1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's all over now.

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Why do you keep telling me?

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Why are you still here?

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You came here for me and Wu Yuting, right?

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's already like this.

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
There's nothing to hide.

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm investigating what happened between you and Wu Yuting.

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Did Gao Qi tell you?

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There are rules in this industry.

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I can't tell you.

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Fei Fei!

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm so good to you.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I treat you like my own child.

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Why do you have to hurt me in this way?

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Mengjie.

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You told me. I can tell you everything.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You told me that I can suffer with you.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You told me that you want to be my sweet little Mia.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Why did you do this?

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Mengjie, I know you're good to me.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I remember it all.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But this is my job.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I came here for you and Wu Yuting.

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I lost my relationship. I can't lose my job again.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Then you hurt my family for your own good, right?

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I don't think it's a harm.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
On the contrary, I think I'm helping you.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
As soon as the report is released,

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Wu Yuting will have to admit you and Hua Youxi.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Then you can get a lot of money.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Isn't that a good thing?

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We don't want this!

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm telling you.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't force your own wishes and reasons on us.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You can hurt me.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You can't hurt my child.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
This is my job.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
If I want to continue in this industry,

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I have to make a comeback.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Well, Feifei.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If you have to keep it,

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I can tell you about me and Ding Yi's father.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You can write it down.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Mengjie, do you think these two letters are comparable?

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,320
One is the hotel's

47
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,000
and the other is the singer.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Which one do you think is more credible?

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
How dare you!

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I won't let you succeed!

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You're too much!

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How did you get the other half of this photo?

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I have my own way.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I want you to be prepared.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I won't keep this from you.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You can tear it up.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I have a backup.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll see it in the next week.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But you have to be careful.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You have to be prepared.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Junhua Youxi.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I think he will thank me for changing his fate.

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hello?

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Is this Wu Yuting's hotel?

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Please find Mr. Wu.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I have something important to discuss with him.

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Hello?

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Hello?

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Ldoor.

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Congratulations!

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
How's life at work?

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The British company named realistic Additionally we actually have so much money.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But the import- Harbor Aye ye.

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The aim of mittlerweile business is

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
is still in the hospital.

76
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,720
But in my opinion,

77
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,720
we can let his son Yingdong

78
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,120
as a legal representative

79
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,120
continue our related matters.

80
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,240
So the key to this matter

81
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,440
is still in Yingdong.

82
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,240
That's right.

83
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Boss, I was looking for you in the office.

84
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,480
Didn't you see I was busy?

85
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,880
Let him wait for any important customers.

86
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,560
I'm a client.

87
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,880
I'm Hua Yishi's mother.

88
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,640
talking to the boss

89
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,060
The new extent.

90
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,840
By the way,

91
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,840
I have to check something for you.

92
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,180
What is it?

93
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,160
Do you have an appointment?

94
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,600
I have with the boss already.

95
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
I've a simple thing.

96
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,000
Where does he go?

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Naturally, he won't go now.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,400
Okay, tell me what happened.

99
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,280
An entertainment reporter found out about me and you.

100
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,320
What's there to find out about me and you?

101
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,880
No, he found out about your relationship with Youxi.

102
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,560
He also said that the next week's weekly card will be published.

103
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
What?

104
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
Impossible.

105
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,960
Where's the evidence? Do you have any evidence?

106
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
Yes, I do.

107
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,240
He has a photo of me and you.

108
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,120
I don't know what other evidence there is.

109
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,760
How could they have the photo of us together?

110
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,680
Yes, I want to ask you the same question.

111
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,720
How did he get your half?

112
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
Enough, enough.

113
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,920
There's no point in discussing it now.

114
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,280
Tell me what you want.

115
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
What?

116
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,840
Anyway, after the news was exposed,

117
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,440
I didn't want to make things worse for both parties.

118
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,240
I didn't want to make them laugh.

119
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,880
Why don't we make a deal first?

120
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
Let's start a fight.

121
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
What did you say?

122
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,680
Anyway, I don't want to make things worse for both parties.

123
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,960
I should have given you a good reason to do so.

124
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,240
I know how to live my life.

125
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,760
I'm not like Gao Qi.

126
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,480
I've never spent money on men.

127
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,840
Now everything is because of Gao Qi.

128
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,800
Then I should make it up to you.

129
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,480
I'll buy the magazine tonight.

130
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,760
I won't let the news get out.

131
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,800
Do you think these young people are easy to deal with?

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,200
They just need to press the keyboard with their fingers and send a message.

133
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,800
The whole Internet will be upside down.

134
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,440
I don't want anything to happen.

135
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,360
I don't want to hurt my son.

136
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,680
Mom, are you going on a trip?

137
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,240
No, it's you.

138
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,520
Me?

139
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,240
Yes.

140
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,800
I'm not going on a trip.

141
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,880
I've already signed up for you at the travel agency.

142
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,120
Korea, Japan, America, Europe.

143
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,320
You can go on a vacation.

144
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,840
That's great.

145
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,120
My mom asked me to go to the agency.

146
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,240
Yes.

147
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,280
When you come back in a month,

148
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,560
everything will be solved.

149
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,480
Solved what?

150
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,920
Don't worry about it.

151
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,160
Just go on a vacation.

152
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,720
I'm about to graduate.

153
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,000
I have a lot of things to do after graduation.

154
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,200
I don't have time to go out and have fun.

155
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
You have to go.

156
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,680
You can't stay at home.

157
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,400
What about Lu Wen?

158
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,840
I'll tell Mr. Lan.

159
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,520
He'll help you.

160
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,200
Why do I feel like I'm not a girl?

161
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,680
Why are you so hasty?

162
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,320
Mom, you've been very upset lately.

163
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,280
Tell me, are you under too much pressure

164
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,520
after you go back to the jewelry shop?

165
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,480
I've told you many times.

166
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,440
Don't worry, I'm about to graduate.

167
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,080
Brother and I will support you.

168
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,200
Don't tell Feifei about your vacation.

169
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Why not?

170
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,240
Don't ask.

171
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,040
I don't understand a lot of things.

172
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,520
You're close to her, aren't you?

173
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,080
Why do you still think she's a girl?

174
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,280
She's a paparazzi.

175
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,880
We were all fooled by her.

176
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,600
She fooled you

177
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,400
to hide your identity and investigate Yingdong.

178
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,800
Anyway, Yingdong has nothing to do with us.

179
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,960
Just forgive her.

180
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,280
How is it not related?

181
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,960
You can't have a heart of a victim.

182
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,680
You can't have a heart of a victim.

183
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,600
You can't be friends with her, do you hear me?

184
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,800
Stay away from her.

185
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,560
What's wrong with you?

186
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,560
You were the one who was good.

187
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,560
Now you're the one who's not good.

188
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,760
You're such a bad person.

189
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,800
Hello.

190
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,880
Ye Feifei, how's the material?

191
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,760
Boss, there's one more thing.

192
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,440
I'll give it to you when I'm done.

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,320
I can't wait.

194
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,520
Give it to me now.

195
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,160
Okay, I'll send it to you right away.

196
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,520
Hello, how are you?

197
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,800
I'm fine, thanks.

198
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,160
I'm glad to see you.

199
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,720
I'll be back soon.

200
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,360
I'll be back soon too.

201
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,400
Thank you.

202
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,720
I'll see you later.

203
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,240
I'll see you later.

204
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,680
Okay, bye.

205
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,800
Bye.

206
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,880
Bye.

207
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
Bye.

208
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,200
Bye.

209
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
Bye.

210
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Bye.

211
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,440
Bye.

212
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
Bye.

213
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Bye.

214
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,680
Bye.

215
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
Bye.

216
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
Bye.

217
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,920
Bye.

218
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Bye.

219
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,080
Bye.

220
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,920
He's writing the news.

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,280
Why are you so nervous?

222
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,240
Don't you want the English company to be in trouble

223
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,640
because of this news?

224
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,800
That's Yingdong's family business.

225
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
I don't care.

226
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,640
Really?

227
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,320
You really don't care?

228
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
The computer is over there.

229
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
You can use it.

230
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,160
I'll go and clean it up.

231
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,960
Hello, what can I do for you?

232
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,120
I'm at the office.

233
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,640
I'm here to see Wei.

234
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
Are you here?

235
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
No, he's not here.

236
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,240
He went out with Ding Yi.

237
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,800
I'll be back soon.

238
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,120
Wait for me inside.

239
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Okay.

240
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,320
Do you need any help?

241
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
No.

242
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,440
Go inside and sit down.

243
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,080
Hi.

244
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
Hi.

245
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
What a coincidence.

246
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,760
Are you here to play games?

247
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,320
No.

248
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,360
I'm here to see Wei.

249
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,040
I want to eat her pizza.

250
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
What are you looking at?

251
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,440
Did you say something to me?

252
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
No.

253
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,360
Do you want to know about me and Youxi?

254
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,680
I'm not interested in you.

255
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,080
I'm not interested in you.

256
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,320
I'm not interested in you.

257
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
I'm not interested in you.

258
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,840
What about you and Youxi?

259
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
Nothing.

260
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,400
Do you mind if Youxi

261
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,600
tells me about me?

262
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
No.

263
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,600
Are you afraid that I'll take Youxi away?

264
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
No.

265
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
No, no.

266
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
Then it's no.

267
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,800
Just kidding. Don't be nervous.

268
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,120
Do you like to play games?

269
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,720
No.

270
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
Don't laugh.

271
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,480
No?

272
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,720
Then you care so much about my ex-girlfriend.

273
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,200
I'm her friend.

274
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,080
It's normal for me to care about her.

275
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
Really?

276
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Of course.

277
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
I'm sorry.

278
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
I'm sorry.

279
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
I'm sorry.

281
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
I'm sorry.

282
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,960
I'm sorry.

283
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,540
I'm sorry.

284
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,960
Actually, you know,

285
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,680
I really wanted to tell you

286
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,120
that Guai Youxi has manyonents.

287
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,040
He's am inte ia,

288
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,160
cruel,

289
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,640
Streamy

290
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,840
and childish.

291
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,840
But he's nice.

292
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
And poor.

293
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,700
He's very good to his friends.

294
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,000
I hope you'll care about him.

295
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,920
Since you've said

296
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Why did you leave him?

297
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
Okay, don't worry.

298
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,320
I don't even consider myself as a friend of Huayou Xi.

299
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,960
Welcome.

300
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,960
Sir, what do you need?

301
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
Nothing, I just want to take a look.

302
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Go ahead.

303
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Okay, take a look.

304
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
Okay.

305
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,960
Captain!

306
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
Damn it!

307
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,960
What's wrong?

308
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,960
My dead opponent is trying to steal my news.

309
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,960
This is very important to me.

310
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,960
There are some information about the Dingdong family.

311
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,960
You must find a safe place to keep me safe.

312
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,960
Okay.

313
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,960
You want to run away? It's not that easy.

314
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,960
Give me the USB.

315
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,960
I don't have the USB. I gave it to someone else.

316
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,960
I gave it to someone else.

317
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Who?

318
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Yifei.

319
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
Say it!

320
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Run!

321
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
Don't run!

322
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
Stop!

323
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
Let go!

324
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Let go!

325
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,960
Let go!

326
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,960
Stop!

327
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,960
Stop!

328
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,960
Wan Jia!

329
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,960
Call an ambulance!

330
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,960
USB.

331
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
Hello?

332
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,960
120?

333
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
Wan Jia!

334
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Wake up!

335
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,960
Wan Jia, how is she?

336
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
The doctor said that she has a head injury.

337
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
She is in a bandage wound.

338
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
What's going on?

339
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,960
Why is Wan Jia injured?

340
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,960
Ask her!

341
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,960
She did all the good things.

342
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,960
What is Yifei doing?

343
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
It's for someone else.

344
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,960
Family's news.

345
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,960
Yifei asked the hospital to investigate it.

346
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,960
It's not Yifei's fault.

347
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,960
Yifei asked the hospital to investigate it.

348
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,960
It's not Yindong's fault.

349
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,960
Wan Jia did it for me.

350
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,960
That's why she is here.

351
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,960
Yes.

352
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,960
Because you are the family's information.

353
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,960
My colleagues are stealing the news from me.

354
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,960
So I gave the USB to Wan Jia.

355
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,960
Wan Jia was hit by a motorcycle to protect her.

356
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,960
I'm sorry.

357
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,960
I didn't mean to do it.

358
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,960
I didn't know it would turn out like this.

359
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,960
What's your plan?

360
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,960
Wan Jia.

361
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
Doctor.

362
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,960
How is she?

363
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
How is she?

364
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,960
The wound on her head is sealed.

365
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
She is basically safe.

366
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,960
We need to observe her for a while.

367
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,960
Let's go.

368
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
31

369
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
No.

370
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,960
A woman is injured because of him.

371
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,960
It's impossible for her to be neutral.

372
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
Don't worry.

373
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
These are not love letters.

374
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,960
These are just thank you letters.

375
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
I know.

376
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,960
I don't mind.

377
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
Really?

378
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
Don't be so understanding, okay?

379
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
It's so annoying.

380
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
It doesn't matter.

381
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
You don't hate me anyway.

382
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,960
It's not a day or two.

383
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,960
I'm just concerned about you.

384
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
I'm afraid you'll be sad.

385
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,960
I'm sorry.

386
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,960
I'm happy to be a student.

387
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,960
But why haven't I graduated yet?

388
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,960
I'm already in the middle of everything.

389
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,960
In this society,

390
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
99% of problems can be solved with money.

391
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,960
This is a cheque of my name.

392
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
You can write whatever you want.

393
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,960
What?

394
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,960
Tell Ye Fei Fei not to hand over the USB drive.

395
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
You don't want to move,

396
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
and the mountain is rising again?

397
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,960
I don't know.

398
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,960
Yes.

399
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,960
99% of problems in the world

400
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,960
can be solved with money.

401
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
But we are that 1%.

402
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
1% of this

403
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,960
is the love and friendship of our class.

404
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
It can't be solved.

405
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,960
What's going on?

406
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Why don't you tell us?

407
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
I don't know.

408
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
I'm afraid you'll be sad.

409
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,960
I'm sorry.

410
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
I'm sorry.

411
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,960
I'm sorry.

412
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
I'm sorry.

413
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,960
I'm sorry.

414
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,960
I'm sorry.

415
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
I'm sorry.

416
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,960
I'm sorry.

417
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,960
I'm sorry.

418
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,960
I'm sorry.

419
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
I'm sorry.

420
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
I'm sorry.

421
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
What's wrong?

422
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
I don't know.

423
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,960
Any problems?

424
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
Nothing.

425
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,960
I can believe it.

426
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
I'm really sorry.

427
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
I'm sorry.

428
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,960
I'm really sorry.

429
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
Why are you saying that?

430
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,360
It's my fault.

431
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,160
You should leave the hospital, or you'll get hurt.

432
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,560
You're so strange.

433
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,720
I want to talk to you.

434
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,080
Okay, go ahead.

435
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,880
I hope you don't investigate our family matter.

436
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,360
I don't care what this news can bring me.

437
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,400
I don't want this news to hurt the people around me.

438
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,240
My dad is in the hospital now.

439
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,720
I want to make Ying Shi recover by myself.

440
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,880
I believe that as long as I work hard, I will succeed.

441
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,400
So thank you for your kindness.

442
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,880
But now I think I don't need you.

443
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,440
Actually, I...

444
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,600
Actually, he's not investigating your family matter.

445
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,360
Mom, what are you talking about?

446
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,800
He's not investigating the Yidong family matter.

447
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,280
What is he investigating?

448
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,320
What is he investigating?

449
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,520
He understands it in his heart.

450
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,240
Because he likes what you did.

451
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,960
He also likes you.

452
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,040
Whyover does he do it?

453
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,640
Of course the right thing to do.

454
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,720
Why not just do it?

455
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,320
We'll be in the properly treated conditions.

456
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,000
It's all possible without frankness.

457
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,800
Hello, suits.

458
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,000
Hello, kids.

459
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,800
Leave this to me.

460
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,160
Village invariable punitive policy exam.

461
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,080
Get in your things quickly.

462
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,000
I'll ask my Fundatory Finance Carmen.

463
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,400
Let go!

464
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
Tell me what the hell is going on.

465
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
Your mom won't lie to me.

466
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,400
You're not even moving.

467
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
Who is she?

468
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
I can't tell you.

469
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
You have to tell me.

470
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
You've already dragged so many people into this.

471
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
Wan Jiaxin is in the hospital because of this.

472
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
It's irresponsible of you to not tell me.

473
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,400
I can't tell you.

474
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,400
Okay, you won't tell me.

475
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,400
If you won't tell me, then give me the money.

476
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
What are you doing?

477
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Give it to me!

478
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
I won't give it to you!

479
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400
What do you mean?

480
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Didn't you just buy the gossip magazine for the money?

481
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,400
When you deceived everyone, I was standing by your side.

482
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
Are you going to lie to me now?

483
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Are we brothers or not?

484
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
We can't be friends from the beginning.

485
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
What did you say?

486
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
We can't be friends at all.

487
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,400
Hello?

488
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
Did you talk to your brother like that?

489
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
Brother?

490
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
I've never treated you as a friend.

491
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
Not to mention brothers.

492
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,400
I've been lying to you from the beginning.

493
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
You!

494
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
You lie.

495
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
What are you doing?

496
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
Don't hit me!

497
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,400
Why are you hitting me?

498
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
What are you doing?

499
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Look at it yourself.

500
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
What is this?

501
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
This is the real purpose of my investigation.

502
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Your family.

503
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Your biological father.

504
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,400
This is my destiny.

505
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,400
I'm warning you.

506
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,400
Don't touch Amber.

507
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Tell me what you've done.

508
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
Tell me, tell me!

509
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Meng, you're back.

510
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
Fei Fei, tell me.

511
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Did you help her change?

512
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Yes, she said I changed.

513
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Didn't they do anything?

514
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
No, they just slept here.

515
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
I've been patting Amber upstairs.

516
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,400
I hope you can take good care of Amber.

517
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,400
I don't want her to be by my daughter's side.

518
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Now, I'm a bad guy.

519
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,400
Do I have the right to speak to you?

520
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
I'm sorry, reporter.

521
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
I don't want to be interviewed.

522
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
Now you interview me.

523
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,400
I can answer whatever you want.

524
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
I'll ask you anything.

525
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,400
I won't say anything.

526
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,400
I've been living in a lie.

527
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,400
If you still want to lie to me,

528
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
don't say anything.

529
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,400
I'll tell you.

530
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,400
You're reading the recording.

531
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,400
I have the recording in my bag.

532
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,400
Do you want to take a look?

533
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,400
I'm sorry.

534
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Does my mother know about this?

535
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,400
She just found out earlier than you.

536
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Did they stop you?

537
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,400
No one can stop me.

538
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,400
But she did look for me.

539
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,400
I'm begging you not to publish this report.

540
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,400
She doesn't want to see you fathering your father.

541
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
She doesn't want you to be a mother.

542
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,400
She doesn't want you to be surrounded by public opinion.

543
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,400
She doesn't want you to be hurt.

544
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Of course I won't agree.

545
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,400
Although there are people interested in the old love,

546
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,400
but the series of the family split is a personal child.

547
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,400
Everyone should be more interested.

548
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,400
If you want to make the series more interesting,

549
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,400
the main character must be you.

550
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,400
I suddenly feel that you're alive.

551
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,400
I'm sorry that you know me now.

552
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,400
I'm sorry that you know me now.

553
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
Really?

554
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,400
I've never heard of it.

555
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,400
What's her reaction?

556
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,400
She and your mother are on the same side.

557
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,400
She doesn't want to recognize you.

558
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,400
She doesn't want you to know about your relationship.

559
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,400
She's afraid that she'll lose the face of Hao Lun.

560
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,400
No wonder she hates me so much.

561
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:43,400
So now you know why she's so nervous about your relationship with Amber?

562
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,400
You'll publish that report, right?

563
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,400
I will.

564
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Even if it hurts my mother,

565
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,400
she'll treat you like her own daughter.

566
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Yes.

567
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Even if it hurts Amber,

568
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,400
she's innocent.

569
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,400
It has nothing to do with her.

570
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Yes.

571
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Even if it hurts you,

572
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
you'll regret it.

573
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,400
I will never regret it.

574
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,400
Why do you always have to look at it so negatively?

575
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,400
Maybe you'll be hurt,

576
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
but you'll also benefit from it.

577
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,400
You see, Mengjie can get back together with her old love,

578
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,400
and you can get back together with your rich father.

579
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,400
Isn't that your dream?

580
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,400
For me, it's a rare opportunity.

581
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,400
It can help me get the position of the chief editor.

582
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,400
I helped you, you helped me.

583
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,400
Why should I regret it?

584
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,400
I'm sorry.

585
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,400
I'm sorry.

586
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Ding Yi,

587
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,400
did you find Ye Fei Fei?

588
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
I don't know.

589
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,400
I can't reach her.

590
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Mei Bao called me.

591
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,400
She said Mengjie went back first.

592
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,400
Wenxian, you're awake.

593
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,400
Does your wound still hurt?

594
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,400
I'm glad you're awake.

595
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,400
Everyone is worried about you.

596
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,400
You're finally awake.

597
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,400
Would you like some water?

598
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,400
I want to sit up.

599
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,400
Wait a minute.

600
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
Why are you all here?

601
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
Everyone heard that you were in trouble,

602
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
so they all rushed here.

603
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
They're afraid you'll be in trouble.

604
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
If it weren't for Ye Fei Fei,

605
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
you wouldn't be in this state.

606
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,400
But Fei Fei said that the files in the USB drive

607
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,400
are very important to Yingdong.

608
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,400
I didn't expect him to be so fierce.

609
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,400
Promise me.

610
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,400
Don't do such silly things again.

611
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
Nothing is more important than yourself.

612
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,400
If you really have something to do,

613
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,400
we'll regret it forever.

614
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,400
If you have something to do because of me,

615
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,400
I'll regret it forever.

616
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
Okay, okay.

617
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Good luck.

618
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,400
Jia Jia just woke up.

619
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,400
Let her say a few words.

620
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,400
We have enough people here.

621
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
I'll do it.

622
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,400
If you want to stay, I'll stay.

623
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,400
Let's go.

624
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,400
Let's go.

625
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
Promise me.

626
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,400
Don't take any more risks.

627
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,400
Okay, I know.

628
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
Because I know

629
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,400
that even if I'm in danger,

630
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,400
you'll protect me from the sky.

631
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
You don't know that

632
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Ding Yi and Yingdong have heard about your accident.

633
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,400
One of them wanted to learn from you.

634
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,400
The other one wanted to take you to America.

635
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,400
I think they can even give up their lives for you.

636
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,400
You're exaggerating.

637
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,400
If it were you,

638
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,400
they would do the same.

639
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,400
You know how they feel about you.

640
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,400
If Ding Yi and Yingdong

641
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
confess to you,

642
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
who will you choose?

643
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
I...

644
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,400
I'll choose you.

645
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,400
My little princess.

646
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,400
We'll always be best friends

647
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,400
no matter who you're with.

648
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Now,

649
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,400
answer me.

650
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Who is the most important person

651
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,400
between you and Yingdong?

652
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,400
Don't ask me anymore.

653
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,400
You asked me this question a thousand times.

654
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,400
In my heart,

655
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,400
you're the best friend.

656
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,400
That's the most important thing.

657
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,400
It's different.

658
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,400
It is.

659
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,400
I've made up my mind.

660
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,400
No matter who I'm with,

661
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,400
I want to see you happy first.

662
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,400
I want to see you have a boyfriend first.

663
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
Then I'll have a boyfriend.

664
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
You'll get married first.

665
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Then I'll get married.

666
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,400
You have to find the one

667
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,400
who can be with you forever.

668
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,400
Then I'll find him.

669
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,400
What if he never appears?

670
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,400
Then...

671
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,400
I'll just stay with you forever.

672
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,400
You'll regret it.

673
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
You won't regret it.

674
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Why would I?

675
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
Silly girl.

676
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,400
I still have my brother with me.

677
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Don't blame me.

678
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,400
Go after your own happiness.

679
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,400
Your brother...

680
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,400
He's born to be a man of his own.

681
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,400
He's not a man who can stay with you forever.

682
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,400
One day, he'll want to go to the world.

683
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,400
He'll want to take care of you.

684
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,400
Meng, why are we here?

685
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,400
Mei Bao, I have something to tell you.

686
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
I have to tell him right now.

687
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
Who?

688
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,400
No matter what happens today,

689
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
you can't tell anyone.

690
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
Especially not my son.

691
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
What will happen?

692
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Tell me.

693
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,400
I know you're good to Youxi.

694
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
You won't hurt her.

695
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,400
No.

696
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Hello, madam. Who are you looking for?

697
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
I'm looking for Mr. Wu.

698
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,400
Do you have an appointment?

699
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,400
I don't.

700
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Madam, two ladies broke into the house.

701
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,400
I think it's about 20%.

702
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Mr. Wu.

703
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
Madam, sorry.

704
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,400
That's all for today.

705
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,400
You can go back.

706
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,400
Please don't always rush into my work.

707
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,400
Who is she?

708
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,400
She's Youxi's girlfriend.

709
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,400
Hello.

710
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,400
If you use any illegal means to deal with me,

711
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,400
at least she can prove it.

712
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,400
I'll use any illegal means to deal with you.

713
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,400
Just tell me what's going on.

714
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
I don't have much time to give you.

715
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
Why do you have to do this to Fei Fei?

716
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Why do you want to hurt Wan Jia?

717
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,400
Do you think using this despicable and shameless means

718
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,400
can hide the past of those who despise you?

719
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Why can't you change your bad temper?

720
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,400
I'm not a bad person.

721
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,400
I don't know what happened.

722
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,400
You don't know what happened?

723
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Why did you ask someone to steal Fei Fei's USB drive?

724
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,400
You made Wan Jia stay in the hospital.

725
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,400
Who are you?

726
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
How could this happen?

727
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,400
Who did this?

728
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
Don't talk about the thief.

729
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
I'm warning you.

730
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,400
If you do this again, I won't let you off.

731
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,400
I always thought you knew me.

732
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
But I didn't expect

733
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,400
you to think of me as that kind of person again and again.

734
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
That's right.

735
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,400
I don't want the reports to be exposed.

736
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,400
I will use my method to solve this matter.

737
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,400
But I will never spend money to buy violence.

738
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,400
I thought I knew you well.

739
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,400
But who will change?

740
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,400
But one thing will not change.

741
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,400
That is what I have done.

742
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,400
I will accept it.

743
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,400
Okay.

744
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,400
I want to ask you.

745
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,400
Hua Youxi is your son.

746
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,400
Why don't you accept it?

747
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,400
You are blaming me for not accepting my son.

748
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,400
We had a deal to take the child away.

749
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,400
But you hid it from me and secretly gave birth to it.

750
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,400
How do you want me to accept it?

751
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Do you think I have a good plan?

752
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,400
Do you think I want to use my son to divide your family?

753
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,400
Do you know how it feels to be a mother?

754
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
The child is my life.

755
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,400
Can I kill it?

756
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,400
I will say it again.

757
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,400
I didn't use the method of the steps to get the right card.

758
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,400
Since you want to tear your face today,

759
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,400
Okay.

760
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,400
Then wait until the report is exposed.

761
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
At that time,

762
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,400
All the truth will be revealed.

763
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,400
That's the trouble.

764
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,400
I will take it.

765
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,400
This is the real purpose of my investigation.

766
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,400
Your real identity.

767
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,400
Your real father.

768
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,400
Is my father.

769
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,400
I have been hurt.

770
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,400
I have been hurt.

771
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,400
I have a grudge.

772
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:08,400
I must have you to cry with me.

773
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,400
Let's shout together.

774
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,400
Let's hug together.

775
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:21,400
Let's stay together on the street of the drunk.

776
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,400
We will go to the end.

777
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,400
No need for any reason.

778
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,400
We have been through too much together.

779
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,400
That is our biggest.

780
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,400
We will go to the end.

781
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,400
We will go to the end.

782
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,400
At the time when we need it most.

783
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,400
We will go to the end.

784
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:54,400
At the time when we need it most.

785
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:00,400
Let's stay together forever.
