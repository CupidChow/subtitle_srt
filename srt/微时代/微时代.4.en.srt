1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

6
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Uncle

7
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Uncle

8
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'll take you to the villa for a visit

9
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay

10
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'll take you to the basketball court of the school

11
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You should be very interested

12
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You

13
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You

14
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll tell you

15
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Uncle, do you want to play basketball together?

16
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes

17
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Only one person left to play the game

18
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I don't have clothes

19
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Uncle, don't you dare?

20
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What are you talking about?

21
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Come on, come on

22
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Uncle, come on, go

23
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Come on, come on

24
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Come on, come on

25
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Come on, come on

26
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Come on, come on

27
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Come on, come on

28
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Come on, come on

29
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Come on, come on

30
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Come on, come on, come on

31
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Come on, come on

32
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Come on, come on

33
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Come on, come on

34
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Come on, come on

35
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Who is this?

36
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That one, that one, that one

37
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That's the uncle who is going to marry Hua Yuexi

38
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
How do you know?

39
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't know either

40
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Hua Yuexi is my boyfriend

41
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes, he came to Shanghai to find a girl he likes

42
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You are so handsome

43
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You are so good at playing basketball

44
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You are just like a passer-by

45
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I didn't see you

46
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Is that your taste?

47
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's a pity

48
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
A salary of one month for a shopkeeper

49
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
How many life jackets can you buy?

50
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Just look at it

51
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Come on, come on

52
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Come on, come on

53
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Come on, come on

54
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Come on, come on

55
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Come on, come on

56
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Come on

57
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Come on, come on

58
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Come on, come on

59
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Come on, come on

60
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Come on, come on

61
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Uncle, he is leaving

62
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What's wrong?

63
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Uncle

64
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Uncle

65
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Come on, Xiaojiu!

66
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Come on, Xiaojiu!

67
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Come on, Xiaojiu!

68
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Come on, Xiaojiu!

69
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
How can I let Xiaojiu take it away?

70
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
She's the new girl I love.

71
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Come on, Xiaojiu!

72
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Come on, Xiaojiu!

73
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Come on, Xiaojiu!

74
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Come on, Xiaojiu!

75
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Come on, Xiaojiu!

76
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Come on, Xiaojiu!

77
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Come on, Xiaojiu!

78
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Jiu Yi!

79
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What do you think?

80
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Do you like it?

81
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
When did you become a male director?

82
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I met a male director by chance.

83
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
When Zhu Chang chose the right one.

84
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
How will the picture be taken?

85
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Next time, I'll watch you perform.

86
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No.

87
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Jiu Yi, come here.

88
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,320
How many did you get?

89
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
One.

90
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
I got one.

91
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,320
Yiping, your brother needs a towel.

92
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,320
Okay.

93
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Thank you.

94
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,320
You're quite special.

95
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,320
Don't you remember?

96
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,320
I'm the limit.

97
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
Hua Youxi.

98
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,640
What were you thinking?

99
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,640
How could you put the matter of Xiaojiu and Ding Xiaorou

100
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,640
on the internet without the consent of the person?

101
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,640
What were you thinking?

102
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,640
No wonder all the girls are like flowers today.

103
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,640
They keep fighting with the outsiders.

104
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,640
You're the one who's to blame.

105
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,640
Mr. Tang, I'm just using the simplest way

106
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
to help my uncle find a new lover.

107
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
You're just playing around.

108
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
What are you waiting for?

109
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
No.

110
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,960
He's just doing it for the good of the world.

111
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,360
Uncle Kang understands me.

112
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,360
All of you misunderstand me.

113
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,960
If I were Ding Xiaorou,

114
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,960
I would be so embarrassed if so many girls like my boyfriend.

115
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Look.

116
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
It's so popular on the internet.

117
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,960
There are many girls.

118
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Mom, you have to see if Ding Xiaorou has replied.

119
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,960
That's too many.

120
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Look, Xiaojiu.

121
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,960
What a famous girl, Ding Xiaorou.

122
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,960
The one who misses you every moment.

123
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
This is the most disgusting.

124
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,960
The one who can't forget her affectionate night.

125
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
It's not her.

126
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,960
She won't tell the truth.

127
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,960
Xiaojiu, don't be disappointed.

128
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,960
I posted the post on Weibo this morning.

129
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,960
Maybe she hasn't had time to read it this morning.

130
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,960
She should have searched it in three days.

131
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
Your method is too illogical.

132
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,360
I'll call Mr. Liao.

133
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,360
I'll search it on the school's list.

134
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,960
I agree.

135
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
What do you mean?

136
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
You didn't date and you didn't vote.

137
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,960
All right.

138
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
I know you're worried about me.

139
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
But who's wronged?

140
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,960
If there's a reason, we'll find it out.

141
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Let's go.

142
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,960
You're not happy, are you?

143
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,960
She's just pretending.

144
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,960
Actually, she cares about her feelings.

145
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,960
She came to Shanghai just to find her.

146
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,960
Now she knows that she's in love with someone.

147
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
She must be very worried.

148
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
She's very worried.

149
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,960
Don't talk about Xiaojiu.

150
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,960
I'm telling you.

151
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Go and check on Xiaorou.

152
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Report to me in the afternoon.

153
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Report to me in the afternoon.

154
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Be careful.

155
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,960
Be careful.

156
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
Are you all right?

157
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
I'm fine.

158
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
I don't know what happened to the brakes.

159
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,960
Let me check.

160
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,960
Let me check.

161
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
You should be fine.

162
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Thank you.

163
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,960
You're welcome.

164
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
You're welcome.

165
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,960
You're welcome.

166
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,960
You're welcome.

167
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Take it if you like it.

168
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,960
Is this a gift for me?

169
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,960
You can take it or not.

170
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
I don't want it.

171
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
Why?

172
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,960
You don't like it?

173
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,960
I've never received a flower before.

174
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,960
Is this the first time or not?

175
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,960
I don't know.

176
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,960
Well...

177
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
If you don't want it...

178
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,960
Forget it.

179
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,960
I'm leaving.

180
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,960
So soon?

181
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,960
I'm leaving.

182
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,960
I'm going to Shanghai.

183
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,960
I'm hungry.

184
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,960
I'm going to Shanghai to study.

185
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Congratulations.

186
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,960
Have you ever heard of Wuhan University?

187
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,960
No.

188
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,960
But it must be a good university.

189
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,960
I've been learning painting for so many years.

190
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,960
I wanted to get into the art department there.

191
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,960
Now I can finally realize my dream.

192
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,960
That's great.

193
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Have you ever been to Shanghai?

194
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,960
No.

195
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,960
I've never been there.

196
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,960
I've never been there.

197
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,960
Will you go there?

198
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
I'll go.

199
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,960
I have nothing to do.

200
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,960
You can be a chef.

201
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,960
No.

202
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,960
Shanghai is a high-class place.

203
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,960
How can I go there?

204
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Why not?

205
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,960
How can it not be possible?

206
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
For young people, there's nothing impossible.

207
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,960
I think you can walk out of the kitchen

208
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,960
and be a chef who is face to face with the guests.

209
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,960
Then you can see

210
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,960
the feelings of the guests when they eat your food.

211
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,960
You can communicate with them.

212
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,960
The more you do, the better.

213
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,960
Really?

214
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,960
You look so handsome in the chef's uniform.

215
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,960
It's a pity that you can't be seen by others.

216
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,960
Are you kidding me?

217
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,960
I'm serious.

218
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,960
I'm really serious.

219
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,960
I'm serious.

220
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,960
Beautiful flowers.

221
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Hey, let's go.

222
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,960
Mom, are you really going to stay up all night?

223
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,960
No matter how big the problem was,

224
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,960
you and dad never had a break.

225
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,960
My future son-in-law is going to eat at the restaurant.

226
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,960
Yingdong is a rich young man.

227
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,960
He must be eating at some high-class restaurants.

228
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,960
I'm afraid he's not used to the crowd.

229
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
You bought this new dress, right?

230
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
I bought it especially for Yingdong.

231
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,960
Did you buy it for Yingdong?

232
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
He has a lot of fashion brands.

233
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
He took me to one of the shops.

234
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
It's free.

235
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,960
You're so generous.

236
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
You're so kind.

237
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
Mom, what are you talking about?

238
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,960
I'm always close to you and dad.

239
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
Look at this.

240
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
How is this flower?

241
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,960
I bought it from the flower market this morning.

242
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,960
Jiajia's boyfriend is coming.

243
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,960
I want him to leave a good impression on us.

244
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,960
Look at your dad.

245
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
He's been raising his daughter for more than 20 years.

246
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
I hope you can be happy.

247
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,960
Find someone who really understands you and loves you.

248
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,960
After all, we are parents.

249
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,960
We have our parents.

250
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,960
I'm relieved that he can take care of you on behalf of us.

251
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,960
What are you talking about?

252
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,960
It sounds like you're married.

253
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,960
Jiajia,

254
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,960
Actually,

255
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Mom and Dad don't want you to be filial to us.

256
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,960
We just hope he can love you with all his heart.

257
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,960
We just hope he can love you and not bully you.

258
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960
Yingdong won't bully me.

259
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,960
That's good.

260
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
What time is it?

261
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
Can't you find him?

262
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,960
Call him quickly.

263
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,960
I'll be right there.

264
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
It's so late.

265
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
You should have called me if you didn't want to come.

266
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
He must have been delayed on the way.

267
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,960
You're late when you first met your parents.

268
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,960
I think he doesn't care about you at all.

269
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
It's okay.

270
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,960
It must be because he's too busy with work.

271
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,960
Mom and Dad can understand.

272
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,960
Let's wait a little longer.

273
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
I'm sorry.

274
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,960
Wanjia, did I bother you?

275
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
Yingdong, you're here.

276
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,960
Come in and sit.

277
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,960
We've been waiting for an hour.

278
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,960
Xiaoqiu, you're here just in time.

279
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
Help me with the opera.

280
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
Pretend to be my boyfriend.

281
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Hurry up.

282
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,960
Please.

283
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
Hurry up.

284
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
I'll go get some water.

285
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
Uncle, auntie, I'm sorry.

286
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
I just got in the car.

287
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
It's okay.

288
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
I'll go get you some food.

289
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
I'll help you.

290
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
How can that be?

291
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,960
It's okay to let a woman come in the kitchen.

292
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,960
You can sit here and wait for the food to be served.

293
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
It's okay.

294
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
Let's sit together.

295
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,960
Come on.

296
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
I'm so embarrassed.

297
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,960
Xiaojia, come here.

298
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,960
I didn't expect Yingdong to be so sensible.

299
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:40,460
He's not like the second-generation

300
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,460
I don't know if it suits your taste.

301
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,460
It's okay.

302
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,460
My family has always liked to keep things in their stomachs

303
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,460
and not say anything.

304
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,460
They're always happy.

305
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,460
Now that you're here,

306
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,460
we can rest assured.

307
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,460
If there's anything that my family doesn't say,

308
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,460
you can come to us directly.

309
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,460
We're a family now.

310
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,460
Right.

311
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,460
Actually,

312
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,460
there's something I can't say.

313
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,460
Just say it.

314
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,460
I'm not Yingdong.

315
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,460
Then who are you?

316
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,460
My name is Hua Shanmao.

317
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,460
I'm Meng Jun's brother.

318
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,460
I came to see you today

319
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,460
because I saw the magazine's report.

320
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,460
I didn't expect to meet you.

321
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,460
I'm so happy to see you.

322
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,460
I didn't expect to meet Wanjia.

323
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,460
Jiajia, what's going on?

324
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,460
I don't think Jiajia did it on purpose.

325
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,460
I'm sorry. I won't lie.

326
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,460
You didn't do anything wrong, Xiaojia.

327
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,460
You can't always replace Yingdong.

328
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,460
You'll be exposed one day.

329
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,460
Did he tell you the reason?

330
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,460
He hasn't answered his phone.

331
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,460
He set the date today.

332
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,460
He said he would come.

333
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,460
Xiaojia,

334
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,460
can you tell me why he did it?

335
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,460
Maybe he was trying to escape.

336
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,460
Men are afraid of

337
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,460
having a relationship.

338
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,460
Why didn't you ask him?

339
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,460
I don't dare.

340
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,460
I'm afraid

341
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,460
he might say something about my relationship with him.

342
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,460
Then it's over.

343
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,460
It's hard to be in love.

344
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,460
Sometimes,

345
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,460
you should be careful to maintain a relationship.

346
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,460
You should be honest.

347
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,460
You should be careful to maintain a relationship.

348
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,460
Don't worry about others.

349
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,460
Xiaojia,

350
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,460
have you ever thought about it?

351
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,460
Maybe Ding Xiaorou is trying to escape from you.

352
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,460
He knows you're looking for him, but he won't show up.

353
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,460
Will you give up waiting for him?

354
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,460
I'm a positive person.

355
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,460
Thank you.

356
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,460
The works crummy must still be in the store.

357
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,460
It's now or never?

358
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,860
I didn't go.

359
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,540
Why?

360
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,820
Jiajia is in a bad mood.

361
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,980
She went to the movies with her.

362
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,980
But she still can't smile.

363
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,700
How could she break up with Yingdong?

364
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,020
Who said I was going to break up?

365
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,260
I'm sorry.

366
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,060
I've spread my bad mood to you.

367
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,540
I'm not angry because of this.

368
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,700
Can you be a little bit more positive?

369
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,020
Yingdong doesn't even want to see her parents.

370
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,380
Why are you with her?

371
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,380
I'm sorry.

372
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,500
Wait.

373
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,060
I'll call Yingdong right now

374
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,260
and scold him for you.

375
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,540
It's okay.

376
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,460
Hello?

377
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,140
Little Yingdong.

378
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,980
Wei Wei.

379
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,700
Wei Wei.

380
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,100
I'm Wei Wei.

381
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,060
What do you mean?

382
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,620
Why don't you go to see your parents?

383
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,100
I'm telling you.

384
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,260
We're going to graduate soon.

385
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,220
After we graduate,

386
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,420
everyone will be able to be a handsome man

387
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,780
like Bai Fumei.

388
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,180
Don't regret it when that happens.

389
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,380
You don't have to explain it to me.

390
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,660
Wan Nian, let me...

391
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,900
Let me break up with you right now.

392
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,300
Right now.

393
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,980
No, no, no.

394
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,980
Kang Wei Wei.

395
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,860
You're good.

396
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,180
You're even playing with me, right?

397
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,140
Mr. He.

398
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,500
Just let her go.

399
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,460
Ding Yi.

400
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,140
You betrayed me.

401
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,500
She wants to marry you.

402
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,500
I didn't even go to the cooking class.

403
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,380
I just spent the first day with you.

404
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,220
You have no conscience.

405
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,140
Enough, enough.

406
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,460
Let's go eat.

407
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,780
Are you asking me to cook for you again?

408
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,940
Of course not.

409
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,340
I'm taking a class.

410
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,540
Wan Nian wants to try Xiao Qiu's cooking.

411
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,500
Let's go now.

412
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,460
Now?

413
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,900
It's almost 12 o'clock.

414
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,380
It must be closed.

415
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,420
That's right.

416
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,380
Xiao Qiu didn't go to work today.

417
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,260
As long as you believe,

418
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,820
everything is possible.

419
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,820
I can't let you be unhappy for another day.

420
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,060
Let's go.

421
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,060
Let's go.

422
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,620
Let's go.

423
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,620
Let's go.

424
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,620
Let's go.

425
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,620
Let's go.

426
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,100
Ding Yi.

427
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,820
Why did you bring us here so late?

428
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,300
You'll know soon enough.

429
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,020
Welcome.

430
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,020
Thank you.

431
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,340
You're still working at this hour?

432
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,100
Why are you like this?

433
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,700
Don't stand there. Come in.

434
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,060
I have news.

435
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,100
You wrote this night's performance.

436
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,780
For me?

437
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,900
Why, Xiao Qiu?

438
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,060
Because I want you to be happy.

439
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,220
I'm so happy.

440
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,780
Have a good wedding.

441
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,980
Don't be mad at me, okay?

442
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,900
I really didn't want to forget you.

443
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,460
I had a meeting this afternoon.

444
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,460
But my phone was in the car.

445
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,460
So I didn't have time to inform you.

446
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,340
I knew you were doing this for work.

447
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,220
You asked Ding Yi to let me come here.

448
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,220
I'm not afraid that you'll be angry and won't come.

449
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,620
I haven't eaten yet.

450
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,020
Let's eat together, okay?

451
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,660
Come on in.

452
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,380
I'll go set up.

453
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,380
I'm leaving.

454
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,380
Did you discuss this with Ying Dong?

455
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,420
You just arrived at the flower shop.

456
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,420
He sent me a note.

457
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,020
Romance is a game played by rich people.

458
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,500
Do you think this is love?

459
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,100
Isn't it good to be happy?

460
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,260
I think I'm a little hungry.

461
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,380
I'll cook you a meal.

462
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,500
Can I have a meal with you?

463
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,500
No problem.

464
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,100
You asked Xiao Jiu to kick me?

465
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,540
How is that possible?

466
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,820
I told you I was in a hurry.

467
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,020
I just ran into Xiao Jiu.

468
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,460
That's why I used this method.

469
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,540
Besides, Xiao Jiu denied it.

470
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,740
It's okay.

471
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,460
Who told me not to be handsome?

472
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,700
Next time I want to see your parents,

473
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,220
I'm afraid they won't recognize me.

474
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,940
No way.

475
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,940
As long as you're willing to believe them,

476
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,140
you're more handsome than anyone else.

477
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,860
Look at Xiao Jiu in this dress.

478
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,940
So handsome.

479
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,140
No wonder the girls on the school website

480
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,140
are all fascinated by him.

481
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,300
Yes.

482
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,220
Many girls in our school like him.

483
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,460
They say Xiao Jiu looks like a star.

484
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,460
I could tell when I played basketball that day.

485
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,820
Okay.

486
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,020
The dishes are ready.

487
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,620
Okay.

488
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,460
Thank you, Xiao Jiu.

489
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,460
Xiao Jiu, you're so good at cooking.

490
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,300
You're better than all the flavors I've eaten before.

491
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,860
Have you ever thought of changing your work environment

492
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,620
to seek a bigger development space?

493
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,300
I think this is pretty good.

494
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,300
It's comfortable.

495
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,460
I'll be honest with you.

496
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,420
If you continue working here,

497
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,620
you'll always be a second-rate chef.

498
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,340
I'm very close to the owner of this restaurant.

499
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,140
I can help you build it

500
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:36,140
and make you a fashion star.

501
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,620
You'll be a star in the fashion and the catering industry.

502
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,420
You'll gain a lot of fame.

503
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,180
Xiao Jiu, think about it.

504
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,700
Yin Dong has a sharp eye in business.

505
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,780
So? Are you interested?

506
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,460
A thousand miles of horseback is necessary for a man to enjoy.

507
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,460
Trust me.

508
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,980
I know.

509
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,260
I hope the guests are not my name

510
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,460
because I cooked them.

511
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,780
I'm satisfied with your food.

512
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,780
I'm happy with it.

513
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,820
So...

514
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,540
I don't need it anymore.

515
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:06,980
Okay.

516
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,740
Xiao Jiu is so good at cooking.

517
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,020
It's okay if you don't like it.

518
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,220
I'm just a suggestion.

519
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,460
I know.

520
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,380
Thank you.

521
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,740
Thank you for looking up to me.

522
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,740
Okay.

523
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,860
Take your time.

524
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,700
Okay.

525
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,300
Do you like this?

526
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,100
Are you giving me flowers?

527
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,140
Yes.

528
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,740
But you can also not.

529
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,460
This is my first time to receive flowers.

530
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,820
You can't count them.

531
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,620
I can't count them.

532
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,020
Then I won't.

533
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,900
Forget it.

534
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,380
Don't waste your time.

535
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,820
It's a bunch of flowers.

536
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,460
Come on, handsome.

537
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,220
Look here.

538
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,620
Okay.

539
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,100
Just like this.

540
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,060
La judge.

541
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,580
The other way is right here.

542
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,580
Okay.

543
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,300
That's it.

544
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,580
That's great.

545
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,460
Come on, handsome.

546
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,060
Look here.

547
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,060
It's a pity that you don't become a celebrity.

548
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,180
You're a good boy.

549
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,660
The beauty of the kitchen.

550
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,940
This is great.

551
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,060
It's great.

552
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,260
Thank you so much.

553
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,340
You're welcome.

554
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,420
I just don't like to hide talents.

555
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,900
It's great that Samo is almost done.

556
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,580
Do you want him to come and say hello?

557
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,660
No.

558
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,220
He doesn't like me.

559
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,700
You're so generous.

560
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,740
I just want to prove that my point is right.

561
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,580
I'll get this picture on different websites.

562
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,620
When this chef becomes famous,

563
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,780
you can change the list of new talents.

564
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,340
Okay.

565
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,700
Look at my brother. He's so handsome.

566
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,340
He's been on the magazine cover for interviews.

567
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,740
The beauty of the kitchen?

568
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,540
You've already told me that a dozen times.

569
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,020
You have such an excellent brother.

570
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,260
Can't I be more proud of him?

571
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,300
You can be proud, but there's a gap.

572
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,500
Come and take a look.

573
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,540
I'm sorry.

574
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,460
My brother was so excited when he saw me.

575
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,100
Let me tell you.

576
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,980
My brother is very, very good.

577
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,700
He's very good in every aspect.

578
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,220
In this big Shanghai,

579
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,380
you can't find a few people like my brother.

580
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,580
I think it's pretty good.

581
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:07,820
Sister.

582
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,900
Come.

583
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,780
Hurry up.

584
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,300
Sit down.

585
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,900
This is my brother. This is Sisi.

586
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,060
He's two years younger than you when he works in the bank.

587
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,180
Hello.

588
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,260
Hello.

589
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,860
Why didn't you tell me about this?

590
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,260
I said I'd come here to eat.

591
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,620
You didn't tell me about this.

592
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,220
Your sister is also a good person.

593
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:50,820
That's right.

594
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,020
She's been single for so long, so...

595
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,660
Miss.

596
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,740
I'm sorry.

597
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,180
I really didn't know that today was our blind date.

598
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,900
I didn't want to waste your time.

599
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,180
I'm not suitable for you.

600
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,300
I hope you can find your happiness soon.

601
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,140
I'm sorry.

602
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,300
If I had known, I wouldn't have come.

603
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,780
Sisi, wait a minute.

604
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,940
Stop chasing.

605
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,260
How could you do this?

606
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,140
You abandoned a good girl like that.

607
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,260
You're so ridiculous.

608
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,860
The thing is, if you reject a woman in public,

609
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,500
she'll be very sad.

610
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,780
I don't want to be left out.

611
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,100
I'm telling you.

612
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,700
The school didn't even name Ding Xiaorou after the investigation.

613
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,340
Maybe even the name is fake.

614
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,380
I'm telling you.

615
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,660
You have to fall in love once before you forget your past love.

616
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,660
Do you know that when I was young,

617
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,060
I did this kind of thing a lot?

618
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,140
The men who chased me,

619
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,460
the cards I gave them,

620
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,900
they were all fake.

621
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,020
Wake up!

622
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,100
She's not like you.

623
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,100
What's different?

624
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,100
She's not the kind of girl you think she is.

625
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,500
Okay, okay.

626
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,100
I'm going back to work.

627
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,180
I...

628
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,180
I know.

629
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,380
Okay?

630
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,780
I'm leaving.

631
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,420
Bye.

632
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,820
He's so annoying.

633
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,780
He's so angry that he's making me angry.

634
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,940
And I'm the one who's not angry anymore.

635
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,940
I'm going back to work.

636
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,660
I'm going back to work.

637
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,660
I'll call you later.

638
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,660
Okay.

639
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,860
Okay.

640
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,900
Okay?

641
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,300
Okay.

642
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,580
Bye.

643
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,580
Bye.

644
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,580
Bye.

645
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,580
Bye.

646
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,580
Bye.

647
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,580
Bye.

648
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,580
Bye.

649
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,580
Bye.

650
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,580
Bye.

651
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,580
Bye.

652
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,580
Bye.

653
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,580
Bye.

654
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,580
Bye.

655
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,580
Bye.

656
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,580
Bye.

657
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,580
Bye.

658
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,580
Hi.

659
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,580
You are?

660
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:17,580
Can I ask you to give me something?

661
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,580

Can I ask you to give me something?

667
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,580
Yes, you can.

668
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,580

Yes, you can.

674
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,580

Yes, you can.

681
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,580
Yes, you can.

682
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,580

Can I ask you to give me something?

691
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,580
Yes, you can.

692
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,580
Can I ask you to give me something?

693
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,580
Yes, you can.

694
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,580
Can I ask you to give me something?

695
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,580

696
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,580
Can I ask you to give me something?

697
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,580
Yes, you can.

698
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,580
Can I ask you to give me something?

699
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,580
Yes, you can.

700
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,580
Can I ask you to give me something?

701
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,580
Yes, you can.

702
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,580
Can I ask you to give me something?

703
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,580
Yes, you can.

704
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,580
Can I ask you to give me something?

705
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,580
Yes, you can.

706
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,580
Can I ask you to give me something?

707
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,580
Yes, you can.

708
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,580
Can I ask you to give me something?

709
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,580
Yes, you can.

710
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,580
Can I ask you to give me something?

711
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,580
Yes, you can.

712
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,580
Look, he's just a handsome guy.

713
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,580
He's more handsome than the magazine.

714
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,580
Yes, he's really handsome.

715
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,580
If Dingding has a handsome guy like him

716
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,580
who can cook for me,

717
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,580
I'll be worth it in this life.

718
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,580
Eat up.

719
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,580
Xiao Xiao.

720
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,580
You don't like any of these?

721
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,580
What kind of girl do you like?

722
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,580
Look at my watch.

723
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,580
It's a little girl.

724
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,580
You have a name for yourself.

725
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,580
That's what you call a beautiful life.

726
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,580
I know.

727
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,580
You want me to read a book.

728
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,580
I'm not helping you introduce your girlfriend.

729
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,580
Are you annoying?

730
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,580
Are you a normal guy?

731
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,580
Xiao Jiu.

732
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:54,580
This time, I have to stand on the right side of the game.

733
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,580
And I've checked it out.

734
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,580
There's no one like Ding Xiaorou.

735
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,580
I don't believe it.

736
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:04,580
I can't find anyone with the ability to play games.

737
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,580
The only explanation is that

738
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,580
she's your fantasy.

739
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,580
You've been in love with a fantasy person.

740
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,580
You're just a delusion.

741
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,580
Why are you talking to Xiao Jiu?

742
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,580
What's wrong?

743
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,580
Xiao Jiu has her own secret.

744
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,580
There's no Ding Xiaorou.

745
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,580
Let's talk about it later.

746
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,580
Okay.

747
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,580
I'm tired.

748
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,580
I'm going to sleep.

749
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,580
I'm really doing this for you.

750
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,580
I've been looking for you for so many days.

751
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,580
You said you didn't have any.

752
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,580
Xiao Jiu, I know you're all being bullied by me.

753
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,580
I know.

754
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,580
I know.

755
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,580
I'm not going to let you go.

756
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,580
I'm not going to let you go.

757
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,580
You've been bullying me for 500 years.

758
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,580
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

759
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:05,580
I'm looking forward to the best for you.

760
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,580
I will have a good ending.

761
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,580
When you need me the most,

762
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:17,580
I can be your guardian angel in heaven.

When you need me the most, you can always accept me

777

In our times, together

Thanks for watching!
