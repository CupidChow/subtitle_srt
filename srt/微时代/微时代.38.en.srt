1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

5
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,240
Don't you be a

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,440
Thank you, let's take a picture, okay? Okay

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I

8
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,360
Congratulations, two sons finally graduated from college

9
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,040
Thank you

10
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,160
I have a ring that I just picked up

11
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
Not me

12
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
It must be you

13
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,160
Because only you

14
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
Deserve

15
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,160
You

16
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,160
Wait a minute, don't graduate in a hurry

17
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,160
I promised to tell you the story of Luo Yi

18
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
I haven't finished yet

19
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,160
Let's go back to half a year ago

20
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Shanghai is so beautiful

21
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,160
There are a few rooms downstairs that have just been delivered

22
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,160
I'll send it to you later

23
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,160
Then I won't bother you

24
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,160
What a big bunch of flowers

25
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,160
Which fan sent this

26
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,160
So good at making girls happy

27
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,160
I didn't ask you to come to the flowers

28
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,160
I have something to ask you

29
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,160
Why did you ask us when I went to the airport

30
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
You deliberately guided them

31
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,160
Make people think we are real

32
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,160
How do you know that after this ad is over

33
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,160
You won't be with me

34
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,160
Director, you are too confident

35
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Since the last time we finished work

36
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
After the ad

37
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,160
I put your name on my hand

38
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,160
You didn't object

39
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,160
This means

40
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,160
Director

41
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,160
I won't be in love with people in the work area

42
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
Do you understand

43
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,160
why

44
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,160
There is no why

45
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
Unless you have someone in your heart

46
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,160
But this time to Shanghai

47
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,160
You are really restless

48
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
Hello

49
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,160
Hello, it's me

50
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
Who

51
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Who

52
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,160
Can I not answer you

53
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Who

54
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
Who

55
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,160
Who

56
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
I'm in Shanghai

57
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
Did you see the wrong me

58
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
I arrived in the afternoon

59
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
Do you have time

60
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
Long time no see

61
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,160
I came out to see you

62
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,160
I have to meet the boss of the shooting advertising tomorrow

63
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,160
Don't want to be distracted

64
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
Then rest early

65
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,160
Boss in Shanghai is hard to deal with

66
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,160
Good night

67
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
Good night

68
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
Hello, miss

69
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
Just now the advertising company called

70
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,160
Said it was still on the way

71
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,160
So please rest here first

72
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
Ok, thank you

73
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
Miss Le

74
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Our group's general manager

75
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
I want to talk to you alone

76
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,160
Please come with me to the meeting room

77
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Miss Le, please wait a moment

78
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Our group's general manager will be here soon

79
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
Ok

80
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Miss Le, your coffee, please

81
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
Do you like it

82
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
I didn't expect it was me

83
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,160
Do you think you are a fat and bald old man

84
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,160
I finally know why I want to go back to Shanghai for this advertisement

85
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
Do you understand

86
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,160
If I tell you, I have a feeling

87
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,160
Do you believe

88
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
I took over my father's photography industry

89
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,160
Just hope one day your photo can fill the whole Shanghai

90
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Let everyone be like me

91
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,160
See the shadow of my longing with my own eyes

92
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,160
Everyone

93
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,160
What you are looking at now is the script for the 45-second advertisement of Bugari

94
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,160
The shooting budget and time

95
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
Before we came to Shanghai

96
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
We have already sent it to the advertising company

97
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
But the client has not given us any advice

98
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,160
So he arranged us to come to Shanghai

99
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,160
Now I am waiting for the investment people's instructions

100
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,160
I want to hear the client's opinion first

101
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,160
Kang De

102
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
I have read the ad proposal

103
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,160
To be honest

104
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,160
This time the shooting budget is not a small amount

105
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160
I am worried that only if it is shot in Shanghai

106
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
The effect is not quite clear

107
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,160
It is not enough to match our product image

108
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,160
Then, Mr. Lin, do you have any specific requirements

109
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,160
I hope to be more fashionable and international

110
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,160
It may be the first time to shoot a jewelry advertisement

111
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
Experience is inevitable

112
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
During the production of this advertisement

113
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,160
I will add some space in the Japanese landscape

114
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,160
I will put the bright cherry blossoms and the bustling night view

115
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
Also integrated into this advertisement

116
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,160
This is a good idea

117
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,160
Mr. Lin

118
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,160
I think the Japanese style is not compatible with our advertising plan

119
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,160
If you want to pursue the beauty of the picture and the splendor of the jewelry

120
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160
I don't think you should go to Japan

121
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Then Mr. Ying, where are you going?

122
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
A very passionate place

123
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,160
I have a plan

124
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,160
I will arrange it first

125
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
I will see you in two days

126
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,160
Then please give us an answer as soon as possible

127
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Okay, that's it for today

128
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
I will see you in two days

129
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,160
You said that Ying Dong

130
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,160
Although he is a rich man

131
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,160
But he really has no plans

132
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
We all came to Shanghai

133
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,160
But he still hasn't determined the location of the advertisement

134
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,160
These rich people are too capable

135
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,160
Can I not say these?

136
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
What?

137
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,160
You are not happy?

138
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
You can take it as a vacation

139
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,160
When they determine the location, they can rest

140
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
Stop talking

141
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,160
Okay, okay

142
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,160
See what gifts your fans have sent

143
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,160
Sister Luo Yi

144
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
This is the gift that someone sent to the Tang Dynasty

145
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
Wow, so beautiful

146
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,160
A tree of gifts every day

147
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,160
The person who sent the flowers is really romantic

148
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
And he knows you so well

149
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
He knows you love to forget about me

150
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,160
Luo Yi, what is your favorite flower?

151
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,160
It should be to forget about me

152
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
If there is a delivery tomorrow

153
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
I will wait for you to make a mistake

154
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
Then you will know who sent it

155
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,160
I will open a very big flower shop in Shanghai

156
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
Let all Shanghai be full of this kind of flowers

157
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,160
Although your wish will come true

158
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
But I should not see it

159
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
You don't believe it?

160
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,160
Of course I believe it

161
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,160
But I have already applied for a leave of absence

162
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,160
Because there is a big food company to sign with me

163
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
You seem to have not graduated yet

164
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,160
I haven't graduated yet

165
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
But this opportunity is what I have been waiting for

166
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,160
I said you are not an ordinary person

167
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,160
I will wait for you

168
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
Hello, Miss Luo Yi

169
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
You are the owner of this shop?

170
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,160
My boss's name is Ying Dong

171
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
I am his junior

172
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
I will take care of this shop for him

173
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,160
Can I come in?

174
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,160
Of course, please come in

175
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
I thought you were just a flower shop

176
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,160
I didn't expect there were so many interesting things

177
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,160
These are all original works of some very talented young designers

178
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,160
Where did you find them?

179
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,160
Some of them are known by the boss in the travel office

180
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,160
Some of them I saw at the exhibition

181
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Our boss respects the opinion of young people

182
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,160
He likes the same as before

183
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
Will he come to the shop today?

184
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
He doesn't often come here

185
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
If he has something to say, he will tell me directly

186
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
Do you have something to do?

187
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
Or I can call you

188
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
No, it's okay

189
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
I just take a look

190
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
Okay, then what do you need to tell me?

191
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,160
This painting is interesting

192
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,160
This is designed by an artist specially for our shop

193
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,160
The name of this painting is called The King of Five

194
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,160
How much?

195
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
This painting cannot be sold

196
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,160
This is our boss's favorite painting

197
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,160
So it cannot be sold

198
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,160
You can look at other paintings

199
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
Mr. Lin

200
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,160
We have adjusted the shooting plan again

201
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,160
Do you have any comments?

202
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,160
I am very satisfied with the shooting plan again

203
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,160
I just don't know how the scene is going

204
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,160
I have talked about the foreign places

205
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
There will be no problem

206
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,160
It depends on which country we choose

207
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,160
But there are some problems in Shanghai

208
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,160
Most of the places we chose are the hotels and the dance companies of Wu Yuting

209
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,160
She will influence the guests

210
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
She won't let us suffer

211
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,160
Then let's communicate with her again

212
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,160
Okay

213
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,160
But as far as I know

214
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,160
The daughter of Wu Yuting, Amber, is always a good friend of our Ying

215
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,160
And she has a good relationship with us

216
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,160
As long as she can show up, it won't be a big problem

217
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,160
Kang Nong

218
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,160
You are an artist

219
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,160
In art, you are definitely a professional

220
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
You are the best

221
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,160
But in business

222
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,160
It's not as simple as you think

223
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
Sorry

224
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,160
I will check it right away

225
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
I will check it right away

226
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,160
If I knew she was from the police

227
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,160
Why would I arrange her to be your assistant?

228
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,160
I have the right to guess

229
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,160
You want to use these little actions

230
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,160
To improve your relationship with Luo Yi

231
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,160
Whether you know this or not

232
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,160
It has already happened

233
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,160
No wonder since I came back to Shanghai

234
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,160
I have been seeing this every day

235
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,160
I thought why it happened so fast

236
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
So I have a bastard around me

237
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
What is he afraid of?

238
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
I feel like I am a transparent person

239
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,160
Okay, don't be angry

240
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
It has already happened

241
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Let's think of a way to make up for it

242
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
How about this

243
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
I will find you more assistants

244
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
To strengthen the interview

245
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,160
In the end, you will be the witness

246
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
For people who don't understand

247
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
What if something like that happens

248
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
What will I do?

249
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,160
You don't have to argue anymore

250
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,160
I will let Han Ding Yi be your assistant

251
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,160
She is on vacation

252
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
She can rely on her work

253
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,160
You should be relieved

254
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,160
Were you and Ying Dong together before?

255
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
Yes

256
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
Didn't you check online?

257
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
A few years ago

258
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,160
You already had a scandal

259
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
We didn't really start it

260
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
Many people even slept together

261
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,160
It doesn't mean they love each other

262
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
We didn't start it either

263
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
But our hearts are connected

264
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Isn't it the same?

265
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,160
Don't men and women have a simple friendship?

266
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
In your appearance

267
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Men treat you as a friend

268
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,160
How is that possible?

269
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,160
But don't worry

270
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
I thought about it

271
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
In today's society

272
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
The rich and the powerful are God

273
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,160
And you

274
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,160
Can fight alone until today

275
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,160
It's really not easy

276
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,160
Don't worry

277
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,160
I won't be your obstacle

278
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,160
You don't need to consider my feelings

279
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,160
I have psychological preparation

280
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
Ying Dong

281
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,160
He will find a chance to replace me

282
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,160
I want to thank you for trusting me

283
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,160
And I want to say

284
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,160
I think Ying Dong is not a person who is a fake

285
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,160
If he really makes it hard for you

286
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
I will also care about your feelings

287
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,160
Do you think we are friends?

288
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Mr Ying

289
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,160
I don't know how you have been thinking these days

290
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,160
If the location is not implemented

291
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,160
I'm afraid I can't give you so much of Luo Yi's schedule

292
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
I will bear Luo Yi's loss

293
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
I have decided on the location

294
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,160
With the passion and beauty of the jewelry

295
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,160
We will change the location to Bali Island

296
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Change to Bali Island again?

297
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
I didn't expect it to be this place

298
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,160
Is there any special reason for Mr Ying's appointment to Bali Island?

299
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,160
This is because

300
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,160
I promised a goddess in college

301
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,160
I have a postcard of Bali Island since I was a child

302
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,160
I want to see the beautiful scenery there

303
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,160
And understand the story there

304
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,160
I will find a chance to take you there in the future

305
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
Why?

306
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
I want to see you smile

307
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
Lama

308
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
If we go to Bali Island for shooting

309
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,160
Will it affect our original budget?

310
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,160
You don't have to worry about this

311
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,160
I will make this ad work at all costs

312
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,160
I believe that if we shoot this ad well

313
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,160
It will make our British image greatly improved

314
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,160
Ok, I will immediately ask the head office

315
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,160
Mr Ying is really brave

316
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,160
It is impossible for a successor like you to have a bright future

317
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,160
But the ad is about to start

318
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,160
You are in a hurry to change the location

319
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,160
The director has done a lot of work before

320
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Including watching the scene and separating the shots

321
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,160
You can change it like this, is it ok?

322
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
Why not?

323
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,160
I believe in the ability of Director Kang

324
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,160
Director Kang, this small change can't be difficult for you

325
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
Mr Ying, don't worry

326
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,160
This time I can go to Bali Island for shooting

327
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,160
It is also an improvement to my career

328
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,160
This is not difficult for me

329
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,160
But I really should thank you

330
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
For the memories of the university

331
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,160
So committed

332
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,160
I hope this change can make this ad more perfect

333
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,160
And it also helps Luo Yi's development

334
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:56,160
But I don't want to work because of someone else's private commitment

335
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,160
Don't think too much

336
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,160
I will bring my own girlfriend to Bali Island

337
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,160
I will give you unnecessary trouble

338
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,160
Head office reply, fully support this shooting

339
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,160
Since everyone has no objections

340
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,160
I will give you a chance to make a decision

341
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,160
Since everyone has no objections

342
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,160
Then this matter is settled

343
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,160
Bauga 2 advertisement, move to Bali Island

344
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,160
Please have a meeting with your team

345
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
And re-plan the shooting plan

346
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,160
Ding Yi, you and Minghui see what else they need

347
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Hello

348
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,160
Is there a time for you to go to the university?

349
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
Yes

350
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,160
I am painting at the university today

351
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,160
I will be fine after that

352
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,160
I am asking you for the next week

353
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,160
One week?

354
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,160
Go to Bali Island with me

355
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,160
Go to Bali Island?

356
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,160
Why?

357
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,160
Go with me

358
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,160
I am going to Bali Island

359
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,160
I will be there

360
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,160
I will be there

361
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,160
I will be there

362
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,160
I will be there

363
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
I will be there

364
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,160
I will be there

365
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,160
Go to work with me

366
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,160
Do Luo Yi's advertisement

367
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,160
Let you enjoy the sunshine and beach

368
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,160
You won't reject me, right?

369
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
I...

370
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,160
I will ask Ding Yi to do the specific procedures

371
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
He will also go as Luo Yi's assistant

372
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,160
Pack your luggage and wait for my notice at home

373
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,160
What's wrong, Xiao Wen?

374
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
What are you looking for?

375
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,160
I was looking for you because I had something to do

376
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,160
I didn't say I would see you

377
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,160
Yes

378
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,160
I am the princess, I can burn incense if I want to

379
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
I will tell you the truth

380
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,160
I want you to go to Bali Island

381
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Take pictures of all the first movements in India

382
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,160
And why did you ask Wan Jia to go to Bali Island

383
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,160
when she was with Luo Yi?

384
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,160
Tell me one by one

385
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,160
This...

386
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,160
Going to Bali Island is a land-borrowing

387
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,160
50,000 is the salary for your salary

388
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,160
Since you care so much about India, why don't you go yourself?

389
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,160
The most important person should appear at the most important moment

390
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,160
If I do something, it's called losing my identity

391
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
I understand

392
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,160
Go

393
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,160
I will help her

394
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
Why don't you go to Bali Island?

395
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,160
You can go anywhere except my sister

396
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,160
Wan Jia is also...

397
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,160
I won't tell you if you come earlier

398
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,160
Hello

399
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Are you asleep?

400
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Your handsome brother misses you

401
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,160
I won't answer your call if I'm asleep

402
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,160
I know you are cursing me

403
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,160
You think I have been busy with work in Shanghai

404
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
and didn't accompany you

405
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,160
I won't put hope on others

406
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,160
If I knew you were like this, I would rather not come back

407
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,160
Mr. Kang, you are really angry

408
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,160
I'm not

409
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,160
I won't be angry at those who don't value me

410
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
I'm not angry

411
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
I'm not angry at you

412
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,160
I'm not angry at you

413
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,160
I'm not angry at you

414
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,160
I won't be angry at those who don't value me

415
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,160
Finally, you have a daughter

416
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,160
I like her

417
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,160
Who allows you to like me?

418
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,160
You are so mean to my brother

419
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,160
I'm even meaner. Do you want to hear it?

420
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Okay, let me talk first

421
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
This time I will go to Bali Island

422
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,160
The company arranged for me to have another assistant

423
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,160
I will leave it to you

424
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,160
Bali Island belongs to Luo Liqin

425
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,160
Tomorrow you can go with us with your passport

426
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,160
Really?

427
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,160
So you have already planned it

428
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,160
He Mo lied to me

429
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
How is it?

430
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,160
Are you willing to be my assistant?

431
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,160
Of course I am

432
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,160
Who do you think is more understanding than the sister?

433
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,160
You talk too much

434
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,160
Okay, gather at the hotel at eight o'clock tomorrow morning

435
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,160
By the way, don't be late

436
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,160
Yes, sir

437
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,160
Do you still owe me a word?

438
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,160
I love you so much, Mr. Kang

439
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,160
Okay, welcome to join

440
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
See you tomorrow

441
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,160
Hurry up

442
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,160
Let's go out after you get dressed

443
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,160
I love you so much

444
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,160
Excuse me

445
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,160
I love you so much

446
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,160
I love you so much

447
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,160
Excuse me, can you hold my hand?

448
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,160
Xiao Lian

449
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,160
Xiao Lian

450
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
Xiao Lian

451
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,160
Xiao Lian

452
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,160
Xiao Lian

453
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,160
Don't hit him

454
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,160
I just want to keep him as a souvenir

455
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,160
Okay, I will pay you back

456
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,160
Here

457
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,160
It's not wrong to love an idol

458
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,160
But I can't give you this

459
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,160
Your bracelet

460
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,160
Thank you

461
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
You are hurt

462
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
It's okay

463
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,160
It's just a scratch

464
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,160
Brother Ding Yi, you are so cool

465
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,160
You are a warrior

466
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,160
Han Ding Yi

467
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,160
Come here

468
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,160
Who told you to chase him?

469
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,160
He took Miss Luo's bracelet

470
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,160
Isn't it just a bracelet?

471
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,160
Do you know what's in your bag?

472
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,160
It's the plan to go to Bali Island this time

473
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,160
If anything goes wrong

474
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,160
You are responsible

475
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,160
He said the bracelet has a special meaning

476
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,160
I don't want him to be in a bad mood

477
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,160
Enough, enough

478
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
Forget it if nothing happens

479
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,160
But listen to me

480
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,160
Don't forget your job

481
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,160
Don't make a big deal out of it

482
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,160
I'm sorry

483
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,160
I love you

484
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,160
I love you too

485
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,160
Thank you

486
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,160
Don't worry, auntie

487
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,160
I will come back to you after I settle down

488
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,160
Welcome to Bali Island

489
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,160
It's a pity that we are not here to play this time

490
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,160
We have more important tasks to do

491
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,160
Tomorrow morning the photography team will set out to see the city

492
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,160
Others can go around freely

493
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,160
I have prepared a local phone card for you

494
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,160
You must carry your phone with you

495
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,160
The day after tomorrow is the official work

496
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,160
I hope you are ready to get up to 12 points

497
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
So lively

498
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
How can I be missing?

499
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
So lively

500
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,160
How can I be missing?

501
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,160
Why are you here?

502
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,160
I have my own reason

503
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,160
And I'm afraid you are only good at playing and not doing anything

504
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,160
I just arrived and I have nothing to worry about

505
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,160
Wait and see the good show

506
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,160
Mom, I didn't expect you to be so enthusiastic

507
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,160
Come without asking

508
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,160
Do you think I came for you?

509
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,160
You forgot that my dad also participated in the advertising shoot

510
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,160
I accompanied him to supervise your work

511
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,160
I hope you can shoot well

512
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,160
Sorry, I have no other meaning

513
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,160
I welcome you both

514
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,160
Everyone doesn't need to worry

515
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,160
Although I, Wu An Po, always pick up new words wherever I go

516
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,160
But I'm definitely not here to disturb

517
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,160
I'm here to learn

518
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,160
Learn from Miss Lu Ying

519
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,160
Learn from me?

520
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,160
Miss Lu, being modest is a virtue

521
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,160
But being too modest is a hypocrisy

522
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,160
A female star like you

523
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,160
Is a big fan of men

524
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,160
A male killer

525
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,160
Not only do you know how to attract attention

526
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,160
But you can also please men

527
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,160
And make men stand on your side

528
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,160
What is most admirable is that you can also handle the relationship with all men

529
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,160
Putting all men together

530
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,160
And letting them get along with each other

531
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,160
I can't learn that

532
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,160
Miss Wu

533
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,160
Please pay attention to your words when you speak

534
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,160
Don't affect Luo Yi's emotions

535
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,160
This time, we are here to work

536
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,160
An Po, stop it

537
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,160
Ding Yi, tell your dad to take her to the fire

538
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,160
Who is making a scene?

539
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
I never obey anyone

540
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
Let her go to the new class, okay?

541
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,160
Don't call An Po An Po so lightly

542
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
If Miss Lu misunderstands us later

543
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,160
The relationship will be bad

544
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,160
Miss Lu, don't think too much

545
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,160
Yindeng and I are just friends

546
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,160
So we are together all day

547
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,160
There is no way

548
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,160
We can be together

549
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,160
Parents are right

550
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,160
But you know

551
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,160
I don't know how to please Yindeng

552
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,160
Can you teach me?

553
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,160
I'll let you go

554
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,160
I'll let you go

555
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,160
You

556
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,160
You, my girlfriend

557
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,160
No

558
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,160
You remember me

559
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,160
You remember me

560
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,160
Look at my face

561
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,160
You crazy

562
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,160
Go away, she is my friend

563
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,160
Buddy good friend

564
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,160
I secure it

565
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,160
You remember

566
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,160
You can't be with me

567
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,160
Take him away

568
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,160
Take him away

569
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,160
Go

570
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,160
You can't be my girlfriend again

571
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,160
Are you okay?

572
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,160
Are you okay?

573
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,160
Take it

574
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
What?

575
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,160
I don't like to owe others

576
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,160
Especially you two

577
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,160
Take it as your revenge

578
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,160
Take it

579
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,160
I don't want it

580
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,160
I saved you not because of money

581
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,160
I don't want to owe you

582
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,160
Take it

583
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,160
Hurry up, I said I don't want it

584
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,160
Take it

585
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,160
I've already spent all my money, I'll give it to you

586
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
Look, you two take it

587
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,160
You two are so mean

588
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,160
You two take it

589
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,160
You two are so mean

590
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,160
Hurry up

591
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Do you look like a female dog?

592
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Yes

593
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,160
I help you work

594
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,160
You laugh at me

595
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,160
Look

596
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,160
Look

597
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,160
Come

598
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,160
My Mr.Kang

599
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,160
Thank you

600
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,160
How do you want to rely on me?

601
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,160
I am the owner

602
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,160
I will pay you back

603
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,160
I don't want to give you money

604
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,160
I will not take it back

605
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,160
This is not my style

606
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,160
What's wrong?

607
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,160
Will you smile?

608
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,160
You don't smile

609
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,160
Are you still a woman?

610
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,160
I help you

611
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,160
Let's go

612
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,160
Tomorrow is enough

613
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,160
Okay

614
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,160
I will pay you back

615
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,160
Cheers

616
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,160
I didn't expect to play with you two

617
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,160
So happy

618
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,160
Of course

619
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,160
Long hair, short sword

620
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,160
Our Mr.Kang

621
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,160
He is so good

622
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,160
How about it?

623
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,160
Cheers

624
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,160
Okay

625
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,160
No matter how many years have passed

626
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,160
We should be happy

627
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
Okay, cheers

628
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,160
Cheers

629
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,160
Except for the beach of the Bougley Hotel

630
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,160
And the beach of the Ayana Hotel

631
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,160
We also found the Sea Temple and the Love Cliff

632
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,160
In the shooting site

633
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,160
And we found the best team

634
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
In the local area

635
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,160
Mr.Ying

636
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,160
Mr.Ying

637
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,160
For the site

638
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,160
Do you have any special request?

639
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,160
No

640
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,160
Very good

641
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,160
You continue

642
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,160
I will call you

643
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,160
The phone rings

644
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,160
The beach of the Ayana Hotel

645
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,160
Do you have any favorite place?

646
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,160
Wherever you go

647
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,160
I go

648
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,160
I want to go to the Paris Castle

649
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,480
The

650
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,480
The Paris Castle

651
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,480
The Paris Castle

652
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,480
The Paris Castle

653
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,480
That's where my mom first fell in love

654
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,480
When your mom left you when you were a kid

655
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,480
She never contacted you

656
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,480
She never contacted you

657
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,480
She didn't leave anything

658
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,480
Except for the bracelet and the star card

659
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,480
Okay

660
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,480
I will take you there in the future

661
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,480
Really?

662
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,480
Really

663
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,480
You are not in the meeting?

664
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,480
I believe you can't work

665
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,480
How do you know?

666
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,480
I always remember the smell of you

667
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,480
It's the same

668
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,480
Very good

669
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,480
You still remember

670
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,480
Is the smell the most important?

671
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,480
Luo Yi

672
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,480
I really don't know how the massage will come

673
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,480
I really don't know how the massage will come

674
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,480
I really don't know how the massage will come

675
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,480
I really don't know how the massage will come

676
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,480
And say those words

677
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,480
Please don't mind

678
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,480
No

679
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,480
Don't worry

680
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,480
I will do your job well

681
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,480
Can we not talk about work?

682
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
Can we not talk about work?

683
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,480
Can we talk about other things besides work?

684
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,480
I never wanted to hurt you

685
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,480
You must believe me

686
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,480
Why do you say this?

687
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,480
You know how I have been these years

688
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,480
You know how I have been these years

689
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,480
I never forget

690
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,480
I never had a relationship with anyone

691
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,480
I never had a relationship with anyone

692
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,480
Wanjia is just a friend

693
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,480
I only think about you

694
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,480
I only think about you

695
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,480
You left me with only one word

696
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,480
You left me with only one word

697
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,480
You never thought about me

698
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,480
You should leave completely

699
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,480
You should leave completely

700
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,480
You should leave completely

701
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,480
It's all over

702
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,480
Why do you still mention it?

703
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,480
Is it really over?

704
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
Do you really think so?

705
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,480
I said all of this is to wait for you to come back

706
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,480
I said all of this is to wait for you to come back

707
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,480
Do you know why I always come here to take photos?

708
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,480
I never forget what you said to me

709
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,480
I owe you three words

710
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,480
Luo Yin

711
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,480
Do you believe in life?

712
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,480
I don't believe

713
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,480
Why?

714
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,480
Because everything changes

715
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,480
Including you and me

716
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,480
So you will leave me one day?

717
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,480
So you will leave me one day?

718
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,480
I think it's to reunite

719
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,480
Why do we have to separate?

720
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,480
Because I have what I want to do

721
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
Luo Yin

722
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
Hello

723
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,480
Don't say it

724
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,480
Don't you want to hear it?

725
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,480
I want to hear it

726
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,480
But not now

727
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,480
Look here

728
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,480
I miss you and your daughter

729
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,480
They are repeating this every day

730
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
How many people can walk to the end with them?

731
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,480
I don't want us to be like them

732
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,480
I don't want us to be like them

733
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,480
Even if you leave

734
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,480
I will find you even if I have to go to the end of the world

735
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,480
I thought I was the only one who remembered

736
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,480
If you leave

737
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,480
If you leave

738
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,480
To make me miss you more

739
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,480
You have succeeded

740
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,480
Look, we seem to have everything now

741
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,480
But there are also many troubles

742
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,480
But there are also many troubles

743
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,480
Every time I feel very stressed

744
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,480
I think of those simple and beautiful little happiness

745
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,480
I think of those simple and beautiful little happiness

746
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,480
I think of those simple and beautiful little happiness

747
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,480
It will be much easier

748
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,480
But some things have already passed

749
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,480
Let it go

750
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,480
Luo Yin

751
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,480
Don't let it go

752
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,480
I love you

753
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,480
I won't go

754
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,480
It's different

755
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,480
Luo Yin

756
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,480
Will you promise me one thing?

757
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,480
Tell me

758
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,480
Forget me

759
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,480
I'm sorry

760
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,480
This is the only thing

761
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,480
I can't do

762
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,480
I'm sorry

763
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,480
I'm sorry

764
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,480
I'm sorry

765
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,480
I'm sorry

766
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,480
I'm sorry

767
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,480
I'm sorry

768
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,480
I'm sorry

769
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,480
I'm sorry

770
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,480
I'm sorry

771
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,480
I'm sorry

772
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,480
I'm sorry

773
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,480
I'm sorry

774
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,480
I'm sorry

775
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,480
I'm sorry

776
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,480
I'm sorry

777
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,480
I'm so sorry

778
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,480
I'm sorry

779
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,480
I'm sorry

780
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,480
I'm sorry

781
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,480
I'm so sorry

782
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,480
I'm sorry

783
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,480
I'm sorry

784
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,480
I'm sorry

785
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,480
I'm sorry

786
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,480
Thanks

787
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,480
You don't have to say anything

788
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:11,480
You will not hesitate to reach out your hand

789
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,480
You block the wind for me

790
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,480
You bring rain for me

791
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:24,480
You teach me to stop and walk forward

792
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,480
I have been hurt and hurt before

793
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:37,480
I must have you to cry with me

794
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,480
Let's shout together

795
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,480
Let's keep our mouth shut

796
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,480
Let's stay on the street of drunkenness

797
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,480
We will go to the end

798
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,480
We don't need any reason

799
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,480
We have been through too much

800
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,480
That is what I love most

801
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,480
We will go to the end

802
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,480
We don't need any reason

803
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,480
We can listen to your voice

804
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,480
Listen to your voice

805
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,480
In our times

806
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,480
Together
