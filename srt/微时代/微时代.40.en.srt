I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000

Translated by Shion

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I found it.

31
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
What did you find?

32
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,120
I found the bag I lost.

33
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,680
I sent it to the airport in Bali.

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,920
I can go to the airport tonight.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Really?

36
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,280
I'm so happy.

37
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,880
I'm so happy.

38
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,960
How was it?

39
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,600
I didn't do anything wrong, did I?

40
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,040
You always say that when I guess.

41
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,160
Mr Ling, I'm sorry about what happened last time.

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,720
I was too impulsive.

43
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,880
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,880
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,800
Luo Yi, you've worked so hard this time.

47
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,560
You've shot two films in a row.

48
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,560
You've wasted your precious time and energy.

49
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,320
How could I waste my time?

50
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,680
I've got something very precious this time.

51
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,480
It's just that you don't know.

52
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,280
Welcome.

53
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,880
Meng.

54
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,840
Yendong, Amber, you're here.

55
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,120
Feel free to look around.

56
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,280
Let me know if you need anything.

57
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,360
Okay.

58
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,880
How big are you going to sell these rings to Luo Yi?

59
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,280
I want to see this.

60
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
I'll help you.

61
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,240
What a beautiful diamond ring.

62
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,920
You have a good taste.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,120
Amber, can I have it?

64
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,600
Give it back to me.

65
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,480
You're so petty.

66
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,280
I'm just helping Luo Yi.

67
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,880
I'm not not giving it back to you.

68
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,280
I'm just helping Luo Yi.

69
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,680
I'm not giving it back to you.

70
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,480
I'm just curious.

71
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,880
How are you going to confess to Luo Yi?

72
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,160
I haven't decided yet.

73
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,360
Sir, this is the ring you chose.

74
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,760
I've already packed it for you.

75
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,840
Okay, thank you.

76
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,240
Welcome.

77
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,840
Kang Zirui.

78
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,680
You're here to buy a ring too?

79
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,280
What's this?

80
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,400
I have a habit.

81
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,880
Every time I finish work,

82
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,880
I'll give the main character a gift.

83
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,720
This is just a pair of rings.

84
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,240
But I used up all my money to buy this.

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,240
I won't bother you then.

86
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,720
I wish you happiness.

87
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Hurry and take it off.

88
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,600
They've all misunderstood.

89
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,840
How many people would want to have a misunderstanding?

90
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,280
But the ring on his hand

91
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,000
must be for Luo Yi.

92
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,560
It seems like you have a competitor.

93
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,360
Do you think he has a competitor?

94
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,360
The winner is already decided.

95
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
No.

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I think he's quite sincere.

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,200
It's really pretty.

98
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
Right?

99
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,800
Yi Hong, I want this.

100
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,880
Okay.

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Hello.

102
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,080
You're here.

103
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
Meng.

104
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
You're here.

105
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320
You look so pretty today.

106
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Thank you.

107
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
Meng.

108
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,160
Come on, sit.

109
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,920
Are the others not here yet?

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,800
Today is the anniversary of the ad.

111
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,200
Why are you so excited?

112
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,760
Cheers.

113
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
Cheers.

114
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,880
Cheers.

115
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Cheers.

116
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
Cheers.

117
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
Cheers.

118
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Cheers.

119
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
Cheers.

120
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
Cheers.

121
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
What are you cooking?

122
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,840
You're the best.

123
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
It's delicious.

124
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,880
I'll show you the kitchen.

125
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,400
Did we come here first?

126
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
It's embarrassing.

127
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,960
Girls are hitting boys.

128
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,320
What are you talking about?

129
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
We're here.

130
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,280
They'll be here soon.

131
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,360
I brought flowers.

132
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,920
Such pretty flowers.

133
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,360
Are they for me?

134
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,800
I'll give them to whoever is the lead.

135
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,320
You're here.

136
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Cheng.

137
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
Hello.

138
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,000
Such a big bouquet.

139
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Where's the pretty girl?

140
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,960
With my face,

141
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,560
isn't that enough?

142
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
You brat.

143
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,320
If you're sincere to women, you should buy a diamond ring.

144
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,880
See if she loves you.

145
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,640
See if she's wearing the ring on her hand.

146
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,520
I want to be sincere too. I have no money.

147
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,800
I'll pay for it.

148
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Go away.

149
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,280
You're the one who should buy it.

150
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,760
No way.

151
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,040
Mom.

152
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,520
This is the first time I bought a ring for someone.

153
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,160
I hope you'll accept it.

154
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,760
Maybe you've never loved me before.

155
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,920
But I want you to know

156
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,240
that you're the only female lead in my life.

157
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,440
I want to be sincere to women.

158
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,240
I want to be sincere to men.

159
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,960
I want to be sincere to women.

160
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,640
I want to be sincere to men.

161
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,000
I want to be sincere to women.

162
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,080
Here you are.

163
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,040
Thank you.

164
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,120
Why do you look so pale?

165
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,200
Are you feeling unwell?

166
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
What do you think?

167
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,880
Do you think I'm sick?

168
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,760
I just drank a little.

169
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,000
Besides flowers,

170
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,800
do you give other things to girls?

171
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,800
What do you want?

172
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,080
I can give you anything.

173
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,600
I want a diamond ring.

174
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,880
I bought it in India.

175
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,960
What do you think? Can you make it come true?

176
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Can you make it come true?

177
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,960
It seems that a song can't be made into anything.

178
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,680
What are you talking about with Xiao Qiao?

179
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,680
I'm talking about their ex-boyfriend.

180
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,920
You're their ex-boyfriend?

181
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,520
Thank you, Ms. Lu Yi.

182
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,920
I learned a lot from you.

183
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,360
I want to thank you.

184
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,200
Thank you for taking care of me.

185
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,760
It's all thanks to you.

186
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,920
I learned a lot from you.

187
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,400
You're my benefactor.

188
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,640
You're a teacher.

189
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,120
Everyone likes you.

190
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,880
It feels safe to be with you.

191
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,800
Not necessarily.

192
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,160
Many women don't like it.

193
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Do you know?

194
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,960
I have a ring that I can't take out.

195
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,160
What a coincidence.

196
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,760
I have a ring that I don't want to take out.

197
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,240
It's from Ning Dong.

198
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,640
If it's him,

199
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,800
you want me to take it, right?

200
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,640
Then the player will turn around.

201
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,120
I didn't think too much.

202
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,160
I just think that everyone can be happy.

203
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,480
Take care of yourself.

204
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,600
I didn't know that there was a situation

205
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,960
that I couldn't control.

206
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,200
People can't get what they want.

207
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,520
Life is moving.

208
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,200
What about you?

209
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,640
I hate the feeling of failure.

210
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,840
I will never be able to get it.

211
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,960
I will find a new way to replace you.

212
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,560
Me too.

213
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,040
Don't tell me

214
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,720
that you like Han Dingyi.

215
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,760
Is there a problem?

216
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,280
He reminds me of my past self.

217
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,120
I always thought

218
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,200
that you were not willing to be an ordinary person.

219
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,120
So, Xuan,

220
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,960
you still don't understand me.

221
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
Well...

222
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,160
I still can't accept it.

223
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,800
Thank you for being so nice to me.

224
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,120
I'd rather go anywhere anytime

225
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,120
Maybe happiness is right there

226
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,360
Don't leave Shanghai, okay?

227
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,520
It's better not to start a relationship.

228
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
Trust me.

229
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,960
I can give you happiness.

230
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,600
I'll take you to 22 No. 3

231
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,200
and get you a tractor.

232
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,280
Excuse me.

233
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,480
Check the dust here.

234
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,880
We hope that we make some good memories

235
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,720
PIease share your downloading score

236
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,760
with these ones who uses P heartbeat.

237
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,880
For the farmers,

238
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,880
Waiting for the wind to blow

239
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,880
You're too obvious.

240
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
What's wrong?

241
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
I advise you to give up on Yingdong.

242
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,880
A few days ago, I went to the jewelry store with him and bought a diamond ring.

243
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,880
I think you can guess who the diamond ring master is.

244
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
Diamond ring?

245
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,880
Is he going to propose to Luo Yi?

246
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,880
Don't you always know?

247
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,880
In Yingdong's heart, there is only Luo Yi.

248
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,880
Anyway, I decided to give up.

249
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,880
I never accept anything that is second-hand, including people.

250
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,880
The reason I told you was afraid you would get hurt.

251
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,880
In Yingdong's heart, there is no way you would be.

252
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,880
We are also willing to follow you.

253
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,880
I'll write to you.

254
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,880
You won't regret it.

255
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,880
Just like this.

256
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,880
I'm sorry.

257
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,880
I'm sorry.

258
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,880
I'm sorry.

259
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,880
I'm sorry.

260
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,880
I'm sorry.

261
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,880
I'm sorry.

262
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,880
I'm sorry.

263
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,880
I'm sorry.

264
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,880
I'm sorry.

265
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
I'm sorry.

266
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,880
I'm sorry.

267
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,880
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
I'm sorry.

269
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,880
I'm sorry.

270
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,880
I'm sorry.

271
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
How did you know I was here?

272
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,880
Only our memories.

273
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,880
If I could find you here,

274
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,880
it would mean you haven't forgotten this feeling.

275
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,880
I will never let you leave again.

276
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,920
Let's go.

277
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,180
All right.

278
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,880
I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm sure I can do it.

279
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,880
I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm sure I can do it.

280
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,880
I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm sure I can do it.

281
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,880
I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm sure I can do it.

282
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,880
I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm sure I can do it.

283
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,880
I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm sure I can do it.

284
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,880
I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm sure I can do it.

285
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,880
I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm sure I can do it.

286
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,880
I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm sure I can do it.

287
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,880
I'm not sure if I can do it, but I'm sure I can do it.

288
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,880
Okay?

289
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,880
Okay?

290
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,880
Okay?

291
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,880
Okay?

292
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,880
I thought I could dodge it, but you still caught me by surprise.

293
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
I'm always afraid that I can't catch you.

294
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,880
Although you're standing in front of me,

295
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,880
I feel so far away.

296
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
I don't feel safe.

297
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
I've never been so afraid of losing someone.

298
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,880
Promise me.

299
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,880
Don't leave me again.

300
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
Don't go anywhere else, okay?

301
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
But I'm an actress.

302
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,880
I can't always stay in one place.

303
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,880
I have to go out and film.

304
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,880
Can't our love be more than your so-called career?

305
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,880
I don't want our love to wait.

306
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
I want it to stay with me,

307
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,880
stay in my home.

308
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
Yingdong, I love you.

309
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,880
So I also hope that the person I love can be with you.

310
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
I respect my choice.

311
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,880
As long as I can continue to film,

312
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
all my efforts before have been in vain.

313
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,880
Even if everyone knows you,

314
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,880
what can you do?

315
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
You said you would remember everything about me.

316
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,880
Have you forgotten why I tried so hard?

317
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
Is it important to remember or not to remember?

318
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
If you want to live a good life,

319
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,880
I can give you better things at any time.

320
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
You don't have to work hard to film.

321
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,880
I can give you a lot of money every month.

322
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,880
You can ask for as much as you want.

323
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,880
As long as I can give you.

324
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,880
You're taking care of me.

325
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,880
As long as you quit the entertainment industry,

326
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
I can give you everything you want.

327
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
You can't give me.

328
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Love is not a friend.

329
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,880
It's not forcing each other to change or compromise.

330
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
I've never changed.

331
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
But what about you?

332
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,880
Do you still remember who you were?

333
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,880
I remember.

334
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,880
You don't remember.

335
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,880
You forgot.

336
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
You're not who you used to be.

337
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,880
Even if I didn't say anything,

338
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,880
you would understand me.

339
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
But now,

340
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,880
no matter how much I say,

341
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,880
you don't seem to understand.

342
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,880
You're wearing new clothes.

343
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,880
You're so cute.

344
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
Pick one.

345
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
What do you like?

346
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,880
What?

347
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,880
You two are on a honeymoon now?

348
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,880
We're still in love.

349
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Didn't your dad go back to Shanghai?

350
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,880
Why are you here?

351
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
I came here to escape from him.

352
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,880
I have to tell him a lot of big things when he sees me.

353
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,880
I can't think straight.

354
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
Look.

355
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Amber.

356
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
Hi.

357
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
Why are you two here?

358
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,880
We're going to watch a movie.

359
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,880
Shuai Lu, come and have a look.

360
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,880
You two are here too?

361
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,880
Hi.

362
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,880
Let's see what's good.

363
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,880
The magazine said that Miss Wu is a charity woman.

364
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,880
She sells all the clothes she's worn.

365
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
Please.

366
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
Are these clothes authentic?

367
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,880
They look like a copy of the original.

368
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,880
I said I was going to buy them.

369
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
If you don't want to buy them,

370
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,880
you can leave my store.

371
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,880
I don't want to work for a low-class customer like you.

372
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,880
We don't want to stay here for more than a minute.

373
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
It's our identity.

374
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,880
A person who doesn't have a mother's education is really a bad person.

375
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,880
Stop.

376
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
What did you say?

377
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,880
I said someone who has never had a mother since childhood.

378
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,880
And it's really unclear.

379
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,880
Maybe it's a foster child.

380
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
You should be careful.

381
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,880
Your father has his own child.

382
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,880
When your child comes back to be a father,

383
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,880
you'll be a foster child.

384
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
You're talking nonsense.

385
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
Don't be so stubborn.

386
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
No matter how hard you try,

387
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,880
our circle won't leave you a place.

388
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,880
What circle?

389
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,880
Are you talking about the whole circle?

390
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,880
You must have been very angry.

391
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
I'm not angry.

392
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,880
And you.

393
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,880
You have a very bad chest.

394
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
That's right.

395
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
Who do you think you are?

396
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
If your father wasn't rich,

397
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
who else would be around you?

398
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,880
You're a rich but poor foster child.

399
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Let's go.

400
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
Stop.

401
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
What did you say?

402
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
What are you doing?

403
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
Why did you fight?

404
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,880
Stop fighting.

405
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Stop fighting.

406
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
What are you doing?

407
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,880
Stop fighting.

408
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,880
What's going on?

409
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
Stop.

410
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
Why haven't you left?

411
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,880
I don't want your pity.

412
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,880
You must think I'm very annoying.

413
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,880
I didn't even have a chance to see you.

414
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
I'm sorry.

415
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,880
I'm sorry.

416
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,880
I'm sorry.

417
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
I'm sorry.

418
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
I'm sorry.

419
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
I'm sorry.

420
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,880
I'm sorry.

421
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,880
I'm sorry.

422
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
I'm sorry.

423
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,880
I'm sorry.

424
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,880
No one has ever really loved me.

425
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,880
How could that be?

426
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
I don't think you're pitiful at all.

427
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,880
On the contrary,

428
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,880
I think you're very cute.

429
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,880
Because when you cry,

430
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
you're very simple.

431
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,880
You're very straightforward.

432
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
Like a child.

433
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
You want to make me cry?

434
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,880
Amber,

435
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
you may not know yet

436
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,880
that there are only women who cry.

437
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,880
Only then can you truly move a man's heart.

438
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,880
Why are you so sure?

439
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,880
Because you're the most straightforward

440
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,880
among all people.

441
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
Thank you for comforting me.

442
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,880
Okay.

443
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,880
Wipe your tears with the tissue.

444
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,880
Wipe your tears with the tissue.

445
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,880
With your identity,

446
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
let him wipe it.

447
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,880
Are you sick?

448
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
I'll give you a gift.

449
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,880
It can help you find

450
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,880
someone who truly loves you.

451
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,880
Give me your hand.

452
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
Is this

453
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,880
the ring you gave me?

454
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
Thank you.

455
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
This is so strange.

456
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,880
I can't believe it.

457
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,880
I can't believe it.

458
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
I can't believe it.

459
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,880
I can't believe it.

460
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
I can't believe it.

461
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,880
I can't believe it.

462
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,880
This is so strange.

463
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,880
It seems

464
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
that it's my size.

465
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
Jingdong,

466
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,880
why are you here?

467
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,880
I came to see Ding Yi.

468
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,880
He has something to do at home.

469
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,880
He'll be back very late.

470
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
Are you waiting for him?

471
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,880
No.

472
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
I just passed by here today.

473
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,880
So I came in to see.

474
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,880
I heard from Weiwei

475
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
that Luo Yi is going to Hollywood today.

476
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,880
Will you go with him?

477
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,880
I wish you a safe trip.

478
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,880
What?

479
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,880
Luo Yi is going to Hollywood today.

480
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,880
Luo Yi.

481
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,880
When you saw this letter,

482
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
I was on the plane to America.

483
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,880
I'm sorry.

484
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,880
I lied to you.

485
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,880
I lied to you

486
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,880
because I didn't want you to send me to the airport.

487
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,880
I was afraid that I couldn't bear to stay

488
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,880
when I saw your eyes.

489
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,880
But I had to leave.

490
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,880
I had to leave with a strong heart.

491
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,880
Because I had to fulfill my dream.

492
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,880
Do you remember the reason why I wanted to be an actress?

493
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
To let more people know me.

494
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,880
To let my mother leave

495
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
and come back to me.

496
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
Maybe you have forgotten

497
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,880
that I have always treated this as the motivation for my work.

498
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,880
The goal that I don't want to give up.

499
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,880
Maybe in ten years,

500
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,880
I will be old, tired,

501
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,880
and unable to fly anymore.

502
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,880
If you still love me at that time,

503
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,880
then we will meet at the Sea God Temple on Bali Island.

504
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,880
Before that, please forget me.

505
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,880
Luo Yi.

506
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,880
Luo Yi.

507
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,880
This city

508
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,880
has a precious memory

509
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,880
that I will never forget in my life.

510
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,880
In this world,

511
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,880
love may be the only one without a solution

512
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,880
and never have a standard answer.

513
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,880
Some people will stick to a pure love forever.

514
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,880
Until death

515
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,880
they will separate.

516
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Some people will take love as a driving force.

517
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
Constantly encourage themselves

518
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
and become better themselves.

519
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
Some people will take love as a bargaining chip.

520
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,880
Let it exchange for money,

521
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
status,

522
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,880
and satisfy their endless desires.

523
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,880
Some people will be closed off from love

524
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,880
because of the pain of love.

525
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,880
Some people are willing to fulfill others' love

526
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,880
only to get happiness from each other.

527
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,880
For those who just graduated from university,

528
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,880
what attitude should they use when facing love?

529
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,880
I don't know.

530
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,880
Maybe only by growing up

531
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,880
can we find a better answer.

532
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
Mei Bao,

533
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,880
why didn't you tell Hua Youxi?

534
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,880
You haven't had a boyfriend since you broke up.

535
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,880
Because

536
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
I don't want her to worry about me.

537
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
I don't want her to worry about me.

538
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
I don't want her to worry about me.

539
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,880
I'm sorry.

540
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,880
I have to send Youxi a message.

541
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,880
Mei Bao,

542
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,880
can you tell me

543
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,880
why you always treat Hua Youxi so well?

544
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
In your eyes,

545
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,880
there's no one else but Hua Youxi.

546
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,880
When you go out,

547
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,880
wear some clothes

548
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
so that you won't catch a cold.

549
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,880
Put your hands here.

550
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,880
Okay?

551
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,880
Hua Youxi,

552
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,880
I really want to remember this feeling for the rest of my life.

553
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,880
Hua Youxi!

554
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
Because

555
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,880
she's my first love.

556
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,880
I wish I could spend every day by her side.

557
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,880
She can't see it,

558
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
so she finds

559
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,880
the familiar face on the left.

560
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,880
It's too simple for her.

561
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,880
She thought she could see it.

562
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,880
But she forgot her right hand.

563
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
I'm sorry, Lan Zhan.

564
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
I have to go to a meeting.

565
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,880
Can't you stay for five more minutes?

566
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,880
Just five minutes.

567
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,880
Lan Zhan, really,

568
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,880
not even one minute.

569
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,880
You waited for her so many times.

570
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,880
What's wrong with you?

571
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,880
Why are you so angry?

572
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,880
Because I can't stand it anymore.

573
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,880
I'm sorry.

574
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,880
I'm sorry.

575
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,880
I'm sorry.

576
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,880
The day we met in the sea

577
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,880
I was wrong.

578
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,880
The day we met in the sea

579
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,880
I was wrong.

580
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
The day we met in the sea

581
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,880
I regret not choosing you.

582
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,880
I regret not choosing you.

583
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,880
I know now

584
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,880
that you're the best for me.

585
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,880
Will you really give up everything for me

586
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,880
and go to America with me from the beginning?

587
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,880
I wish I could spend every day by her side

588
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,880
If you still want to go to America with me,

589
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,880
see you at the gate of Minzhen Jun tomorrow at 10 o'clock.

590
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,880
...the familiar face on the left

591
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,880
The person is too simple

592
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,880
because she could see it

593
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,880
But she forgot her right hand

594
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
Brother Ding Yi,

595
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,880
Jia Jia went to study abroad.

596
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,880
I'm going to go abroad with Ou Hui to see a doctor.

597
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,880
I'll leave our house to you.

598
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,880
...the person is too simple

599
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,880
because she loves another woman

600
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,880
She likes him

601
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,880
I never thought I could live in someone else's dream.

602
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,880
And I'm still a first love.

603
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,880
In fact, you appear in many people's dreams.

604
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,880
But you don't even know yourself.

605
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,880
...the person is too simple

606
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:59,880
because she loves another woman

607
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:06,880
I wish I could spend every day by her side

608
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,880
If you still want to go to America with me from the beginning

609
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,880
The familiar face on the left

610
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,880
The person is too simple

611
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,880
because she could see it

612
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,880
But she forgot her right hand

613
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,880
...the familiar face on the left

614
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,880
What's wrong?

615
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,880
You seem unhappy.

616
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,880
No.

617
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,880
At the graduation ceremony,

618
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
Uncle Wu promised to donate the stadium.

619
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,880
This is a double-edged sword.

620
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,880
Although you smile on your face,

621
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
you have something on your mind.

622
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,880
You can't fool me by hiding it from others.

623
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,880
I'm just sad.

624
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,880
I've been living in school for four years.

625
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,880
I don't care if I'm sad.

626
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,880
But we won't.

627
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,880
Daddy.

628
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,880
Let me ask you.

629
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,880
I was talking about a very important business with Uncle Hua

630
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,880
at the party of Huakai Group.

631
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,880
Why did you bring Yingdong to our company?

632
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,880
Yingdong is my boyfriend.

633
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,880
He has the right to participate in the company's cooperation.

634
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,880
His name is Yingdong, not Yinggai.

635
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,880
Business is like a battlefield.

636
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,880
How can my business be known to others?

637
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,880
Daddy, Yingdong is not an outsider.

638
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,880
He is my boyfriend.

639
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,880
Even if you marry him in the future,

640
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,880
he is still an outsider in my heart.

641
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,880
I only leave my property to people who have blood ties with me.

642
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,880
You and my future grandson.

643
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,880
As for my son-in-law, I don't have a choice.

644
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,880
Money, money, money.

645
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,880
I hate everything about money.

646
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,880
Can't you use simple and simple methods

647
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,880
to see the relationship between us?

648
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,880
I tell you, I never believed in simple feelings in my life.

649
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,880
What about simple feelings?

650
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,880
Simple feelings...

651
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,880
Daddy.

652
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,880
Daddy.

653
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,880
Are you having a heartache?

654
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,880
Auntie.

655
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,880
Daddy, let me carry you.

656
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,880
Daddy, are you okay?

657
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,880
Are you feeling better?

658
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,880
Auntie, take daddy to his room to rest.

659
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,880
I'll call the doctor.

660
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,880
I'm sorry.

661
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,880
I'm Huang Youxi.

662
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,880
I have a mother and no father since I was little.

663
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
Since I was little,

664
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,880
I've been imagining

665
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,880
what kind of person my father is.

666
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,880
If my father was a rich man,

667
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,880
I would have been developed in my life.

668
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,880
I have been living in this world for a long time.

669
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,880
I'm sure I can change my life.

670
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,880
I can change my life.

671
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,880
I can change my life.

672
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,880
I can change my life.

673
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,880
I can change my life.

674
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,880
I can change my life.

675
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,880
I can change my life.

676
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,880
I didn't expect that

677
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,880
God really cares about me.

678
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,880
My father is really

679
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,880
a rich man.

680
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,880
A rich man.

681
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,880
But now,

682
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,880
all of this is not important to me.

683
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,880
This father

684
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,880
hasn't raised me for more than 20 years.

685
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,880
But I'm still

686
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,880
healthy and happy.

687
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,880
He hasn't taken responsibility for his mother.

688
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,880
For more than 20 years,

689
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,880
I haven't seen him in my life.

690
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,880
Now, it's the same.

691
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,880
Since I was little,

692
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,880
the position of my mother

693
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,880
in my heart is the most important.

694
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,880
No one can replace her.

695
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,880
Of course,

696
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,880
I also want a rich father.

697
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,880
But,

698
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,880
my mother needs

699
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,880
a grown-up husband.

700
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,880
My uncle said,

701
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,880
if you see this kind of raincoat,

702
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,880
I want to tell you,

703
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,880
only if my mother wants to give you back,

704
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,880
I will accept you.

705
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,880
I don't need to be afraid

706
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,880
of the relationship between us.

707
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,880
I will not

708
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,880
let Amber down.

709
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,880
Now, you must think I'm stupid and childish.

710
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,880
You think I don't know how to hold the chance.

711
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,880
But it doesn't matter.

712
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,880
I don't care.

713
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,880
My whole life

714
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,880
is living in misunderstanding.

715
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,880
Can you find out

716
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,880
any of my trust?

717
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,880
Of course.

718
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,880
Especially for you.

719
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,880
I'm sorry.

720
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,880
I'm sorry.

721
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,880
For your love,

722
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,880
cheers!

723
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,880
Cheers!

724
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,880
This can't be.

725
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,880
We can't have a love.

726
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,880
We are brothers.

727
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,880
This can't be.

728
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,880
Dear Miss Hua,

729
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,880
I hope you can

730
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,880
teach her well.

731
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,880
I don't want her to be

732
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,880
with my daughter.

733
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,880
Tell me!

734
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,880
Tell me!

735
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,880
Miss Hua, you misunderstood.

736
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,880
Why are you wearing Yuxi's clothes?

737
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,880
Feifei helped me change.

738
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,880
Can they really do anything?

739
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,880
No.

740
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,880
Yuxi is sleeping here.

741
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,880
I'm with Amber upstairs.

742
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,880
I guess the heavens

743
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,880
are watching me.

744
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,880
So I sent you to help me.

745
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,880
I'm

746
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,880
a good actor.

747
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,880
I can help you

748
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,880
with all kinds of problems.

749
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,880
I wish I had a sister like you.

750
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,880
I don't want a brother like you.

751
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,880
What?

752
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,880
I have a brother to take care of you.

753
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,880
I don't want a brother.

754
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,880
My father has been

755
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,880
annoying enough.

756
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,880
If someone else comes to bother me,

757
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,880
I can't stand it.

758
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,880
And I don't want

759
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,880
anyone to take away my father's love for me.

760
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,880
Don't worry.

761
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,880
No one can take

762
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,880
everything you have away.

763
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,880
You are your father's only.

764
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,880
The End

I've been hurt.

775
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,880
I have a grudge.

776
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,880
I must have you

777
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,880

778
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,880
