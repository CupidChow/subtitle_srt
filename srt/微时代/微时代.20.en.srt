1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,780
If the

2
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,480
tears

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,360
But I should tell somebody,

4
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,260
this is everything willing to pay for the funeral

5
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,600
that we had to.

6
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,740
Quick, do something!

7
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,340
Tell me all about the people who are気 spoke to us last night.

8
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,560
They're talking about how we gave her to vendetta.

9
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,180
The three...

10
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,560
Has someone told a long story?

11
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,160
But you love me so much.

12
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,160
How can I accept it?

13
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,560
Amber, that's how you are.

14
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,160
You are stubborn.

15
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,160
You don't understand what young people think.

16
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,960
Mommy is different from her.

17
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,160
Mommy supports you to love freely.

18
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,760
Really?

19
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,360
You really support me to be with Zirui?

20
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,160
I believe in your vision.

21
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,160
What you like is the best.

22
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,960
And you are my daughter.

23
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,960
You are a piece of my body.

24
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,160
I care about your happiness.

25
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,160
Only women know what they need.

26
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,360
Why didn't you come to see me?

27
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,160
Because you were outside.

28
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,760
Of course, he wouldn't tell you.

29
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,760
Every year on your birthday,

30
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,360
I choose a gift for you.

31
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,360
He will return it.

32
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,160
He won't tell you.

33
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,560
Every time I want to hear your voice,

34
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:45,160
he will cut it off.

35
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:52,560
You didn't receive the photo I sent you before, did you?

36
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,960
I knew it.

37
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,560
Otherwise,

38
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
on the day of the MBA,

39
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,760
how could you not recognize me?

40
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,160
That day,

41
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,760
I saw your strange eyes.

42
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,960
I felt so painful.

43
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,160
But I saw

44
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,560
my little princess,

45
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,360
she was so beautiful.

46
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,960
I was so happy.

47
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,560
Little princess,

48
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,560
you found a prince to protect you.

49
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,960
I was so happy.

50
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,160
I felt so sorry.

51
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,160
Why did daddy hate you so much?

52
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,360
Why did he do that?

53
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,160
He didn't hate me.

54
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,960
He was afraid of me.

55
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,360
He was afraid that one day I would tell you the truth.

56
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,960
So,

57
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,560
he had to drive me away.

58
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,760
I remember that he didn't want me to get close to you.

59
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,760
What truth?

60
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,160
It's a long time ago.

61
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,360
Don't mention it.

62
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,560
Amber,

63
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
you just need to remember,

64
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,160
that daddy and mommy's story has nothing to do with you.

65
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,960
You were born

66
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,760
to save a marriage.

67
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,760
It's because of love.

68
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,960
What you heard outside

69
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,960
may not be true.

70
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,160
Can you tell me

71
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,160
what you meant by the 10 million?

72
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,360
I'm her husband.

73
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,760
I don't want to say anything.

74
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,560
Mommy,

75
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,560
I want to know what the 10 million means.

76
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,760
Please tell me.

77
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,560
Amber,

78
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,160
I think you know your dad better than anyone else.

79
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,960
He

80
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,760
always thinks that money can solve all problems.

81
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,760
The deeper he hurts you,

82
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,360
the more money he will make up for it.

83
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,160
At that time,

84
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,160
I just got pregnant with you.

85
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,760
I didn't think that he had another woman

86
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,160
outside.

87
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,760
He told me to get rid of the baby.

88
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,960
I firmly opposed it.

89
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,360
I always thought that

90
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,760
as soon as the baby is born,

91
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,160
everything will change.

92
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Maybe

93
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,360
he can't face me anymore.

94
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,760
Maybe

95
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,560
he will remember his mistakes when he sees me.

96
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,960
After you were born,

97
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,360
he became indifferent.

98
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,360
I felt so painful.

99
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,760
I felt like I was going to break down.

100
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,560
I felt like I was suffering.

101
00:06:52,560 --> 00:07:00,560
I couldn't stand the torture.

102
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,160
At that time,

103
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,360
you were so young.

104
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:13,960
You were so beautiful and cute.

105
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,760
When I saw you,

106
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,560
I smiled.

107
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,360
You smiled too.

108
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,360
I cried.

109
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,760
You cried too.

110
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,560
It was like

111
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:34,560
you could feel my pain.

112
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,160
You broke up with your father.

113
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,560
You tied him up.

114
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,760
It was a life-long torture.

115
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,760
You have to take the money.

116
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,960
Either I take you away from this family,

117
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,760
or

118
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,960
I will give you up.

119
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,360
I will never come back.

120
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,760
I was thinking,

121
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,560
I am a woman.

122
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
I have no money.

123
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,160
I am mentally unstable.

124
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,560
How can I keep you company?

125
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,160
How can I make you happy?

126
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,360
If God

127
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,560
has made my daughter

128
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,960
have a family without a child,

129
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,960
I will choose for her.

130
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,360
I want a family without a mother.

131
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,960
But do you know?

132
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,560
I really...

133
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,960
I really miss you.

134
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,560
I really don't want to leave you.

135
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,360
Really.

136
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,360
But...

137
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,560
But Daddy loves me too.

138
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,360
Silly.

139
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,160
Daddy loves you too.

140
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,560
The one you don't love is me.

141
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,760
Why is there no woman

142
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,160
around you?

143
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,960
How do you know?

144
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
For so many years,

145
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,960
there is no woman outside.

146
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,360
Boss, Gao has arranged for Amber and Kang to have lunch.

147
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,160
I am not a member. I can't go in.

148
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
But when I left,

149
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,360
I saw Gao Qi and Miss

150
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,560
holding hands.

151
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,360
It was very lively.

152
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,160
Ma Zhen is not only your dancing teacher.

153
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,560
Before you married me,

154
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,760
you were a couple of lovers.

155
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,760
Will you marry me

156
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,960
and treat it as a business?

157
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,160
In this age,

158
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,760
how many women

159
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,760
marry their own lovers?

160
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,760
I married you

161
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,760
to seize the opportunity to go abroad.

162
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,560
Then why did you have a child?

163
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,560
I want you to get rid of her and divorce me.

164
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
You don't agree.

165
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,160
Because I am not happy.

166
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,160
I don't want you to be happy either.

167
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,560
I just don't want to fulfill

168
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,760
your dream of becoming a coffee shop owner.

169
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,360
And I have one.

170
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,160
If I have a man,

171
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,560
I can share more money.

172
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,360
I didn't expect you to have a daughter.

173
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,160
Gao Qi,

174
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,760
I don't allow you to talk nonsense in front of my daughter.

175
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,160
Get out of here.

176
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,160
Leave the Chang family.

177
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
Get out.

178
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,760
I will sue you for theft.

179
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,560
Gao Qi, what are you doing?

180
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,760
I am taking Amber away.

181
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,960
No, you let her go.

182
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,560
Did you see?

183
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,160
She is a piece of meat in my belly.

184
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,760
She is with me.

185
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,960
She kisses me more.

186
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,160
If I am not here,

187
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,560
she will definitely cry all day.

188
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,760
But you?

189
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,360
I can find someone to replace you at any time.

190
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,960
I can even tell her

191
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,960
that Ma Zhen is her father.

192
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
I have been tested in the hospital.

193
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,960
Amber is my flesh and blood.

194
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,360
I will always be her father.

195
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,360
Don't think about it.

196
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,160
Then buy the love.

197
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,960
As long as you can afford it,

198
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,560
I will divorce you.

199
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,760
I will let you go forever.

200
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,160
Gao Qi.

201
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,760
You have already broken up.

202
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,360
What are you pretending?

203
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,760
Open the door and see the mountain.

204
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,360
Let's talk about the price.

205
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,760
I want you to pay for the slap you just gave me.

206
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,960
Okay, I will pay you.

207
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,560
How much do you want?

208
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,160
Ten million.

209
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
Impossible.

210
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,360
I don't have that much money.

211
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,360
There is a flow of money in business.

212
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,760
That is not my money.

213
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,960
I want to use it to break the law.

214
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,760
Use your brain.

215
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,160
It is not easy to use your brain in business.

216
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,760
That is true.

217
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,760
Is this baby so important to you?

218
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,960
Is it really so precious?

219
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,760
Amber.

220
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,560
Mommy will take you and Uncle Ma Zhen abroad, okay?

221
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,560
Okay?

222
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,560
Gao Qi.

223
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,560
You finally show your true colors.

224
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,160
You can hurt me.

225
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,960
But I don't allow you to hurt my daughter.

226
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,160
I will give you the money.

227
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,560
But when the money is over,

228
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,360
you will never have any relationship with this family and my daughter.

229
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,560
Mr. Ou, you are so generous.

230
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,360
As long as the money is in my account,

231
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,160
we will be free.

232
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,160
I will never come back.

233
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
Come in.

234
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Mr. Ou.

235
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,760
This is our studio.

236
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,760
The walls are our daily life photos.

237
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
Brother Ding.

238
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,160
Amber's father is so cool.

239
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,760
He is all alone.

240
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,960
If Amber quarrels with her father,

241
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,760
we will be in trouble.

242
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,160
You are so mean.

243
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,760
You should prepare your food.

244
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,360
Don't be sorry.

245
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,760
Jia Jia gave us this painting.

246
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,960
Amber often says

247
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,240
This cat represents him.

248
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,280
This is Ding Yi.

249
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
This one represents me.

250
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,160
This painting symbolizes our friendship.

251
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,880
Good.

252
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,880
You young people are very creative.

253
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,600
Thank you for bringing so many smiles to Amber.

254
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,480
Uncle Wu, I'll go to the kitchen and prepare dinner for you.

255
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,720
Let my brother watch it with you.

256
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,600
Okay.

257
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,120
Mr Wu, please have a look.

258
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,960
Okay.

259
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,320
I made all the dishes today.

260
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,600
Don't be surprised if they're not delicious.

261
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,160
No, no, no. They're very good.

262
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,400
Amber likes to eat these dishes.

263
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,760
You young people are really not simple.

264
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,840
I didn't expect Mr Wu to invite us to meet here.

265
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,320
I don't want to be too formal.

266
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,800
And I also want to know

267
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,120
the little world that makes Amber happy.

268
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,160
You young people are very kind.

269
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,840
Thank you for your kindness.

270
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,000
Thank you.

271
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
Thank you.

272
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Thank you.

273
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,240
Thank you.

274
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,760
You young people are really not simple.

275
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,360
You should know why I invited you here today.

276
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,600
Is it because of Amber's mother?

277
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
I know you had dinner together today.

278
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,680
Gao Qi took her shopping.

279
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,360
People should know each other.

280
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,960
It's inevitable to have time.

281
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,960
Besides, Gao Qi is Amber's mother.

282
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,760
Amber has never seen her since childhood.

283
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,560
It's inevitable to be curious.

284
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,600
Zirui, I don't care

285
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
what will happen to Amber and you.

286
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,240
But at least now you're the most trusted person.

287
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,360
At this critical moment,

288
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
I hope you can take good care of her,

289
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,360
treat her and protect her.

290
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,280
Don't let her get hurt, okay?

291
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,760
Mr Wu, don't worry. I understand.

292
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,560
Weiwei, Amber has a lot of friends.

293
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,760
She knows very well whether it's true or not.

294
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,760
And you're the most sincere person to Amber.

295
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,560
I hope you can help her.

296
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,680
After all, Amber has not experienced much

297
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,160
and you haven't grown up.

298
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,360
I understand.

299
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,960
You two brothers have no parents since childhood.

300
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,160
You must know better about Amber's loss of her mother.

301
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,360
It's a pity that I gave Amber a life,

302
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,360
but I couldn't give her a complete family.

303
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,760
Mr Wu, Amber has not received her mother's love,

304
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,960
but you're by her side.

305
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,960
She has double the love.

306
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,760
I've always wanted to have Gao Qi.

307
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,760
I can't hide my effort.

308
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,760
Let me make an analogy.

309
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,960
You want a man to love you.

310
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,760
You want a man to love you.

311
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,160
But one day another man will give you ten times more love.

312
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,760
You can't make up for it, right?

313
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,560
Mr Wu, what do you think will happen?

314
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,160
Gao Qi will never do something unreasonable.

315
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,960
There's nothing more important than money in her heart.

316
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:12,360
I'm afraid Amber will hurt her again.

317
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,360
Don't worry, Mr Wu. I'll take care of her.

318
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:25,960
But Gao Qi told Amber about your divorce.

319
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:32,760
She said you forced her to give up Amber.

320
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,360
Everyone starts with their own loyalty when they tell their own story.

321
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,960
So, of course, you're wronged by others.

322
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,560
As long as Amber believes in that version,

323
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,560
that version is the truth of the story.

324
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,160
As long as Gao Qi doesn't hurt Amber again,

325
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,360
I can't tell her who's right and who's wrong.

326
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,960
It doesn't matter.

327
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,760
Mr Wu, cheers.

328
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,960
Mr Wu, I have a question.

329
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,360
Do you still love Amber?

330
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,960
If possible, will you get back together with her?

331
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,360
I really don't know.

332
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,560
Great! My mom is finally not around.

333
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,560
I can finally go out and have a look.

334
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,960
My mom let her go.

335
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,160
I'll tell you, you have to report to me wherever you go.

336
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Mom, Mr Wu is going to the factory today.

337
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,360
Please invite Kang Zi and Wei Wei to dinner.

338
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
Meng Jian.

339
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
Hello.

340
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,360
I don't know how to address you.

341
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,160
Do you call me Mrs Han or Mrs Hua?

342
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,760
My two sons' father has nothing to do with me now.

343
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,760
Call me Meng Jian.

344
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
Okay.

345
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,960
Mr Wu, sit down.

346
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
Meng Jian, sit down.

347
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,160
Mr Wu, I'm sorry for offending you.

348
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,160
It's okay.

349
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,160
It's okay.

350
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,760
Don't forget the past.

351
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
It's better to forget.

352
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,160
I have something to do.

353
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,160
This 10,000 yuan is for dinner tonight.

354
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
Thank you.

355
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,960
Mr Wu, don't mention it.

356
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,760
This is a little encouragement for young people.

357
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,560
Thank you for coming.

358
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,560
Okay, goodbye.

359
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,360
I'll see you out.

360
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,160
No, no, no.

361
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,160
Goodbye.

362
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,160
Take care, Mr Wu.

363
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,360
CEOs!

364
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,560
I'm sorry, thank you minus 100.

365
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,560
Yes, yes, excellent.

366
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,360
Goodbye.

367
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,160
Goodbye.

368
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,160
I'll go get some wine.

369
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,160
I know you asked me out tonight to talk business.

370
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,160
I'm afraid I'll be impulsive and say something wrong.

371
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,160
So I came earlier to calm down.

372
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
I didn't expect to drink too much.

373
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
You don't mind, do you?

374
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,160
You're always better than me.

375
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,160
But I hope you'll drink less tonight.

376
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,160
Thank you for caring about me.

377
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,160
I'm afraid you'll get married after you drink too much.

378
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,160
You didn't hear my conditions.

379
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,160
The drunkard knows the wine.

380
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,160
The lover knows the weight.

381
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,160
This wine is nothing.

382
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,160
That's good.

383
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,160
Come on, let's have a fight.

384
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,160
Yuting, do you really hate me so much?

385
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,160
I saw Amber this morning.

386
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,160
I went shopping with her.

387
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,160
Do you know? I'm so jealous of you.

388
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,160
Every time we see a good-looking man,

389
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,160
he says,

390
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,160
if my father wears it, it will be very good-looking.

391
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,160
I just realized that in my daughter's heart,

392
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,160
you're so deep.

393
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,160
Why should I talk to you about conditions?

394
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,160
I can't take this daughter away.

395
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
No.

396
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,160
You can't break the relationship without money.

397
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
You want to get married,

398
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,160
and want me to leave Shanghai immediately.

399
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,160
And someone wants to get married and let me stay in Shanghai.

400
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,160
Do you want to compare me with Ying Youjing?

401
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,160
I'm sorry.

402
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,160
I'm not interested in fighting with her.

403
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,160
She's too far from you.

404
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,160
She's not of the same level.

405
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Okay, let's get down to business.

406
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,160
Tell me, how much do you want?

407
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,160
You can fool others, but you can't fool me.

408
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
You can't fool yourself either.

409
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,160
In your heart, you never let me go.

410
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,160
You still have a chance to make me come back.

411
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
Right?

412
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,160
Gao Jie,

413
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,160
you're too confident.

414
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,160
Then why don't you find a mother for Amber?

415
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,160
That's because I don't want other women to hurt her.

416
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,160
I won't trust any woman in my life.

417
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,160
Just for me?

418
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,160
You've given up all women.

419
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,160
Then I should feel honored.

420
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,160
I was once fooled by a woman.

421
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,160
I won't let this woman fool me again.

422
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,160
Please give me a price.

423
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,160
Just like back then,

424
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,160
as long as you're willing to leave Shanghai,

425
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,160
I'll give you as much money as you want.

426
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,160
I came back to Shanghai not to leave,

427
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,160
but to get money.

428
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
All these years,

429
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,160
I've been wandering outside alone.

430
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,160
I was always surprised to think of you.

431
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,160
I thought of our past.

432
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,160
Every time I think of you and Amber,

433
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,160
I feel so painful.

434
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,160
It really hurts.

435
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,160
I feel so guilty for you, Amber,

436
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,160
and this family.

437
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,160
This feeling of guilt

438
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,160
is that no matter how much money I make,

439
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,160
I'm afraid that I'll lose you.

440
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,160
No matter how much I make,

441
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,160
I can't make up for it.

442
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,160
Do you understand?

443
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,160
Enough.

444
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,160
Don't act in front of me.

445
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,160
How much money do you want?

446
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,160
Do you think...

447
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,160
Do you think I came to Ying Liu Jin

448
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,160
because of his money?

449
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
It's not like that.

450
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
It's because of me.

451
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,160
I really want to stay here and see you.

452
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,160
I know I lied to you before.

453
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,160
You must hate me.

454
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,160
So,

455
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,160
I came to Ying Liu Jin

456
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,160
to help you with the money.

457
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,160
I really want you to forgive me.

458
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,160
Because of you,

459
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,160
I have my favorite daughter,

460
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,160
and the man I can't let go of.

461
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,160
Okay.

462
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,160
It's getting late.

463
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,160
Let's talk about this business another day.

464
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,160
Go back and rest.

465
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,160
Let's go.

466
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,160
If I have to rely on other men,

467
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
I can stay in Shanghai.

468
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
And the man I love

469
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,160
and my daughter Meng Xiu,

470
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,160
I really want to die right away.

471
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,160
Because I know myself

472
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,160
is the one who hurt you the most.

473
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,160
Brother Jing Yi.

474
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,160
Today, one table costs so much money.

475
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,160
I think we can do this kind of business every day.

476
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,160
Calm down.

477
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,160
It's impossible to do this every day.

478
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,160
How is the order going tomorrow?

479
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
It's all ready.

480
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,160
We have fifteen people's dinner.

481
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,160
And each meal is with a little bit of love.

482
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,160
Oh, and there is one most special thing.

483
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
Amber's father gave it to Amber.

484
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,160
It's all your idea?

485
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
Everyone wants to break this rule.

486
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,160
You should find a suitable excuse for them.

487
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,160
Wei Wei, you are so thoughtful.

488
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,160
You always think for others.

489
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,160
Aren't you the same?

490
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,160
Are you ready?

491
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
I can't stand it.

492
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
It hurts.

493
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,160
What happened to your hand?

494
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,160
It's nothing serious.

495
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
Don't move.

496
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,160
It hurts.

497
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
It hurts here?

498
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,160
Here is the bone.

499
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
Here?

500
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
It seems better.

501
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,160
What are you thinking?

502
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,160
I am thinking

503
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,160
what to write on the card that Wu Yuting gave Amber.

504
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,160
I am so grateful to you.

505
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,160
It seems appropriate.

506
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,160
It's not what Wu Yuting told Amber.

507
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,160
It's not.

508
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
It's not.

509
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,160
Wu Yuting told Amber.

510
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,160
It's what I, Han Dingyi, told you.

511
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
Follow the car.

512
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
Drive.

513
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
You are so beautiful today.

514
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,160
The bank we are going to meet today

515
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,160
is interested in our project.

516
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
I see.

517
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,160
I see.

518
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,160
I see.

519
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,160
I see.

520
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,160
I see.

521
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,160
I see.

522
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,160
I see.

523
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
Thank you.

524
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,160
It's very hard for me to say anything.

525
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,160
You are welcome.

526
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,160
I am a very good person.

527
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,160
I have done all the work for you.

528
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,160
I have expressed your identity, background and investment products to her.

529
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,160
She is very interested in it.

530
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
How many chances do I get?

531
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,160
No one in the world can reject you.

532
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,160
I'm not worried about being rejected.

533
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,160
Some feelings are more painful than rejection.

534
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,160
What's wrong, darling?

535
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
What is it? Tell me.

536
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
Don't ask.

537
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
I'll handle some things alone.

538
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,160
I don't want to burden you.

539
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
No, darling.

540
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,160
Your business is my business.

541
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,160
Please tell me.

542
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,160
I don't mean I don't want to tell you.

543
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
It's just...

544
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,160
Oh, I see.

545
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,160
It's just that you don't trust me enough.

546
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,160
It means I'm not good enough for you.

547
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,160
No.

548
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,160
I think you're good enough for me.

549
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,160
The more you treat me well,

550
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,160
the more I feel guilty.

551
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,160
I always feel...

552
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,160
I always feel I owe you.

553
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,160
Do you understand?

554
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,160
Don't, don't, don't.

555
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,160
Don't cry.

556
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,160
Please don't do this.

557
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,160
I'm really sad.

558
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,160
You know.

559
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,160
Youjin, you're a good person.

560
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,160
But some people are different from you.

561
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,160
He keeps pushing me.

562
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
I really don't know what to do.

563
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,160
Wu Yuting?

564
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,160
He uses women to force me to fight.

565
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,160
He even threatens me.

566
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,160
If I choose a woman instead of him,

567
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,160
he'll hurt my father.

568
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,160
One is you.

569
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,160
One is father.

570
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,160
This is too difficult for me.

571
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,160
This is a despicable act.

572
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,160
Don't worry.

573
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,160
I'll deal with him.

574
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
Don't worry.

575
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,160
But in order to control you,

576
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,160
he followed me 24 hours a day.

577
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,160
For example, now.

578
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,160
Now?

579
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,160
How ridiculous.

580
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
Stop the car.

581
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,160
Stop the car.

582
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,160
Wu, we're friends.

583
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,160
Look what you did.

584
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,160
Your friend did it to follow us.

585
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,160
You're a big scoundrel.

586
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,160
If people find out,

587
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,160
they'll laugh at us.

588
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
Wu,

589
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
you're happy

590
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,160
because we're jealous of you?

591
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,160
I'm just a woman who came back from abroad

592
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,160
and has no relationship with anyone.

593
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
I hope that

594
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,160
more powerful people will treat me well.

595
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,160
I don't want to hurt anyone.

596
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,160
Ying,

597
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,160
we're so close.

598
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,160
You're yelling.

599
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,160
I don't want to laugh.

600
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,160
Wu,

601
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,160
we used to be close.

602
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
Now we're not.

603
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,160
You're divorced.

604
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,160
What are you going to do?

605
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,160
Chai,

606
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,160
we just started dating.

607
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,160
Tell me,

608
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,160
what do you want?

609
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,160
I want to start over with Gao Qi.

610
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,160
What do you mean?

611
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,160
Okay,

612
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,160
we're just getting along.

613
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,160
How about this?

614
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,160
We're men.

615
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,160
Let's make it simple.

616
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,160
First, don't hurt him.

617
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,160
Second, don't hurt Ying Zhou.

618
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,160
I dare, do you dare?

619
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,160
Get in the car.

620
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,160
I'll take you back to the hotel.

621
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,160
Check.

622
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,160
No.

623
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,160
We agreed to go to the bank to talk to him.

624
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,160
We have to hurry.

625
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,160
Okay, okay, okay.

626
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,160
You're a couple after all.

627
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,160
I know.

628
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,160
I won't make it difficult for you.

629
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,160
But I just want to let people know

630
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,160
how much I love you.

631
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,160
I mean it.

632
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,160
But I won't put pressure on you.

633
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,160
Okay?

634
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,160
You choose.

635
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,160
Sorry.

636
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,160
I can't make a decision now.

637
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,160
Wait for me.

638
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,160
You go back first.

639
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,160
I'll help you make an appointment another day.

640
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,160
Okay?

641
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,160
No need.

642
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
You drive, I'll follow you.

643
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,160
Okay.

644
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,160
Let's go, sir.

645
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,160
Okay.

646
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,160
This is the house we both live in.

647
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,160
Is it useful for me to go alone?

648
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,160
You said you would come with me.

649
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,160
Your sister doesn't live with us.

650
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,160
Is it useful for her first house?

651
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,160
You're good.

652
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,160
You check the house first.

653
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,160
When I have time,

654
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,160
we'll buy furniture together, okay?

655
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
Okay.

656
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,160
When you have time,

657
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
let's come together.

658
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
Listen.

659
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
Don't you always want

660
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,160
to have our own house?

661
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,160
You decide, okay?

662
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,160
You like it, I like it.

663
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,160
Come on.

664
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,160
Okay.

665
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,160
Bye-bye.

666
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,160
Bye-bye.

667
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,160
I told you

668
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,160
I wouldn't come to you.

669
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,160
Don't come to me.

670
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,160
You follow me every day.

671
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,160
Don't you have to work?

672
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,160
The boss asked me to wait for you.

673
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,160
He ordered me to

674
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,160
leave other jobs first.

675
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,160
I have to pay for the car.

676
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,160
Then I'll see

677
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,160
if I need to take

678
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,160
useful things and clothes for you.

679
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,160
What do I need to take?

680
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,160
Do I need you to take it?

681
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,160
Don't you want to walk into my room?

682
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,160
If I need something,

683
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,160
I'll ask Ouyang Qiao to take it.

684
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,160
Did Qiao tell you

685
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
that Kang Zirui found me

686
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
in the FIA?

687
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,160
Yes.

688
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,160
I knew you were following him

689
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,160
for the police.

690
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,160
You like to follow people.

691
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,160
He's not following you.

692
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,160
He's worried

693
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,160
that you're not used to

694
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
living alone.

695
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
Go back and tell him.

696
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,160
I never lack people.

697
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,160
I just gave myself a holiday.

698
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,160
I'm not not going back.

699
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,160
I won't go back as long as he's here.

700
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,160
If he's not here,

701
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,160
I'll think about it.

702
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,160
Contact Weiwei

703
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,160
and ask if she's on her way.

704
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,160
Hello, Miss Kang.

705
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,160
I'm Victor.

706
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
Amber asked if you're on your way.

707
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,160
Why do you have Weiwei's WeChat?

708
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,160
And Yingdong.

709
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
You're a fan of his?

710
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,160
You're a fan of his?

711
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,160
He's a fan of Yihua and Xin...

712
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,160
Oh my god.

713
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,160
You're a fan of his?

714
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,160
You're a fan of his?

715
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,160
You're a fan of his?

716
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,160
You're a fan of his?

717
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,160
You're a fan of his?

718
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,160
I'm just worried

719
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,160
that I can't contact them

720
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,160
when I can't find you.

721
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,160
Kang An said

722
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,160
that she's busy with the store.

723
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,160
She's going to look for you.

724
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,160
So,

725
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,160
should we take my car

726
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,160
or drive our own car?

727
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,160
How can we play games when we drive our own car?

728
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,160
What are you doing here?

729
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,160
What do you think of this house?

730
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,160
I think this house

731
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,160
is quite nice.

732
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,160
It's like a painting.

733
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,160
Okay.

734
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,160
From a man's point of view,

735
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,160
do you think this house

736
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,160
has no sense of home?

737
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,160
After you finish your work every day,

738
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,160
do you want to come back home

739
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,160
in a hurry?

740
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
I think this house...

741
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,160
Forget it.

742
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,160
I can see that you like this house very much.

743
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,160
What you like is what I want.

744
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
Are you really going to

745
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,160
go down with Kang Zui Zhi?

746
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,160
Do you know how I'm going to

747
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,160
deal with your relationship?

748
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,160
Does this have anything to do with you?

749
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,160
When do I have to report

750
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,160
to you every time?

751
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,160
If you don't report now,

752
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,160
you'll have to report this one day.

753
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,160
You're not here to

754
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,160
look at the house with me, right?

755
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,160
You've ruined my good mood.

756
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,160
I'm not here to look at the house with you.

757
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,160
I'm here to look at the house with you.

758
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,160
I have to go.

759
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,160
We have to look at three more houses.

760
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,160
I'll look at them.

761
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160
They're all houses my daddy found.

762
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,160
But if you

763
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,160
look for houses in other places,

764
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
those people will still

765
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
give you respect.

766
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,160
Then I'll just use your name

767
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,160
to buy it.

768
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,160
I don't want to get in the way.

769
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,160
What are you talking about?

770
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,160
Whose light do you want?

771
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,160
Of course, your light.

772
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,160
Without you,

773
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,920
Sister-in-law, it's so strange.

774
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,920
Wei Lai, Xiao Gu,

775
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,480
this house is really beautiful.

776
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,960
Your brother can tell his movie

777
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,080
to the beautiful scenery here.

778
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,240
I'll cook delicious food for him in the kitchen.

779
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,680
You don't feel pain today?

780
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,240
Do I?

781
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,040
Don't talk about me.

782
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,000
Talk about you.

783
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,320
Are you really going to live here?

784
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,440
Does your father know?

785
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,080
I feel like I'm in the underground.

786
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,760
If I drop a feather

787
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,760
or a leaf on my head,

788
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,560
my father will know it immediately.

789
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,480
You can't blame him.

790
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,960
Even if he's not here,

791
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,320
your father will care about you in another way.

792
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,840
How happy it is!

793
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,400
Your parents are all for you.

794
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,880
We all think you're a celebrity.

795
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,120
You're not satisfied.

796
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,960
Did your father buy you?

797
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,120
Of course, he did.

798
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,160
Your father is an excellent father.

799
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,000
We all see it.

800
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,320
If you like my father so much,

801
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,120
you should be his goddaughter.

802
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,240
Then I can't be your future Xiao Gu.

803
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,280
Right.

804
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,440
What should I do?

805
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,480
Forget it. Don't worry about it.

806
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,960
Let's take it slow.

807
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,160
Give me the bag.

808
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,720
Are you going to take my car?

809
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,240
No.

810
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,840
I'll be a motorcycle.

811
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,200
I'll take care of the door.

812
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,360
Don't follow me.

813
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,720
I love you, Xiao Mei!

814
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,360
I love Tao Mei!

815
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,200
I love Tao Zi Wei!

816
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,880
I love you too!

817
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,280
Xiao Ji, it's An Ben.

818
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,920
Jing Yi.

819
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,200
An Ben is here.

820
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,840
Hi, Brother Jing Yi.

821
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Hi, An Ben.

822
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,480
How are you?

823
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,080
I'm so jealous of you.

824
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,560
I'm so jealous of you.

825
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,880
We Love is like a couple restaurant now.

826
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,520
Really?

827
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,440
Don't talk nonsense.

828
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,240
Why are you blushing?

829
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,240
Brother Jing Yi, Wei Wei is blushing.

830
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,920
Is there a problem with your relationship?

831
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,680
I've changed a lot in the past few days.

832
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,600
Go��

833
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,920
Go��

834
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,240

835
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,680
Go발

Go˚

837
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,560
In one sentence

838
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,400
Don't say anything

839
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,320
You will not hesitate

840
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,880
To reach for

841
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:42,280
You are my wind, you are my rain

842
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:48,880
You taught me to stop, to move forward

843
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:55,880
I've been hurt, I've been hurt, but I still have a grudge

844
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:02,880
I want you to stay with me, to cry and drink with me

845
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,880
Let's shout together, let's keep our mouth shut

846
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,880
Let's walk on the street drunk

847
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:22,880
We'll go to the end, there's no need for any reason

848
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,880
Let's try to get through it together, that's the hardest part

849
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:35,880
We'll go to the end, there's no need for any reason

850
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:42,880
When we need each other the most, we can stand still and stand by each other

851
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:49,880
Let's try to get through it together, that's the hardest part
