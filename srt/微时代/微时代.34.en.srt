1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,120
You were able to pay your debts for three days

2
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,120
Is that your meal?

3
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,320
That was for my best friend and best friend

4
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
I think you are so weird

5
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,800
Why you've always been so nice to others

6
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,240
Since I was a child, I lost my parents

7
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,160
There are no family tennis players left

8
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,120
Then I ended up living on the yacht

9
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,120
I lost my parents when I was a child.

10
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,120
My brother and I were left alone.

11
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,120
Then my brother went abroad because of work.

12
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,120
I was always at the Wan family's house.

13
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,120
They have a small restaurant.

14
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,120
I would go there to help when I was free.

15
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,120
I liked cooking at that time.

16
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,120
Wan family and I are like real sisters.

17
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,120
So I will help her.

18
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,120
So you gave her the one you liked.

19
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,120
I was asked to investigate.

20
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,120
Before Yingdong family was killed, Wan family was her girlfriend.

21
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,120
And you were with Han Dingyi.

22
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,120
Who told you to investigate me?

23
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,120
Besides, it's all in the past.

24
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,120
Han Dingyi and I are just friends now.

25
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,120
Is that so?

26
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,120
Why does she care about you so much?

27
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,120
She called you in the middle of the night.

28
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,120
400,000 yuan a year.

29
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,120
But you are working for the rent.

30
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,120
Is there a good solution?

31
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,120
A man has to do his job.

32
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,120
We met a problem.

33
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,120
Our flower shop is in the right place.

34
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
We have to order every month.

35
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,120
We have many acquaintances in our restaurant.

36
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,120
But Wan family told me that Weiwei decided not to help you.

37
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,120
She told me.

38
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,120
But it didn't happen.

39
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,120
I didn't take it seriously.

40
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,120
After all, our flower shop has paid us a lot of money.

41
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,120
Dad.

42
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,120
What's wrong?

43
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,120
Guess what this is.

44
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,120
What is it?

45
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,120
What is it?

46
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,120
Jiajia, don't be so hard on yourself.

47
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,120
This is the invitation letter from New York University of Arts.

48
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,120
New York?

49
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,120
Is it for you?

50
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,120
Mom, do you have a second daughter named Wanjia?

51
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,120
I finally received this invitation letter.

52
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
I have a dream.

53
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
I'll go to the market later.

54
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,120
Let's go home tonight and celebrate for my daughter.

55
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,120
Celebrate what?

56
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,120
This is what Yingdong did for her.

57
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,120
Besides, she went to America to study.

58
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,120
How much does it cost?

59
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,120
School fees, living expenses.

60
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
My daughter is far away from home.

61
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,120
I'm worried about her.

62
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,120
Dad.

63
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
So you mean,

64
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,120
without Yingdong, my life will be over, right?

65
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,120
I can work there.

66
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,120
I can work in several jobs.

67
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,120
Work?

68
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
What kind of work?

69
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,120
In a girl's home?

70
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
Didn't you watch TV?

71
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
It's said on TV that

72
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,120
students can go to the park during the holidays to hear people's voices.

73
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,120
I can do that too.

74
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,120
It sounds not reliable.

75
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,120
It's not reliable.

76
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,120
Everyone will be worried about you.

77
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,120
I know you're worried about me.

78
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,120
So I thought about it.

79
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,120
Yes.

80
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,120
I really want to go to America.

81
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,120
I want to go there to see the market.

82
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,120
I want to study there.

83
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Dingyi.

84
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,120
Come with me to America, okay?

85
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,120
Me?

86
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,120
You want me to take

87
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,120
a tourist visa?

88
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,120
You have to take the first step.

89
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,120
You have to take the first step first.

90
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,120
Then there will be a second step.

91
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,120
I've thought about it.

92
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,120
Amber has so much business in America.

93
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,120
We can go to ask her.

94
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,120
See if she can find you a job.

95
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,120
Then you can stay there.

96
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,120
I don't want to rely on anyone.

97
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,120
What if I go to America, what about my mom?

98
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,120
There are ways out.

99
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,120
I don't even know

100
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,120
how to get this flower shop.

101
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,120
At worst, just close it.

102
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,120
So that you don't have to

103
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,120
have to work so hard every day.

104
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,120
You didn't put your heart into it.

105
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,120
Of course it's easy for you to say.

106
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,120
Jiajia.

107
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,120
Before you decide to do something,

108
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,120
you have to think about a way out.

109
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,120
This is not a game.

110
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,120
You don't just buy a ticket and go on a trip.

111
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,120
Don't be so brave.

112
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,120
I know.

113
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,120
I want to go to America.

114
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,120
But I want to go with my brother.

115
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,120
If he doesn't go,

116
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,120
I won't go either.

117
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,120
Are you satisfied?

118
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,120
If you really can't rest assured,

119
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,120
his father and I will take care of it.

120
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,120
No matter how good the business is,

121
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,120
at least it won't close down.

122
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,120
When you come back in the fall,

123
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,120
you can still take over the restaurant.

124
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,120
This is a change of Liu Anhua.

125
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,120
Jiajia.

126
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,120
Hello.

127
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,120
I'm in a good mood today.

128
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,120
Let's go to the restaurant for dinner tonight.

129
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,120
Sister.

130
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,120
I can't tonight.

131
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,120
I have an appointment with a friend tonight.

132
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,120
I told Ou Hui before.

133
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,120
I'm not going.

134
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,120
Don't think.

135
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,120
How can you make my sister unhappy for your friend?

136
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,120
But I can't break up with all my friends.

137
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,120
Hui, call all her friends.

138
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Tonight they have a party.

139
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,120
It's booked at our foreign exchange.

140
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,120
I'll pay for everything.

141
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,120
I know, sister.

142
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,120
I'll let Yingdong handle it.

143
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,120
But...

144
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,120
But...

145
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,120
My head hurts.

146
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,120
I'll get you some medicine.

147
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,120
What's wrong, sister?

148
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,120
Can you stop making my sister angry?

149
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,120
Sister, are you okay?

150
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,120
I'm sorry.

151
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,120
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,120
I told you I was going to America.

153
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,120
Did I make you unhappy?

154
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,120
Is it so hard to make a decision?

155
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,120
Tingyi, if you don't want to go,

156
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,120
you can tell me directly.

157
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,120
Do we need to be silent?

158
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,120
Wanjia, don't think too much.

159
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,120
I'm just very confused.

160
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,120
I don't know what to do.

161
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,120
To be honest, I'm worried about Vila.

162
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,120
Everything I have here is a burden.

163
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,120
I don't want to give it to anyone.

164
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,120
Then I'll lose everything.

165
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,120
But...

166
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,120
I really can't trust you.

167
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,120
I don't want to lie to you.

168
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,120
I really don't know what to do.

169
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,120
I'm sorry.

170
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,120
I was wrong.

171
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,120
I was wrong about you.

172
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,120
Actually,

173
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,120
I don't want to leave Vila.

174
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,120
But going to America

175
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,120
is really my dream.

176
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
What should I do?

177
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,120
I'm so confused.

178
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,120
Okay.

179
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,120
Thank you.

180
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,120
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Did you call your friends?

182
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
They are on their way. They should be here soon.

183
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,120
Did you forget to take the medicine?

184
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,120
You guys sit down.

185
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,120
I'll go downstairs and get the medicine for her.

186
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,120
I'll be back soon.

187
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,120
I'll be back soon.

188
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
Can I change my clothes today?

189
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
It's pretty.

190
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,120
Really?

191
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
I'm back.

192
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,120
Oh my god.

193
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,120
You look so beautiful today.

194
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,120
You look so beautiful in a dress.

195
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,120
I'll go downstairs and get the medicine for her.

196
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
You guys sit down.

197
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
I'll be back soon.

198
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
Okay.

199
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
Hurry up.

200
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Let's go.

201
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
Cheers.

202
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
Cheers.

203
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Cheers.

204
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Great.

205
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,120
Everyone is great.

206
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
The boys are handsome.

207
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,120
The girls are beautiful.

208
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,120
You're young.

209
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,120
If I'm not wrong, you're Hua Youxi.

210
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,120
Did Pei Pei mention me to you?

211
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
Of course.

212
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
You have a brother.

213
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,120
And a small restaurant.

214
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,120
Okay, let's eat.

215
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,120
Who is that girl?

216
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
She's my best friend, Wan Jia.

217
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
Jiajia.

218
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Juanjie is talking to you.

219
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
Hello, Juanjie.

220
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
You're beautiful.

221
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,120
Thank you.

222
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,120
Who is that guy?

223
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
He's Han Dingyi.

224
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
He's the owner of the restaurant.

225
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
He's Wan Jia's boyfriend.

226
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,120
Oh, they're so cute.

227
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
They're a good match.

228
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,120
Yes, I didn't think so before.

229
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,120
But since Weiwei gave the flower shop to Wan Jia,

230
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,120
I think they're a good match.

231
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,120
Yes, they are.

232
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Weiwei, pour me a glass of wine.

233
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,120
But the doctor said you can't drink.

234
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,120
And we already drank yesterday.

235
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,120
You said it was yesterday, too, right?

236
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
Besides, I rarely come out for dinner.

237
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,120
Why is it so crowded today?

238
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,120
Waiter, pour me a glass of wine.

239
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,120
Have some more.

240
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
How's Mr. Hu's health recently?

241
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,120
Not bad.

242
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
Weiwei is very good at taking care of people.

243
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
Of course.

244
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,120
Come on.

245
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,120
I wish all the people in the world who love each other can be together.

246
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,120
Heart to heart, health to health.

247
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,120
Cheers.

248
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,120
Cheers.

249
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
Cheers.

250
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,120
Heart to heart, health to health.

251
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,120
Thank you for coming to eat with me and your friends.

252
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,120
You're welcome.

253
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,120
Director Kang, you're Weiwei's brother.

254
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,120
I have to tell you something.

255
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,120
I've liked Weiwei since the first time I met her.

256
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,120
I hope she can stay with me and be my family.

257
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,120
And even my sister.

258
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
I will do whatever she says.

259
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,120
We had a good dinner.

260
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,120
Thank you.

261
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
You're welcome.

262
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,120
Our treat.

263
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,120
Weiwei's friends are very good.

264
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,120
You can chat with them.

265
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,120
I will.

266
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,120
I will.

267
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,120
I hope everyone can find another chance to go.

268
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,120
Okay.

269
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,120
Wei Wei, you don't have to send me back.

270
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,120
You can chat with everyone here.

271
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,120
But...

272
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,120
No buts.

273
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
Look, there's Xiaohui.

274
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
Don't worry.

275
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
Then you go back and be careful.

276
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Yes.

277
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
Jun, take care.

278
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,120
Goodbye.

279
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
Goodbye.

280
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
Bye-bye.

281
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
Bye-bye.

282
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
Bye-bye.

283
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
Bye-bye.

284
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,120
Xiaohui,

285
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
when we were eating, you said we were siblings.

286
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
I won't take her as my girlfriend.

287
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,120
You'd better not say it out loud.

288
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
If you really want to marry her,

289
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,120
you won't be able to do it.

290
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,120
Xiaohui, since you want to keep Wei Wei by your side,

291
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,120
why do you want to keep her and Han Dingyi?

292
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,120
I want to give Wei Wei a chance to give up.

293
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,120
Look at Han Dingyi, he's so weak.

294
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,120
How can he face such a relationship?

295
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,120
A woman faces a man who doesn't know how to be true.

296
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,120
How can she let her own life continue?

297
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,120
Do you have any activities?

298
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,120
Anm's feet are not very convenient.

299
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,120
I'll send her back first.

300
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,120
Can I go with you?

301
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,120
Then let Wei Wei go with my brother and Wanjia's car.

302
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,120
Isn't it inconvenient to resist Anm's feet?

303
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,120
How about letting her go in Dingyi's car?

304
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,120
Okay.

305
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
Then we'll go first.

306
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,120
Bye.

307
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,120
Bye.

308
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,120
Bye.

309
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,120
Bye.

310
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,120
Wanjia, come on, help me.

311
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,120
My feet are not yet healed.

312
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,120
Wei Wei won't mind.

313
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,120
I'll go and grab her brother.

314
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,120
Didn't you see that we were wearing high heels?

315
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,120
If you pull me down again,

316
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,120
we'll become disabled.

317
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,120
Brother, I'm not as stupid as you say.

318
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,120
You're so white-faced.

319
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,120
You need some time to get used to it.

320
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,120
Brother.

321
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,120
Brother.

322
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,120
Why didn't Mei Bao come tonight?

323
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,120
I sent her a message.

324
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,120
She said she was not feeling well today, so she didn't come.

325
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,120
Brother, I'll take you home first.

326
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
No need.

327
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,120
Wanjia, send me.

328
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
I have something for her.

329
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,120
I have a few words to tell you.

330
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
Me?

331
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Are you afraid?

332
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,120
What am I afraid of?

333
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
Let me help you in.

334
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
If you're not afraid, then go.

335
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,120
Dingyi, you talk to Wei Wei for a while.

336
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,120
It's so nice to have a beauty to help me go home.

337
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,120
Are you not used to me now?

338
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,120
I like you from before.

339
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,120
Don't like me.

340
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,120
Whether it's from before,

341
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,120
now,

342
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,120
or for the sake of it,

343
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,120
it has nothing to do with you.

344
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
Okay.

345
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,120
You're home.

346
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
I'm not going in.

347
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,120
If you have anything to say,

348
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,120
just say it here.

349
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,120
Go in and have a drink.

350
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,120
Take your time.

351
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,120
No need.

352
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,120
Dingyi is waiting for me outside.

353
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,120
Maybe he wants you to stay longer.

354
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,120
So that they can talk for a while.

355
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

356
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,120
You...

357
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,120
Aren't you worried that Wei Wei will take away Han Dingyi?

358
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,120
Zirui, you're so boring.

359
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,120
Wei Wei is your sister.

360
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,120
She's also my best friend.

361
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,120
You should know better than I do

362
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,120
what kind of personality she is.

363
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,120
Really?

364
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,120
Aren't you curious

365
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,120
and don't want to know what they're talking about?

366
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,120
Wei Wei is more feminine.

367
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,120
Even if she doesn't want to do anything,

368
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,120
it doesn't mean that Han Dingyi won't move.

369
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Wei Wei,

370
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,120
why are you so sad?

371
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
Why do I feel that

372
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,120
we've lost so much?

373
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,120
Nothing.

374
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,120
My brother is not here.

375
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,120
I changed my mind

376
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,120
to keep Vila.

377
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,120
I've already prepared

378
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,120
the rent for the night club.

379
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
Tomorrow morning,

380
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
I'll give you the Internet club.

381
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,120
If I give up on Vila,

382
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
can you leave me?

383
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,120
I can't.

384
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,120
But I want to see him for three months.

385
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
Three months?

386
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,120
It's too long.

387
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,120
He'll fall in love with you.

388
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,120
I think he's already in love with you.

389
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
Do you have

390
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
a boyfriend?

391
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
What are you talking about?

392
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
We're talking about...

393
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,120
We're talking about Vila's marriage.

394
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,120
I've prepared the rent for the night club.

395
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
I'll give it to you tomorrow morning.

396
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
Really?

397
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,120
Wei Wei,

398
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,120
that's great.

399
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
I don't know what to say.

400
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,120
But

401
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,120
I'm not sure

402
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,120
if I can tell you.

403
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,120
Ding Yi,

404
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,120
didn't you tell Wei Wei?

405
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
I'm going to the US.

406
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
Ding Yi will probably go with me.

407
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
So, the restaurant

408
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,120
should be managed by my parents.

409
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
It doesn't matter who manages it.

410
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
Everything I do

411
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,120
is just to keep Vila

412
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
and our family's life.

413
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
Not for anyone.

414
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,120
I'll give it to you tomorrow morning.

415
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
Okay, I'll go.

416
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
Okay, see you tomorrow.

417
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
Bye!

418
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
Bye!

419
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,120
Bye!

420
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
Bye!

421
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,120
Bye!

422
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
Bye!

423
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,120
Bye!

424
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
Bye!

425
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
Bye!

426
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
Bye!

427
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,120
Bye!

428
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
It's not painful.

429
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
Get well soon.

430
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,120
Meng, if you have a stomachache, drink some porridge first.

431
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,520
Ding Yi asked you to buy some medicine.

432
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,120
He should be on his way back.

433
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,520
If I don't pretend to have a stomachache,

434
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,120
how can I see you so beautiful,

435
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,120
so beautiful and beautiful?

436
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,120
Actually, when I called Ding Yi from Youxi,

437
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,120
I knew you were pretending to have a stomachache.

438
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,120
I don't have a stomachache, but I feel bad.

439
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
Of course.

440
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,520
There is a young man who is not a good partner,

441
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,320
but he misses a good girl.

442
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,520
As a parent...

443
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Meng, use warm water to warm your stomach.

444
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
Be careful.

445
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
Thank you.

446
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,120
The number you have dialed is not available at the moment.

447
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,720
There's a call from your ex-boyfriend.

448
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,120
The soul-seeking shop.

449
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,520
How is that possible?

450
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,120
Today, Mr. Ou forced me to come back.

451
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,720
But this time it's not about Ou Jun.

452
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,120
It's about the meeting.

453
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,120
He's worried you might get into trouble.

454
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,120
꽃

455
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,120
I can't take medicine or go to the hospital.

456
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,120
I just want to have a bone marrow check-up.

457
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,120
I have to go back to the hospital.

458
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,120
I haven't seen you for so long.

459
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,120
You're leaving so soon?

460
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,120
You're not a doctor. It's too late.

461
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,120
Go back before dawn.

462
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,120
But I'm worried about her sister.

463
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
I want to go back.

464
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
Go back before dawn.

465
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
Please.

466
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,120
Are you mute?

467
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,120
She won't be mute if I'm not here.

468
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
Go after her.

469
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,120
I don't know which one to chase.

470
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,120
Why should I let others stay?

471
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,120
You're so stupid. Youxi.

472
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,120
Stupid?

473
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,120
Have you thought it over?

474
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,120
Stupid.

475
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,120
Weiwei.

476
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,120
Wait a minute.

477
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,120
Go back.

478
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,120
Don't make others feel bad.

479
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,120
I want you and my brother to be happy.

480
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,120
I'm doing fine now.

481
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,120
You don't care about the outside world.

482
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,120
You don't care about your heart.

483
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,120
Leave me alone.

484
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,120
It's impossible for me and my brother.

485
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,120
You must give up so easily.

486
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,120
You must sacrifice your happiness.

487
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,120
Why do you have to escape when my brother is escaping?

488
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,120
You always care about others' feelings.

489
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Who cares about your feelings?

490
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,120
And that Ou Hui.

491
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,120
No matter how rich or how domineering he is, he can't win you.

492
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,120
Why do you all fear that I'll fall in love with Ou Hui?

493
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,120
Is it because he's too good or because he's too bad?

494
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,120
I know my brother is hurting you.

495
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,120
But if you keep running away like this,

496
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,120
my brother will be more and more patient with you.

497
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,120
If you were me,

498
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,120
would you choose Ou Hui or Han Lingying?

499
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,120
I would choose my brother.

500
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,120
I know.

501
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,120
The more I say, the more you won't choose him.

502
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,120
You've always let others have everything.

503
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,120
Ou Hui's actions have given you enough opportunities to marry my brother.

504
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,120
But you...

505
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,120
Enough!

506
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,120
I know you all think I'm trying to get the right.

507
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,120
But it's easier for me to face Ou Hui.

508
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,120
Your brother can't make a choice.

509
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,120
You pretend you don't know.

510
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,120
Why do you have to force us to face embarrassment?

511
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,120
I don't need your self-righteous concern.

512
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,120
I don't want to let embarrassment continue to deteriorate.

513
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,120
I can't face it.

514
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,120
This soup is salty enough.

515
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,120
No need to add salt.

516
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,120
I don't know what you've been through tonight.

517
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,120
I don't want to ask.

518
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,120
Because some things are destined to be faced by one person.

519
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,120
But when you look back,

520
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,120
no matter how painful the situation is,

521
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,120
it's just a memory of the Clouds and the Sky.

522
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,120
Because everything

523
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,120
can't be stopped by the flow of time.

524
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,120
But now I can't get up from the Clouds and the Sky.

525
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,120
You're a loser.

526
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,120
How can you be so cool

527
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,120
with your little talent?

528
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,120
But you're lucky.

529
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,120
Because I'm the one who's been through this.

530
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,120
So don't worry.

531
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,120
Even though you're stupid and have a bad temper,

532
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,120
I'll still teach you how to cheer up.

533
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,120
I'm glad I didn't take you for a fool.

534
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,120
Go get me some tea.

535
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,120
I'm sorry.

536
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,120
I didn't call you last night.

537
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,120
It's the night before my birthday.

538
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,120
I'm sorry.

539
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,120
I couldn't help you.

540
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,120
I'm sorry.

541
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,120
I'm sorry.

542
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,120
I'm sorry.

543
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,120
I'm sorry.

544
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,120
I'm sorry.

545
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,120
I'm sorry.

546
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,120
I'm sorry.

547
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,120
I'm sorry.

548
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,120
I'm sorry.

549
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,120
You're my best friend.

550
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,120
Because I don't know what to say.

551
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,120
I understand.

552
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,120
Do you think I'm better than that?

553
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,120
Everyone who's doing good

554
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,120
is just good friends.

555
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,120
But now...

556
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,120
Because you are dating,

557
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,120
our relationship has been messed up.

558
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,120
I'm sorry.

559
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
On the surface,

560
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,120
he's still very nice to me.

561
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,120
But I know that Weiwei

562
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,120
has a place in his heart.

563
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
She's not like before.

564
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,120
And Zirui

565
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,120
must think that

566
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,120
I'm a bad girl who stole her brother's boyfriend.

567
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,120
I've lost my best friend.

568
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,120
And I've lost a big brother

569
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,120
who loves me wholeheartedly.

570
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,120
I'm the dumbest fool in the world.

571
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,120
Lan Zhan, don't say that.

572
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
I'm too naive.

573
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
What's hers is hers.

574
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,120
Why should I interfere?

575
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,120
It will end sooner or later.

576
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,120
I'd better give up now.

577
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
Lan Zhan, what are you talking about?

578
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,120
I'm going to America after graduation.

579
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,120
After I leave,

580
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
I'll go to America.

581
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,120
Can we maintain

582
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,120
such an uncertain relationship?

583
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
At least in my opinion,

584
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,120
it's over.

585
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,120
No one will care about anyone.

586
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,120
What is love?

587
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,120
I really don't want anything now.

588
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,120
I just want everything to go back to the past.

589
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,120
Lan Zhan, you're thinking too much.

590
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,120
Who said you would lose me?

591
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,120
Don't be silly.

592
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,120
When I leave,

593
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
all feelings will disappear.

594
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,120
They will no longer exist.

595
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,120
No.

596
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,120
I won't let you go alone.

597
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,120
Will you go to America with me?

598
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
Will you really give up everything

599
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
and go to America with me

600
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,120
for me?

601
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,120
I will.

602
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,120
I don't care what you do,

603
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,120
but you must cure my sister's illness.

604
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,120
Otherwise, you will be shut down.

605
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
Baoding,

606
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,120
when will you change your temper?

607
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,120
You're already so angry.

608
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,120
Even if my sister is not sick,

609
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,120
she's already sick because of you.

610
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,120
I'm not sick.

611
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,120
I'm not sick.

612
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,120
I'm sick because of you.

613
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,120
It's okay, sister.

614
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,120
I'm just scolding the secretary.

615
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,120
You don't have to make up.

616
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,120
I know.

617
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,120
It's just a brain tumor

618
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,120
that suppresses the nerves.

619
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
It will soon disappear.

620
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,120
Don't worry.

621
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,120
My sister is already lost.

622
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,120
I know it very well.

623
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,120
So,

624
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,120
my sister knows it all.

625
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,120
You think I'm stupid?

626
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,120
I won't contact my doctor.

627
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,120
Besides,

628
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,120
I have my eyes on me.

629
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
How can I not know?

630
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,120
Sister,

631
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,120
the medical technology is so advanced now.

632
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,120
They will definitely cure you.

633
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
Don't worry.

634
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,120
I'm not worried.

635
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,120
I just want to make a wish before I die.

636
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,120
What wish?

637
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,120
I just want to invite my relatives

638
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,120
to come over to my house

639
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,120
and have a meal.

640
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,120
This is simple.

641
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
I'll help you.

642
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,120
No.

643
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,120
Those who are powerful,

644
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,120
did they help us when we were kids?

645
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,120
Now they think of us.

646
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,120
I don't agree.

647
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,120
Your sister's body is like this.

648
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,120
One foot is already in the coffin.

649
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,120
What's there to worry about?

650
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,120
What do you mean one foot is already in the coffin?

651
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,120
Sister, I don't allow you to say that.

652
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,120
I will definitely cure you.

653
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,120
I'm telling you.

654
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,120
I'm telling you, I'm a dead man.

655
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,120
I won't have an operation.

656
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,120
I know you came to persuade me.

657
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,120
You don't have to say it.

658
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,120
I won't agree.

659
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,120
Do you know that you have four words on your forehead?

660
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,120
Handsome and cool.

661
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,120
It's a dead man.

662
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,120
Now this society is so realistic.

663
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,120
I believe you know better than me.

664
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,120
When you are in trouble,

665
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,120
when you are in trouble,

666
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,120
when others don't harm you,

667
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,120
they are already helping you.

668
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,120
They only remember what they did to you.

669
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,120
They helped you.

670
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,120
But no one remembers what they did to you.

671
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,120
So why do you have to

672
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,120
care about things that others don't remember?

673
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,120
I don't care what others think.

674
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,120
I just don't agree with them.

675
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,120
You can't be so selfish.

676
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,120
Although you don't usually get in touch with your relatives,

677
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,120
maybe they were bad to you before.

678
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,120
But it's all in the past.

679
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,120
You don't have any deep hatred after all.

680
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,120
Now you are more qualified to forgive than anyone else.

681
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,120
There are no such people.

682
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,120
I have been living well with my sister for so many years.

683
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,120
You really don't understand your sister's pain, do you?

684
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,120
Your sister knows that you are independent.

685
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,120
But you are too proud.

686
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,120
You don't have many friends.

687
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,120
She is afraid that if one day she leaves,

688
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,120
you don't even have anyone to take care of you.

689
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,120
She thinks that relatives are the best bridge.

690
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,120
She thinks that relatives are the best bridge.

691
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,120
She thinks that relatives are the best bridge.

692
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,120
Even if you don't want to admit your blood-related relationship,

693
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,120
it still exists.

694
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,120
So she wants you to recognize your ancestors

695
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,120
and reconnect with your family.

696
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,120
She doesn't want you to be alone.

697
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,120
There is no other way.

698
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,120
I am fine alone.

699
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,120
I don't have any problems.

700
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,120
But your sister is not good.

701
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,120
She is worried about you.

702
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,120
You are not doing well.

703
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,120
Is she doing well?

704
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,120
So just treat her as if she is happy.

705
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,120
We have to play this game.

706
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,120
Your sister loves you the most in this world.

707
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,120
So you must not let her down.

708
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,120
It's really hard to be a human.

709
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,120
You have to care about others' feelings, not yourself.

710
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,120
Of course.

711
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,120
The hardest thing in this world is to be a human.

712
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,120
After you fulfill your sister's wish,

713
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,120
you can do what you want to do.

714
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,120
Will you stay with me?

715
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,120
What are you thinking about?

716
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,120
I will take you to the amusement park.

717
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,120
I will go there when I am not happy.

718
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,120
Because I think the happiness there is the most pure.

719
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,120
Okay.

720
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,120
We will go together another day.

721
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,120
Brother,

722
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,120
last night Mr. Kang came back.

723
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,120
He said he wanted to see you.

724
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,120
Brother,

725
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,120
did Mr. Kang come back last night?

726
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,120
It's Princess Kang.

727
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,120
No.

728
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,120
I called her this morning.

729
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,120
Her phone is off.

730
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,120
Is she angry about what happened last night?

731
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,120
She is not that kind of person.

732
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,120
I don't understand.

733
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,120
You don't understand?

734
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,120
Let me ask you.

735
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,120
What is Kang Wei Wei?

736
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,120
What?

737
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,120
She is a woman.

738
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,120
As long as she is a woman,

739
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,120
no matter how big her personality is,

740
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,120
she will have a small belly.

741
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,120
Women are used to coax and hurt.

742
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,120
And after I chased her out last night,

743
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,120
I saw her crying.

744
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,120
She felt wronged.

745
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,120
She has done so much for you.

746
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,120
Brother, what have you done for her?

747
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,120
I have decided.

748
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,120
What have you decided?

749
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,120
I want to sell this flower shop.

750
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,120
Wei Wei promised to meet me for the flower shop.

751
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,120
But I didn't do it for the sake of the request.

752
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,120
For me to be someone else's first-class girlfriend.

753
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,120
I am hiding behind a woman like this,

754
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,120
and I am her sister.

755
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,120
What kind of man am I?

756
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,120
But didn't she give you the rent?

757
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,120
I didn't use her rent.

758
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,120
I would rather sell the flower shop.

759
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,120
I can't let her down.

760
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,120
Brother, you are so manly.

761
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,120
If Wei Wei sees you like this,

762
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,120
she will be so confused.

763
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,120
Don't worry.

764
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,120
No matter from the spirit or action,

765
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,120
you should take care of the flower shop.

766
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,120
I will find a good buyer for you.

767
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,120
And you will have a good price.

768
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:51,120
I don't need any reason to wait for the end.

769
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,120
But you are too close to me.

770
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,120
I can't wait for that.

771
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,120
I will wait for the end.

772
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,120
I will have an excuse.

773
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,120
When you need me the most,

774
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:12,120
I can hold you in my arms.

775
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:24,120
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

776
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,120
There is a saying

777
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,120
that you should keep your mouth shut.

778
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,120
Then you can reach out

779
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,120
with all your might.

780
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,120
You make wind for me,

781
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,120
you both bring me rain.

782
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:50,120
I will not stop, my chest is moving forward

783
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:58,120
I've been hurt, hurt and grieved

784
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:05,120
I want you to stay with me, cry and drink

785
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:12,120
Let's shout together, let's keep our mouth shut

786
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:17,120
Let's stay together on the street of drunkenness

787
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:25,120
We will go to the end, there is no need for any reason

788
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:32,120
In your heart, there is no one who can't be treated

789
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:38,120
We will go to the end, there is no end to it

790
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:42,120
When you need each other the most

791
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:51,120
We can stand together on the street of drunkenness

792
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:56,120
Let's stay together

793
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:13,120
The End
