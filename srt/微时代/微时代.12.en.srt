I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I shouldn't have become a singer because of your words.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You can forget about me.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You should remember about yourself.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Mr. Liang is waiting for you.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Do you think I still have the mood to talk?

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I love you.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I love you.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We've changed.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let's go.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Let's go.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Brother.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Let's go.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Why is the night club learning to sing now?

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Let's go.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let's dance in a short skirt.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let's dance.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't worry, don't worry.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Smile.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Dr. Liang, come down with me.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Come on, why are you looking at the girl?

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Open your mouth.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Youxi.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't make fun of others.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
She has a name. Her name is Ai Zhengni.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You're so good at talking.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm sorry, Ai Zhengni.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Youxi.

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Report.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The Indian councilor of the Indian team is playing.

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The Chinese team is sitting by the table.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
They don't have any other reasons.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Over.

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Please keep in touch.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Youxi.

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Youxi.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What kind of woman do you think of?

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
No.

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I've been controlled.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Who dares to approach me?

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Who can control what you think in your mind?

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You don't like Ai Di.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You think she's a little bit of a bitch.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You don't like her, do you?

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
No.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I've always been a good girl.

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I don't know what your brother is thinking.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Such a beautiful woman.

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Such a beautiful woman.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
She's telling the world on the radio that she loves you.

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
How romantic.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Nothing happened between us.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We didn't even hold hands.

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If it were someone else,

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
it would have been wrong.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Right?

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Ai Di likes you so much.

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
She's so good.

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You're so business.

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You'll be her manager after graduation.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You're right.

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Even if she was ugly,

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
she's beautiful now.

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You can't accept a beauty being ugly.

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's normal. I understand.

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But she's ugly now.

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
She's like a duck.

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You're so anxious to get rid of her.

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Han Dingyi.

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Are you out of your mind?

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I remember you.

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But we're really nothing.

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
How do you know?

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Brother.

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I remember this is the ghost

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
that sent the school to Shanghai before we married.

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
How do you know?

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Forget it.

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
My brother is a stubborn person.

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
If I were Ai Di,

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I would choose a dream.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I just want to have a good time.

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Since your brother is not interested in her,

126
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
why don't you go?

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I've passed the heat wave.

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm not interested in a woman

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
who is too determined

130
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
to be a prostitute in someone else's house.

131
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't worry, brother.

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I won't let my most dear brother

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
suffer.

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
They know Ai Di.

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But Brother Yiting still thinks

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
he hasn't done that.

137
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
They're still talking.

138
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I think Hua Youxi is a bit of a traitor.

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
She gave up the chance to go to the rooftop.

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
She said Ai Di is a stubborn person.

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We found the suspect.

142
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It seems that we have to think of a way to find out the culprit.

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You're protecting Han Dingyi

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and lying to me.

145
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
No.

146
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We don't think you and Han Dingyi are lying.

147
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's just that the truth

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
is a little different from what you think.

149
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Impossible.

150
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Actually,

151
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
frankly speaking,

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
you don't want to accept the truth you don't want to accept.

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I have the right to believe that you are

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
trying to trick me.

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I knew it.

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
When you saw me at the hotel cafe,

157
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
you saw me with a bad eye.

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Now you can believe

159
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
or suspect that we are

160
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
trying to trick you.

161
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But I don't think it matters.

162
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I think

163
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
everyone is doing it out of good will.

164
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
No one is evil.

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You two don't have to fight against each other.

166
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Don't worry.

167
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Although I have some tricks

168
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
but I came up with this plan

169
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
for your own good.

170
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Does this have anything to do with you?

171
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Your enthusiasm seems to be a little too much.

172
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm not just

173
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
helping you with this.

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm also helping my two good sisters

175
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Weiwei and Wanjia.

176
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
They are worried that this will affect Dingyi.

177
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
They have been depressed for several days.

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
They are not happy. I am not happy either.

179
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Is that okay?

180
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm doing this

181
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
purely because I'm worried about Dingyi.

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm also worried that this will affect the development of V-Log.

183
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We don't want to have any more prejudice against Dingyi.

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
He has been avoiding us

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
for this matter.

186
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yes. Besides, what age is it now?

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Every girl

188
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
has to experience more boyfriends to grow up.

189
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
who is the first love?

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's the most important thing for every girl.

192
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Isn't it?

193
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes. Since you have already said this on the radio

194
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
why don't you dare to find the truth?

195
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Okay.

196
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I apologize

197
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
for what I said to you.

198
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Thank you for your kindness.

200
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Let's find the truth together.

201
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Let's

202
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
start.

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Let's hear from her first.

204
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Why did she call you?

205
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Mei Bao sent a message.

206
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
She has also started to act.

207
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
My obsession

208
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
started from the makeup dance.

209
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Youxi.

210
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I remember the makeup dance.

211
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I was holding a mask with a gold bar.

212
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I was giving you a mask with a cross.

213
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I've been doing this for so many years.

214
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
How could I forget?

215
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And that day, the makeup dance

216
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
was also attended by Ivy.

217
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
No.

218
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
At that time, she was called

219
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Ai Zhen Ni.

220
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Don't you think Miss Chou has no impression?

221
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I only remember

222
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
that she was alone

223
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
in the corner.

224
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Then I went to talk to her.

225
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
She's not your daughter.

226
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
She's my girlfriend.

227
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
She's not my girlfriend.

228
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Why don't you dance

229
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
alone?

230
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Why don't you dance alone?

231
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Why don't you dance alone?

232
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Why don't you dance alone?

233
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Why don't you dance alone?

234
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm nervous.

235
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Are you feeling better?

236
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Much better.

237
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Brother Huo Teng.

238
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You have to dance in the makeup dance.

239
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Did you two dance?

240
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
No.

241
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
She told me that she didn't know how to dance.

242
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
She was afraid that others would laugh at her.

243
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Because I know that she sings well.

244
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I took her to a recording studio.

245
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I was very nervous.

246
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
She was so handsome.

247
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
She was so bright.

248
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
She smiled at me.

249
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I couldn't even speak.

250
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What I want is

251
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
to make her happy

252
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
when she sings.

253
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Everyone will be happy.

254
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
After all, this is the last night

255
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I left Guangzhou.

256
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm so happy.

257
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
This is the last night.

258
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Did she sing?

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You can sing here.

260
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Then you don't have to worry

261
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
that others will see you.

262
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And we will hear your song.

263
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm still a little nervous.

264
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Are you feeling better now?

265
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm feeling better.

266
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm still nervous.

267
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
How about

268
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
you go get a bottle of wine?

269
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
We'll drink together.

270
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Okay.

271
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Wait for me.

272
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I only remember that it was my first time drinking.

273
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The water was about to boil.

274
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I was dizzy.

275
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But I felt really good.

276
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So you

277
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
didn't go back

278
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
after you went out to get the wine?

279
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I didn't come back. I definitely didn't come back.

280
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Because I was drunk.

281
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I remember

282
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
a senior asked me to take a picture.

283
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Youxi, do you remember

284
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
where I put my mask?

285
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I don't remember.

286
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Let's go.

287
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Dingyi, a few people want to take pictures with you.

288
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Now?

289
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yes, let's go.

290
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,160
I remember!

291
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,580
Thank you.

292
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,520
I even我看到

293
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:33,520
the new

294
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,040
home

295
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,480
as soon as I opened it.

296
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,400
They were so close.

297
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,560
It was so romantic and exciting.

298
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,600
I couldn't even imagine the scene.

299
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,760
It happened like this.

300
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,480
I was shy.

301
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,360
So I put on a mask.

302
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,760
And she walked in.

303
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,800
Take it out.

304
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,720
50.

305
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,320
Then I'll be bold enough to gentlemen ask.

306
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,240
Did that time

307
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,160
not have a deeper connection with her?

308
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,760
No.

309
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,400
No?

310
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,160
How could that be possible?

311
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,160
Because I only know the two words.

312
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
The gentleman.

313
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,160
Responsibility.

314
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,160
Too many people.

315
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,160
No space.

316
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
What's going on?

317
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,160
There's only one person.

318
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,160
Can I keep the secret between us?

319
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,160
Because for me, this is a precious memory.

320
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,160
But for a handsome man,

321
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,160
how can he be a little girl in his mind?

322
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,160
So, for the person,

323
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,160
the most unwilling to see is the old girl.

324
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,160
Smart.

325
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,160
I'm sorry.

326
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Can you not sing a song?

327
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,160
Annoying.

328
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
What?

329
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Why are you angry?

330
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,160
You're not the one who's got a tattoo on your arm.

331
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
I'm sorry.

332
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,160
Brother Yiding.

333
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,160
So many flowers.

334
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,160
Why do you have so many flowers?

335
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,160
Why are you so haggard?

336
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,160
You're more annoying than me.

337
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,160
I'm worried about your reputation.

338
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,160
By the way,

339
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,160
are there any dogs following you today?

340
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
Not yet.

341
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
Brother Yiding.

342
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,160
Did Yiding look for you recently?

343
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,160
No.

344
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,160
You're really a heartbreaker.

345
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
Yes.

346
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,160
Is there any way to make up for it?

347
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
I've thought about it.

348
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
I want to pretend to be a couple with Weiwei.

349
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Then Yiding will be more calm.

350
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,160
You and him pretend to be a couple?

351
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
Who believes it?

352
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,160
Hua Youxi, what do you mean?

353
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
Put down your scissors.

354
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,160
I'm just telling you from a man's perspective.

355
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,160
Your womanhood is not attractive enough.

356
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
I'll serve you.

357
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
What do you want?

358
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,160
I'll take advantage of you for the rest of my life.

359
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,160
I'll let you discover it.

360
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Brother Yiding,

361
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
I'll take advantage of you.

362
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,160
Can you give me a bouquet?

363
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
What are you doing?

364
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
Guess who I saw.

365
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,160
Who?

366
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,160
The girl from the TV series.

367
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,160
Yiding really scared Hua Youxi.

368
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,160
She didn't keep her promise for days.

369
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,160
She's been vomiting all day.

370
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
No way.

371
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,160
She's been so aggressive.

372
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
I'm going to the hospital to see her.

373
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,160
Let's make the next plan.

374
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,160
I'll go check on her first.

375
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,160
I'll see if she can act.

376
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,160
Okay.

377
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Okay.

378
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Are you in pain?

379
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,160
Why did you vomit?

380
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,160
It's a common disease.

381
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,160
I'm so sorry that I didn't have the pressure.

382
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
Don't think about her.

383
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,160
If you keep doing this,

384
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,160
I'm afraid you'll have depression.

385
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,160
I'm not feeling well.

386
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
Can you help me?

387
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,160
Sure.

388
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,160
What should I do?

389
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:03,160
If you don't like me,

390
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,160
but my brother,

391
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,160
but you think it's impossible,

392
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,160
then you should approach me.

393
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,160
You're trying to make me feel better?

394
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,160
What do you want to ask?

395
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,160
You don't like me,

396
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,160
but my brother.

397
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,160
But you think it's impossible,

398
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,160
so you should approach me.

399
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,160
You must be thinking that

400
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,160
you're my brother.

401
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,160
When you're with him,

402
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,160
you can approach my brother.

403
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,160
Are you crazy?

404
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
You're so selfish.

405
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,160
I gave you everything.

406
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,160
How could you say that?

407
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
I'm pretending.

408
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,160
Don't you understand?

409
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,160
How could I not understand?

410
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,160
You really think about that girl?

411
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,160
You really have something to do with her?

412
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
You don't believe me, do you?

413
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,160
How can I believe you?

414
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,160
Your brother is so honest.

415
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,160
He won't even lie.

416
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,160
Everyone can see that you're in trouble.

417
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,160
What's wrong with me?

418
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
Why are you so nervous

419
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,160
when you see that girl?

420
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
I don't know.

421
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
I don't care.

422
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,160
Brother.

423
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,160
It's over.

424
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,160
What did I do wrong?

425
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,160
This is a big problem.

426
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,160
You think your mother is a cloud in the sky?

427
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,160
You don't know anything.

428
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,160
Since Aidi said he loves you on the radio,

429
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,160
you've been denying him.

430
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,160
He's not talking much.

431
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,160
He's my child.

432
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,160
I know what he's thinking.

433
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,160
He's the one to blame.

434
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,160
Aidi is a public figure and a student idol.

435
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,160
Have you thought about

436
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,160
how bad this will affect Youxi?

437
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,160
Mom.

438
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,160
This will be exposed sooner or later.

439
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,160
I used you to hide from the world

440
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,160
because I didn't want this to happen.

441
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,160
But why can't you help your brother?

442
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,160
How will your brother be?

443
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,160
Mom.

444
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,160
I really don't know what you're thinking.

445
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,160
I'm wrong.

446
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,160
You think I'm biased?

447
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,160
You've been saving money since you were a kid.

448
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,160
You didn't let me worry about you.

449
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,160
Look at your brother.

450
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,160
He didn't let me worry about him.

451
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,160
He's been naughty all day long.

452
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,160
If something really happens to him,

453
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,160
will you be as happy as others?

454
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,160
It seems you're ready.

455
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,160
Mei Bao sent a message

456
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,160
saying Youxi is the only one in the hospital.

457
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,160
I'm just worried that we're going too far.

458
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,160
We've already reached this point.

459
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,160
We can't go back.

460
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,520
Besides, who is the one who changed the

461
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,160
crystal bowl that night?

462
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,160
The truth will be revealed soon.

463
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
Let's go.

464
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,160
Get in the car.

465
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
Youxi.

466
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,160
Youxi.

467
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,160
Youxi.

468
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,160
Youxi.

469
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,160
What are you doing?

470
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,160
I'm you.

471
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,160
You're so ugly.

472
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,160
I fell in love with you the night I saw you.

473
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,160
Can you stop acting?

474
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,160
I'm begging you.

475
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,160
What?

476
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Don't you like my teeth?

477
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,160
I'm begging you.

478
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
Help me.

479
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,160
Do you remember why we didn't

480
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,160
get closer that night?

481
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,160
Do you know why?

482
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,160
Two words.

483
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,160
Two words.

484
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,160
And...

485
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
Youxi.

486
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,160
Oh, no.

487
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,160
Youxi.

488
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,160
Squad leader.

489
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,160
Xiao'ai.

490
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,160
I finally found the answer

491
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,160
to open my heart.

492
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,160
I'm so stupid.

493
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,160
I'm going to reveal the truth

494
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,160
that made me lie in the blood.

495
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,160
No.

496
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
You're wrong.

497
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,160
That night was me.

498
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,160
It has nothing to do with my brother.

499
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,160
I just can't admit it.

500
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,160
Youxi.

501
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,160
What?

502
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,160
I said that night was me.

503
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
I was the one who slept with you until dawn.

504
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,160
It has nothing to do with my brother.

505
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,160
Do you think I'll believe you?

506
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,160
Do you think I'll believe you?

507
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
Do you think you can change the world?

508
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,160
What's the justice between you and

509
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,160
Kang Weiwei and Wu Anpo?

510
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
And the Indian family, Kang Zirui.

511
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,160
They're all your accomplices.

512
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,160
And this makeup.

513
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,160
You want me to change

514
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,160
the way I used to be, right?

515
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,160
He is your inner self.

516
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,160
I was really attracted to you that night.

517
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
Han Dingyi.

518
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
He was a bad guy.

519
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,160
Why did you become Han Dingyi?

520
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
Anyway,

521
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,160
I was the one who was disappointed that night.

522
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,160
I know that as a woman,

523
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,160
the value of the memory is so important to me.

524
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,160
Unlike you,

525
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,160
I don't want to play it as a game.

526
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,160
I refuse it at will and admit it at will.

527
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,160
I can.

528
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,160
I really hope that I won't see you again that night.

529
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
Because you are always beautiful

530
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,160
in my heart.

531
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,160
I'm sorry.

532
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,160
I shouldn't have kept it a secret.

533
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,160
You all are playing tricks on me.

534
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
Youxi.

535
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,160
Let's call it a day.

536
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,160
Don't mention it to anyone else.

537
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,160
Don't talk about Wu Anpo's incident.

538
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,160
That's all.

539
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,160
Okay, that's it.

540
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,160
Okay, that's it.

541
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,160
What?

542
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,160
You posted it on Teng Xun's Weibo?

543
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
Are you crazy?

544
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,160
Delete it right now.

545
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,160
You are so annoying.

546
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,160
Many people are already blaming me.

547
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,160
Don't mind it too much.

548
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,160
I've already asked Ouyang Qiao to delete this circle.

549
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,160
I can't do anything without Wu Anpo.

550
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,160
You are quite good at this.

551
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,160
Amber, you are a different person today.

552
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
Why are you looking at me with such a strange look?

553
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,160
I'm just curious.

554
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,160
Everyone wants to know who was with who that night.

555
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,160
When did I ever think about the consequences?

556
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
Do you know?

557
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,160
I finally found a common ground with you.

558
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,160
When did we ever think about the consequences?

559
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,160
We are standing as people, lying down as people,

560
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,160
and then we fall and then we get up.

561
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,160
That's what we call being a good person.

562
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,160
Don't be so petty, okay?

563
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,160
You want me to feel guilty, right?

564
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,160
The most annoying thing is that Adi.

565
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,160
Why is he always in our lives?

566
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,160
You want to push everything I do wrong to someone else, right?

567
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,160
Is there a problem?

568
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,160
No problem.

569
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,160
I'm too immature.

570
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,160
What will my mother think of me?

571
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,160
What will my brother think of me?

572
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,160
My mother told me since I was a child,

573
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,160
that no matter what happens in the future,

574
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,160
the three of us must protect each other.

575
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
Why did I forget everything?

576
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,160
It's all my fault.

577
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,160
You are angry with Brother Ying?

578
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
Are you jealous?

579
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,160
How can I be jealous?

580
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
I'm not jealous.

581
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,160
How can I be jealous?

582
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,160
I just think that I should have a new understanding of Ding Yi.

583
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,160
He is a coward who is always in a mess and doesn't admit his mistakes.

584
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,160
But have you ever thought that it might really not be Brother Ding Yi?

585
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,160
Adi is a star.

586
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,160
He is just a normal college student.

587
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,160
Do you think Adi needs to make up such a story to lie to us?

588
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,160
But Brother Ding Yi is not a person who can lie.

589
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,160
Wan Jia, you have been together for so long.

590
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
You don't know him, do you?

591
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,160
How can I know? I don't know him.

592
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,160
Wan Jia, if we don't believe him now,

593
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,160
who will believe him?

594
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,160
Alright, let's go.

595
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,160
Wan Jia.

596
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
You have to believe me.

597
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,160
Why must I believe you? You are not my boyfriend.

598
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,160
Yes, I'm not your boyfriend.

599
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,160
But you are very important to me, okay?

600
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,160
Anyone can misunderstand me, but you can't.

601
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:28,160
You can tell me that having a woman like Adi

602
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,160
is like a tiger to men.

603
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,160
It's like a tower.

604
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,160
You can climb higher and faster than others.

605
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,160
Having a woman like that is hard to ask for men.

606
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,160
Why don't you just say you are wrong?

607
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,160
I don't like this kind of way.

608
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,160
And I don't have this kind of brain.

609
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,160
Idiot.

610
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,160
I believe you.

611
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,160
I hope you are a man who doesn't lie and is responsible.

612
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,160
That's great.

613
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,160
You finally believe me.

614
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,160
Don't look at me like that.

615
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,160
If you want to thank me, thank Wei Wei.

616
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,160
She has been listening to you.

617
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,160
I don't want my sister to look at the wrong person and say nonsense.

618
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,160
I don't want my sister to look at the wrong person and say nonsense.

619
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,160
I don't.

620
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,160
If I didn't get angry at you,

621
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:33,160
you wouldn't have joined the 7M Alliance because you care about my opinion.

622
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,160
Don't blame everything on you, okay?

623
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,160
I should be the one who said that to you.

624
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,160
I'm so confused right now.

625
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,160
I don't know how to make everyone happy.

626
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,160
Let me tell you a story.

627
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,160
When I was little,

628
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,160
I broke the vase my grandfather left for my father.

629
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,160
I was so scared that I was beaten.

630
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,160
So I secretly used glue to stick the vase together.

631
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,160
I hope it can hide the sky from the sea.

632
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,160
I hope it can hide the sky from the sea.

633
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,160
I hope it can hide the sky from the sea.

634
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,160
But I was so scared every day.

635
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,160
I was afraid that I would be discovered.

636
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,160
I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to eat or sleep well.

637
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,160
I was really waiting for a long time.

638
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,160
How long did you wait?

639
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,160
Just a few days.

640
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,160
My mother accidentally found out when she was wiping the vase.

641
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,160
Did she hit you?

642
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,160
She slapped me.

643
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,160
After I grew up,

644
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:49,160
I knew that my parents didn't mention it because they cared about my feelings.

645
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,160
I realized that my value is more important than the vase.

646
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,160
Just like you now.

647
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,160
I believe that you can feel it in your heart.

648
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,160
Your brother cares about you.

649
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,160
I hope that you can understand me like you do.

650
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,160
How can a girl not be obsessed with her first love?

651
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,160
Time will change everything.

652
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,160
Trust me.

653
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,160
You understand how to comfort people.

654
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,160
But I really thank you.

655
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,160
Don't drink anymore.

656
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
Give me another drink.

657
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
No.

658
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,160
You have to control me.

659
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,160
Our best singer has left.

660
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,160
My two sons are gone.

661
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,160
The movie is really a love story.

662
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,160
What's wrong with that?

663
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,160
It's okay. Didn't Brother Ding already admit it to Aidi?

664
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,160
I think it's okay.

665
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,160
I think it's okay.

666
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,160
That silly boy.

667
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,160
He doesn't know when to tell the truth and when to lie.

668
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,160
When he understands, his life will be over.

669
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,160
Okay.

670
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,160
Maybe everything will be solved after dawn.

671
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,160
They will come back safely.

672
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,160
Trust me.

673
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,160
There are too many things that are not good for life.

674
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,160
People grow in setbacks.

675
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,160
If Aidi can be like you,

676
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,160
and doesn't care about this,

677
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,160
it's okay.

678
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:08,160
Why are you so obsessed with the past?

679
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,160
Your career is so good.

680
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,160
There are so many fans who love you.

681
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,160
In your life, you need a Han Dingyi.

682
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,160
Or a person like me.

683
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,160
I think you are not good enough.

684
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,160
You are not good enough.

685
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,160
You are not good enough.

686
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,160
You are not good enough.

687
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,160
You are not good enough.

688
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,160
You are not good enough.

689
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:36,160
What does it matter if you don't have a Han Dingyi or a Hua Youxi?

690
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,160
You are talking about me on the surface.

691
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,160
No matter how many people like me,

692
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
how popular I am,

693
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,160
I always think about the past Aizheni.

694
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,160
Actually, that Aizheni is so strange.

695
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,160
I think it's because of that handsome guy's words

696
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,160
that I can continue to sing.

697
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,160
Sing loudly.

698
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,160
I'm sorry.

699
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,160
Aidi.

700
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,160
I came back to get my suitcase.

701
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,160
Go.

702
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,160
Aidi.

703
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,160
Where have you been these days?

704
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,160
Why are you leaving so suddenly?

705
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,160
Didn't you say that you still have your childhood memories in this room?

706
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,160
Dingyi and I are making breakfast for you.

707
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,160
When you are bored, I can drink with you.

708
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,160
When you are bored, my son Youxi can accompany you.

709
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
I'm sorry.

710
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,160
I'm sorry.

711
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,160
I'm sorry.

712
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,160
Aidi.

713
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
Aidi.

714
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,160
Go.

715
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,160
Aidi.

716
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,160
Aidi.

717
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,160
Where are you going?

718
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
I don't care about you.

719
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,160
Give me the suitcase.

720
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,160
Where are you going?

721
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,160
I'll take you there.

722
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,160
I hate you the most.

723
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,160
You pretend to be in love, but you have no principles.

724
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
You are right.

725
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,160
Get in the car.

726
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,160
Please don't always have a bad face that others can't refuse.

727
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,160
Please don't hurt others with the excuse of caring.

728
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,160
You don't know it yet.

729
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,160
Please don't carry all your mistakes on your back.

730
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,160
Please sacrifice yourself to satisfy your sense of achievement.

731
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,160
Okay?

732
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
Okay.

733
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,160
I accept all your complaints.

734
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,160
But please be careful.

735
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,160
There are people in this world who always do bad things with good intentions.

736
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,160
You are the one who said it.

737
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,160
I'm sorry.

738
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,160
I'm sorry.

739
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,160
I'm sorry.

740
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,160
I'm sorry.

741
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,160
