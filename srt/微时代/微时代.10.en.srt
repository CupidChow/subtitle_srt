1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,160
In theards Ohh Oh Oh

2
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,320
Oh

3
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,320
Why did you ask us to come down?

4
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,320
Mom is in a good mood today.

5
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,320
She is afraid of a girl.

6
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,320
She said that she wanted to be a singer.

7
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,320
She is a natural singer.

8
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,320
Is she a beauty?

9
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,320
Of course.

10
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,320
Does beauty have anything to do with you?

11
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,320
Let's see.

12
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,320
No.

13
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,320
How is it?

14
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,320
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,320
It's her.

16
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,320
You know her?

17
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,320
Yes.

18
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,320
Son.

19
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,320
How do you think?

20
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,320
It's good.

21
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
Why is she sitting here?

22
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,320
Brother Yitian.

23
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,320
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,320
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,320
Why do you always treat me like a loyal friend?

26
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,320
You sing so well.

27
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,320
Thank you.

28
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,320
You sing so well.

29
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,320
Thank you.

30
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,320
What's your name?

31
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,320
They call me Xiaoai.

32
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,320
What do they call you?

33
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,320
You call me Mengjie.

34
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,320
What's your name?

35
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,320
This is my little son Youxi.

36
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,320
This is my eldest son Dingyi.

37
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,320
Hello, I'm Han Dingyi.

38
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,320
Hello.

39
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,320
Hi.

40
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
I'm Mei Bao.

41
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,320
I'm his girlfriend.

42
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,320
Hello.

43
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,320
You sing so well.

44
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,320
Where did you sing before?

45
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,320
I sang for others.

46
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,320
It's not easy to sing for others.

47
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Your talent is not enough for you.

48
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,320
Yes.

49
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,320
You sing much better than your singing.

50
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Xiaoai.

51
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,320
Do you really want to sing here?

52
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,320
Of course.

53
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,320
Why do you want me to come?

54
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,320
We're just a small bar.

55
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,320
The fee is limited.

56
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,320
Is it too much for you to sing here?

57
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,320
Boss.

58
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,320
I think you have a very cool personality.

59
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
I like you too.

60
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,320
It's delicious.

61
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,320
Let's drink a glass of water.

62
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Actually, I really like

63
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,320
the feeling here.

64
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,320
I like the feeling of singing on the stage.

65
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
I like to sing with everyone.

66
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,320
So,

67
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,320
the money is not a problem.

68
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,320
Don't worry.

69
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,320
If so,

70
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,320
sing here every Friday and Saturday.

71
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,320
Do you think it's appropriate?

72
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,320
It doesn't matter.

73
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,320
I think it's a good idea.

74
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,320
We can be friends.

75
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,320
No, boss.

76
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,320
I have a request.

77
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,320
What request?

78
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,320
I want to live in your house.

79
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,320
Okay.

80
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,320
No.

81
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,320
Actually, I lived with my grandmother

82
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,320
when I was a child.

83
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,320
I have feelings for that place.

84
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Yes.

85
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,320
I was a book reader in Shanghai.

86
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,320
My grandmother and I lived there.

87
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,320
I went to Guangzhou when I was in middle school.

88
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,320
I went back to Shanghai in the past two years.

89
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,320
When I went there that day,

90
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,320
I found out where you lived.

91
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,320
I saw the advertisement of the book reader.

92
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,320
I found it here.

93
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,320
It seems that we are so fated.

94
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,320
We came from Guangzhou.

95
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,320
We welcome you.

96
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,320
If you come to our bar

97
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,320
and sing,

98
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
our bar business will be better.

99
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,320
Thank you, boss.

100
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,320
Thank you.

101
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,320
I think

102
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,320
since I fell in love,

103
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,320
a man

104
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,320
has changed a lot of things.

105
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,320
Including you,

106
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,320
my parents.

107
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,320
I feel

108
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,320
very uncomfortable.

109
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,320
Then you should

110
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,320
leave him.

111
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,320
No.

112
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,320
You are honest.

113
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,320
I hope you will become a famous painter soon.

114
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,320
I am really happy.

115
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,320
Will you help me?

116
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,320
There are too many things to do in the bar.

117
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,320
If I leave, who will help me?

118
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,320
Let's talk about it after graduation.

119
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,320
We will graduate in three months.

120
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,320
In your glass bottle,

121
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,320
there are so many notes.

122
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
What does it say?

123
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,320
That is a wish list.

124
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,320
I will write about

125
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,320
my happiness

126
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
and happiness

127
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
on the paper.

128
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,320
I will put it in.

129
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
When I am free,

130
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,320
I will take it out

131
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,320
and remember it.

132
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,320
I will be very happy.

133
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,320
You are so romantic.

134
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,320
Are you happy

135
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,320
and happy because of me?

136
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,320
I am not telling you.

137
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,320
Your lover called you.

138
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,320
Hello?

139
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,320
I am talking to Weiwei.

140
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,320
What's wrong?

141
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,320
I am not talking.

142
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,320
I am not talking.

143
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,320
Hello, Miss Eddie.

144
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,320
I am here.

145
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Okay, see you later.

146
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,320
You are looking for Kang?

147
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,320
Director Kang.

148
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,320
I am Eddie.

149
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,320
Sit down.

150
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,320
Here is your coffee.

151
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Thank you.

152
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,320
Why do you look so sad?

153
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,320
It's just a publicity.

154
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,320
I will release a new album in summer.

155
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,320
I will show up in the album.

156
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,320
Thank you.

157
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,320
It's a good thing that we met today.

158
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
You are welcome.

159
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
You think I am a ugly woman?

160
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,320
I don't want to see you.

161
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,320
It seems that I am looking for you.

162
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,320
I am here to promote your album.

163
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,320
I want to invite you to the movie

164
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,320
to find another actress.

165
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Ding Xiaorou.

166
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,320
I have read this story on Weibo.

167
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,320
I am very impressed.

168
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
So I am here to meet you.

169
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,320
You can answer the phone.

170
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Or he will call me.

171
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Hello?

172
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
Where are you?

173
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,320
I am at work.

174
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
I will call you later.

175
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,320
Are you hiding from me?

176
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,320
I am at work.

177
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
Bye.

178
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,320
I am sorry.

179
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,320
But now I am fine.

180
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,320
Why don't you answer my phone?

181
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Why are you here?

182
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
Don't you know that I have a tracker on you?

183
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Hello.

184
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Introduce yourself.

185
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
I am Wu Anpo. You can call me Amber.

186
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
I am the producer of this movie.

187
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,320
Hello.

188
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,320
It's okay.

189
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,320
I just want to know the progress of the movie project.

190
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
I want to invite Miss.

191
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
to be the leading actress.

192
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,320
The leading actress?

193
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,320
So many celebrities don't need it.

194
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,320
Why do you need a singer?

195
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,320
I am sorry.

196
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,320
I think there is a big difference between singers and singers.

197
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,320
Miss.

198
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,320
Don't you know that

199
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,320
she is very popular now?

200
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
Everyone is very curious about her.

201
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,320
If she is willing to appear in a movie,

202
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
she will attract many young fans.

203
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,320
I think it will help her.

204
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
I don't think so.

205
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,320
Although she is very popular,

206
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,320
she is just a singer.

207
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
Everyone doesn't know what she looks like.

208
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,320
At that time, the movie poster

209
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
can't be named after her.

210
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,320
In short,

211
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,320
her ticket office is zero.

212
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,320
I told you before.

213
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,320
I don't want commercial films.

214
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,320
I don't want those big brands with ticket offices.

215
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,320
I want new faces.

216
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,320
New faces are the real image of Ding Xiaorou.

217
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,320
And it must stimulate my creative inspiration.

218
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,320
What inspiration do you want?

219
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
What do you want?

220
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,320
I invested so much money for you.

221
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,320
I don't want to make a little star out of money.

222
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
Miss.

223
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
I think you are right.

224
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
As a movie star,

225
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,320
I am still a newcomer.

226
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,320
I don't want your investment

227
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,320
to be on me.

228
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,320
Since the producer and the director

229
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
haven't discussed it,

230
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
I think you should discuss it.

231
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,320
I am very happy to meet you.

232
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,320
I am leaving.

233
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Wait.

234
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
I have something to tell you.

235
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,320
If you don't mind, I can give you a ride.

236
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
Okay.

237
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
Wait for me.

238
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Okay.

239
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
See you later.

240
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,320
Are you satisfied now?

241
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
I asked her out.

242
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
And you are making a fuss.

243
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Unless she is crazy.

244
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320
I don't want her to come.

245
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,320
It's better if she doesn't come.

246
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,320
Are you okay?

247
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
Are you jealous?

248
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,320
Of course I am jealous.

249
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,320
You are hiding behind me.

250
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,320
I don't know how to act.

251
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,320
I am afraid you will scare her away.

252
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,320
I am not professional.

253
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,320
You can teach me.

254
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
I invested so much for you.

255
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
You don't want to cooperate with me.

256
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Whatever you think.

257
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
You are always so passionate about your career.

258
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
You never cared about my feelings.

259
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
If I knew you were so selfish,

260
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,320
I wouldn't have chosen to be with you.

261
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
You regret it now.

262
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,320
I am going home.

263
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,320
Take me home.

264
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,320
You have a private trip.

265
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Why are you looking for me?

266
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,320
I want you to take me home.

267
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,320
Why?

268
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,320
You don't want to?

269
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
Yes, I don't want to.

270
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
I am not your private driver.

271
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,320
You are driving me crazy.

272
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,320
I am sorry.

273
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,320
I didn't know she would come.

274
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,320
It was my mistake.

275
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,320
I apologize for her.

276
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,320
She was rude and unprofessional.

277
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
It seems that the rumor is true.

278
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
Actually, before you asked me out,

279
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,320
I had already talked to the directors and producers of several films.

280
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
But I rejected them all.

281
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,320
Because I have seen your works.

282
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
You are very talented and thoughtful.

283
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,320
After I read the script of this film,

284
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
I knew that my opinion was right.

285
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,320
But I didn't understand why you thought I could act.

286
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,320
I still remember the first time.

287
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,320
When I heard your voice on the radio for the first time,

288
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,320
I thought your voice was different from other singers.

289
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,320
I was very happy.

290
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,320
I was very happy.

291
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,320
I was very happy.

292
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,320
I was very happy.

293
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
I was very happy.

294
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,320
I was very happy.

295
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Your voice is different from other singers.

296
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,320
Your voice has a very rich feeling.

297
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,320
I believe that a singer with this kind of feeling

298
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
can play Ding Xiaorou well.

299
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,320
can play Ding Xiaorou well.

300
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
That film is a pure love film.

301
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
That film is a pure love film.

302
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
You have to have a pure heart to play it well.

303
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,320
You have to have a pure heart to play it well.

304
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,320
I don't think you have never been in love.

305
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,320
I don't think you have ever been in love.

306
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
I am the same as other girls.

307
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
I have experienced a lot.

308
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
But no matter what,

309
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
my pursuit of love is complete.

310
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
my pursuit of love is complete.

311
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,320
Because I am very lucky.

312
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,320
Because I am very lucky.

313
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,320
I met a good person in my first love.

314
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,320
I met a good person in my first love.

315
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,320
Nowadays, girls are not in love for nothing.

316
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,320
Nowadays, girls are not in love for nothing.

317
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
It's just to not leave too many memories.

318
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,320
It's just to not leave too many memories.

319
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,320
You are wrong.

320
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,320
In fact, every girl

321
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,320
is very much looking forward to her first love.

322
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,320
Hey, Kondor.

323
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,320
Do you really not understand

324
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,320
or don't want to understand?

325
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,320
You are very direct.

326
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Actually, your girlfriend is very cute.

327
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
She is just too bad-tempered.

328
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,320
The children of rich people are a little bit bad-tempered.

329
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
Oh, right.

330
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,320
You put me down in front of you.

331
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,320
I'll call the police myself.

332
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,320
It's okay. I'll take you home.

333
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
But don't do that.

334
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,320
Your girlfriend will really misunderstand.

335
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,320
Then let her misunderstand.

336
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,320
Or are you afraid that I will really chase you?

337
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,320
Do you want to use me

338
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,320
to get rid of your girlfriend?

339
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
I don't want to be someone else's tool.

340
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
Go back to her.

341
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,320
She cares about you

342
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,320
because you are her first love.

343
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,320
Don't let her think that her first love

344
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,320
is a bad person.

345
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,320
Okay.

346
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,320
I'll call you.

347
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
See you next time.

348
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,320
Okay.

349
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,320
I don't mind if your girlfriend doesn't like me.

350
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,320
Next time, bring the first love.

351
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Okay.

352
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,320
Bye.

353
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
Bye.

354
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,320
Today we will cut carrots.

355
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,320
Everyone, be careful.

356
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,320
First, let's see the teacher's demonstration.

357
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,320
Be careful.

358
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,320
Hello.

359
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,320
I've been looking at you for a long time.

360
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,320
Can you give me a contact?

361
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,320
Let's make friends.

362
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,320
Slowly.

363
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,320
Be careful.

364
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,320
Go back to your seat.

365
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,320
Hello.

366
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,320
Can you give me a phone number?

367
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,320
I don't have one.

368
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,320
Let me see.

369
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,320
Let me see.

370
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,320
Do you need a number, please?

371
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,320
No, you don't need a number.

372
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,320
No, I don't have one.

373
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,320
Okay.

374
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,320
I'll give you one.

375
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,320
I'll call you back.

376
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,320
I'm leaving.

377
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
Take care of yourself.

378
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,320
Thank you.

379
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,320
What's your number?

380
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,800
I've been paying attention to you since the first day of class.

381
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,000
I want us to keep in touch.

382
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,120
Okay, I'll keep in touch.

383
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,840
Go back.

384
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,640
How can you keep in touch with me without my number?

385
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,040
Why don't you keep in touch with me?

386
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,640
I don't have your number.

387
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,480
Here, I'll send you a letter.

388
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,200
Okay.

389
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,200
Are you done?

390
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,160
Yes.

391
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,000
Weiwei, I have your number.

392
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,120
Go away if you have it.

393
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,920
Okay.

394
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,240
I'll text you.

395
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
Okay.

396
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Bye.

397
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,240
Ding, you're back.

398
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,320
Ding.

399
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,320
Okay.

400
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,360
Actually, I'm not familiar with that man.

401
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,760
I think he likes you.

402
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,320
Really?

403
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,560
Isn't it normal for classmates to keep in touch?

404
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,440
Don't think too much.

405
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,320
I'm not thinking too much.

406
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,720
It has nothing to do with me.

407
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,720
Actually, I think he's nice.

408
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,760
He's honest.

409
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,960
He can take care of you.

410
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
Really?

411
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,640
But you should keep an eye on everything.

412
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,200
I don't want you to be cheated.

413
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,320
If you're cheated, I'll have to save you.

414
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,800
Don't worry.

415
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,040
I won't fall in love with anyone.

416
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,080
But if I fall in love with anyone,

417
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,760
you'll be alone.

418
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,400
I won't be so mean.

419
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,200
I'll keep...

420
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,040
I'll keep you company.

421
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,880
I'll help you open the restaurant.

422
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,120
If you can't get married,

423
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,440
you can't blame me.

424
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,520
Damn it.

425
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,080
Xiaoxin.

426
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,240
Brother Zhezhe, they're inside.

427
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,600
Weiwei, hi.

428
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
Brother.

429
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,160
Why did you come here?

430
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,400
You're the host of the dinner.

431
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,480
Ding.

432
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,360
Look, the structure of the restaurant is designed by Brother Ding.

433
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,760
But I matched the color of the table.

434
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,840
Do you like it?

435
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Of course.

436
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,400
Brother, try your sister's cooking.

437
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
Okay, I'll see how my sister cooks.

438
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,760
Go and sit down.

439
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,840
Let's go.

440
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,280
Welcome.

441
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,280
Xiaoxin.

442
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,880
Xiaoxin, Amber, you're here too.

443
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,760
How is it?

444
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,280
It's great, brother.

445
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,360
Xiaoxin.

446
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,320
Brother Tuo.

447
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,160
How is it?

448
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,280
The design?

449
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,720
It's great.

450
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,240
Come in.

451
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,240
Brother, don't change the tablecloth.

452
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,080
When will I put you in?

453
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,160
Okay.

454
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,440
What a coincidence.

455
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,960
My brother just arrived.

456
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,720
And you're already here.

457
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,320
It's not a coincidence.

458
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,800
Someone...

459
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,880
...took my action.

460
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,920
Brother, I'm under a financial restriction.

461
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,680
I can't miss such a good opportunity.

462
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,800
Please forgive me.

463
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,520
Your restaurant is open today.

464
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,400
So I want to eat something.

465
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,040
What? You're not welcome?

466
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,320
Of course, we're welcome.

467
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,920
Come on, take a look.

468
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,000
Whatever you want.

469
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,760
I want the same as your brother.

470
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,720
Brother.

471
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,200
What do you want to eat?

472
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,200
I want a pizza with a V-log.

473
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,280
No problem.

474
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,360
I want one too.

475
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,160
On the guitar.

476
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,880
Wait.

477
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,960
I'm here.

478
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
Here you are.

479
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
Try it.

480
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
Yours is the best.

481
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Here, brother.

482
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,080
Try it.

483
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,080
It smells great.

484
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,160
You didn't make it?

485
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,840
Everyone is here today.

486
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,920
I want to announce something.

487
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
What is it?

488
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,720
Your brother and I have decided to let Adi perform...

489
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,720
...and find the first female lead of the other half of the film.

490
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
Really?

491
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,320
Yes.

492
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,600
You asked Director Kang?

493
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,520
Yes, I've seen her.

494
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,000
She has agreed to perform.

495
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,040
You've seen her?

496
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
Is she pretty?

497
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,320
I want to know what Adi looks like.

498
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,320
Don't worry.

499
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,800
She is very pretty.

500
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,880
She can totally play the role of Ding Xiaorou.

501
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,480
Who says she is pretty?

502
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,080
I think she is average.

503
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,240
But she has a bit of personality.

504
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,120
I think that's your personal opinion.

505
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,520
You mean I'm not objective enough?

506
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,680
What's wrong with being pretty?

507
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,960
She has no temperament.

508
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
So vulgar.

509
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,680
Is she pretty or not?

510
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,760
Ask her.

511
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,840
I'm asking you.

512
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,560
Don't ask me.

513
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,520
Some people can't hear that she is pretty.

514
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
Excellent.

515
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,520
Okay, the pizza is good.

516
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
Enjoy it.

517
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,160
Brother, you're leaving?

518
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,160
I'm leaving.

519
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,800
Who is Adi?

520
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,880
How can you change it?

521
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,040
Can you follow the trend?

522
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,120
What's wrong?

523
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,240
Adi is the most famous singer.

524
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,160
But she has never been seen.

525
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,560
So mysterious.

526
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,160
Who is she?

527
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,560
Tang Ziyuan!

528
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,400
Why did you answer my call?

529
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,560
What do you think?

530
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
You little brat!

531
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
It's been so many days. Why are you still angry?

532
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,000
Aren't you angry too?

533
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,440
What's wrong?

534
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Are you angry?

535
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,560
I'm not angry anymore.

536
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
I checked.

537
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,760
There's nothing between you and Adi.

538
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,320
She has been staying in the hotel these days.

539
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,240
You've been in the studio too.

540
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,680
I misunderstood your relationship.

541
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,920
Okay.

542
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,200
I'm not angry anymore.

543
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,520
Don't be angry, okay?

544
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,680
Come on, hug me.

545
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,800
Amber, listen to me.

546
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,320
If you want to be with me,

547
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,400
you must fix your bad habit.

548
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,000
I can't stand you arguing for three days and making trouble for five days.

549
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,600
I can't stand your control.

550
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
Why are you so suspicious?

551
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,360
I suspect you because I care about you.

552
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,840
I have to work with different women every day.

553
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,440
If you can't fix your bad habit,

554
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,960
I'm sorry.

555
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,320
We can only break up.

556
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,880
Okay, I'll fix it.

557
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,120
But don't say that so easily, okay?

558
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,200
You told me before

559
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,280
you left me before I finished loving you.

560
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
Let go.

561
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,200
Let go.

562
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,400
Didn't you say you wanted to hug me?

563
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,160
You always make me angry and make me happy.

564
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,840
You're annoying.

565
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,360
Let's go.

566
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,440
Where are we going?

567
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,600
You're going to watch a movie a few days ago.

568
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Come on, let's go watch a movie.

569
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
You said you wanted to hug me.

570
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,800
I'm not going to do that.

571
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,080
I'm going to be with you.

572
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,400
I'm not going to be with you.

573
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
I'm going to be with you.

574
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
I'm going to be with you.

575
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,640
I'm going to be with you.

576
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,320
You said they had a fight.

577
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,280
It's hard to guess a man and a woman in love.

578
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,320
You want to know their feelings?

579
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,640
You can just find someone to fall in love with.

580
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,360
But someone like you

581
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,960
can't be with someone like that.

582
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,240
Really?

583
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,800
Let's go.

584
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,160
Let's go watch a movie.

585
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,320
Let's go watch a movie.

586
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,880
A movie about love?

587
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,360
You've already watched it, haven't you?

588
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,880
I watched it yesterday with Yindong.

589
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,960
You're so mean.

590
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,400
We made an appointment.

591
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,880
Don't be angry.

592
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,920
I'll go with you later.

593
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,200
I have something to do.

594
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
I don't need to.

595
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,720
Do you think only you have an appointment and I don't?

596
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
Who?

597
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,280
Wang Dongyu.

598
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,040
Who is Wang Dongyu?

599
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,760
He's a classmate of the culinary school.

600
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
Is he after you?

601
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,480
Come on.

602
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,760
We're just friends.

603
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,800
Friends?

604
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,480
My dear Wei.

605
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,240
I suddenly miss you.

606
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,560
I miss your serious look

607
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,280
at the culinary school.

608
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,200
I think you're very cute.

609
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,000
I miss you so much.

610
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,600
Give it back to me.

611
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,640
My god, Wei.

612
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
You're so cute.

613
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,600
I'm so happy.

614
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,880
How dare you say that you're just friends?

615
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,360
We're just friends.

616
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,880
I have no feelings for him.

617
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,680
Then who do you have feelings for?

618
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,760
I have no feelings for anyone.

619
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,360
Someone is calling.

620
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,440
Hurry up.

621
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,960
Answer it.

622
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,040
No.

623
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,960
Why not?

624
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,600
Kang Weiwei, you can't do that.

625
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,560
You can't talk to anyone like that.

626
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,080
You have to open yourself up.

627
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,320
I'm worried about you.

628
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,400
Hurry up.

629
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,160
I won't answer it.

630
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,080
Why won't you answer it?

631
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,800
You didn't even see his face.

632
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,280
He looks like a frog.

633
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,920
A frog?

634
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,280
He can turn into a prince.

635
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,760
Good shot.

636
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,640
You won again.

637
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,240
You just let me win.

638
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,000
I like fair competition.

639
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,080
I don't like this kind of victory.

640
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,120
I didn't let you win.

641
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,800
It's all your strength.

642
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,480
I know my strength.

643
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,640
We haven't played together for a long time.

644
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,360
Yes.

645
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,720
I've been ignored since we started dating.

646
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,440
Really?

647
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,880
Why do I feel like you're trying to get me out of your mind?

648
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,560
I'm not.

649
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,640
Brother.

650
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,960
I hope you won't affect our friendship

651
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,720
because of some emotions.

652
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,160
Don't worry.

653
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,920
I won't.

654
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,960
That's good.

655
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,400
I'll give you another assistant next week.

656
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,560
No need.

657
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,560
I have enough people in my store.

658
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,160
I really don't need it.

659
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,440
I don't want you to spend too much time in the flower shop.

660
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,240
You'll have more people to share your stress.

661
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,200
Then you'll have time to fall in love.

662
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,000
At the last party,

663
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,680
there were many pretty girls asking me about you.

664
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,240
To be honest,

665
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,160
I don't want to fall in love.

666
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,320
I think love is a luxury for me.

667
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,160
I'll tell you what, brother.

668
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,080
In the past,

669
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,840
love was an unreachable desire.

670
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,040
But in this age,

671
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,560
we can love and hate each other.

672
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,320
We can even make it more luxurious.

673
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,680
Love doesn't have to be temporary.

674
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,360
But you must leave a beautiful memory in your life.

675
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,360
So...

676
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,600
is Wan Jia your memory?

677
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,600
I don't want her to be my memory.

678
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,000
But I'm afraid she can't bear the pressure from my family.

679
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,640
Forget it.

680
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,600
Let's not talk about this. Let's do it again.

681
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,800
Let's talk about what kind of girl our big sister-in-law likes.

682
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,520
Everyone is anxious about you.

683
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,920
A popular singer, Aidi.

684
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,000
Look at Aidi.

685
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,000
She's good at singing.

686
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,360
She's beautiful.

687
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,360
She's beautiful and sweet.

688
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,040
She looks like a good singer.

689
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,640
How do you know if she's a good singer?

690
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,120
Besides,

691
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,760
everyone in Korea is a good singer.

692
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,080
Huang Youxi.

693
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,040
When did you post this photo?

694
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,000
Why did Aidi want to date you?

695
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,840
What?

696
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,960
This is the new main character of the show.

697
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,760
No way.

698
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,320
How could Aidi be your kind of singer?

699
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,600
What?

700
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,880
She's Aidi?

701
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,000
Yes.

702
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,080
A few days ago, I met her in the cafe in the hotel.

703
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,480
I asked her out.

704
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,880
She's the same person.

705
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,960
Yes.

706
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,120
Could she be Lan Sheng's sister?

707
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,560
No way.

708
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,400
Did my mom invite Aidi to sing at the bar?

709
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,640
Yes.

710
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,400
I see.

711
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,480
I understand.

712
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,000
Women are born to sacrifice for love.

713
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,800
She's going to live with us.

714
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,520
I'm so strong. How can I compete with you?

715
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Really?

716
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,240
The gossip magazine.

717
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,000
Weibo, WeChat, mobile phone.

718
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,840
What class are you in?

719
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,760
I'm in the self-study class.

720
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,840
Where's the book?

721
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,400
I think Ms Yang is in a bad mood.

722
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,880
Didn't you hear?

723
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,680
Ms Yang has been keeping a person in her heart.

724
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,040
Self-management.

725
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
Self-management.

726
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,160
A person's willpower determines his success.

727
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,720
Do you understand?

728
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Yes.

729
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,480
Give me a reason to be free from punishment.

730
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,080
Ms An.

731
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,080
Ms An.

732
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,560
We were talking about the school's music festival.

733
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,520
We need to raise money for the school.

734
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,880
I'm grateful that you don't want to demolish the building.

735
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,240
I don't need your help.

736
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,520
Actually, I can invite Aidi to the school.

737
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,600
You're crazy.

738
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,680
Don't be so sweet.

739
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,800
I'll invite her.

740
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
Don't worry.

741
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,840
Are you crazy?

742
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,680
You're crazy.

743
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,960
Are you really crazy?

744
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,640
Which village do you think you're from?

745
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,720
All the girls in the world are in love with you.

746
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,920
Just like you.

747
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
That's right.

748
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,200
And I think Aidi is just like you.

749
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,640
She's definitely not alone.

750
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,720
Liuxi.

751
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,440
Even if she's Aidi,

752
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,360
she might be single.

753
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,120
I knew it from the moment she came into our house.

754
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,040
She must be jealous of me.

755
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,800
Aidi lives in your house.

756
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Mr Hua.

757
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,480
You can't joke about this.

758
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,920
If I tell the board

759
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,120
that you failed, what will you say?

760
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,000
I'll quit school.

761
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,320
Sir.

762
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,160
Don't leave. I'm joking.

763
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,760
Okay.

764
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,040
I'll wait for you to quit school.

765
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,440
Mr Hua.

766
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,000
Don't be so mean.

767
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,560
You've been thinking about Aidi in your room.

768
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,120
Just because of that Aidi?

769
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,760
Miss Le Bao.

770
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,120
If you don't want to,

771
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,280
why did you join this team?

772
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,680
I'm not going to join your team.

773
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,800
I don't want people to misunderstand.

774
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,760
You're the only one who cares about her.

775
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,240
I don't want her to know that we're in the same boat.

776
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,320
Okay.

777
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,320
Since we're in the same boat,

778
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,560
you must help me

779
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,680
to invite Aidi to the concert in the school.

780
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,160
And you must complete this mission.

781
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,680
Besides, I'm good at singing.

782
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,880
If she thinks I'm a good match for her,

783
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,640
I'll be in trouble.

784
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,680
I don't want you to be a bad person.

785
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,160
I don't want to see you.

786
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,480
Lin.

787
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,720
Then you'll see.

788
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,920
I'll call her.

789
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Coming.

790
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,320
I'm home.

791
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,400
Hi.

792
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
Sorry to bother you.

793
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,040
No, it's okay.

794
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,680
I've cleaned up my son's room.

795
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,760
It's upstairs.

796
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,840
You can stay here.

797
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,600
Right.

798
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,520
If you want to play Ding Xiaorou in the movie,

799
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,240
you can stay in my room.

800
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,880
You can find their love story in there.

801
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,480
Have you read the magazine?

802
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,960
Everyone thinks you're like Aidi, the mysterious singer.

803
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,040
I'm not.

804
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,520
How is that possible?

805
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,040
If you're Aidi, how can you live in our house?

806
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,360
Our house is so ordinary.

807
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,440
Right.

808
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,040
Lin, I'm Aidi.

809
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,360
You're Miss Aidi?

810
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,720
I'm going to buy lottery tickets.

811
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,240
You're so stupid.

812
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,200
If you don't mind,

813
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,240
I'll go to the concert.

814
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,600
I'll go to the concert.

815
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,680
I'll go to the concert.

816
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,400
I still miss her.

817
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,480
I used to live here when I was a kid.

818
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,960
It's okay. My room is simple.

819
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
Come and see.

820
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,880
Thank you.

821
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,720
Our bar is back to life.

822
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,120
He's really Aidi.

823
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,000
But how did Aidi live in this house

824
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,120
because of his old age?

825
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,480
He even promised to be a singer in this bar.

826
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,560
That's incredible. He's so ungrateful.

827
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,880
I think he's here to get the debt.

828
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,480
To get the debt.

829
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,000
Did you hire him?

830
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,280
I swear to God, I didn't even touch his finger.

831
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,080
Is it you, Ding Yi?

832
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,720
No, it's impossible.

833
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,320
I met him at the festival when it was raining.

834
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,520
I've never met him.

835
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,120
Maybe he's really an old friend.

836
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,120
Maybe he used to live here.

837
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,680
Mom, can you do this?

838
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,200
There are so many girls who like me.

839
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,960
Can you love me?

840
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,480
Plus, I can't even count to ten.

841
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,240
Maybe. I mean maybe.

842
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,880
Give me three days and three nights.

843
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,400
I can think about it.

844
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,520
My two sons.

845
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,480
One is winter, the other is summer.

846
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,000
You two are my best friends.

847
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,680
Thank you.

848
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,080
You sing so well. Here you go.

849
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,280
Thank you, Director Ni Kang.

850
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,480
You're in our life because you want to know more about the characters.

851
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,080
I can say no.

852
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,720
I can guess you want to live in my neighbor's house.

853
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,000
But I don't want to live with my sister.

854
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,840
I'll move here for you.

855
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,040
Why are you so short-tempered?

856
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,680
The study room.

857
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,000
This is Jun Peru.

858
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,360
That's my girlfriend.

859
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,560
Go get something to drink.

860
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,680
Why is my opponent a singer?

861
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,960
I hate singing the most.

862
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,280
Enough.

863
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,400
You're a celebrity.

864
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,040
He can't beat you.

865
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,120
Even if I'm a celebrity,

866
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,760
I'm a rich second generation.

867
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,920
Unlike him,

868
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,760
he's so arrogant.

869
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,640
He's a man taking his girlfriend out

870
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,240
to see the car.

871
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,760
And he knows how to make paper.

872
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,200
My brother is such a bad person.

873
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,160
He's so bad.

874
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,080
What?

875
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,760
He even gave her flowers.

876
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,880
He never gave me flowers.

877
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,680
Tong Weiwei, don't tease him.

878
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,520
Amber,

879
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,560
Eddie is our idol.

880
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,120
Even if Zi Rui gave him flowers,

881
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,640
it's normal.

882
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,800
Don't think too much. It's okay.

883
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,280
How is it possible?

884
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,680
How can a woman who's taking her boyfriend out

885
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,320
be our idol?

886
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,680
I mean, can women

887
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,960
talk about something else

888
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,240
when they're together?

889
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,880
No.

890
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,480
You're too confident

891
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,680
about your boyfriend.

892
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,400
Really.

893
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,320
No.

894
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,440
You're too confident about him.

895
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,760
Look over there.

896
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,080
Your Yingdong

897
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,160
was also attracted by Eddie's

898
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,440
strong side.

899
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,080
Look at his smile.

900
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,600
That's it.

901
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:14,960
What's wrong?

902
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,080
Is there a problem?

903
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,000
You're so cute.

904
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,960
You're cute, aren't you?

905
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,000
Eddie looks so handsome.

906
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,520
So handsome.

907
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
I like Eddie.

908
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,440
Come on.

909
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,800
Come on, Weiwei, let's drink.

910
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,880
Weiwei,

911
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,360
let me talk to you.

912
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,560
Don't think too much.

913
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,760
I'm just kidding.

914
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,760
He and my brother are just friends.

915
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,040
I thought

916
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,960
Weiwei was going to lose her boyfriend.

917
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,040
What are you doing?

918
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,720
What are you doing?

919
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,040
Listen,

920
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,360
it's a good time to get away.

921
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,480
You can give Hua Youxi to Eddie

922
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,760
and tell him he changed his mind and doesn't want you.

923
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,800
Then you pretend to have a miscarriage

924
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,440
and let him live forever.

925
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,800
When you're ready to leave

926
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,280
You can stay in heaven

927
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,960
Da da da

928
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,240
Da da da

929
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,760
Da da da

930
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,600
Da da

931
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,000
There's a saying

932
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,920
Don't say it out

933
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,680
You will be good

934
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,360
Pull out a jab

935
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,760
이고

936
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,920
Scorpio

937
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,000
Uh AmA

938
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,680
leaning towards you

939
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,080
It's a 20%

940
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,160
chair

941
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,680
