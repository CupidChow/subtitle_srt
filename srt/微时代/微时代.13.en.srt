1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

5
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,000
Do you drive? Where are you going?

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

7
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Have you lost your temper?

8
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
No

9
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Then you can continue

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No more fuel

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
There is a gas station ahead

12
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Drive over and add fuel

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I can't add fuel

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What's wrong? The car is broken?

15
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
For a long time

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Whenever I want to give up

17
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I tell myself to add fuel

18
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
When I encounter a setback and want to run away

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I still tell myself to add fuel

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
More often

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I even feel desperate and can't see the future

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I still tell myself to add fuel, add fuel

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But now

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't even have any strength left

25
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I know

26
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I know the road of a singer is difficult

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You need to work harder for others

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Han Dingyi

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Are you still running away from the problem?

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I know you care about my safety

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But I think

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If you really don't want to face me and your situation

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You won't chase it out, right?

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Even I have the courage to face it

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What else do you have to worry about?

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm afraid to hurt you

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You have already hurt me

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I didn't mean to

40
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I finally understand now

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The person who says sorry

42
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Is the biggest winner

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I know this matter is very meaningful to you

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You can not forgive me

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But I have to say sorry

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Han Dingyi

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Han Dingyi

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You always speak so beautifully

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You are a person who never makes mistakes

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Do you know?

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm sorry

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I have no previous misunderstandings

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I will not be like today

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm sorry

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I always thought

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It was God who made up for my inferiority and ordinary

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So I met you in the lowest

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I like people

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I take your words as my role model

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I take your encouragement as my goal

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I just want to encourage you

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I know you are kind

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sorry

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But for me

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
In addition to love

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What can make me live in happiness

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Even I don't know myself

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We were very young at that time

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We don't understand anything at all

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Do you understand when you grow up?

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't think so

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I will never understand

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
They just pretend to understand

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So we have singers like us

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's so beautiful to sing love

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Just to encourage them

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Make them feel confident in love

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's not like that at all

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
After I became addicted, I met you

80
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I think it's God's grace

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But it always starts with beauty

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Break up

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I don't know what to say to you

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
To make up for you

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Can you make up for the pain in your memory?

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
If you can

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I can delete it

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Can you?

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I can't

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Actually, I also remember the love song when I was young

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I didn't lie to her

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Her voice is really nice

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I can't

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I can't

95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You see a lot of fans on Weibo

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Are you a man who is scolding Hua Yangxi?

97
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You deserve it

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Didn't An Bo tell them

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
They are not allowed to mention this again

100
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Don't you know

101
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The more people don't know

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The more gossip they like

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Xiao Qing

104
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Why are you so cruel?

105
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Because I am not the first woman he loves

106
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I thought I was the first

107
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But I didn't expect him to be so mean

108
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm not as stupid as you

109
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I still protect this bitch

110
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But it's our first love

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Isn't that enough?

112
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Look at him these days

113
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Don't you feel bad?

114
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Why should I feel bad for him?

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This is just the beginning

116
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The good show is just beginning

117
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Eddie is gone

118
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What about the school concert?

119
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I think he will tell the school

120
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Why are you so hateful?

121
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You let others go and let yourself go

122
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Isn't that good?

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm like this

124
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So I will use you to pretend to be pregnant

125
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let him sit in a bad position

126
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You are so stupid

127
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You will end up like this

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You can't say that

129
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You are willing

130
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Right?

131
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Because you don't think this is wrong

132
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But Hua Youxi

133
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Won't look at you

134
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You are so sad

135
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You are pushing your friend to death

136
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I am very sad

137
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I am so stupid

138
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I always treat you as a friend

139
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I always listen to you

140
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Does Amber know about this?

141
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Why should I tell Amber everything?

142
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Just because she has money?

143
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I am not as cruel as you

144
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
She is spoiled because she has

145
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Wu Yuting as her father

146
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But she can't be arrogant

147
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Because her father will control her

148
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What are you talking about?

149
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I am not talking nonsense

150
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's the waiter who told me

151
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I won't support Amber to be a producer

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
When Amber doesn't have value

153
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Do you think Kang Zirui will want her?

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yes

155
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Because they really love each other

156
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Really love each other

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
How many women did Kang Zirui love?

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't believe it

159
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't believe Amber Siqi

160
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Why do you believe it?

161
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Don't you think you are funny?

162
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I have to tell you one more thing

163
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Amber has been with him

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
because she is ashamed of Hua Youxi

165
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Maybe

166
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
they have already

167
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
put out the fire of love

168
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and are now sleeping

169
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Don't talk nonsense

170
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Amber won't

171
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Do you know if Amber will?

172
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Keep talking

173
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I always think of you as a friend

174
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Really?

175
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I always thought I was only your maid

176
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
No need to go

177
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
She is my friend

178
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Don't forget

179
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
There is nothing in the Northeast

180
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Who introduced you to them?

181
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Who introduced you to the part-time job?

182
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Don't listen to her

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You can stay in Shanghai

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
because of your friendship and loyalty to your friends

185
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I will ask you one last time

186
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Will you go with me?

187
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I am sorry, Amber

188
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Xiao Qiao didn't mean it

189
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
She is not in a good mood today

190
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
She is envious of you

191
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's okay

192
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I never take her as a friend

193
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I never take anyone as a friend

194
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Until I met Wan Jia

195
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Weiwei and you

196
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I have a part too

197
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I have a part too

198
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Of course

199
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't like to be alone since I was a child

200
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I hope

201
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I can have many friends

202
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's good to have everyone together

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But I didn't expect

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
things to be like this

205
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Can we face it calmly?

206
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I am really afraid of losing you

207
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Don't worry

208
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It will pass

209
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
We will not leave you

210
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Okay?

211
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It will pass

212
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I will go with you

213
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Did you sleep with your brother?

214
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No, I slept with my brother

215
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I am warning you not to talk nonsense

216
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You didn't sleep with anyone

217
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You just hold hands until dawn

218
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I don't believe it

219
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I am warning you not to talk nonsense

220
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Do you understand the people's opinion?

221
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Mr. Kang, I heard you are in love with Hua Youxi

222
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I heard she fell from the school's school board

223
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
to the bottom

224
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
If she is involved in the concert

225
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
everyone will not forgive her

226
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The poster is out

227
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The tickets are sold out

228
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You told me you can't buy tickets

229
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You said you can't buy tickets

230
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Go, go now

231
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Mr. Lu

232
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I am sorry

233
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I don't know what to say

234
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I can't come to the concert

235
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Can I buy tickets?

236
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Who will pay the money?

237
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I will pay the loan

238
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Loan?

239
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
They are all mortgage loans

240
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What are you mortgage?

241
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't care, you can handle it yourself

242
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I can't handle it now

243
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
How can you?

244
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Isn't it because she likes you?

245
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You can go and flirt with her

246
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
She likes my brother, not me

247
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Then let Dingyi handle it

248
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
My brother can't handle it now

249
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't know what to do

250
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't know if I can go to the concert

251
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's up to you

252
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Don't go to our dorm tonight

253
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What are you two doing?

254
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's not the time

255
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Hand them over to me

256
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I will call the police

257
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Brother, is it that bad?

258
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The contract is still in the period

259
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I haven't paid the deposit

260
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Why are you so anxious?

261
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I will pay the deposit

262
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Anben

263
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I am the big shareholder of the movie

264
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
If you don't mind

265
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What do you mean?

266
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I want you to understand

267
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I am not helping Zirui to make money

268
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I just want to help my friend achieve his dream

269
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
When did you two become friends?

270
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's not for mutual interests

271
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Kang Zirui, I just had a temper with you

272
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You just found out

273
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Enough, stop arguing

274
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
We are here to solve problems

275
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
For an ID

276
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Everyone is so unhappy

277
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Do you know?

278
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
He has signed the movie contract

279
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The deposit has been paid

280
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I am concerned about whether he will appear in my movie

281
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Ding Yi, where is the ID?

282
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Tell us as soon as you know

283
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Don't delay our business

284
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Don't ask

285
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
A woman can leave her job and disappear

286
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Will there be anything else besides love?

287
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I think he needs time to calm down

288
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I don't have time to wait for him to calm down

289
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I have to explain to the media

290
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Actually you just hurt the expectation of ID for love

291
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If you can really pursue him

292
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Let him confirm his love

293
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Then this matter is over

294
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
My brother doesn't like ID

295
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I can't let him take me to the police

296
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I will apologize to him

297
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Ding Yi, ID's heart is still counting on you

298
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Don't expect me

299
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I think the person ID doesn't want to see most

300
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Should be me

301
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But whether ID can forgive me

302
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I will always treat him as my friend

303
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Except for pursuing him

304
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I am willing to do anything for him

305
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Ding Yi, you are kind and honest

306
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
This is your advantage

307
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But ID has been working in society for so long

308
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Many things are not as simple as you think

309
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
He is really simple

310
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
He is a person with a very heavy heart

311
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I will not betray him

312
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Brother, listen to me

313
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Don't take the feelings of a product too seriously

314
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What do you mean by this?

315
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Only a few rich people can receive such information

316
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
From female stars to singers

317
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The price is very high

318
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
A meal with a meal

319
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
From tens of thousands to millions

320
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
ID's name is also in it

321
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You can't insult ID like this

322
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I didn't want to show you

323
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I was afraid to hurt your relationship with ID

324
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But the situation is different now

325
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm afraid you will be hurt

326
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You guys are sober

327
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Don't be a toy in their hands

328
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Such a star

329
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Can't explain any problem

330
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
ID is not that kind of person

331
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Han Ding Yi, I am very disappointed in you

332
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I am also very disappointed in you

333
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I know Luo Yi hurt you a lot

334
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I can understand

335
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But you can't become a person without feelings

336
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I said don't mention Luo Yi in front of me

337
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I don't believe in feelings

338
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It has nothing to do with you

339
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It has nothing to do with me

340
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But it has something to do with Wan Jia

341
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
If you are not a person with feelings

342
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Then what do you think of her?

343
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I knew you would mention Wan Jia

344
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I treat her as something

345
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It has nothing to do with you

346
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Because she chose me

347
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Not you

348
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Ying Dong, don't do this

349
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Ying Dong, didn't we also make an appointment with the senior who will be the host?

350
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Ying Dong, I am in a bad mood

351
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You accompany me to go

352
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
These people are very bad at chatting

353
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I don't want to drive alone

354
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Let's go

355
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Don't worry about my things

356
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You continue

357
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I am her friend

358
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I have the right to care about her

359
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Her thing

360
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It has nothing to do with you

361
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Your wish

362
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Will only make you more pitiful

363
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Do you know why she chose me and not you?

364
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Because I have money

365
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Wrong

366
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Because you are too cowardly

367
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You will not fight for your love

368
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You will always live in your own little world

369
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You have no man's ambition

370
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Can I give Wan Jia everything she wants?

371
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Can you?

372
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Similarly

373
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
If Eddie has a chance

374
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
He will also choose me

375
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But I will not be like you

376
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Look at her one more time

377
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Because a woman like this

378
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Not worth it

379
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Brother

380
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Brother

381
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Brother, let's talk

382
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
How are you?

383
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Look

384
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I am fine

385
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Han Dingyi

386
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I have always admired your courage

387
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
This is also the reason I gave you the opportunity

388
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But at least you have to know

389
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What are you doing?

390
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You think we are friends

391
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Actually

392
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Nothing

393
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Friends can solve problems with fists?

394
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What is the problem?

395
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Maybe the answer is just that one

396
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That one

397
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Are you for Eddie

398
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Or Wan Jia?

399
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
No

400
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
No

401
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
No

402
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's Amber

403
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And

404
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Zi Rui and your father

405
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
They have fought several times

406
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You should give them back

407
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Did Han Dingyi call again?

408
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
No

409
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
William sent you a message

410
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What did he say?

411
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
What did he say?

412
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
He said

413
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
There is a reply

414
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
There are three European artists

415
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
They are interested in my painting

416
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
He can come to Europe

417
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
To do a small tour

418
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And arrange a North American exhibition

419
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And help me participate in the most important

420
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Young artists

421
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Award selection

422
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
As for the promotion

423
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You don't need to know

424
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Before you met my father

425
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
This is the fastest way to get closer

426
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You don't like it

427
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Or you are doubting your talent?

428
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I am thinking

429
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Is it possible to live in this world

430
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
As long as you have money?

431
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Of course

432
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But in my world

433
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I have to control everything

434
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Is it really that important

435
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
To control everything?

436
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I want to control

437
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
To use my ability

438
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
To help others

439
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
To achieve a future

440
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
To help others to achieve their dreams

441
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Is a great thing

442
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Like I opened a store for Han Dingyi

443
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
To make films for Kang Zirui

444
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I enjoy everything

445
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
About my friends

446
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I know

447
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
This is the way you express love

448
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
They

449
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Will be like me one day

450
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Will understand you

451
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
No

452
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
They will always think I am doing business

453
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
They will never care

454
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
My achievements in business

455
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Are all in my father's light

456
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Only through them

457
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I can get another eye-catching painting

458
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
But just now

459
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I feel I am childish

460
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I am wasting my resources

461
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Why should I spend money

462
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
To do these things

463
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
That I can't do well

464
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Yingdong

465
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Don't think like that

466
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Han Dingyi

467
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Maybe because of what happened to him recently

468
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
He is feeling a little upset

469
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
He was just impulsive

470
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Don't say that

471
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I am not suggesting you stand in his shoes

472
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I am not suggesting you stand in his shoes

473
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You have been friends for so many years

474
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You can say a few nice words for him

475
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
But Han Dingyi

476
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
He can't do big things

477
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Because he is too weak

478
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
He is too weak to others

479
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And he is too strong to himself

480
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
If he can vent his anger on me

481
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I will definitely be able to see him in his dreams

482
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
But he didn't

483
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
He didn't cherish the chance I gave him

484
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
He didn't feel sorry for losing a friend like me

485
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
No

486
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
He is not a stranger

487
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
He is just a little dumb

488
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
He doesn't know how to express himself

489
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
But he knows everything in his heart

490
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
This painting shop business is too small for me

491
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I don't want to make money from it

492
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I just want to give more to my friends

493
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I just want to give more to my friends

494
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Now I have some experience

495
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Now I have some experience

496
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It's time for me to choose some friends who are valuable to me

497
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I don't want to be too close to them

498
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I don't want to be too close to them

499
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It's normal for friends to have some conflicts

500
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
It's normal for friends to have some conflicts

501
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Just like Weiwei and I

502
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
We often fight

503
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
But after the fight

504
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
The relationship is better than before

505
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
But I am different from you

506
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Since you appeared

507
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
My friendship with Dingyi is destined to end

508
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
My friendship with Dingyi is destined to end

509
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
The ID just speed up the end of this relationship

510
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Why can't we live together?

511
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Why can't we live together?

512
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Of course not

513
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Love is selfish

514
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It's a matter of two people

515
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
It's not allowed to have one more person

516
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
No matter how good the relationship is

517
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Since you chose me

518
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
You should know right from wrong

519
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You know what kind of person you are with

520
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
You know what kind of person you are with

521
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You know what kind of person you are with

522
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Do you understand?

523
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Do you understand?

524
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Can you talk to me?

525
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You are so quiet

526
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I am not used to it

527
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
My brother's restaurant might close

528
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
No way

529
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Will Yingdong really treat Dingge like this?

530
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
What do you think?

531
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Okay, okay, let's not talk about this

532
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Okay?

533
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Hua Youxi is very unhappy today

534
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
So let's go to the bar and have a bath

535
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Let's go to the bar and have a bath

536
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Let's go to the bar and have a bath

537
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You are a good man, right?

538
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
You have a problem

539
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You are a good man, right?

540
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You are a good man, right?

541
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
But

542
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
But I still like you

543
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You are happy every day

544
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
You are like a little ghost

545
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Little ghost

546
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I am glad I can be a martial artist

547
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Then you go after her, okay?

548
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Women are the softest

549
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
You can chase her in the most primitive way

550
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
What?

551
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
You are so annoying

552
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I tell you

553
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You are so annoying

554
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You are so annoying

555
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So from tomorrow

556
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
You will stick to her

557
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You will stick to her

558
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
When she can't leave you

559
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You will disappear

560
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Don't care about her anymore

561
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I really miss you

562
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I miss you so much

563
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
No matter who you are

564
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You can win her over

565
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
What if I really chase her?

566
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
What will you do?

567
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Me?

568
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
It doesn't matter

569
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
As long as you are happy

570
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
What about the child?

571
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I will call the police

572
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You think my life is not bad enough?

573
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
My mom told me since I was a child

574
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
You should admit your mistakes

575
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You should bear them

576
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
This is what a man should do

577
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
This is the first time you hold my hand so seriously

578
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Is it?

579
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Huang Xiaoxi

580
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I really want to remember this feeling for the rest of my life

581
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Silly girl

582
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Silly girl

583
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Huang Xiaoxi

584
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
What did you do wrong?

585
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Who doesn't make mistakes?

586
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
We are all young

587
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
We can't lie

588
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I am the privilege of young people

589
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
No one can control me

590
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Meibao

591
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Do you know

592
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
This is the first time I feel so good to have you

593
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I am so happy

594
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Can you say it again?

595
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You are the best

596
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Why are you crying?

597
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
You are finally smiling

598
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You are so handsome when you smile

599
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Really?

600
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
You are so handsome

601
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
You are so handsome

602
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You are so handsome

603
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
You are so handsome

604
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
You are so handsome

605
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
You are so handsome

606
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
You are so handsome

607
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
You are so handsome

608
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
You are so handsome

609
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
You are so handsome

610
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You are so handsome

611
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
You are so handsome

612
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You are so handsome

613
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
You are so handsome

614
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
The snow-covered winter

615
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
will put on the song of a three-deck train

616
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,000
A gentle summer night

617
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
entrusted to me by the breeze

618
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Now we have changed our appearance

619
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,000
We are busy with our daily life

620
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But when we think of the past

621
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Your eyes will shine

622
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Now we have changed our appearance

623
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Life is full of hope

624
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,000
If we could go back to the past

625
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Even if there is only one night

626
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:09,000
If we could go back to the past

627
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Even if there is only one night

628
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I am happy that I can go back to Shanghai and go back to my mother school

629
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I feel happy that I can go back to my mother school

630
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
So before I leave, I want to share with you something

631
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It is to cherish what you have now

632
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Live in the present

633
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Don't regret the glory you had before

634
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Don't regret the mistakes you made before

635
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Don't blindly look forward to the future

636
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I think the most attractive part of youth is when you make a mistake

637
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
You can have a chance to come back

638
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So cherish the person who understands you

639
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I hope the video Luo Yi talked about in the mother school is useful to you

640
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So I brought it here for you

641
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Did you send it here to represent him?

642
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I always represent myself

643
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I guess you want to talk to someone now

644
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So I came here

645
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Thank you

646
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Do you have something that you can't understand?

647
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I am sorry

648
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I might lose my job after graduation

649
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Didn't you do well in the kitchen?

650
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
The kitchen is probably going to close soon

651
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Ding Yi was impulsive today

652
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
He hit Ying Dong

653
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Why?

654
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Because Ying Dong said something unintentional

655
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
He said that actresses in the entertainment industry are not serious about their feelings

656
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I am not in your life

657
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I am also affecting your life

658
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
After graduation, Ding Yi was not in your world

659
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
He was also secretly affecting your life

660
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
He ruined my first love dream

661
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I also ruined his career base

662
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Tell me, who is right and who is wrong?

663
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Tell me, who is right and who is wrong?

664
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I think in the world of love, there is no one who is right and who is wrong

665
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Maybe you just need a little bit more to get Ding Yi's heart

666
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
He will regret losing you sooner or later

667
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Do you know?

668
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Maybe I am disappointed because he never appeared in my memory

669
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Maybe I owe him something

670
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
From imagination to cognition

671
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
In the end, I found out that we are not in a suitable process

672
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
No

673
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
If you allow it, I believe that Ding Yi will definitely pursue you

674
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Is it to make the people around him happy?

675
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I don't want this kind of twisted love

676
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
This is not the first love I imagined

677
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
This is not the first love I imagined

678
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
There are many things that cannot be returned if they happen

679
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Which woman can truly control her first love dream?

680
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You don't have to eat breakfast with me so early

681
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
You think who can sleep after such a big thing happened yesterday?

682
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
You don't have to worry about this

683
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Xiao Qiao has told me that your father will not touch this for you

684
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I am sorry

685
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I will not touch this for you

686
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I don't know what happened after Vivi found Eddie last night

687
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
The appearance of Eddie has messed up our world

688
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Why do you still care about him so much?

689
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
As long as he is willing to go to the movies and have a concert in your school

690
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Everything will return to normal

691
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Do you understand, little heart?

692
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Have you ever heard that when a woman is in love, she is always looking at the mirror?

693
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
You? I think you are a microscope

694
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I am sorry

695
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Brother, I am here

696
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Hello

697
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Good morning, can we go now?

698
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Can we go now?

699
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I went to the recording studio yesterday and met Eddie

700
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Really?

701
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
He really needs some time to calm down

702
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
It's okay, I have made the final plan

703
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Xiao Ji, I have a class in the morning

704
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I sent the house to the blackboard

705
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I will be back in five minutes

706
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Brother Eddie, Brother Ying Dong called me today

707
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
He said that when you go to class, he will find someone to check the accounts

708
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
He is the boss, he has given all the power to the bank

709
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Give this to him, all the accounts are in it

710
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Brother, thank you

711
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Oh, right, who took the car keys?

712
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
No need to be guilty, you just don't drive today

713
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Men are like this, they are always guilty

714
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
You put the keys in the drawer, you don't have to give it to Ying Dong today

715
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Brother Ying, today my electric car is for you

716
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Brother Ying, today my electric car is for you

717
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
We are leaving now, take care of the shop

718
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Bye bye Xiao Ji

719
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Playing games, playing games, playing games

720
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Playing games, playing games, playing games

721
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Playing games, playing games, playing games

722
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Ladies only play games

723
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Playing games, playing games, playing games

724
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Playing games, playing games, playing games

725
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Playing games, playing games, playing games

726
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Playing games, playing games, playing games

727
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Playing games

728
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I don't know what I should tell Mr. Lan.

729
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I really hope this event will be a success.

730
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
We're relieved that you're here.

731
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Tianyi.

732
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Hello.

733
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It's been a long time.

734
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Long time no see.

735
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
You've lost weight.

736
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I'm not that fat.

737
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I'm not that fat.

738
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I...

739
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I've been thinking a lot these days.

740
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
The reunion between us

741
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
has brought you a lot of trouble.

742
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I'm sorry.

743
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I don't want my obsession

744
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
to affect everyone's life.

745
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
So,

746
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
this school concert

747
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
and the movie of the island

748
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
will be my responsibility.

749
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Why did you become an idol?

750
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
You're so generous.

751
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Life goes on.

752
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Yes.

753
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
But,

754
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
should we stop

755
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
those unnecessary comments?

756
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
This is what I'm most worried about.

757
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Lu Yi.

758
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Maybe one of you

759
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
will be in trouble.

760
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I'll take care of it.

761
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
The best thing is

762
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
there will be no excuses

763
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
When you're in need

764
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
you can

765
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
look up to the sky

766
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
There's a saying

767
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Don't say anything

768
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
You'll be fine

769
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Don't hesitate

770
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
to reach out your hand

771
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Block the wind for me

772
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Bring rain for me

773
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Teach me to stop

774
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
and move forward

775
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I've been hurt

776
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I've been hurt

777
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
You must stay with me

778
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Let's drink up

779
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Let us shout out loud

780
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Let us shut our mouths

781
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Let us walk on the streets that are drunk

782
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
We walked to the end

783
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
No need for any reason

784
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
We've been through so much together

785
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
But it's still the most important thing

786
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
We know that the best

787
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
We will have that moment

788
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
When we need each other the most

789
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
We can stand still and watch

790
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,000
In our times

791
00:44:50,000 --> 00:45:00,000
We will be together
