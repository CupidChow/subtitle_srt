00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,440
Hi, Genie.

2
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,957
Class president?

3
00:00:37,056 --> 00:00:38,676
Seriously…

4
00:00:38,676 --> 00:00:41,028
this is very interesting.

5
00:00:41,028 --> 00:00:42,057
Don't you think?

6
00:00:42,057 --> 00:00:43,660
<i>What was his name?</i>

7
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,340
<i>He's the Class president and first<br>in our class. That's all I know.</i>

8
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,646
I… have a lot of questions for you.

9
00:00:50,646 --> 00:00:52,485
What about you?

10
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,500
Is there anything you want to ask me?

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,310
<i>Fake glasses.</i>

12
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,340
<i>That layered look.</i>

13
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,370
<i>He's usually very subdued and seems nonchalant.</i>

14
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,330
<i>You and I are the same.</i>

15
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,560
<i>We hide who we really are.</i>

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,640
<i>(SHADOW BEAUTY)</i><br><i>(EPISODE 4: CONSEQUENCE OF SECRETS)</i>

17
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:17,513
How did you know?

18
00:01:17,513 --> 00:01:20,770
Because you make such stupid mistakes.

19
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,820
Exactly a month ago,

20
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,162
you wanted to post a picture<br>in a school girl outfit.

21
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:30,547
<i>(THAT'S OUR SCHOOL UNIFORM)</i><br>But right after you posted it,

22
00:01:30,547 --> 00:01:33,477
you realized the uniform<br>can give away the school name.

23
00:01:33,477 --> 00:01:35,970
So you deleted it.

24
00:01:36,662 --> 00:01:39,342
However, in that short time,

25
00:01:39,342 --> 00:01:42,020
bloggers captured<br>that picture and posted it.

26
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,680
That problematic picture was widely spread even after it was erased.

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,980
When I saw that, it caught my interest.

28
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,999
There is no Genie in our school.

29
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:56,420
Who could have<br>lent her our school uniform?

30
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,916
I wondered.

31
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,880
Or could someone be pretending…

32
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,329
to be Genie?

33
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,589
Could she be deceiving us?

34
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:08,740
It hasn't been long<br>since the collar design was changed.

35
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,332
So the possibility<br>of her being a graduate was zero.

36
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:15,490
If I edit the picture, I could pick out <br> the ones with a similar physique

37
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,967
and with pretty faces in each grade.

38
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:21,310
Bae Su-yeon, a freshman.

39
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,510
She's computer-illiterate, so she can't be Genie.

40
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,375
Famous for her Photoshop skills, Go Hae-mi, a senior,

41
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,590
has unusual makeup skills.

42
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,750
So that leaves her out.

43
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,790
Yang Ha-neul. She has moderate looks and is good at makeup.

44
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,420
She was the most promising candidate.

45
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,050
Not only that, Yang Ha-neul

46
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:47,078
used products sponsored by Genie very often.

47
00:02:47,078 --> 00:02:49,836
But I found out later

48
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:54,466
they all came from one person.

49
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,350
It was you.

50
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,341
Koo Ae-jin.

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,530
Even so I didn't think it'd be you.

52
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,230
I'm not trying to insult you.

53
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,241
I'm just being realistic.

54
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:09,815
Nevertheless.

55
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:12,070
Thankfully…

56
00:03:14,587 --> 00:03:17,307
you made a second mistake.

57
00:03:17,307 --> 00:03:21,100
Phones were collected on exam day and delivered to the teacher.

58
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,173
There was a phone continuously ringing.

59
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:28,381
It turned out, they were social media notifications.

60
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:31,380
The only person to continuously<br>receive social media notifications.

61
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,489
Who else could it be but Genie?

62
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:38,549
I thought by any chance,

63
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:40,738
could it be Genie's phone?

64
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:42,203
Why did I think that?

65
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:47,164
Just that morning, Genie uploaded a picture.

66
00:03:47,164 --> 00:03:48,500
<i>Take your phones, please!</i>

67
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,500
After that, I observed

68
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,310
who would take that phone carefully.

69
00:03:56,968 --> 00:03:58,648
It was you again.

70
00:03:58,648 --> 00:04:00,332
Koo Ae-jin.

71
00:04:00,332 --> 00:04:03,900
<i>What a horrible bastard!</i>

72
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:07,798
Of course I didn't jump to a conclusion that it was you

73
00:04:07,798 --> 00:04:10,550
just from that incident.

74
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:15,188
I am very cautious.

75
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,060
But the picture you posted that morning connected you

76
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,370
with Genie.

77
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:31,687
But why didn't you say anything then?

78
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:34,430
Why are you bringing this up now?

79
00:04:37,395 --> 00:04:38,955
There you go!

80
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:41,840
That is a great question.

81
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:47,795
That's because I didn't have proof.

82
00:04:47,795 --> 00:04:52,980
Coincidence and conviction alone wouldn't make you confess the truth.

83
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,886
<i>What an investigative nerd!</i>

84
00:04:55,886 --> 00:04:58,225
While I was pondering what to do,

85
00:04:58,225 --> 00:05:01,759
you came to me on your own

86
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,145
to that cafe that I often go to.

87
00:05:04,145 --> 00:05:05,950
<i>Shit!</i>

88
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:31,971
Well, that's that, then.

89
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:35,020
Who else knows besides you?

90
00:05:38,494 --> 00:05:40,374
Why?

91
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:42,485
Why?

92
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:44,298
You want to kill me?

93
00:05:44,298 --> 00:05:45,982
What?

94
00:05:47,837 --> 00:05:49,997
I'm just kidding.

95
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,420
In horror movies, they kill you when somebody asks you that.

96
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,765
No one knows besides me.

97
00:05:57,765 --> 00:06:00,416
And I don't want others to know.

98
00:06:01,286 --> 00:06:04,126
What is it you want?

99
00:06:07,488 --> 00:06:09,958
What can you do for me?

100
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:14,651
I don't think you need money.

101
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,371
You're a better student than I am.

102
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:28,456
If you want me to kneel down and beg, then I will.

103
00:06:32,954 --> 00:06:34,544
Ae-jin.

104
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:37,086
I want to be the only one

105
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:41,890
who knows and enjoys this secret.

106
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,263
There's only one thing I want.

107
00:06:44,263 --> 00:06:47,420
I want to see the real you.

108
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,070
You just have to answer my questions sincerely and honestly.

109
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,160
<i>This bastard is a crazy psycho.</i>

110
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,710
My girlfriend is coming to my house right now.

111
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,050
<i>What do you expect me to do?</i>

112
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,694
Yang Ha-neul.

113
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,880
Ha-neul is my girlfriend.

114
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,950
And Ha-neul is Lambsky.

115
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,415
Isn't she your best friend?

116
00:07:17,415 --> 00:07:21,658
Of course, it's only online where she's Genie's best friend.

117
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:29,080
How will Ha-neul react when she finds out you're Genie?

118
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:35,560
When she finds out that the girl she admires most is Koo Ae-jin,

119
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,827
a loser,

120
00:07:36,827 --> 00:07:40,470
who transferred here not too long ago?

121
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:55,440
Mirror, mirror, who is the prettiest of them all?

122
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:58,440
Yang Ha-neul!

123
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,433
Yang Ha-neul!

124
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:04,105
I'm going to send this to Jjin!

125
00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:06,200
Pretty.

126
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,061
Tell me.

127
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:10,451
When did you two become friends?

128
00:08:10,451 --> 00:08:14,463
And why are you lying to Ha-neul?

129
00:08:18,104 --> 00:08:21,060
<i>As expected, Jjin, you have an eye for fashion!</i>

130
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,761
<i>The scarf idea is so cute</i>

131
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:27,088
<i>I'm on my way to my boyfriend's</i>

132
00:08:27,088 --> 00:08:28,876
<i>(ONE YEAR AGO)</i><br><i>About a year ago,</i>

133
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:31,683
<i>when I first opened the Genie account…</i>

134
00:08:31,683 --> 00:08:33,590
I didn't have anyone to give it to.

135
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,440
<i>Sharing sponsored product events.</i>

136
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,390
<i>Make an acrostic with my name.</i>

137
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,317
Jigusange*.<i>(Means 'in the world'. <br> Ji-ni is the Korean pronunciation for 'Genie'.)</i>

138
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:41,660
Ni ga jeil yeppo* (<i>You're the prettiest.</i>)

139
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:46,171
<i>Well I wish I really was Genie.</i>

140
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:50,010
<i>Jigeum e sungan jamsirado:<br>even in this moment</i>

<i>Ni ga naigo: I wish you were me</i>

142

<i>Nae ga neoyeosseumyeon jokesseo:<br>and I wish I was you.</i>

143
00:08:58,012 --> 00:08:59,147
<i>Genie,</i>

144
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:01,830
<i>thank you for<br>the moisturizing cream and star earrings.</i>

145
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,210
<i>Hope you like them.</i>

146
00:09:05,756 --> 00:09:07,860
<i>Genie, I can't believe we're the same age.</i>

147
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,367
<i>This is amazing.</i>

148
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:12,340
<i>What do you think about being friends?</i>

149
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,754
<i>Friends?</i>

150
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:17,160
<i>Sure. Let's be friends.</i>

151
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,394
<i>Really?</i>

152
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:19,600
<i>My name is Lambsky.</i>

153
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,424
It literally means Yang Ha-neul*.<br><i>(Yang means sheep and Haneul means sky)</i>

154
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:24,270
<i>Is Genie your real name?</i>

155
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,130
<i>My name is Goo Hui-jin.</i>

156
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,403
<i>Hui-jin?</i>

157
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:34,163
<i>That's such a pretty name.</i>

158
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,440
<i>I hate my dad more<br>than anything in the world.</i>

159
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,420
<i>I can't remember<br>the last time he contacted me.</i>

160
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,770
<i>Kids in my school think I was born in a rich family.</i>

161
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,452
<i>Jjin. I've never told anyone before.</i>

162
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:49,569
<i>Sorry if I overwhelmed you.</i>

163
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:50,628
<i>What?</i>

164
00:09:50,628 --> 00:09:53,138
<i>I wasn't overwhelmed at all.</i>

165
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:57,410
<i>To be honest.. I don't like my mother</i>

166
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,558
<i>What! Really?</i>

167
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,293
<i>Ha-neul, I've never</i>

168
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:07,800
<i>told this to anyone before.</i>

169
00:10:12,782 --> 00:10:15,092
Why is the door open?

170
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,810
Ho-in, I'm here!

171
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,000
Ho-in!

172
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:24,768
Where is he?

173
00:10:31,068 --> 00:10:32,356
<i>(LAMBSKY)</i>

174
00:10:32,356 --> 00:10:34,383
She must have arrived at my house.

175
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,588
Actually, I wanted you two to meet.

176
00:10:37,588 --> 00:10:39,232
You could make up.

177
00:10:39,232 --> 00:10:43,673
Making up is between two people who had a fight.

178
00:10:43,673 --> 00:10:46,640
I never had a fight with her.

179
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,157
She's the one who hates me.

180
00:10:49,157 --> 00:10:53,232
If you get to know her, she's actually not that bad.

181
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:54,253
<i>Hey!</i>

182
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:57,760
<i>I know her better than you do.</i>

183
00:11:01,282 --> 00:11:02,882
I'll see you next time.

184
00:11:02,882 --> 00:11:06,587
I still have a lot of questions.

185
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,590
<i>(LAMBSKY)<br>On a date with my boyfriend</i>

186
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,880
<i>What is my Jjin doing?</i>

187
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:45,769
<i>Jjin, looking at the sky?</i>

188
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:47,036
<i>Do you want to see the sky?</i>

189
00:11:47,036 --> 00:11:49,090
<i>Wish I could see it with you.</i>

190
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,710
<i>Dreaming of that day.</i>

191
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,910
<i>Here's my gift.</i>

192
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,630
<i>Pretty girl next to a pretty girl.</i>

193
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,528
<i>Right?</i>

194
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,243
Good afternoon.

195
00:12:14,245 --> 00:12:15,645
It's so beautiful!

196
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:18,046
This is really nice!

197
00:12:18,046 --> 00:12:19,870
But there's no one here.

198
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,790
It's a cafe that opens tomorrow.

199
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,690
I asked this hyung I know for a favor.

200
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:30,048
Here you can take pictures

201
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:32,161
very comfortably.

202
00:12:33,302 --> 00:12:37,102
Are you thinking of doing a live stream without telling me

203
00:12:37,102 --> 00:12:39,900
or doing a public shooting<br>on a community website?

204
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,977
No way.

205
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:47,367
Why would I share something this exciting?

206
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,316
It'd be a waste.

207
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,859
<i>Get a grip, Koo Ae-jin!</i>

208
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:57,116
<i>Don't let your guard down.</i>

209
00:13:01,853 --> 00:13:03,497
But,

210
00:13:03,497 --> 00:13:06,470
if it's a cafe that opens tomorrow,<br>there won't be any employees.

211
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,932
Of course.

212
00:13:07,932 --> 00:13:10,919
This is completely confidential.

213
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:15,340
Well, that also means there is no coffee.

214
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:18,461
Yes, you're right.

215
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:21,400
I'll go to a convenience store and get some coffee.

216
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,500
Wait.

217
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,848
You should leave your glasses.

218
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:26,790
My glasses?

219
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,700
- Why my glasses?<br>- I just wanted to try them on.

220
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,474
Those glasses don't have lenses anyway.

221
00:13:33,474 --> 00:13:35,202
Sure.

222
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,420
There's usually<br>a mini hidden camera in these.

223
00:13:48,773 --> 00:13:50,953
What are you doing?

224
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,820
Why are you back so soon?

225
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,710
I was going to ask you if you wanted a latte or iced Americano.

226
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:02,330
- This is ridiculous.<br>- Just in case…

227
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:07,796
What are you doing, you lunatic?

228
00:14:07,796 --> 00:14:10,425
You perverted, investigative nerd!

229
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,120
Look carefully.

230
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,969
This is how I really look.

231
00:14:15,969 --> 00:14:18,700
The reason I'm showing you this

232
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,637
is to show you I'm not your enemy.

233
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,230
But don't fall for me.

234
00:14:32,731 --> 00:14:34,781
Wait, what are you doing?

235
00:14:34,781 --> 00:14:35,600
Delete it!

236
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,810
I'm going to keep one as collateral.

237
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,200
This way, you won't<br>easily reveal me on the internet.

238
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,360
Let's call it even.

239
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,928
This… somehow makes me really angry.

240
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:50,748
But, okay for now.

241
00:14:53,987 --> 00:14:57,087
So it's time to show me.

242
00:14:57,087 --> 00:15:00,990
Show me the magical<br>transformation from Koo Ae-jin to Genie.

243
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,140
<i>(LAMBSKY)</i>

244
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,200
I'm ready!

245
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,660
Everything's set.

246
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,280
All I have to do is take a picture.

247
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,746
I'll take… your picture.

248
00:15:26,746 --> 00:15:27,700
Go stand over there.

249
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,350
- You'll take my picture?<br>- Obviously.

250
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,320
When you go to a cafe,

251
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,220
the friend you come with<br>usually takes your picture.

252
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,410
Since you only take selfies and post them,

253
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,700
there are rumors that Genie is an outcast.

254
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,690
Fine, then.

255
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,130
Take the picture.

256
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,240
Just press this.

257
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,310
Hey! Why the long face?

258
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,505
Do you need to pee?

259
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:03,710
It's the first time somebody's <br> taking my picture.

260
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,050
It feels strange.

261
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,351
Fine, then.

262
00:16:07,351 --> 00:16:09,750
Do it your way.

263
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:39,470
I think… this should be enough.

264
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:48,620
You really resemble Genie with just the wig and makeup.

265
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,670
Don't beat around the bush.

266
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,217
No, I mean it.

267
00:16:52,217 --> 00:16:56,230
You're basically pretty so that makes it possible.

268
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:02,150
Hey! We almost did it!

269
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,014
Sorry.

270
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:08,106
It's done.

271
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,950
All you have to do is post them online?

272
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,420
Not quite.

273
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,240
Why not?

274
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,680
You said this cafe will open tomorrow.

275
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,840
Shouldn't we wait at least<br>a week before we post them online?

276
00:17:26,092 --> 00:17:28,542
That's very meticulous of you.

277
00:17:34,497 --> 00:17:36,807
Should we have dinner together?

278
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,810
<i>The person you are calling is not available. <i></i></i>

279
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:43,120
What's going on?

280
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,500
Again.

281
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,180
<i>The person you are calling is not available. <i></i></i>

282
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,460
Seriously?

283
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,380
Why isn't he answering my calls?

284
00:17:57,065 --> 00:17:59,165
Honestly, I had fun today.

285
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:01,628
Kim Ho-in, that investigative bastard.

286
00:18:01,628 --> 00:18:04,770
You're not as bad as I thought.

287
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:11,163
<i>Genie.</i>

288
00:18:11,163 --> 00:18:13,647
<i>If I become prettier than I am now,</i>

289
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:16,922
<i>do you think<br>my boyfriend will care for me then?</i>

290
00:18:16,922 --> 00:18:19,470
<i>If my mom had maintained her beauty,</i>

291
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,226
<i>my dad wouldn't have left her.</i>

292
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,980
<i>Did something... happen?</i>

293
00:18:30,204 --> 00:18:32,354
<i>Not really.</i>

294
00:18:32,354 --> 00:18:35,570
<i>There are days when I get sentimental.</i>

295
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,980
<i>Today's that kind of day.</i>

296
00:19:03,696 --> 00:19:04,726
<i>Hello.</i>

297
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,805
<i>A few days ago,<br>you pressed the like button.</i>

298
00:19:07,805 --> 00:19:09,738
<i>I think it's amazing.</i>

299
00:19:09,738 --> 00:19:10,870
<i>You know Genie, right?</i>

300
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,130
<i>Genie pressed the "like" button<br>on my Wingstagram.</i>

301
00:19:15,508 --> 00:19:17,438
What is this?

302
00:19:17,438 --> 00:19:19,780
Why are you doing this?

303
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,569
This is out of the blue.

304
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:24,550
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

305
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,060
<i>Did you press it by mistake?</i>

306
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,293
<i>Yes.</i>

307
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,330
<i>Is this conversation uncomfortable?</i>

308
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,200
<i>I want to get to know you.</i>

309
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,070
Lee Jin-sung,<br>why are you being so weird?

310
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,790
What's wrong with you?

311
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,416
<i>Why?</i>

312
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,050
<i>Well... because you're pretty.</i>

313
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,156
<i>Also...</i>

314
00:19:46,156 --> 00:19:47,696
<i>Not really sure...</i>

315
00:19:47,696 --> 00:19:49,506
<i>What were you doing?</i>

316
00:19:49,506 --> 00:19:52,346
<i>I was drinking milk tea.</i>

317
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,963
<i>Wow! Daebak!</i>

318
00:19:53,963 --> 00:19:56,640
<i>Me too. I was also drinking milk tea!</i>

319
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,410
<i>We're in sync!</i>

320
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,410
<i>You're as beautiful as a goddess.</i>

321
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,370
<i>You're quite handsome too.</i>

322
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,160
<i>Wow! Thank you.</i>

323
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,226
<i>Crap.</i>

324
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:09,406
<i>I pressed it by mistake.</i>

325
00:20:09,406 --> 00:20:11,007
<i>(❤️)</i>

326
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:13,042
<i>Wow. Daebak...!</i>

327
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:15,238
<i>My heart fluttered.</i>

328
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,890
<i>Do you want...</i>

329
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:31,082
