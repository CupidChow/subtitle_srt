1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,615
I'm not an ordinary fairy.

2
00:00:07,732 --> 00:00:10,910
Summer always<br>follows me around and obeys me.

3
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:15,184
And I happen to love you.

4
00:00:15,185 --> 00:00:16,961
So together with me…

5
00:00:16,962 --> 00:00:21,478
<i>My dad, an ordinary businessman,<br>fell in love with my mom at first sight</i>

6
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:26,208
<i>while watching a play at Daehak-ro<br>and asked her out on a date that very day.</i>

7
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:35,112
<i>Mom and Dad got married<br>after they dated for a year and a half.</i>

8
00:00:35,113 --> 00:00:39,233
- Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!<br>- Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

9
00:00:39,234 --> 00:00:41,409
<i>That following year, they had me.</i>

10
00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:44,660
<i>When Dad couldn't bring in any money</i>

11
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,780
<i>after he quit<br>the company and started a business,</i>

12
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,280
<i>Mom started working<br>at a restaurant to make ends meet.</i>

13
00:00:51,992 --> 00:00:54,918
<i>Dad failed three businesses in ten years,</i>

14
00:00:55,537 --> 00:00:57,555
<i>and whether it can be seen<br>as good or bad,</i>

15
00:00:57,556 --> 00:01:01,111
<i>Mom began managing the restaurant<br>on behalf of the sick owner.</i>

16
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:03,801
Ha-neul.

17
00:01:04,873 --> 00:01:08,051
Dad will succeed

18
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:11,832
and buy you anything you want!

19
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:12,874
Okay.

20
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,893
<i>What Dad said became reality.</i>

21
00:01:14,894 --> 00:01:17,548
<i>He got rich while working on<br>his fourth business,</i>

22
00:01:18,672 --> 00:01:21,383
<i>while Mom became ill<br>from overworking and stress</i>

23
00:01:21,384 --> 00:01:24,236
Mom. Mom!

24
00:01:24,237 --> 00:01:27,301
<i>She became ill<br>in exchange for Dad's success.</i>

25
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:33,732
<i>The woman<br>next to my Dad was stunning.</i>

26
00:01:35,031 --> 00:01:37,331
<i>Women are loved only when they are pretty.</i>

27
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:39,134
<i>If not,</i>

28
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:41,712
<i>they'll get discarded.</i>

29
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,115
<i>It was the first lesson</i>

30
00:01:46,737 --> 00:01:49,404
<i>I learned at the age of eight.</i>

31
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:58,340
I want wispy bangs,

32
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:00,133
but I think it needs a bit more thinning.

33
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:02,351
What about the length?

34
00:02:02,352 --> 00:02:03,939
I'm happy with it.

35
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,496
<i>Director, a call for you.</i>

36
00:02:06,796 --> 00:02:08,204
I'll be right back.

37
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:13,542
Sae-hee, I think<br>you'll look really pretty with short hair.

38
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:17,531
What? Short hair? It took three years<br>for me to grow my hair like this.

39
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:20,157
Do you know?

40
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:25,217
You give off<br>a similar vibe as Emma Watson.

41
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:30,156
What? Me… with that Emma Watson?

42
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,827
You didn't know?

43
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:37,257
Just look at your small head,<br>long neck, and alluring eyes.

44
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:39,445
I envy you.

45
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:42,755
You do know Emma Watson<br>became famous for the pixie cut, right?

46
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,464
I wasn't actually going<br>to tell you, because I was jealous.

47
00:02:46,705 --> 00:02:50,649
Then… should I get a pixie cut?

48
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:57,642
No, don't. I'm going to be super jealous.

49
00:02:58,121 --> 00:02:59,577
Don't, okay?

50
00:03:01,364 --> 00:03:03,270
Now then, what style do you want?

51
00:03:03,354 --> 00:03:06,326
Give me a pixie cut, like Emma Watson.

52
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:08,401
Emma… Watson?

53
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,872
It won't be easy.

54
00:03:11,956 --> 00:03:13,546
But let's give it a shot.

55
00:03:24,275 --> 00:03:26,108
How do you like it?

56
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:34,277
I'm so pissed off!

57
00:03:38,813 --> 00:03:41,757
Hey, what the hell?

58
00:03:44,913 --> 00:03:47,904
I… knew it.

59
00:03:47,988 --> 00:03:51,990
It's… the hair for you.<br>You look really pretty.

60
00:03:53,197 --> 00:03:55,753
Treat me to tteokbokki* today, got it?<br><i>(Spicy rice cakes)</i>

61
00:03:57,843 --> 00:03:59,941
Look at how small your head is!

62
00:04:00,088 --> 00:04:03,065
Hey, walk about a meter away from me.

63
00:04:12,188 --> 00:04:15,265
Maybe I do kind of look like Emma Watson.

64
00:04:18,734 --> 00:04:21,356
Look at Jo Sae-hee's hair!

65
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:24,668
Did you get it done at the barber's?

66
00:04:24,752 --> 00:04:26,234
Don't tell me you paid for it.

67
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:27,462
Shut it.

68
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:30,389
Hey, don't tease her.

69
00:04:30,577 --> 00:04:32,726
She went for the Emma Watson style.

70
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,920
- Emma Watson?<br>- Emma Watson?

71
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:36,854
I thought Sae-hee was your boyfriend.

72
00:04:36,938 --> 00:04:40,114
Guys! Stop it.

73
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:42,173
Are you guys in elementary school?

74
00:04:42,257 --> 00:04:46,057
Stop making fun of her<br>and say she's pretty if you think she is.

75
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:50,145
Well, she's not.<br>We would obviously tell her if she is.

Yeah.

00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:21,285
You mean the genie in a magical lamp?

118
00:07:31,044 --> 00:07:33,555
Then since when<br>have you been close to Goo Ae-jin?

119
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,578
I'm not close to her.

Our homeroom teacher told me<br>to watch you so you don't bully her.
