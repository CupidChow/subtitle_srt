1
00:00:00,556 --> 00:00:02,456
<i>I thought if something like this</i>

2
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:04,789
<i>happened to me,</i>

3
00:00:05,628 --> 00:00:08,726
<i>I'd run out barefoot<br>without thinking about anything</i>

4
00:00:09,334 --> 00:00:11,835
<i>like… in the movies or dramas.</i>

5
00:00:13,132 --> 00:00:17,164
<i>Your mother kept<br>calling but couldn't reach you.</i>

6
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,867
<i>As you may know, she's been getting<br>treatment for her myocardial infarction.</i>

7
00:00:23,046 --> 00:00:26,976
<i>I was so calm to the point<br>that I wasn't sure if this was normal.</i>

8
00:00:27,843 --> 00:00:31,359
<i>(BASTARD)<br>I called Dad and explained the situation.</i>

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,171
It's me.

10
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:37,632
<i>I did great without shedding<br>a single tear.</i>

11
00:00:40,272 --> 00:00:41,238
<i>(EMERGENCY CENTER)</i>

12
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:42,820
<i>I arrived at the hospital…</i>

13
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:46,343
<i>and walked in calmly</i>

14
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,515
<i>to see my Mom.</i>

15
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:54,109
<i>The moment I looked down<br>at the stiff and cold body of my mom,</i>

16
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:57,187
<i>it sunk in.</i>

17
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,289
Mom.

18
00:01:02,408 --> 00:01:03,687
<i>This is goodbye.</i>

19
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:05,781
Mom.

20
00:01:07,054 --> 00:01:08,206
Ae-jin.

21
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:11,454
Yes?

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,265
Let's go somewhere together.

23
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:16,619
Okay.

24
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:45,007
I'm so sorry…

25
00:02:46,053 --> 00:02:47,757
I'm so sorry…

26
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:50,117
I'm so sorry…

27
00:03:19,777 --> 00:03:22,281
I was going to leave<br>without saying anything…

28
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,594
But with your personality,<br>I'm sure you'd worry rumors might fly.

29
00:03:26,948 --> 00:03:28,398
Don't worry.

30
00:03:29,065 --> 00:03:30,765
That will never happen.

31
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:32,944
Like I said in the past.

32
00:03:34,262 --> 00:03:37,707
Just… grieve.

33
00:03:37,941 --> 00:03:42,036
Keep crying. And when you<br>get tired, just eat and drink.

34
00:03:43,575 --> 00:03:45,789
That's the only way<br>you can cry to your heart's content.

35
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:50,468
How do you know that?

36
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,700
Because I also lost someone before.

37
00:04:01,212 --> 00:04:02,678
Are you Genie?

38
00:04:07,895 --> 00:04:09,358
What do you mean?

39
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:13,494
I'm asking if you're Genie.

40
00:04:14,084 --> 00:04:18,014
I couldn't answer<br>my mom's last call because of her.

41
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:20,275
So tell me.

42
00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:22,170
Are you…

43
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:24,835
Genie?

44
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:26,968
I'll get going.

45
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:32,271
<i>(SHADOW BEAUTY<br>EPISODE 9: THE DAY OF PROOF)</i>

46
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:53,828
<i>You're a fake.</i>

47
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,273
<i>You're a fake! Bring her back to life!</i>

48
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:08,753
Earlier, I mentioned A and B equals 2.

49
00:05:08,804 --> 00:05:11,095
So 3 times 2 is 6.

50
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,460
It's a number we've seen a lot, right?

51
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:16,948
And what did I say A minus B was?

52
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:18,726
It's x, right?

53
00:05:18,804 --> 00:05:22,359
Now then, if we erase<br>A minus B, it becomes 6x.

54
00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:25,007
If we move 6x to the left,

55
00:05:25,165 --> 00:05:27,094
x cube plus 6…

56
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:34,472
Did Ha-neul get in touch with you?

57
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,935
Her phone's turned off,<br>and she's not reading my texts…

58
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:42,476
What's going on? She even missed school.

59
00:05:44,923 --> 00:05:49,023
Did she… really find out?

60
00:05:57,535 --> 00:06:01,656
Wow! Is this that famous macaron cake?

61
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:04,593
It's already good to eat separately,<br>but to eat it altogether…

62
00:06:04,937 --> 00:06:06,859
You really love desserts, don't you?

63
00:06:08,683 --> 00:06:10,015
For me, sweets are a bit…

64
00:06:10,148 --> 00:06:12,296
What? Don't you also love sweets?

65
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:13,132
Me?

66
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:15,218
Yeah, I saw your social media.

67
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,921
I heard you're a huge fan of sweets.

68
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:23,787
I don't hate them.<br>It's just high in calories, that's all.

69
00:06:24,648 --> 00:06:25,429
Are you watching what you eat?

70
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:27,375
Of course, isn't that obvious?

71
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:29,414
By the way, aren't you going to post this?

72
00:06:29,851 --> 00:06:33,578
Hashtag, such a pretty cake.<br>Hashtag, with my pretty best friend.

73
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:37,242
I'm not.

74
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:42,117
And… are you trying to make me feel<br>uncomfortable right now?

75
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,179
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:54,945
Anyway… don't you have<br>something more important to do?

77
00:06:55,171 --> 00:06:56,843
- Are you going to leave her be?<br>- Who?

78
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:57,953
Yang Ha-neul.

79
00:06:58,716 --> 00:07:00,718
She didn't even come to school,<br>so what am I supposed to do?

80
00:07:00,817 --> 00:07:03,843
You sound carefree for someone<br>who got beaten up by Yang Ha-neul.

81
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:05,648
Right?

82
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,454
I like something more definite.

83
00:07:09,816 --> 00:07:13,166
What's the worst thing<br>Yang Ha-neul has ever done?

84
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:17,583
It would be even better if it's something<br>everyone knows.

85
00:07:19,423 --> 00:07:21,625
Oh! That underwear incident.

86
00:07:22,328 --> 00:07:26,328
She pushed Goo Ae-jin down and<br>grilled her with her underwear exposed.

87
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,734
I mean, it was her underpants.

88
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:33,292
But if I was Goo Ae-jin…<br>Thinking about it gives me goosebumps.

89
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,296
Really?

90
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,007
Why aren't you eating? It's all yours.

91
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,023
Dig in.

92
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,507
Stuff it all in.

93
00:07:59,075 --> 00:08:00,051
Huddle up.

94
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:06,403
Student on duty. Is everyone here?

95
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Sir.

96
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:12,092
What?

97
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,140
I'm not feeling well.<br>May I go rest at the infirmary?

98
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:18,617
Sure, go ahead.

99
00:08:18,938 --> 00:08:20,264
Thank you.

100
00:08:20,857 --> 00:08:22,001
Goodness.

101
00:08:24,163 --> 00:08:28,593
Today, we're going<br>to play tee-ball. Tee-ball is…

102
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,273
What?

103
00:08:47,824 --> 00:08:49,362
Why would you wear<br>something that expensive to school?

104
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:53,108
Why is that my fault?<br>The jerk who stole it should be blamed.

105
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:55,148
It's not the price that's important.

106
00:08:55,337 --> 00:08:58,718
It was a birthday gift<br>from Jin-sung before he transferred.

107
00:08:58,945 --> 00:09:01,218
And I had no idea it was that pricey.

108
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,641
For now, I'll…

109
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,609
talk to the teacher.

110
00:09:13,492 --> 00:09:15,960
Goo Ae-jin wore<br>a circle necklace to school,

111
00:09:16,595 --> 00:09:17,825
but she lost it.

112
00:09:18,576 --> 00:09:19,644
The necklace?

113
00:09:19,881 --> 00:09:20,699
Yes.

114
00:09:20,878 --> 00:09:25,396
She thinks someone took it during PE

115
00:09:25,882 --> 00:09:27,328
when no one was looking.

116
00:09:27,947 --> 00:09:29,911
Maybe she left it somewhere.

117
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:34,070
No, I also think someone stole it.

118
00:09:36,156 --> 00:09:37,531
What the hell?

119
00:09:39,015 --> 00:09:42,359
I just heard the class president<br>talking in the teachers' office.

120
00:09:42,393 --> 00:09:45,023
Apparently, Goo Ae-jin lost<br>her circle necklace.

121
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:51,070
Whose fault is it?

122
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:54,249
Perfect timing, my friend!

123
00:09:54,671 --> 00:09:57,507
I was just telling everyone

124
00:09:57,874 --> 00:10:00,171
about that necklace you lost.

125
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:02,919
Who do you think did it?

126
00:10:03,326 --> 00:10:05,921
<i>I think it's you, you jerk.</i>

127
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,882
What? Why are you staring at me?

128
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,289
I was thinking.

129
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:16,765
Wouldn't it be the person<br>who bullies her every day?

130
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:22,359
That's right. You mean the person<br>who always has eyes on her stuff, right?

131
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:25,367
Could it be the person who missed PE?

132
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,078
And who could be that person?

133
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:32,725
Yang Ha-neul, was it you?

134
00:10:32,868 --> 00:10:34,359
Is it?

135
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:38,184
I don't care about some damn necklace.

136
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:43,015
Stop faking it.<br>She bullies Ae-jin every day

137
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:45,781
and was the first to return to class<br>after PE.

138
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,382
You do realize you suck at acting, right?

139
00:10:48,462 --> 00:10:49,444
Get lost.

140
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:50,902
What?

141
00:10:53,226 --> 00:10:56,687
Yang Ha-neul, you're…<br>total trash, aren't you?

142
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,437
Give me whatever's in your hand.

143
00:10:58,718 --> 00:10:59,684
No.

144
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:01,221
Give it to me.

145
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:03,081
No!

146
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:05,777
What the heck is this?

147
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,987
What kind of crap…

148
00:11:10,322 --> 00:11:11,555
Where's the necklace?

149
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:13,632
Where did you hide it?

150
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:20,414
Did you buy this yourself?<br>Your taste has changed a whole lot.

151
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,093
This is so old! So old!

152
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:25,335
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

153
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:41,406
Move your foot.

154
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:45,859
What's this? You're a liar, aren't you?

155
00:11:47,718 --> 00:11:50,256
Move it. Move!

156
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:52,118
Move!

157
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:02,764
Shouldn't we stop them?

158
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:04,487
Come on, let's watch a bit more.

159
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:09,187
Violence…<br>is not something only you can do.

160
00:12:09,712 --> 00:12:12,986
Got it? You thief.

161
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:32,421
Mom… Mom…

162
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,953
Mom?

163
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:39,293
Move your foot.

164
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,539
I've been through<br>the same thing, and it feels like shit.

165
00:13:38,171 --> 00:13:40,898
Hey, why didn't you help Yang Ha-neul?

166
00:13:41,084 --> 00:13:42,464
Isn't she your girlfriend?

167
00:13:43,311 --> 00:13:46,452
It's just… I hate getting the attention.

168
00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:49,355
But you of all people<br>shouldn't have ignored her.

169
00:13:50,843 --> 00:13:53,726
And you? Why did you help her?

170
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,703
Didn't she do the same thing to you?

171
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:59,517
Yeah. She did the same damn thing to me.

172
00:13:59,774 --> 00:14:01,817
Do you think<br>I did that because I like her?

173
00:14:01,934 --> 00:14:04,695
I have every right<br>to hate Yang Ha-neul, but…

174
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:07,879
I don't have to watch as those guys,<br>who used to sit on the sidelines,

175
00:14:07,921 --> 00:14:09,804
pretend to be on my side now.

176
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:13,476
I will be the one to judge<br>whether to hate or forgive her.

177
00:14:14,123 --> 00:14:15,756
And I hate Seon Mi-jin.

178
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:18,235
Seeing her acting like Genie disgusts me.

179
00:14:27,695 --> 00:14:31,396
Ha-neul's mom…<br>passed away a few days ago.

180
00:14:31,977 --> 00:14:33,557
That's why she couldn't come to school.

181
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:38,053
Now do you know how much of<br>a shitty boyfriend you are?

182
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,217
Hey, be quiet.

183
00:14:50,281 --> 00:14:51,820
What's with her?

184
00:14:52,882 --> 00:14:54,769
She deserves to be bullied.

185
00:14:54,906 --> 00:14:57,547
We were just trying to help.<br>No wonder she's a loser.

186
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:00,797
Let me ask you something.

187
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,972
What do you want now?<br>Didn't you spoil the mood earlier?

188
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:08,806
Ae-jin, what is it?

189
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,766
Jo Sae-hee,<br>you used to bully me every day.

190
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:15,250
You always stole my snacks<br>and shoved them all into your mouth.

191
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:17,811
- What did you say?<br>- You always smacked my head.

192
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:20,843
So why do you suddenly pretend<br>like you care about me?

193
00:15:21,393 --> 00:15:24,627
Come on, can't friends joke around?

194
00:15:24,845 --> 00:15:27,757
And how can you compare<br>your snacks with the necklace?

195
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:29,687
How do you know how much it costs?

196
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,633
And earlier, you said it was<br>a circle necklace.

197
00:15:32,717 --> 00:15:34,195
How did you know that?

198
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,570
I never showed it to anyone.

199
00:15:36,882 --> 00:15:38,546
When did I say it was a circle necklace?

200
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:40,328
I don't think I ever did.

201
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:43,530
Hey, didn't Jo Sae-hee<br>say it was a circle necklace?

202
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,367
- Yeah, I heard her say that.<br>- Shut it.

203
00:15:46,664 --> 00:15:49,105
I must've heard that from<br>the teacher's office.

204
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,140
If not, how would I know the details?

205
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:54,976
I only told the class president<br>it was a moon-shaped necklace.

206
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:59,195
Jeez, moon-shaped,

207
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:02,515
full moon, or circle.<br>Aren't those all the same?

208
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:05,139
You're really getting on my nerves today.

209
00:16:05,304 --> 00:16:06,425
You're right.

210
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,804
Moon-shaped, full moon,<br>circle. Those are all round.

211
00:16:12,093 --> 00:16:14,353
You might remember it like that<br>because they're similar.

212
00:16:14,437 --> 00:16:17,710
Yeah, you're right. The class president<br>is right. That's how I remembered it.

213
00:16:18,364 --> 00:16:20,920
You're seriously pissing me off today.

214
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:26,236
But I… didn't want<br>the teacher to get angry,

215
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,164
so I lied that it was 30,000 won.

216
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,981
How do you know the shape and the price<br>of the necklace you've never seen before?

217
00:16:37,732 --> 00:16:41,489
It's strange, isn't it?

218
00:16:41,612 --> 00:16:42,620
What?

219
00:16:45,385 --> 00:16:46,578
Well…

220
00:16:48,455 --> 00:16:50,351
So…

221
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:52,812
Well, looks like<br>Jo Sae-hee is the culprit.

222
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,984
Totally.

223
00:16:54,452 --> 00:16:56,195
Ah… that's crazy.

224
00:16:56,993 --> 00:16:58,085
Mi-jin.

225
00:16:59,596 --> 00:17:03,135
What? Then I got the wrong person?

226
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,230
And without knowing the actual story?

227
00:17:06,262 --> 00:17:09,301
I only thought about<br>paying back for Ae-jin's suffering.

228
00:17:10,085 --> 00:17:11,260
It's all my fault.

229
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,290
I feel so bad for Ha-neul.

230
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:16,492
Seon Mi-jin.

231
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:18,351
Yeah?

232
00:17:18,783 --> 00:17:20,382
I've got a question for you too.

233
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,250
How did you know that the necklace

234
00:17:23,586 --> 00:17:25,685
in Yang Ha-neul's bag was mine?

235
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:33,140
Sae-hee… told me to say it.

236
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,242
She told me she saw Yang Ha-neul steal it

237
00:17:37,078 --> 00:17:40,273
and had me go through her bag<br>once she gave the signal.

238
00:17:42,702 --> 00:17:43,804
Don't cry.

239
00:17:44,003 --> 00:17:45,734
Wow… Jo Sae-hee. What a bitch.

240
00:17:45,782 --> 00:17:46,703
Don't cry.

241
00:17:46,771 --> 00:17:50,132
Did she use the innocent transfer<br>student to screw Yang Ha-neul over?

242
00:17:50,217 --> 00:17:51,859
Jo Sae-hee's unbelievable.

243
00:17:55,232 --> 00:17:57,468
Hey, tell them.

244
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:01,664
Tell them you were all in on it too.

245
00:18:01,738 --> 00:18:03,960
This was all Seon Mi-jin's idea.

246
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,874
Tell them. Tell them!

247
00:18:07,914 --> 00:18:08,645
Stop it.

248
00:18:10,347 --> 00:18:13,009
Fuck! And to think<br>I hung out with you guys.

249
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:15,578
<i>She can win an Oscar for her performance.</i>

250
00:18:16,101 --> 00:18:17,945
<i>You're really something, Seon Mi-jin.</i>

251
00:18:18,168 --> 00:18:20,731
- Hey.<br>- Stop it.

252
00:18:20,913 --> 00:18:24,125
What? Is Jo Sae-hee<br>a psychopath? How scary.

253
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,851
Fuck… She's losing it.<br>What's gotten into her?

254
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:30,046
Please, it wasn't me!

255
00:18:30,272 --> 00:18:32,492
It wasn't… it wasn't!

256
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:35,866
Fuck! It wasn't me, you bastards!

257
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:39,641
It wasn't me!

258
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,359
What do you know? It wasn't me!

259
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:48,007
It wasn't, for fuck's sake!

260
00:18:51,187 --> 00:18:53,171
Die, you assholes!

261
00:19:15,431 --> 00:19:18,590
<i>Is Sae-hee… the target now?</i>

262
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,539
<i>People will start gossiping</i>

263
00:19:22,811 --> 00:19:24,843
<i>about how weird Sae-hee is.</i>

264
00:19:34,877 --> 00:19:37,510
<i>No one will apologize to Ha-neul</i>

265
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,460
<i>for the misunderstanding</i>

266
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:44,399
<i>and the gossip.</i>

267
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:51,331
<i>Only the victims remain</i>

268
00:19:52,097 --> 00:19:53,905
<i>and none that inflicted the pain.</i>

269
00:20:42,445 --> 00:20:43,811
Yang Ha-neul.

270
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:48,819
You're right.

271
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:52,751
I'm…

272
00:20:58,568 --> 00:20:59,879
I'm…

273
00:21:17,301 --> 00:21:19,990
<i>(SHADOW BEAUTY)</i>

274
00:21:21,023 --> 00:21:23,125
<i>How can you do this to me?</i>

275
00:21:23,187 --> 00:21:25,857
<i>If I had told you I was Genie</i>

276

277
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:30,195
<i>would we have become friends?</i>

278
00:21:31,076 --> 00:21:32,406
What's going on these days?

279
00:21:32,445 --> 00:21:33,739
Let go.

280
00:21:35,396 --> 00:21:38,062
<i>I'm sending you</i>

281
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,906
<i>everything about the real me.</i>

282
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,953
- What? Didn't she act like Genie?<br>- Hey, is she really Genie?

283
00:21:43,086 --> 00:21:44,648
She never admitted it.

284
00:21:44,693 --> 00:21:46,171
Explain yourself.

00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:48,085
<i>I'm worse.</i>
