Why did you try to kill yourself?

9
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:49,406
My father was<br>an infamous loan shark.

10
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:55,523
He suddenly became rich due to<br>the money he extorted

11
00:00:55,996 --> 00:00:57,343
from the people<br>who worked for it.

12
00:00:59,312 --> 00:01:01,549
What he hated the most

13
00:01:01,905 --> 00:01:03,375
was suffering a loss.

14
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:14,276

15

and always asked for great results.

16
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,828
On days I couldn't satisfy<br>his requirements,

17
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,008
I had to make up for it…

18
00:01:25,298 --> 00:01:27,008
by getting whipped.

19
00:01:28,577 --> 00:01:30,516
I couldn't bear it.

21
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:39,210
It was even on TV.

22
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,305
Yes. Did you see it?

23
00:01:41,714 --> 00:01:44,125
I vaguely remember it.

24
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:47,625

unable to get a word out.

26
00:01:52,386 --> 00:01:53,305
That's right.

27
00:01:56,904 --> 00:02:00,203
But honestly… I had nothing to say.

28
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,461
I didn't even shed a single tear.

29
00:02:04,508 --> 00:02:05,898
Back then…

30
00:02:06,885 --> 00:02:08,023
I was just scared…

31
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:11,289
that others might find out<br>my true feelings.

165
00:13:47,404 --> 00:13:48,430
more dangerous…

166
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:50,625
than we thought.

167
00:13:51,383 --> 00:13:54,255
<i>I found out about her old school.</i>

168
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:58,258
Awon Girls' High. Fortunately,<br>the sophomores had a class webpage.

169
00:13:58,594 --> 00:14:00,859
<i>(AWON GIRLS' HIGH WEBPAGE)</i><br>A student with the nickname Pluto

170
00:14:01,016 --> 00:14:03,416
seemed responsible<br>for posting the class photos.

171
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:08,219
And of course, more than half of them were<br>about Seon Mi-jin because of her beauty.

172
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:10,616
I looked up Pluto's recent social media

173
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,719
with the e-mail address<br>that was on the webpage.

174
00:14:12,805 --> 00:14:16,742
<i>(PLUTO_04)</i><br>But… she wasn't a student there.

175
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:20,492
It was weird, so I sent her an e-mail.

176
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:23,165
"If you can tell me about Seon Mi-jin,"

177
00:14:23,311 --> 00:14:25,820
"please enter the anonymous chat room."

178
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:28,695
"Complete secrecy will be guaranteed."

179
00:14:29,114 --> 00:14:32,523
"I'll be waiting for your reply."

180
00:14:33,084 --> 00:14:35,680
It didn't take long<br>for her to get in touch.

181
00:14:36,187 --> 00:14:38,176
<i>(KAKAO TALK:<br>PLUTO HAS ENTERED THE ANONYMOUS CHATROOM)</i>

182
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,260
<i>(DETECTIVE FREAK HAS LOCKED THE CHATROOM)</i>

183
00:14:55,172 --> 00:14:56,391
<i>Are you Detective Freak?</i>

184
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:15,234
<i>Was someone… getting bullied at school?</i>

185
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,047
<i>And was it Seon Mi-jin<br>who helped her get out of it?</i>

186
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:39,914
<i>She's kind.</i>

187
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:42,000
<i>And friendly.</i>

188
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:44,641
<i>You probably know that, right?</i>

189
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:50,336
<i>Who wouldn't like such<br>a pretty and kind girl?</i>

190
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,164
<i>But that's only until<br>she takes off that pretty mask of hers.</i>

191
00:15:55,492 --> 00:15:59,144
I can't tell you everything right now,

192
00:15:59,228 --> 00:16:00,898
but what's clear…

193
00:16:01,414 --> 00:16:04,625
is that the past is being repeated.

194
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:07,266
Seon Mi-jin would go up<br>to the outcast of the class

195
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,085
and compliment her.

196
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:10,976
<i>Those sanpaku eyes<br>have a mysterious charm to them.</i>

197
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,686
<i>Hey, don't tease her.</i>

198
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,252
She'd keep others by her side,<br>and make them cut their hair short…

199
00:16:14,336 --> 00:16:16,325
<i>She went for the Emma Watson style.</i>

200
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:20,133
And she'd humiliate people<br>in front of everyone.

201
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,422
Pluto went through all of that alone.

202
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:28,922
She eventually dropped out<br>of school. To get away from her.

203
00:16:29,414 --> 00:16:31,943
But… why Genie?

204
00:16:32,027 --> 00:16:33,789
She must've gotten greedy.

205
00:16:34,274 --> 00:16:36,930
Genie's a goddess on Wingstagram.

206
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:40,508
With a face that looks a lot like Genie's,

207
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,148
she'd easily be able…

208
00:16:43,898 --> 00:16:45,447
to take away her fans.

209
00:16:45,602 --> 00:16:48,211
I don't get it. Why go that far?

210
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:51,883
Seon Mi-jin… is a sociopath.

211
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:56,930
She does whatever<br>she can to get what she wants.

212
00:16:57,695 --> 00:17:00,922
The incident that turned<br>Ha-neul into a thief the other day.

213
00:17:01,273 --> 00:17:03,453
I'm sure it was Mi-jin's idea.

214
00:17:03,782 --> 00:17:07,422
The others are starting to wonder<br>if she's really Genie or not.

215
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:10,331
<i>What? Wasn't she acting like Genie?</i>

216
00:17:10,415 --> 00:17:12,360
<i>Explain yourself.</i>

217
00:17:12,444 --> 00:17:13,578
<i>Hey, is she really Genie?</i>

218
00:17:13,662 --> 00:17:15,242
<i>She never admitted it.</i>

219
00:17:15,364 --> 00:17:18,719
She must've felt anxious.

220
00:17:20,703 --> 00:17:23,727
And in order to prove she's not lying,

221
00:17:23,987 --> 00:17:25,219
she held on…

222
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:28,820
to your weakness.

223
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:36,313
Did Pluto say anything else?

224
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,055
No.

225
00:17:41,015 --> 00:17:42,086
That was everything.

226
00:18:06,823 --> 00:18:08,240
<i>(SUNQUEEN)<br>Reset the password.</i>

227
00:18:08,324 --> 00:18:10,203
<i>Or do you want to get exposed?</i>

228
00:18:19,101 --> 00:18:20,828
Should I have told her?

229
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:27,379
<i>Until she gets what she wants,</i>

230
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,396
<i>Seon Mi-jin will do everything she can…</i>

231
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,758
<i>with that pretty face…</i>

232
00:18:34,005 --> 00:18:36,023
<i>until she ruins the other person's life.</i>

233
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,406
<i>Everything you went through alone</i>

234
00:18:44,796 --> 00:18:46,945
<i>and the similar incidents<br>that happened until now.</i>

235
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:49,906
<i>Three people<br>are currently suffering from it.</i>

236
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,906
<i>Pluto,</i>

237
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:55,891
<i>who do you think we should be…</i>

238
00:18:57,078 --> 00:18:58,429
<i>most cautious about?</i>

239
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,617
<i>The most dangerous person this time is…</i>

240
00:19:10,477 --> 00:19:12,391
<i>(GOO AE-JIN)</i>

241
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:13,593
<i>(HO-IN)<br>Are you asleep?</i>

242
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,560
<i>(HO-IN: ARE YOU ASLEEP?)</i>

243
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,602
Good morning, Ha-neul.

244
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:48,502
<i>(SHADOW BEAUTY)</i>

245
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:49,654
You saw Yang Ha-neul, right?

246
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:51,992
How she clings to me

247
00:19:52,284 --> 00:19:53,906
even though she knows I'm not Genie.

248
00:19:55,992 --> 00:19:58,410
We… need to talk.

249
00:19:58,494 --> 00:20:00,102
- This?<br>- Give it back!

250
00:20:00,186 --> 00:20:02,516
Why are you doing this to me?

251
00:20:04,992 --> 00:20:07,188
How about using Genie?

252
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:08,843
A live stream. What do you think?

253
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,282
Have you lost it?

254
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:12,966
A live stream?<br>Why would you provoke Seon Mi-jin?

255
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,115
Choose. Either kill yourself

256
00:20:15,285 --> 00:20:17,000
or kill Lee Jin-sung.
