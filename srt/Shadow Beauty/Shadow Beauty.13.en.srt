I'm sorry.

165
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:07,374
I'm sorry I hurt you.

166
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:09,075
I'm really sorry.

167
00:16:10,138 --> 00:16:11,317
No.

168
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,320
No, Mom.

169
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:19,206
I acted as if I was the only one…

170
00:16:20,385 --> 00:16:23,107
in pain and grief.

171
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:26,974
But you must've also had a hard time…

172
00:16:27,798 --> 00:16:30,199
and wanted to cry.

173
00:16:39,185 --> 00:16:41,407
<i>I had an older sister.</i>

174
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:42,773
<i>Goo Hee-jin.</i>

175
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,353
<i>She was pretty</i>

176
00:16:44,607 --> 00:16:48,017
<i>and kind, so everyone liked her.</i>

177
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,251
<i>Hee-jin!</i>

178
00:16:50,437 --> 00:16:53,780
<i>I had a vague idea<br>ever since I was little</i>

179
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:58,634
<i>that she was pretty and I wasn't.</i>

180
00:16:59,248 --> 00:17:02,255
<i>And I thought her friends would tease her</i>

181
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:05,585
<i>if they found out<br>she had such an ugly sister.</i>

182
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:10,340
<i>Or thought she might be embarrassed of me.</i>

183
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:12,208
<i>Ae-jin, wait for me!</i>

184
00:17:12,678 --> 00:17:14,550
<i>We should go together!</i>

185
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:16,322
I ran away from her.

186
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:31,763
<i>Hee-jin…</i>

187
00:17:37,296 --> 00:17:38,622
<i>Hee-jin…</i>

188
00:17:40,151 --> 00:17:41,732
<i>Hee-jin!</i>

189
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:46,396
<i>Help! Please help!</i>

190
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,872
<i>Someone got hurt.</i>

191
00:17:49,911 --> 00:17:53,146
<i>Please help my sister.</i>

192
00:17:53,274 --> 00:17:54,857
<i>Ae-jin…</i>

193
00:17:55,516 --> 00:17:57,958
<i>- Hee-jin…<br>- Are you okay?</i>

194
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:00,404
<i>If one of us had to disappear,</i>

195
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:03,469
<i>it should've been me…</i>

196
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,575
<i>My heart indeed broke over her death,</i>

197
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:17,630
<i>but I also wanted to have her face.</i>

198
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:25,715
<i>Genie was born using<br>both my sister's and my face.</i>

199
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,272
<i>Thanks, Hee-jin.</i>

200
00:18:58,723 --> 00:19:00,167
Thanks.

201
00:19:06,147 --> 00:19:09,031
You should thank Ho-in, not me.

202
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,449
Ho-in suddenly got in touch<br>in the middle of the night.

203
00:19:14,365 --> 00:19:15,427
<i>(HO-IN)</i><br><i>Are you asleep?</i>

204
00:19:19,211 --> 00:19:23,518
With just that text, I ran over<br>to Ho-in's late in the night.

205
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,811
I couldn't help it.

206
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,739
You know how much I love Ho-in.

207
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,090
But…

208
00:19:55,203 --> 00:19:57,619
he asked me to help you out of the blue.

209
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:03,011
Ho-in must've known<br>Seon Mi-jin was going to get close to me.

210
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:08,454
Honestly, I… suspected<br>your relationship with Ho-in.

211
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:10,570
Me and that Detective Freak's?

212
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,723
- I swear it was nothing like that.<br>- I know…

213
00:20:14,568 --> 00:20:18,824
I understood why you got along with him.

214
00:20:19,366 --> 00:20:21,078
You two are alike.

215
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,000
You self-reflect<br>when you've done nothing wrong,

216
00:20:27,648 --> 00:20:31,401
and you're always in fear out of guilt.

217
00:20:32,697 --> 00:20:35,516
It's true. Right, Ae-jin?

218
00:20:40,331 --> 00:20:43,157
Hey, why are you crying?

219
00:20:45,886 --> 00:20:48,610
You called me by my name just now.

220
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,110
Seriously?

221
00:20:56,794 --> 00:21:00,530
- Hey, stop crying.<br>- But why are you crying?

222
00:21:01,175 --> 00:21:03,747
Because you are.

223
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:20,686
