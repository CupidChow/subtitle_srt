Hey, this is yours. I can't accept it.

No, I mean it. It looks better on you.

Huh, you've already eaten all by yourself?

128

I'm sorry. Sorry.

129

Oh, come on.

131
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,809
I wanted to have dessert together.

<i>But there is a huge difference between us.</i>

139
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,070
Hey, wake up!

140
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:27,143
- Are you close with oppa Heo Yeong? <br>- Not really.

141

- Is Jua from Break Girls pretty? <br>- I don't know.

142
00:08:31,193 --> 00:08:33,389
Man, he's so stuck up.

143
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:35,430
Hey, do you think he even considers us friends?

144
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,663
<i>One is too cool.</i>

145
00:08:37,663 --> 00:08:41,843
<i>And the other… is a loser.</i>

146

Are you okay?

147
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,136
Hey, stop it. That tickles.

148
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:56,397
I'm just patting you. How does that tickle?

149
00:08:56,397 --> 00:08:58,330
Even this?

150
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,710
I said stop!

151
00:09:03,415 --> 00:09:04,902
What's the big deal?

152
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:08,317
I'll buy you more tomatoes tomorrow.

153
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,107
You…

154

remind me of someone.

155

- Who? <br>- Ah...

156
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:19,223
There was a rerun of a drama on cable yesterday.

157
00:09:19,223 --> 00:09:21,240
A drama?

158
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,149
Oh yeah! It was "Dokkaebi"*. <br><i>(T/N: He means "Guardian: The Lonely and Great God")</i>

Dokkaebi?

160
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:27,990
I look like a dokkaebi*? <br><i>(T/N: She's referring to the Korean word for 'goblin'.)</i>

162
00:09:30,843 --> 00:09:32,663
You know…

163
00:09:32,663 --> 00:09:34,552
Kim Go Eun. <br><i>(T/N: Lead actress from "Guardian: The Lonely and Great God")</i>

164
00:09:35,463 --> 00:09:38,190
Just because I have two eyes, one nose, and a mouth?

165
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,636
No, I'm serious. You resemble her.

166
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:42,455
The way you smile and your grinning eyes.

167
00:09:42,455 --> 00:09:44,556
You really look like her.

168
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,175
Thanks.

169
00:09:49,175 --> 00:09:51,276
It's just the two of us here, but it's still embarrassing.

170
00:09:51,276 --> 00:09:53,783
Can you please shut up?

171
00:09:54,976 --> 00:09:56,903
Why? I was complimenting you.

172
00:09:56,903 --> 00:10:00,003
-Honestly, you're the prettiest in your class.

173
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,600
Hoel*... I think you're really sick. <br><i>(T/N: *Korean Slang used to express a mild shock or surprise)</i>

174
00:10:05,623 --> 00:10:06,707
Let's go to the hospital.

175
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,263
No, it's true.

176
00:10:09,263 --> 00:10:11,497
Ask the other students.

177
00:10:11,497 --> 00:10:14,250
You'd better not say anything stupid!

178
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,457
I'll tell everyone that you speak in a dialect.

179
00:10:20,123 --> 00:10:23,156
You're such a mean girl!

180
00:10:29,423 --> 00:10:31,597
<i>Today was a lucky day.</i> <br><i>(Sangil High School)</i>

181
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,810
<i>Ha Neul didn't bother me.</i>

182
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,737
<i>And Jin Sung</i>

183
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:39,830
<i>complimented me by saying I look like Kim Go Eun.</i>

184
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,783
<i>Maybe just a little bit…</i>

185
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:47,097
<i>just the tiniest bit, my smile resembles her.</i>

186
00:10:48,383 --> 00:10:51,010
<i>No social media for me today.</i>

187
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:55,397
<i>Even without Genie, I can happily fall asleep tonight.</i>

188
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:58,523
I'm prettier than Yang Ha Neul!

189
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,200
So pretty!

190
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:05,614
<i>Did you have your lunch?</i>

191
00:11:05,614 --> 00:11:06,830
<i>Not yet, right?</i>

192
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,770
<i>Please tell me you didn't.</i>

193
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,780
<i>There's a new family restaurant on Nahyeon Road.</i>

194
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,983
<i>Let's go together.</i>

195
00:11:20,628 --> 00:11:23,101
<i>Let me know when you're ready.</i>

196
00:11:27,116 --> 00:11:29,096
<i>Okay!</i>

197
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,810
Where are you going? It's lunchtime.

198
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:43,197
Dad wants us to eat out today as a family since it's been ages.

199
00:11:44,154 --> 00:11:46,234
Family?

200
00:11:46,234 --> 00:11:48,330
And where is my dad?

201
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,237
Ae Jin.

202
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,310
Don't act like a caring Mother.

203
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,557
It makes me sick.

204
00:11:55,557 --> 00:11:57,237
Are you going somewhere, Ae Jin?

205
00:11:57,237 --> 00:11:59,581
It's been a while since we ate out together.

206
00:11:59,581 --> 00:12:02,477
I'm having lunch with a school friend.

207
00:12:02,477 --> 00:12:04,510
I'm coming home late tonight,

208
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,530
so you should have a nice dinner together.

209
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,735
See you later, mom.

210
00:12:23,506 --> 00:12:25,693
Enjoy your meal.

211
00:12:27,343 --> 00:12:28,443
What?

212
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:30,170
You didn't even try it yet.

213
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,883
Just looking at it is a treat.

214
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:34,120
Let's dig in.

215
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,497
Oh, hang on.

216
00:12:35,497 --> 00:12:37,412
Let me take a picture.

217
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,997
Make sure you send me that picture too.

218
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:52,449
You should go on Wingstagram.

219
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:55,517
Who doesn't do Wingsta these days?

220
00:12:57,381 --> 00:12:59,074
I'm not really interested.

221
00:12:59,074 --> 00:13:01,870
Let's eat. I'm starving.

222
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:13,315
- Is it that good? <br>- It is.

223
00:13:13,315 --> 00:13:15,550
We should hang out more often.

224
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,560
There are so many delicious things in this world.

225
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,454
<i>I… don't like you.</i>

226
00:13:28,454 --> 00:13:32,177
After lunch, shall we go to a kono*? <br>(T/N: Short for coin karaoke box)

227
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:33,801
And then the arcade next?

228
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:35,023
I'm sorry.

229
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,097
Why? Do you have other plans?

230
00:13:37,097 --> 00:13:40,330
I'm supposed to have dinner with my parents.

231
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,863
It's kind of far.

232
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,670
- I'm sorry. <br>- Is that so?

233
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,323
All right. That's fine.

234
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:50,798
It's too bad, though.

235
00:13:50,798 --> 00:13:53,683
<i>It's more disappointing for me.</i>

236
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:57,116
<i>There's something really important today.</i>

237
00:13:58,276 --> 00:14:00,681
<i>(Three Hours Ago)</i>

238
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:01,970
What is this?

239
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,797
It's so noisy.

240
00:14:03,797 --> 00:14:05,690
<i>Aside from the Photoshop ones, she has zero outdoor pictures.</i>

241
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,302
<i>Can we ever see her in real life? Or is she not real?</i>

242
00:14:07,302 --> 00:14:09,902
<i>Man… what's with the black curtain?</i>

243
00:14:09,902 --> 00:14:12,183
<i>Genie, are you a hikikomori*?</i> <br><i>(T/N: Someone who lives in isolation)</i>

244
00:14:12,183 --> 00:14:14,843
<i>It's easy to Photoshop these days, isn't it?</i>

245
00:14:14,843 --> 00:14:17,496
Dammit. How did they know?

246
00:14:17,496 --> 00:14:19,263
<i>They're not wrong.</i>

247
00:14:19,263 --> 00:14:24,396
<i>If the background is complex, I can't use the pictures at all.</i>

248
00:14:25,383 --> 00:14:28,740
<i>That's why natural editing is hard.</i>

249
00:14:31,183 --> 00:14:33,503
<i>So…</i>

250
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:35,943
<i>Do it outside?</i>

251
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:50,336
<i>Did you have lunch?</i>

252
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:51,325
<i>Not yet, right?</i>

253
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:52,943
<i>Please tell me you didn't.</i>

254
00:14:52,943 --> 00:14:54,770
No, not yet.

255
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,670
<i>There's a new family restaurant on Nahyeon Road.</i>

256

<i>Let's go together.</i>

257
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,734
Nahyeon Road.

258
00:15:04,157 --> 00:15:07,683
I don't know anyone there so…

259
00:15:07,683 --> 00:15:10,220
it should be fine.

260
00:15:17,027 --> 00:15:18,220
Next time,

261
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,382
we'll go to the kono and the arcade together, all right?

262
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:25,163
- I'll see you later. <br>- Bye.

<i>I… don't like you.</i>

264
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,470
I did it.

265
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,423
It looks natural!

274
00:17:14,156 --> 00:17:15,677
<i>She looks like a goddess.</i>

275
00:17:15,677 --> 00:17:17,243
<i>How can she look that natural?</i>

276

<i>She seemed naïve enough to believe my words.</i>
