True. She looks like her,<br>but she never admitted it.

00:09:56,773 --> 00:09:58,483
What's wrong all of a sudden?

168
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,967
What is it? Are you leaving<br>me out, because I'm a new student?

169
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:05,200
Come on, tell me. I feel left out.

170
00:10:05,546 --> 00:10:08,919
Well, it's not that interesting.

171
00:10:09,003 --> 00:10:12,608
Hye-yeon, Min-hee,<br>and I were bullied in turns.

172
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:13,967
Something like that.

173
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,067
You know, something everyone<br>experiences from a minor misunderstanding.

174
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,967
And back then, Sae-hee…

175
00:10:20,674 --> 00:10:23,067
- bullied us a bit.<br>- I'm sorry, guys.

176
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:26,033
I should've stopped Ha-neul,

177
00:10:26,182 --> 00:10:28,933
but I was also scared of her.

178
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:32,300
Honestly, on days<br>I couldn't beat you guys up,

179
00:10:32,873 --> 00:10:34,667
she beat me up as much.

180
00:10:34,903 --> 00:10:35,933
What?

181
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:36,967
Really?

182
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,183
Aren't you two close?

183
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:40,649
Yang Ha-neul's a total bully.

184
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:44,167
No, I should've put up<br>with her beating myself,

185
00:10:44,388 --> 00:10:45,929
but I was scared of her too.

186
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:47,680
Stop, that's not right.

187
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,133
It's all my fault.

188
00:10:52,274 --> 00:10:53,982
If you think about it like that,

189
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:56,300
we all feel bad for Ae-jin.

190
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,433
Don't we?

191
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,467
- Yeah, eat.<br>- Okay.

192
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,236
Now, now.

193
00:11:02,331 --> 00:11:04,331
Gathering together like this today

194
00:11:05,088 --> 00:11:06,933
might be our golden opportunity.

195
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,667
What do you mean?

196
00:11:08,907 --> 00:11:12,167
Shouldn't we pay<br>Ha-neul back the same way?

197
00:11:13,352 --> 00:11:14,600
Right, Ae-jin?

198
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:18,333
Why are you taking the lead in this?

199
00:11:18,602 --> 00:11:20,283
You don't have a reason to.

200
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:21,316
Hey, Goo Ae-jin.

201
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,000
- How can you say--<br>- It's just…

202
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:24,526
I can't figure it out.

203
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:26,633
You're different from us.

204
00:11:27,055 --> 00:11:29,167
Aren't you the social media star, Genie?

205
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,900
Everyone loves you<br>even if you don't do anything.

206
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,700
So is there a need to make enemies?

207
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:39,300
I'm just curious, that's all.

208
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:43,633
Did I…

209
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:45,300
overdo it?

210
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,100
I'm…

211
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:50,933
going leave first.

212
00:11:54,127 --> 00:11:55,333
Do you mind moving?

213
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,549
What's with her?

214
00:12:02,633 --> 00:12:04,550
She's so full of herself.

215
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:06,467
Isn't that why she's getting bullied?

216
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:07,643
Totally.

217
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,727
Mi-jin was being thoughtful here.

218
00:12:09,853 --> 00:12:12,235
Like she'd ever be able<br>to talk with Genie again.

219
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,990
Ae-jin.

220
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:22,667
I'm sorry if I offended you.

221
00:12:22,985 --> 00:12:24,233
To be honest,

222
00:12:24,973 --> 00:12:26,033
I was…

223
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,118
also bullied…

224
00:12:28,118 --> 00:12:31,800
like you in my previous school<br>by someone like Yang Ha-neul.

225
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:34,267
So I couldn't control my anger.

226
00:12:34,602 --> 00:12:36,067
Genie was bullied?

227
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:42,733
Actually, I'm…

228
00:12:44,183 --> 00:12:47,833
<i>Say it! Say that you're not Genie!</i>

229
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,567
having a rough time.

230
00:12:54,455 --> 00:12:56,372
I told the others earlier,

231
00:12:56,456 --> 00:13:00,067
but don't talk about<br>social media things in front of me.

232
00:13:00,485 --> 00:13:01,421
Why?

233
00:13:01,505 --> 00:13:04,233
<i>You're scared your lies<br>are getting out of hand, aren't you?</i>

234
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,800
Because…

235
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:08,900
I want you

236
00:13:09,637 --> 00:13:11,893
to look at the real me, as Seon Mi-jin.

237
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:13,767
You'll…

238
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:15,533
promise me, too, right?

239
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,700
<i>(DO YOU WANT TO ACTIVATE THIS ACCOUNT?)<br>(YES, NO)</i>

243
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,667

<i>Let me drink this.</i>

249
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,933

<i>- Was it a girl?<br>- Yeah.</i>

251

<i>These are everything<br>I took from Goo Ae-jin.</i>

253
00:14:49,707 --> 00:14:51,200
It's a coincidence, right?

254
00:14:57,503 --> 00:14:58,567
No way.

255
00:14:59,796 --> 00:15:00,638
I've lost it.

256
00:15:02,524 --> 00:15:04,267
It can't be Goo Ae-jin.

257
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,333
When did you go to that coffee shop?

258
00:15:07,562 --> 00:15:08,424
What?

259
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:11,367
This rooftop coffee shop.

260
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:13,900
<i>(GENIE)</i><br>You were with us after school yesterday.

261
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:16,133
Hey.

262
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,567
You promised<br>not to talk about social media.

263
00:15:18,848 --> 00:15:20,100
It makes me uncomfortable.

264
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:28,733
Their strawberry shortcake is really good.

265
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,467
You should drop by.

266
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:33,167
It's really her.

267
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,567
We made you<br>uncomfortable, didn't we? I'm sorry.

268

Leol tint?

269
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:53,467
Genie doesn't use<br>products from rival companies.

270
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:57,100
Do your research<br>if you're trying to fool us.

<i>Why did you deactivate it?</i>

<i>Did something happen?</i>

274
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:15,600
<i>I was really worried.</i>

275
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:18,167
<i>Did Baek Seol-hee bully you again?</i>

276

<i>I wasn't feeling well.</i>

00:16:39,603 --> 00:16:42,033
<i>A girl named Seon Mi-jin<br>transferred to my class,</i>

282

<i>and she looks a lot like you.</i>

283

<i>Have you been<br>to the coffee shop near Yeonja station?</i>

<i>No.</i>

287
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,033
<i>That's too far.</i>

288
00:17:04,697 --> 00:17:06,667
<i>Isn't that rooftop cafe near that station?</i>

289

<i>Is it?</i>
