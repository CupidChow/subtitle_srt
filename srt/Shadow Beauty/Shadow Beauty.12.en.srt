<i>While living as a social media star,<br>what I envied the most</i>

2
00:00:10,194 --> 00:00:16,182
<i>were the people with much fewer likes<br>and followers than Genie</i>

3
00:00:17,354 --> 00:00:22,074
<i>and pictures of their normal lives<br>without the use of filters.</i>

4
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:27,707
<i>The number of likes being in<br>the double-digits is not pathetic.</i>

5
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:30,462
<i>What makes you happy…</i>

6
00:00:31,104 --> 00:00:33,564
<i>is probably very different from<br>what makes me happy.</i>

7
00:00:34,373 --> 00:00:41,854
<i>At least you don't leave behind<br>your self-esteem in photos.</i>

00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,742
<i>(HO-IN: ARE YOU ASLEEP?)</i>

10
00:01:04,726 --> 00:01:06,375
Good morning, Ha-neul.

11
00:01:07,536 --> 00:01:09,803
What brand is<br>that lip tint you're wearing?

12
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,093
I'm really jealous, Ha-neul.

13
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,928
You can pull off both pink<br>and orange colors.

14
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:26,923
Normally, if you look good<br>in pink, you don't in orange.

15
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:29,651
Really?

16
00:01:32,671 --> 00:01:34,267
Do you want to try it?

17
00:01:34,406 --> 00:01:35,617
Seriously?

18
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:39,039
Then… put it on for me.

19
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:57,349
How about taking a selfie together?

20
00:02:03,696 --> 00:02:05,480
Come on.

21
00:02:06,364 --> 00:02:08,264
One, two, three.

22
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:16,476
As I mentioned before,

23
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:18,234
Mencius lived in<br>a confusing era as he was the eldest son

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,240
of the Crown Prince<br>during the Warring States period.

25
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:22,884
Here's a very important concept.

26
00:02:23,036 --> 00:02:25,335
What did Mencius value?

27
00:02:25,928 --> 00:02:29,287
Just go to sleep if you guys<br>are going to chat like that.

28
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:31,849
He valued righteousness.

29
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:34,695
Mencius and Confucius…<br>Hey, I told you to quiet down.

30
00:02:35,117 --> 00:02:37,912
Mencius was influenced<br>by Confucius's righteousness.

31
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:40,227
By righteousness…

32
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:47,194
Ji-young, save a seat for us both.

33
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:49,664
Sure. Then five seats<br>under the air-conditioner.

34
00:02:49,785 --> 00:02:52,093
- I'm going to stop by the bathroom.<br>- Okay.

35
00:02:56,396 --> 00:02:58,674
We… need to talk.

36
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:00,132
What is it?

37
00:03:17,783 --> 00:03:19,179
Give me back my phone now.

38
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:20,402
What phone?

39
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:22,613
Did you give me one?

40
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,001
Oh…

41
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,284
- This?<br>- Give it back!

42
00:03:31,368 --> 00:03:34,057
Why are you doing this to me?

43
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:38,542
So why did you mess with me<br>in the first place?

44
00:03:38,648 --> 00:03:42,350
<i>Seon Mi-jin,<br>how did you know that the necklace</i>

45
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:44,239
<i>in Yang Ha-neul's bag was mine?</i>

46
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,343
<i>Sae-hee… told me to say it.</i>

47
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:50,062
<i>She had me go through her bag<br>once she gave the signal.</i>

48
00:03:52,671 --> 00:03:54,179
<i>I'm Genie.</i>

49
00:03:58,445 --> 00:04:00,468
<i>Explain yourself.<br></i>

50
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:01,656
<i>Hey, is she really Genie?</i>

51
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,781
<i>She never admitted she was.</i>

52
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:10,835
If you're ugly, just continue living<br>the life of a loser.

53
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:14,887
So this was what's behind your confidence.

54
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,195
Hey, you're the worst.

55
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:23,554
You played with Yang Ha-neul,<br>calling her best friend and all.

56
00:04:24,906 --> 00:04:26,398
You saw her, right?

57
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:31,109
How she clings to me<br>even though she knows I'm not Genie.

58
00:04:33,414 --> 00:04:34,885
It's only natural.

59
00:04:35,398 --> 00:04:37,484
After spending some time alone,

60
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:40,044
she must've come back to her senses.

61
00:04:43,134 --> 00:04:44,304
That reminds me…

62
00:04:46,002 --> 00:04:48,104
This was loaded with interesting things.

63
00:04:48,436 --> 00:04:50,304
Lee Jin-sung from A.S.T.A.

64
00:04:50,784 --> 00:04:53,918
There was even a naughty video of him.

65
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,217
What's the point<br>of being an idol or a goddess?

66
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:02,568
You're all trash.

67
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,773
You bitch! Give me back my phone!

68
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,517
I'm going to kill you!

69
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:16,803
Wow… Even a loser<br>can be terrifying when they're mad.

70
00:05:16,855 --> 00:05:18,429
You're freaking scary right now.

71
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:22,254
Give me back my phone, you bitch!

72
00:05:22,518 --> 00:05:25,240
Hey, what's Lee Jin-sung to you anyway?

73
00:05:25,595 --> 00:05:27,552
Do you really think he cares about you?

74
00:05:27,883 --> 00:05:29,857
You crazy bitch, look at the mirror.

75
00:05:30,186 --> 00:05:32,784
Does he know that you're Genie?

76
00:05:35,065 --> 00:05:38,914
Goo Ae-jin, this is all<br>your doing. You crazy bitch.

77
00:05:39,713 --> 00:05:41,979
Reset the password<br>when I give you a chance…

78
00:05:42,254 --> 00:05:44,257
Before you regret it even more later.

79
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,078
I'll give you until the festival.

00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,466
Stop it.

83
00:06:18,555 --> 00:06:23,057
She's probably getting some snacks<br>with her friends after the evening class.

84

Here.

85

Honey, did you look<br>into hospitals for Ae-jin?

86
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,296
I did.

87
00:06:43,588 --> 00:06:45,754
Why isn't she picking up?

88
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:46,833
Hey!

89
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:49,039
- Isn't there anything special we can do?<br>- Nope.

90
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:50,075
There must be one.

91
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,976
Something that'll make everyone<br>swarm to our event.

92
00:06:52,977 --> 00:06:56,150
- There has to be something…<br>- Just do it yourself.

93
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,597
Hey, we're going to be seniors next year.

94
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:01,842
We've got to enjoy it when we can.

95
00:07:01,926 --> 00:07:03,590
But you don't even study.

96
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,974
How about using Genie?

97
00:07:06,984 --> 00:07:08,452
Seon Mi-jin?

98
00:07:10,702 --> 00:07:11,793
Look.

99
00:07:11,957 --> 00:07:14,900
People will rush over<br>to see Genie in real life.

100
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:16,701
So let's use that.

101
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:19,234
So how about a photo booth?

102
00:07:19,592 --> 00:07:21,569
A selfie with Genie?

103
00:07:22,293 --> 00:07:24,296
That's all great, but…

104
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:26,766
Mi-jin, it's a good idea.

105
00:07:30,644 --> 00:07:32,619
How about a live stream?

106
00:07:35,318 --> 00:07:37,518
- Are you up for it?<br>- What?

107
00:07:39,944 --> 00:07:43,218
Well… I…

108
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,533
If everyone wants it, then sure.

109
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:50,157
Wow!

110
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:53,057
I'm really excited.

111
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:57,708
Seon Mi-jin, I look forward to it.

112
00:07:59,907 --> 00:08:01,218
It'll definitely…

113
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:04,320
be the best festival.

114
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,787
Of course.

115
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,016
We have Genie in our class.

116
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,851
<i>You're fake. Yes, you are!<br>Now give it to me!</i>

117
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,888
Stop!

118
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:43,737
Stop!

119
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:47,289
- Ae-jin, open the door.<br>- Honey.

120
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:48,828
Did Ae-jin have another nightmare?

121
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,956
Let go!

122
00:08:55,628 --> 00:09:00,073
Honey, I think she went back<br>to sleep. Let's talk to her tomorrow.

123
00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:04,451
We can't leave Ae-jin like that.

124
00:09:05,105 --> 00:09:07,783
She keeps bringing up<br>a sister she doesn't even have.

125
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:10,105
She's getting more unusual.

126
00:09:12,446 --> 00:09:14,106
- Honey.<br>- We have to…

127
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:17,123
get Ae-jin into a hospital.

128
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:57,193
Miss, are you okay?

129
00:09:57,627 --> 00:09:58,838
Miss!

130
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:22,084
Hey! Watch where you're going!

131
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,811

Hey, don't stand next to her.

135
00:10:44,187 --> 00:10:45,781
You look like a dried-up squid.
