00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:04,625
Jin-sung, look at your eye bags!<br>Did you not get enough sleep last night?

2
00:00:06,054 --> 00:00:07,812
It hasn't hit me yet.

3
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:11,227
Relax. Just do as you practiced.

4
00:00:12,077 --> 00:00:13,221
Done.

5
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:14,954
Thank you.

8

<i>Hi, Jin-sung.</i>

9
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:41,445
<i>I already messed up<br>four pages writing that,</i>

10
00:00:41,665 --> 00:00:44,101
<i>because I didn't know what to write after.</i>

11

<i>Everything I said to you until now…</i>

12
00:00:47,993 --> 00:00:51,718
<i>Failures huddling up<br>and comforting each other is stupid.</i>

13
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:53,573
<i>So get lost already.</i>

14
00:00:53,657 --> 00:00:55,679
<i>And those puzzling things I did to you…</i>

15
00:00:58,497 --> 00:01:00,835
<i>I couldn't find a way to explain</i>

16
00:01:01,264 --> 00:01:04,171
<i>without being frank.</i>

17
00:01:05,423 --> 00:01:06,851
<i>I liked you.</i>

<i>I… tried not to like you</i>

20
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:18,945
<i>and tried to fool my heart.</i>

21
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:24,468
<i>I couldn't get closer to you,</i>

22
00:01:24,788 --> 00:01:28,117
<i>had no choice but to put up<br>a wall between us,</i>

23
00:01:28,643 --> 00:01:31,812
<i>got angry as I liked, got disappointed,</i>

24

32

<i>P.S. You have what it takes<br>to make a girl obsess over you.</i>

33

36
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:14,435
Okay.

37
00:02:16,522 --> 00:02:18,015
A.S.T.A., get on stage now.

38
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,234
Miss, can you smile a bit?

39
00:02:35,732 --> 00:02:39,429
Here I go. One, two, three.

40
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:43,359
How much editing do you want?

41
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:46,125
Should I make your eyes bigger<br>and smooth out your jawline?

42
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:47,109
Just…

43
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:50,148
print it…

44
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:52,429
as it is, please.

45
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:54,546
You're the first to ask that.

00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,859

I'm Genie.

How can you do this to me?

60

Out of all the people, how can you…

61
00:04:50,814 --> 00:04:52,843
Was it fun making a fool out of me?

Even complimenting<br>your looks and saying I'm jealous.

65
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:03,914
Watching me<br>pathetically act all high and mighty

sure must've been hilarious.

00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:10,656
Tell me. Was it?

69
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:14,703
I… I had no idea<br>I'd transfer to this school.

70
00:05:15,312 --> 00:05:17,784
And I didn't intend<br>to fool you from the start.

71
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:21,414
Still! You should've<br>told me when we first met!

72

I was Genie…

75
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:40,234
would we have become friends?

76
00:07:14,156 --> 00:07:17,695
Ae-jin, what happened? What's wrong?

77
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,773
Ae-jin, open the door.

Ae-jin. Ae-jin!

79
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,250
Open up.

80
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:37,051
I'm sorry. I'll try harder from now on.

You've been to this coffee shop, right?

84
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:50,234
Your profile picture.<br>Wasn't it taken here?

85
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:54,382
Hey, it's not what you think. I'm serious.

86
00:07:54,532 --> 00:07:56,335
You know nothing happened.

87
00:08:00,434 --> 00:08:02,027
Why did you take off your glasses?

90
00:08:16,004 --> 00:08:17,669
Let's break up.

91
00:08:20,881 --> 00:08:22,381
For real?

92
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:24,751
You're the worst.

93
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,145
Why do I always<br>have to be the sincere one?

94
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,835
You never think of me.

95
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:33,718
Not even once.

96
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:41,250
So why do you want me<br>to be sincere until the very end?

97
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,507
You're… really the worst.

98
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:00,976
Now then, I'll collect the answer sheets.

99
00:09:06,437 --> 00:09:08,328
<i>(FINAL EXAMS)<br>The finals ended.</i>

100
00:09:09,273 --> 00:09:11,695
<i>Ho-in and Ha-neul broke up.</i>

101
00:09:12,578 --> 00:09:15,171
<i>They became very awkward.</i>

102
00:09:15,882 --> 00:09:18,988
<i>But nobody noticed<br>since they were going out in secret.</i>

103
00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:21,792
<i>And Ha-neul and I…</i>

104

<i>became more awkward<br>than a couple who broke up.</i>

<i>Since that fire extinguisher incident,<br>no one has mentioned Sae-hee's name.</i>

<i>Like that, she became<br>a ghost in the classroom.</i>

00:09:44,031 --> 00:09:45,687
Try it. It's new.

108

117
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,796
- What do I do?<br>- Should I get an autograph now?

118
00:10:18,936 --> 00:10:21,319
Let's do that. And also a photo together.

119
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,400
My bad.

120
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,857
Hey, can't you see it's scratched?

121
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,372
This is a new sponsored product.

122
00:10:40,865 --> 00:10:43,220
If you're going<br>to apologize, do it properly.

123
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:48,841
I'm sorry.

124
00:10:57,756 --> 00:11:00,295
Do you think I'm begging for an apology?

125
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,242
Hey, Seon Mi-jin.

126
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,603
Wait.

127
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,176
I'm in a really bad mood right now.

128
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:08,434

129
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:09,872

134
00:11:20,031 --> 00:11:21,435
She never admitted it.

135
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,825
Explain yourself. What is this?

136
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:26,747
Were you uncomfortable,<br>because you were lying?

137
00:11:29,865 --> 00:11:30,810
<i>(GENIE)</i><br>This.

138

How did you post it<br>when you were attacking Ha-neul just now?

139
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,607
With a computer. I asked my mom to do it.

140
00:11:38,216 --> 00:11:40,286
I couldn't do it, because our<br>phones were collected during the exams.

141
00:11:41,896 --> 00:11:45,263
As you all know, loads of people<br>impersonate me these days.

142
00:11:52,142 --> 00:11:54,286
Believe me or not, it's up to you.

I don't think I can forgive you.

00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:44,394
I'm sorry.

146
00:12:45,336 --> 00:12:46,918
Even if you weren't Genie, I might have--

147
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:49,521
Stop… lying.

148
00:13:22,489 --> 00:13:23,756
Let go.

149
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:25,404
Let go of me!

150
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:26,638
We need to talk.

151
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:28,224
Talk? I've got nothing to say.

152
00:13:29,982 --> 00:13:33,724
Something's going on<br>these days, right? Stop making me upset.

153
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:35,169
Let go of me already.

154
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:38,629
Don't you ever think about me?

Why on earth am I your only daughter?

158
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:50,223
What about Sae-jin?

159
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,412
Tell me! What about my sister!

160
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,872
Ae-jin, what… What's wrong with you?

161
00:13:59,953 --> 00:14:02,453
You don't have a sister!
