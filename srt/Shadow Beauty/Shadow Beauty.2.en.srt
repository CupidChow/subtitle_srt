00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,125
<i>(Why are you sweating so much? Are you okay? Koo Ae Jin!)</i>

168
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,754
Koo Ae Jin!

169
00:10:01,197 --> 00:10:02,944
You had evening classes today?

170
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:04,003
Yeah.

171
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:07,382
For the time being, they'll be redoing the interior of our dance practice room.

172
00:10:07,382 --> 00:10:09,361
So…

173
00:10:10,364 --> 00:10:12,871
it's my day off.

174
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:13,990
But…

175
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,790
isn't your house in the opposite direction?

176
00:10:17,443 --> 00:10:19,790
I wanted to walk you home.

177
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:23,583
And it's been a while since I've had a night stroll.

178
00:10:25,586 --> 00:10:29,499
You sound like an old man who lives in the countryside.

179
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:30,555
How did you know?

180
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:34,390
All my teachers call me an old man.

181
00:10:41,877 --> 00:10:44,777
You pay for something like this?

182
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,857
You're very strange.

183
00:10:46,857 --> 00:10:49,271
There's a convenience store in front of our practice room.

184
00:10:49,271 --> 00:10:52,076
During our overnight dance practice, <br>everyone would have coffee.

185
00:10:52,076 --> 00:10:56,397
I can't drink coffee or energy drinks <br>because of my weak stomach.

186
00:10:56,397 --> 00:11:00,270
That's how I became addicted to milk tea.

187
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,860
You'll soon realize the charms of milk tea.

188
00:11:17,283 --> 00:11:20,523
- It's really good. <br>- Right? I told you.

189
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,617
This is what I like about you.

190
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:28,003
- What do you mean? <br>- "It's really good." That's it.

191
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:30,735
It sounds more genuine than expressive words.

192
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:34,030
I can believe whatever you say.

193
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,097
Strange, isn't it?

194
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:40,977
I lie very easily.

195
00:11:40,977 --> 00:11:43,140
You?

196
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,450
Whatever!

197
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,770
It's true.

198
00:11:57,026 --> 00:11:59,099
It's a full moon.

199
00:12:00,148 --> 00:12:02,315
It's beautiful.

200
00:12:02,315 --> 00:12:03,980
Right?

201
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,335
<i>Because you're good-looking yourself,</i>

202
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:14,057
<i>the whole world must look beautiful.</i>

203
00:12:14,926 --> 00:12:16,726
<i>I wish…</i>

204
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:19,130
<i>I was beautiful too.</i>

205
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,123
Well.

206
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:22,917
It looks flat.

207
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:24,784
If you actually saw it in person,

208
00:12:24,784 --> 00:12:27,183
it'd probably look ugly with all those big holes.

209
00:12:27,183 --> 00:12:30,730
A half-moon or a crescent would probably look better.

210
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:36,530
But… you know what?

211
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,883
Half-moon or crescent, they're both the same.

212
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:42,363
It's just hidden in shadow.

213
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:48,310
A real thing is laid bare without anything hidden.

214
00:12:50,482 --> 00:12:53,175
That's why I like the full moon.

215
00:12:53,175 --> 00:12:55,602
It's the real thing.

216
00:12:55,602 --> 00:12:57,450
Just like you.

217
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,242
<i>That's not true.</i>

218
00:13:02,242 --> 00:13:06,131
<i>I'm just… darkness.</i>

219
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:09,377
<i>The darkest of the dark.</i>

220
00:13:09,377 --> 00:13:14,249
Did you get drunk off milk tea?

221
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:15,399
It's late.

222
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:17,290
We should go.

223
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:23,257
Koo Ae Jin!

224
00:13:23,257 --> 00:13:25,630
Wait for me!

225
00:13:27,404 --> 00:13:29,517
Why did you leave this behind?

226
00:13:39,657 --> 00:13:44,390
<i>Came to refresh my eyes, but there's nothing new. So sad.</i>

227
00:13:45,517 --> 00:13:48,056
<i>It's been a week since Genie posted a picture.</i>

228
00:13:48,056 --> 00:13:50,160
<i>What's going on?</i>

229
00:13:52,516 --> 00:13:54,763
<i>Why is her profile picture showing her back?</i>

230
00:13:54,763 --> 00:13:58,053
<i>She's making us all feel worried.</i>

231
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,083
<i>I heard she was drafted into the military.</i>

232
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,263
<i>We'll have to wait for 100 days.</i>

233
00:14:05,263 --> 00:14:08,010
<i>Who is she to keep defending her?</i>

234
00:14:10,843 --> 00:14:14,590
He'll go nuts if I post a new picture.

235
00:14:17,076 --> 00:14:18,395
<i>(lambsky: Are the anxiety attacks coming back? <br>Did you take your meds?)</i>

236
00:14:18,395 --> 00:14:19,683
<i>Yes.</i>

237
00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:22,256
<i>(The comments are crazy! I'm like your manager.)</i>

238
00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:24,030
<i>Thanks.</i>

239
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:30,356
<i>(Then get better soon)</i>

240
00:14:30,356 --> 00:14:31,663
<i>Why are you late on the post? We can't even reach you.</i>

241
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,483
<i>Genie, please check our package.</i>

242
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:35,205
<i>If you don't post within the promised time,</i>

243
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:38,090
<i>you'll have to pay the fine for breach of contract.</i>

244
00:14:39,823 --> 00:14:42,017
What should I do?

245
00:14:47,297 --> 00:14:48,271
<i>First comment!</i>

246
00:14:48,271 --> 00:14:50,343
<i>Unni, I missed you!</i>

247
00:14:50,343 --> 00:14:52,157
<i>What a goddess!</i>

248
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:53,485
<i>Just take my money!</i>

249
00:14:53,485 --> 00:14:56,258
<i>Seriously, she's dazzling!</i>

250
00:14:56,258 --> 00:14:57,181
<i> Hey, loser! </i>

251
00:14:57,181 --> 00:14:59,631
Do you know where this bag is from?

252
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:02,300
Hey!

253
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,693
Are you ignoring me again?

254
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:05,493
Why, this loser…

255
00:15:05,493 --> 00:15:07,017
She's ignoring us again!

256
00:15:07,017 --> 00:15:08,540
Hey.

257
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,539
Hey.

258
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:12,197
Koo Ae Jin, do you have a death wish?

259
00:15:12,197 --> 00:15:15,392
She really must be crazy.

260
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:16,597
Hey!

261
00:15:16,597 --> 00:15:20,003
I'm talking to you, you bitch.

262
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:23,093
Give that back!

263
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,517
<i>(coooolguy777: You posted another picture.)</i>

264
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,045
Wow! You really must be crazy!

265
00:15:34,045 --> 00:15:36,370
<i>Ignoring me? You better respond.</i>

266
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,043

00:15:46,463 --> 00:15:47,243
Let her be.

<i>Answer. Answer.</i>

275
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:50,829
What is she, a zombie?

276
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:51,903
<i>- Answer.</i> <br>- Look at my arm!

<i>Answer.</i>

278
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:54,516
She left a mark!

279
00:15:54,516 --> 00:15:55,556
I'm so mad!

- How dare she? <br><i>- Answer.</i>

282
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,890
Don't do that again.

283
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:03,177
What are you looking at?

284
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:05,592
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

285
00:16:12,612 --> 00:16:14,943
<i>Finally, an answer. We should meet first.</i>

286
00:16:14,943 --> 00:16:18,320
<i>At the lounge after school.</i>

287
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,283
<i>(Lounge)</i>

288
00:17:21,723 --> 00:17:23,637
It was you?

289
00:17:26,153 --> 00:17:28,599
Did I startle you?

290
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,400
How did you know I was here?

291
00:17:34,692 --> 00:17:36,204
I was waiting for you at the school gates.

292
00:17:36,204 --> 00:17:37,730
But you never came out.

293
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,017
I looked for you everywhere.

294
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:44,343
By the way, what are you doing here?

295
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:46,063
<i>I have to send him away.</i>

296
00:17:46,063 --> 00:17:49,297
<i>Or even Jin Sung will find out.</i>

297
00:17:49,297 --> 00:17:51,903
What? What's going on?

298
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:54,103
My mom said she'd pick me up.

299
00:17:54,103 --> 00:17:54,850
Go on.

300
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,803
- Then I'll wait with you. <br>- No, just go.

301
00:17:56,803 --> 00:17:58,410
I have lots to think about.

302
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,940
Fine, fine, I'll leave.

303
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,330
<i>Why is he still there?</i>

304
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,090
<i> Could it be Jin Sung? </i>

305
00:18:31,995 --> 00:18:34,028
<i>When are you coming?</i>

306
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:37,330
<i>I'm in the lounge by myself.</i>

307
00:18:56,643 --> 00:18:58,723
<i>When do you think I'll be there?</i>

308
00:18:58,723 --> 00:19:00,960
<i>Curious, aren't you?</i>

<i>What are you expecting?</i>

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,817
<i>I'll give you a mission.</i>

<i>Tomorrow, put on the hot pink tint you used two weeks ago.</i>

<i>Even if you put lipstick on a pig, it's still a pig!</i>

318
00:19:46,923 --> 00:19:49,103
<i>Is he making fun of me?</i>

319
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:51,790
<i>Is he playing with me?</i>

320
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,404
<i>Jin Sung!</i>

321
00:19:59,404 --> 00:20:01,850
<i>Tell me it isn't you!</i>
