You should answer when somebody calls you.

169
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,697
Wow! Daebak!

170
00:12:53,469 --> 00:12:56,996
Friend, even if you put lipstick on a pig, it's still a pig!

171
00:12:56,996 --> 00:12:59,090
Have you absolutely gone nuts?

172
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,903
What is that smeared all over your lips?

173
00:13:01,903 --> 00:13:02,703
Wait a minute.

174
00:13:02,703 --> 00:13:05,390
This calls for a snapshot.

175
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,556
- Snapshot! <br>- Snapshot!

176
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,963
Koo Ae Jin, go take a pose.

177
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:09,470
Hurry!

178
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,617
- Wow! <br>- Let me see.

179
00:13:11,617 --> 00:13:13,757
We'll take a nice picture.

180
00:13:13,757 --> 00:13:15,110
Come on. Stay still!

181
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,009
I still can't believe it!

182
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:20,664
Koo Ae Jin you look so sexy right now!

183
00:13:20,664 --> 00:13:22,165
I can't believe it.

184
00:13:22,165 --> 00:13:24,437
Did it come out nice?

185
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:27,001
I'm going to look at this every time I feel down!

186
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:29,580
It'll brighten me up!

187
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,183
Yang Ha Neul! Jo Sae Hee!

188
00:13:32,183 --> 00:13:33,943
Are you two harassing Ae Jin again?

189
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:35,877
Not at all.

190
00:13:35,877 --> 00:13:38,043
- We're close! <br>- Koo Ae Jin.

191
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:41,336
What's with that lipstick? Did you put it on?

192
00:13:42,683 --> 00:13:43,890
Yes, I did.

193
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,350
I know everyone's into makeup these days, but this is a school.

194
00:13:49,123 --> 00:13:51,537
Hurry up and take it off.

195
00:14:11,085 --> 00:14:13,132
<i>You look pretty.</i>

196
00:15:09,502 --> 00:15:11,856
Due to our school's electrical construction,

197
00:15:11,856 --> 00:15:14,476
there won't be any evening classes today.

198
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:16,677
Be quiet, please!

199
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:20,230
You'll be seniors next year.

200
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,670
Don't make any plans to go out.

201
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,323
Please go home and study.

202
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,680
- Yes. <br>- Yes.

203
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,970
- Goodbye.

204
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,170
- Bye. <br> - Hurry up.
