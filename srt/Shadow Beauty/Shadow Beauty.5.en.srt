Nobody's curious.

162
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:20,730
Are you?

163
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,986
Can't you be nice<br>to your classmate who's leaving?

164
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:24,550
Just get ready for class.

165
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:08,010
<i>(TO AE-JIN)</i>

166
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:14,267
<i>(HAPPY BIRTHDAY)</i>

167
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:15,680
<i>Goo Ae-jin.</i>

168
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,678
<i>Happy early birthday!</i>

169
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:21,533
<i>I don't think I can be with you on your birthday, so happy early birthday!</i>

170
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:26,267
<i>Goo Ae-jin, you're my one and only good memory.</i>

171
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:27,729
<i>Thanks…</i>

172
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:31,620
<i>for eating lunch<br>with me. I didn't feel lonely.</i>

173
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:35,133
You know what, Jin-sung?

174
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:42,467
I'm stupid, so I ruined our relationship.

175
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:48,060
What was so important<br>about that video you sent me?

176
00:12:49,396 --> 00:12:55,396
I'll never have a friend like you again.

177
00:12:57,787 --> 00:13:03,387
I tried really hard not to.

178
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:06,400
But I kept getting greedy.

179
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:13,536
And in the end I messed up our relationship.

180
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:18,933
You did nothing wrong from the start.

181
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:21,223
It was all me.

182
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:30,877
Goo Ae-jin. It's all right.

183
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:32,977
Don't cry.

184
00:13:36,986 --> 00:13:40,986
<i>I like you.</i>

185
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:49,809
<i>So I'm sorry.</i>

186
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,514
What the hell?

187
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:11,662
A monologue?

188
00:14:11,662 --> 00:14:14,000
Has she finally gone mad?

189
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:58,389
Goo Ae-jin. You're really interesting.

190
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:08,133
Come on… Stop making me feel more excited.

191
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,417
Didn't I tell you<br>not to wait in front of my house?

192
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:23,233
I stopped by while I was passing by.

193
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:28,003
Did something good happen?

194
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:29,966
No.

195
00:15:30,803 --> 00:15:31,831
Where were you?

196
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:35,036
Nowhere special. Just on a walk.

197
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:37,937
It's late.

198
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,537
Let's go.

199
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:41,790
I'll drop you off.

200
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:50,015
Let me drink this. I'm thirsty.

201
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,359
- You can't.<br>- Why?

202
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:53,140
You can't even take in caffeine.

203
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,440
I'm going to drink it.

204
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,820
I told you you can't!

205
00:16:01,717 --> 00:16:04,817
<i>(NARAE MAEUL)</i><br>Ho-in.

206
00:16:04,817 --> 00:16:08,916
How do I look today? I'm wearing a new dress.

207
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,069
I don't know.

208
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,333
Your bangs are all I can see.

209
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,103
- My bangs?<br>- Yeah.

210
00:16:16,103 --> 00:16:18,400
It's super weird.

211
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,489
Bye.

212
00:16:43,026 --> 00:16:45,212
I'm exhausted.

213
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:49,241
Seriously?

214
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:53,180
Even if I skip dinner<br>and work out, it won't go down below 40.

215
00:16:55,478 --> 00:16:57,749
She's all skin and bone.

216
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:12,380
How plain.

217
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,520
<i>I want to get prettier.</i>

218
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,100
<i>I want to become a better me.</i>

219
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:27,964
<i>I want to be loved by Ho-in more so that…</i>

220
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:31,133
<i>I don't feel lonely.</i>

221
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:36,319
- Have you had dinner?<br>- No.

222
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,113
But it's way past dinner time.

223
00:17:39,113 --> 00:17:40,546
I don't need it.

224
00:17:40,546 --> 00:17:42,367
I'm on a diet.

225
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:47,218
You'll get sick if you don't eat properly,<br>especially since you're still growing.

226
00:17:47,218 --> 00:17:49,354
Mom!

227
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:52,058
Mom! Are you okay?

228
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:07,216
I'm fine.

229
00:18:07,216 --> 00:18:09,067
Should I make you some fried rice?

230
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:10,900
Forget it.

231
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,981
What about the hospital?<br>Have you gone to one?

232
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:16,602
I will.

233
00:18:16,602 --> 00:18:18,932
You didn't again?

234
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,435
How about some fruits?

235
00:18:20,435 --> 00:18:23,530
How many times<br>do I have to tell you I don't need it?

236
00:18:32,114 --> 00:18:36,380
My baby, you even cleaned the whole house.

237
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,121
Thanks.

238
00:18:38,121 --> 00:18:39,933
You have to go to the hospital tomorrow.

239
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:41,733
Okay.

240
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:54,279
<i>(MY BOO)</i>

241
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:57,567
What? I've never seen this photo before.

242
00:18:59,887 --> 00:19:03,600
Who took this profile picture for him?

243
00:19:18,584 --> 00:19:21,251
<i>(SHADOW BEAUTY)</i>

244
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:23,949
I thought you'd be<br>too depressed to eat anything.

245
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:27,022
- But you're really digging in.<br>- Do you have a death wish?

246
00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:31,019
<i>Are you going to tell the others </i>

247
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:32,966
Hey, you bitch!

248
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:37,075
I must've eaten something weird<br>at your mom's shitty restaurant.

249
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,667
<i>What are you doing?</i>

250
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:40,005
<i>Why are you laughing at me?</i>

251
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:42,505
<i>Do you think we can really be friends?</i>

252
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:46,980
<i>Hey, do I look<br>that easy and stupid to you?</i>

253
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,400
Apologize properly.
