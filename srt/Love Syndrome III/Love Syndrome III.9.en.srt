1
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,920
Where is Itt?

2
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,880
If you can't think of where he is, you're not worthy of seeing him.

3
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,080
- Argh!
- Screw you!

4
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,680
P'Itt, are you afraid of me?

5
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,760
- No.
- That's good to hear.

6
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,400
I'm not going to do anything even though I want to.

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,840
- Happy birthday.
- Couple rings?

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,960
P'Itt is now at an important site of memory for both of you.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,640
Huai Mae Khamin Waterfall.

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,360
Day?

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,280
Why did you run away?

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,440
This is why I ran away.

13
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,240
You can't ever be nice to me. That's why I left.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,880
Two pillows and two blankets?

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,040
- Whose are they?
- Uh.

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,480
Day.

17
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,200
I know that I shouldn't trust someone that easily.

18
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:43,120
I know I shouldn't sleep with someone on our first meeting day.

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,640
But I'm safe and sound.

20
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,240
Day?

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,640
You know it's wrong

22
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,600
yet you did it.

23
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,040
What was I supposed to do?

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,600
I was afraid of ghosts, and I was alone.

25
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,200
That was why I asked Peace to sleep with me.

26
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,400
Besides,

27
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,080
I didn't have you last night.

28
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,280
Just one night without me...

29
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,560
and you started looking for someone to sleep with you?

30
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,120
Darn it, Day.

31
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,200
If you don't trust me that badly, why did you follow me here?

32
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,200
Why don't you just leave me here?

33
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,440
Are you two fighting again?

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,040
Yeah.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,840
What's with all the fighting?

36
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,280
You two just met.

37
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,880
I asked Peace to sleep with me last night.

38
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,000
Who's Peace?

39
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,600
That guy who set up a tent next to mine.

40
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,640
Oh.

41
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,880
Itt!

42
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,720
Are you an idiot?

43
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,880
You had this coming!

44
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,080
Night?

45
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,000
This time, I think you're in the wrong.

46
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,520
Night, please. Aren't you going to back me up?

47
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,640
I was afraid of ghosts.

48
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,640
P'Day cares about you.

49
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,840
Day, what happened to your hand?

50
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,240
Nothing.

51
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,640
Night, what happened to his hand?

52
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,680
P'Nan said that after hitting you,

53
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,120
he punched a wall with that hand

54
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,000
to punish himself.

55
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,000
Boss, there's someone on the track!

56
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,000
What is wrong with you?

57
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,280
Do you want to die that badly?

58
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,360
Do you know what you just did?

59
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Why can't I remember?

60
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,480
Day!

61
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,200
He always cares about me, but not himself.

62
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,240
Aw, aw, aw!

63
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,560
You care about him,

64
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,880
but how about this scar on my face?

65
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,800
My friends? Huh?

66
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,120
Did you get in a fight with a dog?

67
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,120
Dog? The same dog that loves biting your neck.

68
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,320
Day?

69
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,320
Yeah!

70
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,880
He was ruthless. He tried to drown me!

71
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,000
He kept asking where you were. He was merciless!

72
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,560
I feel the pain as I'm talking about it.

73
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,640
I apologize for him.

74
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,480
No need to.

75
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,440
I got a new stereo set. Everything's good.

76
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,680
- Hm!
- Aw!

77
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,640
- Hey! That really hurts!
- All it takes is a stereo set?

78
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,720
I am. I'm good!

79
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,520
Are you?

80
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,520
(Chuckling)

81
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,200
Very speedy healing, huh?

82
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,800
A stereo set?

83
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,360
A stereo set? Huh?

84
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,880
(Chuckling)

85
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,560
- You hugged me again.
- I'm good as new.

86
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,880
That's too quick!

87
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,160
Day?

88
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,120
Behind that waterfall

89
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,880
is where we kissed?

90
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,600
Day, you remember?

91
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,840
Don't be too happy.

92
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,640
- It's not much.
- I'll take what I can get.

93
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,680
I think you should stop coming here.

94
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,400
- Every time you come here, you get a new friend.
- What?

95
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,400
Ball, for example.

96
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,760
Day.

97
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,680
I like this place

98
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,000
and love this place

99
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,120
because of you.

100
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,760
You and I had a good time here.

101
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,040
When you're hurt,

102
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,360
I am too.

103
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,160
You think you're the only one feeling that way?

104
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,360
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,080
I'll be more mindful from now on.

106
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,400
I'll take good care of myself

107
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,320
just like how you took good care of me.

108
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,160
Good.

109
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,880
But don't think I'm not going to punish you.

110
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,040
Tonight,

111
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,800
we'll settle it.

112
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,680
That hurts!

113
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,160
Sorry.

114
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,080
Hey! Bast!

115
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,360
You know how to talk.

116
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,120
Can you take this customer?

117
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,840
Hello, sir.

118
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,280
Whatever you're looking for, we have it all.

119
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,880
Our staff will take care of your car for a lifetime!

120
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,160
I guarantee your satisfaction.

121
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,200
Nice.

122
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,920
Yeah.

123
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,760
I'm looking for Day and Itt.

124
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,280
I went to their house, and they weren't there.

125
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,760
That's why I came here.

126
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,600
P'Day and P'Itt!

127
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,600
Yes, Day and Itt.

128
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,080
I'm their old friend.

129
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,040
I miss them. That's why I came.

130
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,400
Do you know where they are?

131
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,040
I'm going to surprise them.

132
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,440
They're going to be happy to see me.

133
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,880
Oh!

134
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,720
Let me help.

135
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,200
Sit.

136
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Water?

137
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,640
Hey, you two. Do you want to go swimming with us?

138
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,400
I'm thinking of swimming with Gear at the second level of the waterfall.

139
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,160
I want you to come with us.

140
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,320
Good idea. Day? Let's go.

141
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,080
Please, Day.

142
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,000
I've been swimming alone for several days.

143
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,000
Go swimming with me?

144
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,840
I doubt you've been swimming alone.

145
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,720
P'Itt, where will you swim today?

146
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,160
We'd like to join. More people would mean more fun.

147
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,240
Of course. I'm thinking of the second level.

148
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,800
You can join us. Let's go.

149
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,080
Day, get up.

150
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,240
- That's so nice.
- Quickly.

151
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,880
What are your names?

152
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,000
This is Gear, my friend.

153
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

154
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,080
This is Night. He's probably the same age as you.

155
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,360
- Hi.
- Hi.

156
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,680
And this...

157
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,680
is Day.

158
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,680
- Hi.
- Hi.

159
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
P'Itt...

160
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,040
Oh, this is Kung.

161
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,960
- Hi.
- Hi.

162
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,840
- This is Tal.
- Hi.

163
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,960
- And behind them is Han.
- Hello.

164
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,720
Nice to meet you.

165
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,680
And Peace.

166
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Peace.

167
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,920
Let's swim, everyone!

168
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,880
- Let's go!
- Yeah, yeah.

169
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,720
- Let's swim.
- Yeah.

170
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,120
- P'Day and P'Itt's friend!
- Exactly.

171
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,400
- Our new customer, yeah!
- Our new customer, yeah!

172
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,360
Augh!

173
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,880
I'm sorry.

174
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,440
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to.

175
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,400
First-aid!

176
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,040
- Everything's fine. They're performing first aid.
- Everything's fine. They're not kissing.

177
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,640
Let's swim!

178
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,240
They're just performing first aid.

179
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,480
Let's go.

180
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,720
- Day, I'll return these myself.
- No.

181
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,040
- I'll do it.
- Day!

182
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,240
Don't worry.

183
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,960
Don't you know how calm I am?

184
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,960
These are yours.

185
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,280
Take them back.

186
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,200
Tonight, Itt has someone to sleep with.

187
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,760
What are you two?

188
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,640
A couple.

189
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,480
If I hadn't known that you two were a couple,

190
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,400
I would've probably pressed forward.

191
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,680
Now that it's clear,

192
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,240
I'll accept it.

193
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,600
Good.

194
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,200
Oh.

195
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,240
One more thing.

196
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,240
The bathroom isn't soundproof.

197
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,440
Have some decency.

198
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,240
It's just a sound.

199
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,880
I don't care who's eavesdropping.

200
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,600
I don't mind that.

201
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,400
P'Day! I'm so sorry for giving P'Itt a cut.

202
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,600
Let me feed you.

203
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,400
Aw!

204
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,160
Why do you have to be harsh?

205
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,320
P'Day and P'Itt seem really close.

206
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,280
Yeah,

207
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,520
we are.

208
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,920
So, how long have you known each other?

209
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,520
Well, longer than I can remember.

210
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,080
Does that mean you know whom P'Itt is dating?

211
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,240
Yeah, I do.

212
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,120
Ouch!

213
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,040
Is that person cute?

214
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,760
Do you think I am cute?

215
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,720
- I knew it!
- I knew it!

216
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,080
Whenever you two are together,

217
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,520
I can smell love in the air!

218
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,440
Yeah!

219
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,080
So jealous!

220
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,760
Everyone's dating someone except us.

221
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,400
So sad.

222
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,200
Boys, is the beverage ready?

223
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,800
- Come get some.
- Let's get a drink.

224
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,800
Please excuse us.

225
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,200
Itt.

226
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,280
Hm?

227
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,080
Do you know who took a shower next to the bathroom you were in this evening?

228
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,880
Who? You?

229
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,720
Peace.

230
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,320
What? This is going to be awkward.

231
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,200
It won't be.

232
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,400
You don't have to worry about him.

233
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,680
You brought me into this.

234
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,680
It's embarrassing

235
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,840
And now they're going to talk about it.

236
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,400
Why do you have to be ashamed?

237
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,080
You don't need to care

238
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,200
what others say or think.

239
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,880
All you need to care about right now

240
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,920
is how I remember you.

241
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
How much of me can you remember?

242
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,560
I told you. I need it today and now!

243
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,000
- You need to get me a cake!
- Itt!

244
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,840
Can you not?

245
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,320
I'm a fuss to you? Why do you make me look like I'm in the wrong?

246
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,560
Are you mad fighting me over a cake?

247
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,440
You think this is just about cake?

248
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,440
The problem is you not keeping your promise.

249
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,600
I guess that's me in your memory.

250
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,960
Like what?

251
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,920
Like...

252
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,760
Childish, spoiled, and believing that you'll never leave me.

253
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,880
Hey! Day.

254
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,600
Day.

255
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,080
This tent is even less soundproof than the bathroom!

256
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,680
Day.

257
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,760
If you keep quiet, nobody can hear us.

258
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,880
Aw! Day.

259
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,640
Day.

260
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,480
It's embarrassing.

261
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,720
Day.

262
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,520
Augh!

263
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,000
Day.

264
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,880
Day, what's wrong?

265
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,240
Day.

266
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,840
Day.

267
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,160
Hey!

268
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,760
Why do you keep biting? Are you a dog?

269
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,440
Get up. You're heavy.

270
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm not!

271
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,920
In this tent,

272
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,760
you've laid on my lap like you just did, right?

273
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,360
I hugged you like I just did too?

274
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,760
Right?

275
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,440
Day? You can remember now?

276
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,160
Just a bit.

277
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,880
I had this faint memory of how I was so happy.

278
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,400
Day.

279
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,760
Can you help me recall this memory?

280
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,920
Let's see if it's actually as good as I can remember it.

281
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,800
Of course.

282
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,880
Slow down.

283
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,440
Hey, what's this dish?

284
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,760
It looks like stir-fried bamboo shoots, but it's not.

285
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,560
Hm! This is good.

286
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,880
- Is it good?
- Hm!

287
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,120
The lady chef told me it is awesome.

288
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,760
It's a spicy rice called...

289
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,760
Je... Je... Je...

290
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,760
- Jenko.
- Yes, P'Day! Jenko.

291
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,840
Jenko spicy rice, a local Karen dish.

292
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,080
The lady said this is good.

293
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,680
Is it weird that I can remember?

294
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,960
I'm from Kanchanaburi.

295
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,800
I was born here.

296
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,040
Telling you just in case you forgot.

297
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:42,440
Does P'Day actually own a famous barbershop here in Kanchanaburi?

298
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,200
Yeah, he gave me this cut.

299
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,240
Looks good, right?

300
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,520
Aw.

301
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,560
If we pay a visit, would P'Day cut our hair himself?

302
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,200
No.

303
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,880
He only cut VIP clients' hair.

304
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,480
Hm.

305
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,760
Does that mean P'Itt is a VIP?

306
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,760
Hm!

307
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:20,560
But P'Day doesn't look like someone who owns a barbershop.

308
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:26,160
Yeah, he looks more like someone who works with racecars. Exactly.

309
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,640
I can see that.

310
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,320
Talking about cars, that's P'Itt's expertise.

311
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,800
- His family owns a car repair shop.
- Really?

312
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,880
Day works there too.

313
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,680
If anyone would like a new set of car stereos,

314
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,480
pay a visit to Pradubyon Charoen.

315
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:50,000
Tell the staff you're my friend, and we'll discount you.

316
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,760
- Wow!
- Thank you.

317
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,480
That's great. And once you've got your new stereo set

318
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,600
and you want to hit the track, tell me.

319
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,960
- Of course?
- You meant your track?

320
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,560
No, no.

321
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,840
Day is a partner of it with another friend, Nan.

322
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,800
P'Day, do you race sometimes?

323
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,840
You're going to drive fast again, right?

324
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,520
Day.

325
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,200
Yeah,

326
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,640
I'm not.

327
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,000
And don't you turn off your phone on me again.

328
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,120
You make me worried.

329
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,720
Gear told me to!

330
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,080
Itt!

331
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,360
You're going to make me get drowned again.

332
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,000
What would you do if my Night became a widow?

333
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,960
Aw.

334
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,560
I'll find him a new boyfriend.

335
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,000
A top-grade one.

336
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,720
No, P'Itt.

337
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,920
- Aw.
- They love each other.

338
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Hm!

339
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,400
They're teasing each other.

340
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,680
- (Laughing)
- They're cuddling.

341
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,880
(Laughing)

342
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,440
(Chuckling)

343
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,480
Isn't that enough?

344
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,960
Everyone! Let's eat.

345
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,600
- Give me youtiao.
- Let's have some Jenko.

346
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,200
Let's share.

347
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,800
Have you got a spoon?

348
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,520
- We do.
- Go nuts.

349
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,000
- Sure thing.
- We'll eat it all.

350
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,080
- Are you going into the water?
- Yeah, let's go.

351
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,160
- Be careful.
- Whoa, whoa. Careful.

352
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,600
Day, my leg cramps!

353
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,360
Cramp?

354
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,600
Yeah.

355
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,800
Aw! Argh!

356
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,200
Gently.

357
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,360
Ah!

358
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,280
Aw.

359
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,240
A cramp like this isn't too serious.

360
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:26,520
I am happy that we both have and care for each other.

361
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,400
Right there.

362
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,320
Getting better?

363
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,200
That's enough.

364
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,480
I'm getting better. Can I go swimming?

365
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,440
- No way.
- What?

366
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,880
Your leg was just cramped, and your face is all pale.

367
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,800
Come on, Day.

368
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,320
I want to.

369
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,320
I don't come here too often. Day? Please?

370
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,200
Please.

371
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,800
Find. Whatever.

372
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,400
You're the cutest!

373
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,400
But you will come when I call you.

374
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,320
I know.

375
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,800
See you in a bit.

376
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,800
- If you don't, I'll drag you out of the water myself.
- What?

377
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,280
I'll drag you out of the water myself.

378
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,360
You are the cutest.

379
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,800
Did you get better?

380
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,280
Be careful!

381
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,560
Gear.

382
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,120
Hello?

383
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,920
Hello?

384
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,520
Ahem.

385
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,200
If you're not going to say anything, hang up.

386
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,480
It's annoying.

387
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,760
(Chuckling)

388
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,280
The last time I checked, I called Itt.

389
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,160
Why did you pick up the call?

390
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,560
Jerk.

391
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,680
How did you know me?

392
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,080
(Laughing)

393
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,640
(Laughing)

394
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,680
You can't really remember me, huh?

395
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,760
Day.

396
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,560
Say what you want to say. Stop stalling.

397
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,520
You are annoying.

398
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,880
Day!

399
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,880
I'm coming for you two!

400
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,720
I will do it.

401
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,440
(Laughing)

402
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,520
(Laughing)

403
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,560
(Laughing)

404
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,000
Hey!

405
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,120
Let's have lunch over there.

406
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,440
What's up? Day.

407
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,400
The strange call that doesn't talk.

408
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,680
Is it this number?

409
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,600
Yeah, this number.

410
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,240
I talked to him.

411
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,800
What about it?

412
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,240
He said he's coming for me

413
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,960
and he'll do something.

414
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,160
He also asked me

415
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,960
if I can remember him.

416
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,280
Then...

417
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,200
That means he knows us.

418
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,160
So,

419
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,960
what does his voice sound like?

420
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,320
I had it recorded. Listen.

421
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,400
You can't really remember me, huh? Day.

422
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,040
That's Pee's voice. It's definitely him.

423
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,400
Day, what's wrong?

424
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,480
Day, are you alright?

425
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,120
Day?

426
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,440
Day?

427
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,080
How come you get a headache like this?

428
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,840
Day.

429
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,840
Is he alright?

430
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,800
Hey! Jerk!

431
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,960
Day! No!

432
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,960
Pee! No!

433
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,920
Die!

434
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,400
Uncle Supot,

435
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,200
Day is confident that he saw Pee at the waterfall.

436
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,120
I'm afraid he's back for revenge.

437
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,280
Please protect my brother

438
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,920
and deal with those insects for me.

439
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,200
Ugh!

440
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,440
I'm not sure if you're too brave or too stupid

441
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,200
to come to me.

442
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,840
Nan, you put him against a professional racer.

443
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,360
Why do you still need to sabotage his car?

444
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,480
What?
