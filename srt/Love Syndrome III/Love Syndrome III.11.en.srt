1
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,452
Uncle Supot,

2
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,246
Day is confident that he saw Pee at the waterfall.

3
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,165
I'm afraid he's back for revenge.

4
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,376
Ugh!

5
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,629
I'll skin his dog skin myself.

6
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,759
What you're doing is called being a pervert.

7
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,345
I have lots of fun plans for you two.

8
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,348
Just thinking about it makes me so happy.

9
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,231
Didn't you see where you were going?

10
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,025
Didn't you see me coming out?

11
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,568
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,320
I hit your car?

13
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,158
Itt! Itt Wake up!

14
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,666
Yes.

15
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,920
Yes, I see.

16
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,964
Okay. Thank you.

17
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:38,473
I talked to Dr. Kong from psychiatry.

18
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,849
What about it?

19
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,769
The condition you have

20
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,105
is called a panic attack.

21
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,315
Without proper treatment,

22
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,442
It could be fatal.

23
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,986
Don't do this again, Day.

24
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,617
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,954
How long have you been experiencing this?

26
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,249
I remember you were a biker?

27
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,795
Well,

28
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,881
after Day got into the hospital,

29
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,384
I feel uneasy riding a fast vehicle.

30
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,555
It must've been traumatic.

31
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,690
Yes.

32
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,942
It's alright.

33
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:35,238
The doctor has prescribed you antipanic medication.

34
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,240
Nurse,

35
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,285
please follow up on N'Itt's medication.

36
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,703
Sure.

37
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,873
All in all,

38
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:48,209
you need to undergo continuous treatment,

39
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,587
take your medicine regularly,

40
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,381
and attend mental therapy.

41
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,967
Do not stop taking drugs on your own.

42
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,886
Yes, uncle.

43
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:06,102
Mental support is just as important too.

44
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,160
Wow!

45
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,415
You act like you've never had a cake.

46
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,794
I always act this way.

47
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,757
Thank you for treating me to this.

48
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,847
That's just my way of saying sorry

49
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,725
for almost driving you fatally shocked.

50
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,519
Don't be too happy.

51
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,859
P'Day and N'Itt, I miss you!

52
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,033
How are you? P'Day.

53
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,827
I'm sorry I didn't visit you.

54
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,663
I was so occupied at the bakery.

55
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,831
It's alright.

56
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,210
My body has recovered.

57
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,672
Uh, and...

58
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,675
I still can't remember much.

59
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,264
How about you have a seat?

60
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,099
Your favorite table is free.

61
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,976
Day.

62
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,814
Guess which table is our favorite.

63
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,360
P'Nam, don't tell him.

64
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,314
Day, please.

65
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:18,318
Choo, choo. Here's the train!

66
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,737
Choo, choo.

67
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,580
Yeah!

68
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,916
I'm so glad you remember!

69
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,420
I didn't. I just sensed it.

70
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,008
But your sense was right.

71
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,013
Do not cry.

72
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,234
P'Nam, can I please have each of your cakes?

73
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,694
Of course.

74
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,450
If you can't finish all that, you'll get what's coming!

75
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,370
What if I can?

76
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,288
What am I getting?

77
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,849
Om nom nom.

78
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,684
Om nom nom nom.

79
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,812
Om nom.

80
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,189
What are you having?

81
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,691
Can I join?

82
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,904
P.

83
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,073
Why are you here?

84
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,409
Why so rude?

85
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,619
I'm a customer too.

86
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,373
Itt.

87
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,333
Go help P'Nam.

88
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,340
I'm not going to hurt him.

89
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,718
This is P'Nam's café.

90
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,772
P.

91
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,443
If you do anything to him,

92
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,113
you'll eat my fist and not cake.

93
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,332
Sit down.

94
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,962
Hah!

95
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,027
Are you not going to ask me...

96
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,446
why I'm here?

97
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,908
You told me yourself

98
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,495
that it wouldn't be fun if you told me.

99
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,040
Yeah.

100
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,834
That's true.
I said that.

101
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,631
I just want to know if you two

102
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,966
are happy.

103
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,177
What do you think?

104
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,602
I want you two to suffer more than I did.

105
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,646
What suffering are you talking about?

106
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,691
Weren't you the one who shot us?

107
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:49,529
You made my dad exile me out of the country.

108
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,281
Rich kid.

109
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,534
Committing a crime

110
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,661
and escaping abroad.

111
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,705
In fact,

112
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,083
you should be in jail.

113
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,960
I guess you don't know...

114
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,381
What I had to lose.

115
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,343
Now, I have changed.

116
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,179
I...

117
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,640
will never be the same.

118
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,478
Never!

119
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,442
P.

120
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,612
You should stop blaming others

121
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:36,200
and realize that everything that happened

122
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,494
because of you.

123
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,748
Don't act like a child.

124
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,419
P.

125
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,963
Eat your food and get lost.

126
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,929
I just want to set the mood.

127
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,725
I miss you.

128
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,352
How about a cup of coffee together?

129
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,777
Then tell me.

130
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,904
Why did you call me?

131
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,490
I wanted to hear your voice.

132
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,743
I miss you. That's why I called.

133
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,038
How about calling your dad?

134
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,873
He probably misses you.

135
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,754
Is he siding with you two again?

136
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,216
Who's going to side with a terrible kid like you?

137
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,384
Huh?

138
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,889
You want to set the mood before having a cake?

139
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,393
Would you like to take a walk with me?

140
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,713
Actually, I'd like to hear your stupid idea

141
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,758
so I can teach you how normal people think.

142
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,636
But I'm too lazy for that.

143
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,142
Darn Day!

144
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,562
Why didn't you tell me this is what you want?

145
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:39,990
Not bad,

146
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,534
but I'm still fine.

147
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,369
Of course!

148
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,377
- Day!
- P!

149
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,837
Stop it!

150
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,256
What are you doing? Huh?

151
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,926
Ask him who started it!

152
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,762
What is this?

153
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,056
Stretching.

154
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,476
Where did you learn how to fight?

155
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,478
Why?

156
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,314
Stop going there.

157
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,275
You suck.

158
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,986
Stop!

159
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,114
I told you to not do anything to him

160
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,741
or I'm going to beat you up!

161
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,368
Screw you!

162
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,289
I'll make you two suffer!

163
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,085
- I'll come back!
- Itt!

164
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,926
You hated it when I got into a fight.

165
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,928
Why do you do this yourself?

166
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,264
What?

167
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,061
I forgot you can't remember.

168
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,441
What's next?

169
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,488
Leave it. I'll deal with this.

170
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,449
Stay out of this.

171
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,499
Itt!

172
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,090
Who were they?

173
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,136
You don't have to guess.

174
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,098
Good thing they weren't sent to shoot us.

175
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,108
What do we do? Day?

176
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,402
They're really coming.

177
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:21,527
[An event three years earlier.]

178
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,503
Whose car is that?

179
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,966
Darn it.

180
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,261
What are you doing?
Get out of the car!

181
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,351
Didn't you see where you were going?

182
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,521
- Didn't you see me coming out?
- Please calm down.

183
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,273
I'm so sorry.

184
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:04,028
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll deal with everything.

185
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,988
I'm not going anywhere.

186
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,954
- Please go in.
- Thank you.

187
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,004
Nice room.

188
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,130
Yeah.

189
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,592
I'm still renting it out.

190
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,427
Hey,

191
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,179
do you live alone?

192
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,805
I normally live with my brother,

193
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,683
but he moved elsewhere.

194
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:39,521
Yeah, so it's just me for the time being.

195
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,401
Need a drink?

196
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,293
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

197
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,672
- Can I just open it?
- Yes.

198
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,166
Get off!

199
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,837
This is my revenge.

200
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,213
What revenge?

201
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,507
You hit my car!

202
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,303
Do you remember Night?

203
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,561
- That's my brother.
- Huh?

204
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,941
And do you remember your horrible friend, Gear,

205
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,404
and what he did to my brother?

206
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,282
That idea came from you.

207
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,911
- Get off of me!
- You will pay.

208
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,913
Argh!

209
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,374
No! Augh!

210
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,510
Screw you!

211
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,608
Take that!

212
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,296
I'm sorry.

213
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,423
I'm sorry.

214
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,219
I'm sorry.

215
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,472
I'm sorry.

216
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,767
Please don't hurt me.

217
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,520
You can be sorry in hell.

218
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,274
- I'm sorry.
- Shut up!

219
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,999
- I'm sorry.
- Shut up!

220
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,261
How about some beer?
You're thirsty?

221
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,806
Hey!

222
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,459
Argh!

223
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,270
Day.

224
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,190
You said it'll only take a few minutes,
but why did it take so long?

225
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:57,321
I cooked lots of dishes for you!

226
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,371
Alright, fine.

227
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,166
My mom did it, but I helped her.

228
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,252
- We've got lots of your favorites.
- We need to talk.

229
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,829
Whenever I ask you how we met,

230
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,416
you always act strange.

231
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,543
Is this it?

232
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,672
Is this what you've been hiding?

233
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,218
Why does this video still exist?

234
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,683
I should be the one to ask you.

235
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,434
What happened?

236
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,436
You,

237
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,980
Gear,

238
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,357
and my brother, Night.
What happened?

239
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,031
Night likes Gear.

240
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,868
Because I'm a horrible person,

241
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,416
I persuaded Gear to do that to Night

242
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,879
in exchange for...

243
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,215
a new stereo set.

244
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,343
Did you see my brother's feelings as a joke?

245
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,595
You could think of it like that.

246
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,309
After that,

247
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,020
you took Night to England.

248
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,441
You changed him into a new person

249
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,193
who returned for revenge on Gear.

250
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,487
And you...

251
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,657
came back for revenge on me.

252
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,336
What is all this?

253
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,005
It is horrible.

254
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,007
Why would you want to hear this?

255
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,968
If I were to lose my memory,

256
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,720
you wouldn't tell me this too.

257
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,849
How is it possible?

258
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,312
With such a horrible start,

259
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,647
how can we become lovers?

260
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,071
Before today,

261
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,740
it has been rough.

262
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,787
We've been through a lot.

263
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,288
But you...

264
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,999
You forgot everything.

265
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,837
You need to remember everything to understand all this.

266
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,684
I don't think I want to now.

267
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,530
Day.

268
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,411
Don't follow me.

269
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,913
I'll go alone.

270
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,959
Day.

271
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,585
Day!

272
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:56,977
Hey!

273
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,397
Day!

274
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,691
What is this driving?

275
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,320
P'Day!

276
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,406
- Why?
- What is this?

277
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,993
- Get off of me!
- P'Day!

278
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,953
What is wrong with you?

279
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,293
Gear?

280
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,188
You learned about that story.

281
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,733
That's the only thing

282
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,735
that makes you want to kill me.

283
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,883
That video still exists?

284
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,012
Are you alright?

285
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,848
I'm fine,

286
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,141
but...

287
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,602
I had to return home.

288
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,355
Night can't even stop him.

289
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,357
He likely won't listen to me too.

290
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,234
He hates me again.

291
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,278
Gear.

292
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,406
He and I have been through so much.

293
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:37,536
It was a long and rough path.

294
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,539
I understand.

295
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,833
I just want to have a simple life with him,

296
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,253
but he lost all his memories.

297
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,630
He forgot everything we went through

298
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,882
after that video's incident.

299
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,469
Itt.

300
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,096
Calm down.

301
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,182
As soon as he remembers,

302
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,642
it will end.

303
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,104
He said he doesn't want to remember anymore.

304
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,940
He has to.

305
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,776
I'm not losing Night.

306
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,822
Do you want to lose Day?

307
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,490
No.

308
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,744
But I...

309
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,123
Hey, Itt.

310
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,667
Take a break if you're tired.

311
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,920
You don't need to be strong all the time.

312
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,424
I care about you.

313
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,301
Okay.

314
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,720
Take care.

315
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,090
This is the punishment for your defeat.

316
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,891
Nan!

317
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,392
Whoa!

318
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,437
What's up? Itt.

319
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,522
Are you going to faint at my track again?

320
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,274
Hey!

321
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,487
Go get me food.

322
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,322
You can starve to death.

323
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,449
Move!

324
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,454
And...

325
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,706
where's Day?

326
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,917
I came alone.

327
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,796
Are you two good?

328
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,841
Do you still have that video of Mac?

329
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,345
Why?

330
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,267
If you don't want it to come back and haunt you two,

331
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,269
get rid of it.

332
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,065
What happened?

333
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,362
Tell me.

334
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,406
Nothing.

335
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,951
I just don't want you two to have any trouble.

336
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,376
We're fighting.

337
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,922
We're separated now.

338
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,051
He said he wanted to be alone.

339
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,430
Day? Want to be alone?

340
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:48,727
- Hey! Nan.
- Just go home.

341
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,313
Nan, trust me.

342
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,732
Delete that video.

343
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,359
How can I?

344
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,529
It doesn't even exist.

345
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,531
Huh?

346
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,908
Yeah, I fooled him.

347
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,702
Hm.

348
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:09,122
Do you feel better now?
Let's go home.

349
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:13,042
Does Mac know this?

350
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,961
Come on.

351
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,755
I'll find time to tell him.

352
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,257
- When?
- Itt?

353
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,301
- I will.
- When?

354
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,803
You leave for now.
I'll tell him soon.

355
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,264
Just head home.
Go.

356
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,641
- When are you going to tell him?
- I will soon.

357
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,477
- Don't forget that.
- Yeah.

358
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,312
If you don't tell him...

359
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,893
You're late.

360
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,479
Why are you here?

361
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,149
I wanted to talk to you at the racetrack,

362
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,902
but there were some annoying people in the way.

363
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,446
So, I drove to meet you here,

364
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,283
but I didn't plan that you'd drive that slowly.

365
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,373
Are you insane?

366
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,084
Cut to the chase.

367
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,169
What do you want?

368
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,256
Tomorrow, I will settle everything with Day.

369
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,056
Don't be fooled twice.

370
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:54,769
If someone says I'm in danger, do not believe them.

371
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:59,274
If something bad happens, escape to the safest location.

372
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,192
Do not solo anything.

373
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,362
All these just to lecture me?

374
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,780
Am I supposed to be delighted?

375
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,865
Itt.

376
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,368
If you really are in danger,

377
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,203
I can't leave you.

378
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,330
Care about yourself before caring about me.

379
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,332
This is our mutual agreement.

380
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,751
Day, I won't accept this.

381
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,379
Do not wait for me. Do not waste any time.

382
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,383
You need to escape to where there are lots of people.

383
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,719
If you see his car, drive faster.

384
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,354
Don't try that.

385
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,023
That won't work.

386
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,775
I'm not that stupid to use the same trick.

387
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,654
If I want to kidnap you, I could do that right now.

388
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,948
So?

389
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:52,076
I just informed you so maybe you'd come.

390
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,538
Going or not, what does that have to do with you?

391
00:31:56,664 --> 00:32:00,543
I just want you to see him under my feet.

392
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,253
See him pray for life.

393
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,131
See him all defeated.

394
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,973
Are you a kid?

395
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,101
Seriously.

396
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,854
Are you happy?

397
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,108
Does this resentment make you happy?

398
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,154
All you think about is winning or losing.

399
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,782
Are you happy?

400
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,285
You love to lecture just like Day does.

401
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,245
(That's my business.)

402
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,248
You don't have to come.

403
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,336
I'll record a video for you.

404
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,928
Screw you!

405
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,262
What is wrong with you?

406
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,556
Do you want to die that badly?

407
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,692
Darn it!

408
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,683
Boss, boss.

409
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,355
Boss, boss!

410
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,316
What?

411
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,984
Are you with us?

412
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,489
(Laughing)

413
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,742
With a face like that, you're not with us.

414
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,703
- How about a drink?
- A drink!

415
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,206
What? Are you looking for free drinks?

416
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,502
What kind of person do you think I am?

417
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,545
Freeloader.

418
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,341
You can just disrespect me outright if that's what you think.

419
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:56,385
- You said it yourself, freeloader!
- Oh!

420
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,596
So harsh.

421
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,641
Sure, I'd like to drink.

422
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,102
- Yeah!
- Yes!

423
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,062
Let's go!

424
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,107
What do you mean?

425
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,942
The bars haven't opened yet!

426
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,819
Bast!

427
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,695
Let's get to work first. Go!

428
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,781
Both of you. Follow me.

429
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,553
Honey.

430
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,473
Don't let Itt go anywhere today.

431
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,519
Is everything alright?

432
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,857
I'll tell you later.

433
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,318
No matter what. Keep him at home.

434
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,613
I'll be running some errands.

435
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,740
I'll be back late.

436
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,583
Bast, check everything here.

437
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:13,087
Those down there too.

438
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,214
- Yes.
- Did you see that?

439
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:19,093
- The old man left!
- What?

440
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,012
Where is Dad going?

441
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:24,015
Why do you care?

442
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:28,060
- Let's get some drinks!
- Let's get a drink, Boss!

443
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,687
What did you say?

444
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,106
(Chuckling)

445
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,067
We saw that your son is a bit stressed out

446
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:39,071
so we're taking him out to decompress.

447
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,073
Right.

448
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,951
I allow you to leave early today.

449
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:47,580
- Yeah!
- Awesome!

450
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,499
- But Itt, you're not going anywhere.
- What?

451
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,376
Why?

452
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,963
Dad asked that you don't leave home today.

453
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:07,558
- Cheers!
- Yeah.

454
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,478
Drink some!

455
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,649
Boss, can we have a fun song?

456
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,816
Just one.

457
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,152
He plays. You dance.

458
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,035
Cheers!

459
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,039
I'm having so much fun!

460
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,292
Let's have a toast!

461
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,337
- Cheers!
- This is awesome.

462
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,130
- Woo!
- Hey!

463
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,049
Be quiet!

464
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,311
I'm meeting Day at 8 PM tonight.

465
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,522
And?

466
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:01,279
Your tone tells me you don't believe me.

467
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,407
Once he arrived,

468
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,118
I'll call you so you can hear.

469
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,703
Wait,

470
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,831
or should I video call you?

471
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,833
(Laughing)

472
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,836
It'll be late by the time he arrives.

473
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:20,840
I am more than free today!

474
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,011
I'll send you the location

475
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,513
just in case you want to see it for yourself.

476
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,182
You're not fooling me, P.

477
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,635
I'm so drunk!

478
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,931
I am not drunk!

479
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,112
Thep!

480
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,156
Thep?

481
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,449
The...

482
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,619
Who are you, lady?
Why are you here?

483
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,537
Thep!

484
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,082
Where is Itt?

485
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,959
K'Itt?

486
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:42,296
He is gone!
(Laughing)

487
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,716
Gone? To where?

488
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,302
No idea.
(Laughing)

489
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,179
What?

490
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,015
Thank you so much!

491
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:14,995
Take this.

492
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,247
Boss,

493
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,957
do you want me to hit him?

494
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,709
Stay out. Stay here.
Be the lookout.

495
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,550
Boss, I just sent you the video.

496
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,053
Day! What did you do to my dad?

497
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,310
Darn you, P!

498
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,315
You'll be alright.

499
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,650
You'll be safe.

500
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:45,860
Stay with us.

501
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:46,902
Itt.

502
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,155
Don't worry. He is safe.

503
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,698
P'Day!

504
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,200
Night, who is that?
