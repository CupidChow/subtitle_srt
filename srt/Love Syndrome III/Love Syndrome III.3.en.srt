1
00:00:28,626 --> 00:00:29,959
The patient has the massive bleeding.

2
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:33,083
Because he got body impact injury.

3
00:00:33,584 --> 00:00:36,709
According to health check, Day has a Retrograde Amnesia syndrome.

4
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:37,542
Get out!

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,209
It is a retrograde memory loss.

6
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:41,375
Who are you?

7
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:42,334
Day!

8
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,167
Are you kidding me?

9
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:47,375
Kamol.

10
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,250
Hey!

11
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:05,626
Your gut instinct is still fast ever.

12
00:01:06,918 --> 00:01:07,834
Kamol.

13
00:01:08,876 --> 00:01:09,667
Still remember me?

14
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:11,459
Of course.

15
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:13,626
How could I forget you?

16
00:01:16,918 --> 00:01:17,751
Here is a gift

17
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:19,417
For you. A patient!

18
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,250
Did I drive and hit him?

19
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:31,501
He drove a car cut in front yours,
and then he hit the tree.

20
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,083
He has been at ICU for 5 days now.

21
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:35,501
Same situation as you.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,792
Got broken arm and legs.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,250
I don't know when he will wake up.
His Amnesia is the same level as you.

24
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:45,626
But you ever said that after the revenge, what's next?

25
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:47,209
Hey!!!

26
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:47,751
Ouch!!!

27
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:49,792
Remember me, don't you?

28
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:52,250
You drove and hit my parent death.

29
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:55,083
What do you want?

30
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:56,417
I will ask my Dad to pay for it!

31
00:01:57,292 --> 00:01:57,876
Oh!!!

32
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh!!!

33
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,709
Here... for my younger brother!!

34
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:04,709
Who has no chance to see my parents anymore.

35
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,167
Let me go!!! Please.

36
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,042
I can't stand anymore.

37
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,292
Darn!!!

38
00:02:10,584 --> 00:02:11,083
Ah!!!

39
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:14,834
You kill him!

40
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:16,167
What's next?

41
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:17,209
You do it!!

42
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:18,834
You win!!

43
00:02:19,584 --> 00:02:20,667
That's it!!

44
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:24,125
Even the revenge is equal?

45
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,083
It won't be accepted by the law.

46
00:02:35,584 --> 00:02:36,501
If you got power,

47
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:40,209
you can tell it's right

48
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:42,584
or wrong!

49
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,083
I am Kamol.

50
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:16,626
Khun Kamol,

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,459
we have been doing business for long.

52
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:19,959
You are not trusting me, are you?

53
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:22,334
Does it need to check?

54
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:23,834
For your satisfaction.

55
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:27,417
Dirty money can be cleaned,

56
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,292
but fake money can't be made real.

57
00:03:35,918 --> 00:03:36,959
Boss!!! It's fake money!

58
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:37,709
Man!!

59
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:40,459
Oh!!!

60
00:03:43,918 --> 00:03:45,083
Darn it... You shot me?

61
00:03:49,334 --> 00:03:50,334
You shot my boss!

62
00:03:50,584 --> 00:03:51,083
Ah!!!

63
00:03:51,626 --> 00:03:52,626
Should be shot to death!

64
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:53,918
Ah!!!

65
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,167
Boss did say... Killing him... What's next?

66
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:02,000
Killing can not solve the problem.

67
00:04:02,626 --> 00:04:03,834
But it makes a trouble.

68
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:09,125
Ah!!!

69
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:15,542
Keep in mind... Rich Man.

70
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:17,000
Ah!!!

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,375
My henchman saves your life.

72
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:22,375
So you have to choose how to end the problem yourself.

73
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,292
If you could not end this,

74
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:25,959
even there's still trouble,

75
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,459
or your henchman around you will revenge later,

76
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:31,959
just do it.

77
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:45,751
Ah!!!

78
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,584
Will you release me now?

79
00:04:59,167 --> 00:04:59,959
Kim!!!

80
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:04,501
Kamol, see! How does he look at me?

81
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:08,250
He really has amnesia.

82
00:05:12,501 --> 00:05:14,000
It seems that you don't remember

83
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:17,792
how the problem ended between you and me.

84
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:25,292
Want to do it now?

85
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:29,501
I can only stay at 7 pm.

86
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,417
I have to go back to pick up Night.

87
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,083
You think I ask you to come here

88
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:37,959
just for doing something like that?

89
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:42,959
So we come here for what?

90
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,334
In between us,

91
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:47,042
there are many things happened here over and over again.

92
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:51,542
Oh, where is the watch that I gave you?

93
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,334
I meet you many times but never see you wear it.

94
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,209
Anyway, you know it!

95
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:05,250
I sold it.

96
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,542
You sold it to pay for Night's tuition?

97
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,709
That amount you can tell me.

98
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,042
I can do money transfer for you.

99
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:14,292
Why Day???

100
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:17,042
Why do you do that to sell the important thing that I gave to you?

101
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:18,667
You gave me,

102
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:20,751
so it belongs to me.

103
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:22,000
Yes!!!

104
00:06:22,751 --> 00:06:23,709
I gave to you.

105
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:26,209
You can sell any things

106
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:27,626
but not this watch.

107
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:29,542
Do you know what?

108
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:34,042
Because this is our 3-month-anniversary present.

109
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:39,125
Kim.

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,667
We are not boyfriends.

111
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:53,834
Day.

112
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:55,667
Can I ask you?

113
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,375
Since we have met and known each other till now,

114
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,918
have you ever loved me?

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,125
The only one who I love,

116
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:10,250
is Night,

117
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:12,501
my younger brother.

118
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,959
I don't think you will come here.

119
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:34,125
I don't think I will come either,

120
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,709
if my boyfriend didn't tell me to come.

121
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:42,667
Boyfriend?

122
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,375
You dare to call somebody else your boyfriend?

123
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,417
A person who is not me!

124
00:07:51,876 --> 00:07:52,709
Darn!!!

125
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:10,209
I am really sorry. Kim.

126
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,000
Sorry for that you can't love me, don't you?

127
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,375
Sorry for selling your watch

128
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:18,125
to pay for Night's tuition.

129
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:23,083
And so sorry that I never thought of you as a boyfriend.

130
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:26,959
Well,

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,417
what I just wait to hear is that.

132
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:33,125
And I want to tell you that!

133
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:35,667
I was really really angry with you at that time.

134
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,083
As I grew older,

135
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,667
it made me realize that,

136
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:41,918
as for somebody who you don't love,

137
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:45,167
no matter what they do, you could not love them.

138
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:50,292
You are my best friend for me.

139
00:08:58,209 --> 00:08:59,709
I hope that someday

140
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,375
I will be your best friend too.

141
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,542
Hey. What's up? Feel better?

142
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:25,626
Yes, getting better.

143
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:27,375
I told you,

144
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,626
as you have me as a boyfriend, it is good.

145
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:31,083
Ok, let's go out.

146
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:02,709
How are you today?

147
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:05,626
Refilled for second time, sir!

148
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:41,417
You probably don't remember.

149
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:44,584
Kim is my beloved.

150
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:49,459
Well, look at your face that can tell.

151
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:51,125
Ahh.

152
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:54,959
I've never seen his face look like that.

153
00:10:58,042 --> 00:10:59,250
So, Boss! You know

154
00:10:59,751 --> 00:11:01,375
Me and Kim used to be...

155
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:03,751
When you were with Kim,

156
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,167
have you worked with me yet?

157
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:07,584
Yes, I have.

158
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,959
So, why didn't you bring Kim to me?

159
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:15,626
I had wasted my time with somebody
who are not the right guy.

160
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,959
It took long to meet the right one, Kim.

161
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:22,584
Boss.

162
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,834
I used to tell you before.

163
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:27,501
You don't remember.

164
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:29,959
You probably don't remember.

165
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:35,167
And I used to run away from Kamol
to stay with you and Itt too.

166
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:39,042
Because of Itt,

167
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:45,751
I met Kim, and it made me and Kim understand each other.

168
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,334
Itt, again.

169
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,501
Hmm!!!

170
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:54,292
Itt's always fussy.

171
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,042
But because of this,

172
00:11:58,292 --> 00:11:59,959
you fell in love with him, didn't you?

173
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:04,792
Baby,

174
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:07,959
please call Itt to come back.

175
00:12:09,334 --> 00:12:11,417
I think, I almost finish.

176
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:15,501
Don't call me like that in front of him.

177
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:24,709
You act like Itt is a stranger in your memory.

178
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,292
Therefore, Itt can verify that

179
00:12:28,876 --> 00:12:31,876
what is the relationship between you and him.

180
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:36,584
Because you were really self-confident.

181
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:39,042
But now

182
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:42,626
even yourself's memory

183
00:12:43,334 --> 00:12:44,375
can't be trusted.

184
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:49,083
You are trying to use your gut survival instinct

185
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:51,375
to protect yourself.

186
00:12:52,626 --> 00:12:54,709
Boss, I don't know, which is true or not true?

187
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,542
Do you think...Will he remember me?

188
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:13,876
I don't know.

189
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:17,334
Hmm...

190
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:21,042
How are you?

191
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,834
Neil, when I warn you about racing,

192
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,250
you just listen to me.

193
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:29,334
If an accident happened like Day recently,

194
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:31,292
and you lose memory,

195
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:33,083
I'll definitely find a new boyfriend.

196
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,959
- Little Guy.
- Stop! Stop!

197
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,250
As I do remember,

198
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,959
you like a well-behaved
like my younger brother, don't you?

199
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,292
So why did you end up with him?

200
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,167
So different as the sky to the ground.

201
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:47,042
If I did not see you are sick, hmm...

202
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:48,167
What?

203
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:49,626
- I am also a well-behaved like folded cloths...
- Hey take it easy.

204
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:53,083
Yes, I flirted with him.

205
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,751
I flirted with him when he was weak.

206
00:13:56,626 --> 00:14:00,125
He was heart-broken for Night's falling
in love with Gear, my friend.

207
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:02,417
He was overwhelmed by my kindness.

208
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:04,209
He loves the foods I cook,

209
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,626
and he loves that I am good.

210
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,417
I'm talking to my friend.

211
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:11,501
Cause you talked back to me.

212
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:13,834
(Sigh)

213
00:14:14,918 --> 00:14:15,501
Neil.

214
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:16,876
What's up?

215
00:14:17,876 --> 00:14:20,167
Why I let Night and Gear be together?

216
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:22,918
Uh... ..Well...

217
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:26,292
Night and Gear love each other.

218
00:14:27,751 --> 00:14:29,334
At first... You interfered with them.

219
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:31,167
Until Night was dragged away.

220
00:14:32,751 --> 00:14:34,626
You and Gear went to help him.

221
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,709
Gear received a stab instead of you.

222
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:41,584
Because he didn't want Night sad
if his only brother died.

223
00:14:42,834 --> 00:14:43,709
You... Uh...

224
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:45,375
Understand that?

225
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:46,959
So

226
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:49,334
who dragged Night away?

227
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:52,125
You're... So curiously.

228
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,083
I think, why you can't remember...

229
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:57,042
I asked the doctor, you brain has been affected.

230
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:58,751
When you get to recover, then you will remember.

231
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,083
If you could remember by yourself
that would be good for you,

232
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:02,542
and then...

233
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:05,334
Good for everyone too.

234
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:07,542
Is it true?

235
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:09,959
Thus I and Itt

236
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,792
are boyfriends?

237
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:14,709
Uhh...

238
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,167
Right!

239
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,709
You are so obsessed with Itt.

240
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,542
And you let Neil go with me to travel together.

241
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:23,417
Then we got each other, another lover couple.

242
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:26,834
I was the one who approached Itt first, right?

243
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:28,250
Uh...

244
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,042
Yes.

245
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,334
You are really in love with Itt

246
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:35,167
See... What about Gear and Night...

247
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:36,584
Crazy love till...

248
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,375
Fall in love and could not step out

249
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:42,375
until you guys become boyfriends.

250
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,709
You are so curiously, are you Ek Q Sang?

251
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,334
You are so crazy in love with Itt
that you never let Itt go anywhere.

252
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:50,959
At that time, I asked to travel.

253
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,584
He said he had to go ask Daddy first,

254
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:55,375
ask for permission from Daddy.
Then I found out!

255
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,083
That man...is not Daddy.

256
00:15:57,292 --> 00:15:59,417
It's you!

257
00:16:06,751 --> 00:16:08,083
Knock! Knock! Knock!

258
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:10,042
Hello!

259
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:11,584
Opps!

260
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:15,709
I am not used to this sight.

261
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:16,876
When see it again,

262
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:19,292
so scaring.

263
00:16:19,501 --> 00:16:22,501
The atmosphere is just as scary as before.

264
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,375
OK.

265
00:16:28,584 --> 00:16:29,417
How much is it?

266
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:30,834
Transfer ok?

267
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:38,501
Ok, thank you so much. See you next time.

268
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,042
Did you fight with Itt last night?

269
00:16:46,626 --> 00:16:47,709
A little bit.

270
00:16:48,626 --> 00:16:49,542
But we are ok now.

271
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,167
I can handle it.

272
00:16:55,584 --> 00:16:56,501
Day.

273
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,751
You have changed a lot.

274
00:17:01,501 --> 00:17:02,626
How!!!

275
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:04,459
Since your father

276
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:06,375
and your mother

277
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,000
passed away,

278
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,959
I have never seen your smile again.

279
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,751
You show coldness to everyone

280
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:18,959
except brother Night!

281
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:22,751
Or even smile at a customer.

282
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,918
Day just smiled on business purpose,

283
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:29,959
not smile from sincere heart.

284
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:33,501
Am I like that?

285
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:34,459
Umm!

286
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:36,042
But now,

287
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:37,542
Day, you know?

288
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:40,250
Day, your smile is from sincere heart.

289
00:17:40,584 --> 00:17:43,125
Smile from deeply inside with happiness.

290
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,584
Less brutal.

291
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:48,501
Everything looks better and gets better.

292
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:49,751
I hope that

293
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,167
Day, you will not back as before.

294
00:17:55,292 --> 00:17:58,125
I don't want you to be brutal.

295
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:01,167
Your smile is really a smile.

296
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:04,292
Sincerely smile and happy to smile.

297
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:10,292
What did you say?

298
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,459
It is you! Present you! So good.

299
00:18:14,501 --> 00:18:15,792
You smile like

300
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:20,667
really smile, sincerely smile, happily smile from inside.

301
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:21,709
Ahh.

302
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:23,000
Look at the smile!

303
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:29,542
Gifts and stuff from our employees.

304
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:30,626
Umm.

305
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:34,417
They really want to visit you.

306
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:37,584
But I tell them that it's ok,
I will be a representative for them.

307
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:40,834
Don't want to distrub them
and nobody will stay at shop.

308
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:42,542
Yes, that's right!

309
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:44,125
I am ok, nothing much.

310
00:18:44,751 --> 00:18:45,501
Huuu.

311
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,751
How is nothing much?

312
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,459
Broken legs, broken arms, broken heads, like this,

313
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:52,626
it's still nothing?

314
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:54,250
Hmm.

315
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,000
Day, do you know?

316
00:18:56,501 --> 00:19:00,751
On that day, Itt knew you got a car accident.

317
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:02,584
He's worried, could not eat or sleep.

318
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:04,375
He came to see you right away

319
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:06,584
late at night.

320
00:19:06,584 --> 00:19:08,209
Itt got sick too.

321
00:19:08,209 --> 00:19:08,959
Look!

322
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:12,042
I feel so pity.

323
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,542
When I know that... Day

324
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:17,626
was admitted to ICU,

325
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:22,751
Itt passed out...

326
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:25,501
I felt so pity.

327
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:28,250
Got a body sick and heart sick.

328
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,626
I feel so sorry for both of you.

329
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:35,334
When I see this,

330
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:39,125
I thought about my home in Kanchanaburi.

331
00:19:39,584 --> 00:19:40,292
Umm.

332
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:43,792
Day really fell in love with Itt.

333
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:46,626
Always spoil whatever.

334
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:49,209
So lovely.

335
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,209
How is my dessert that I brought for you?

336
00:19:57,417 --> 00:19:58,459
How is it, good?

337
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:01,834
Yes, sis Bell. Thank you so much.

338
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:06,751
Yeah, I choose them as you like.

339
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:08,042
Just for you

340
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:13,125
So good.

341
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,959
Are you tired?

342
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:24,667
If so, please take a break and relax.

343
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:27,083
You can be weak sometime.

344
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,417
Sine Day was admitted at the hospital,

345
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,417
Itt has been always taking good care of him.

346
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:33,375
Itt, you've been extremely patient.

347
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:37,209
To take care who has broken legs and broken arms,

348
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:41,626
but he looks at you like a stranger.

349
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:43,250
It's hard to handle.

350
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,000
I understand.

351
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:49,125
Itt, you are the best.

352
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:54,250
Everything that you do, you did your best.

353
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:56,125
Itt, you've tried your best.

354
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:58,292
Itt, you've been very patient.

355
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,209
But if I've done well enough,

356
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:03,000
Day would remember.

357
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,417
If it is better than that,

358
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:10,417
Day won't be hurt like this.

359
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:13,751
No, no, no. You're good.

360
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:15,501
Don't blame yourself. OK?

361
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,375
Everything you did, you did the best.

362
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,125
Don't think like that.

363
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:28,918
Ahh.

364
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,876
Let's do this!

365
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,292
Next time go to Kanchanaburi.

366
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:39,417
I will take you to see a doctor.

367
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,584
Oh go to see neurosurgery doctor, right? P'Bell.

368
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:44,042
No...

369
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:46,042
A fortune teller.

370
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:49,209
Doctors, we keep them for medical treatment at the hospital.

371
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:52,334
But we should see another doctor, fortune teller.

372
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:53,501
This fortune teller,

373
00:21:53,751 --> 00:21:55,125
she just closes her eyes,

374
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:56,626
and she made a good prediction.

375
00:21:56,918 --> 00:22:00,584
I accepted it.

376
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:01,792
Trust me... Very good prediction!

377
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,501
If P'Bell says it's good,

378
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,667
I will try.

379
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:09,959
Umm... That's right.

380
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,250
Everyone said the same.

381
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:21,417
You and I used to fall in love.

382
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:25,542
I cherish you

383
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,083
and you're so crazy in love with me.

384
00:22:30,751 --> 00:22:32,459
Well, they've seen our love relation for long.

385
00:22:37,584 --> 00:22:39,542
Are you not hiring anyone to fool me?

386
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,125
You think... How much money I should have?

387
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:43,834
To hire anyone to fool you?

388
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,167
Huh!!! Day!

389
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:52,626
And what do you think about those photos on FB?

390
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:54,334
Did I edit them by myself, you think like that?

391
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,751
Are you crazy or you just lose your memory?

392
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,209
Don't raise your voice at me!

393
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:02,542
Am I a wizard?

394
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,751
To spell whatever.

395
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,626
If I have a power to spell,

396
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,375
I will spell that don't let any accident happen to you.

397
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:23,417
As long as I do remember,

398
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:29,042
love has not just happened,

399
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,083
and it never ever happened.

400
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:35,876
If finally

401
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:37,959
I can't remember anyway.

402
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:40,918
What do you think?

403
00:23:42,918 --> 00:23:44,250
Will it happen again?

404
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,125
I don't know.

405
00:23:53,918 --> 00:23:54,751
Have to wait further.

406
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:17,751
(Phone ring)

407
00:24:17,918 --> 00:24:18,959
Can't you talk here?

408
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,375
I don't want to disturb you.

409
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
Answer the phone.

410
00:24:29,918 --> 00:24:30,876
And turn on the speaker.

411
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:35,250
If he really a friend，

412
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,751
turn on the speaker now.

413
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,667
(Voice on the phone: Did I call to disturb you, Itt?)

414
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:46,209
No, it's okay, Ball.

415
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:48,626
(Voice on the phone: How is P'Day's condition?)

416
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:51,417
He is conscious now.

417
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:53,876
(Voice on th phone: Wow that's good!)

418
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:55,626
(Voice on th phone: How long has he been conscious?)

419
00:24:57,501 --> 00:24:58,459
For 2 days.

420
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,000
(Voice on the phone: How are you Itt?)

421
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,292
(Voice on the phone: Take good care of yourself.)

422
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:06,250
(Voice on the phone: Will see you.)

423
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:07,751
Thank you so much, Ball.

424
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:12,751
Who is he?

425
00:25:14,292 --> 00:25:15,000
His name is Ball.

426
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:16,876
I don't want to know his name.

427
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,792
I just want to know if he flirted with you!

428
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:36,751
Be careful, watch out for slippery.

429
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:39,626
Yes, Ball, I know.

430
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:40,792
Are you hungry, Itt?

431
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:42,417
I will buy something to eat for you.

432
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:44,667
Not yet.

433
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:47,626
Ball, can you stay, play in the water to keep my company?

434
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:48,417
Sure...

435
00:25:49,751 --> 00:25:50,751
I will swim with you.

436
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:51,709
Till you get bored.

437
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:52,751
Ok.

438
00:25:59,042 --> 00:25:59,626
Itt.

439
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:00,459
Huh...

440
00:26:00,876 --> 00:26:01,542
Your Dad is coming!

441
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:20,667
Day!

442
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:23,584
See that two ladies are slapping each other.

443
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:26,209
Who the win would get my phone number?

444
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,167
I will put a collar on you, next day...

445
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:33,042
To show that you belonged to someone.

446
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:34,000
Ouhh...

447
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:54,209
I just stood still, didn't I?

448
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:55,292
They approached me...

449
00:26:55,334 --> 00:27:02,375
(Phone rings)

450
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:04,000
Oops!

451
00:27:09,709 --> 00:27:10,542
Hello!

452
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,876
Hello Itt!

453
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:14,167
How are you, Itt?

454
00:27:14,626 --> 00:27:15,709
I'm fine! Ball.

455
00:27:16,918 --> 00:27:17,876
Ball, how are you?

456
00:27:18,292 --> 00:27:18,792
I'm good.

457
00:27:19,876 --> 00:27:21,626
I just flew back from Japan, last day.

458
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:24,375
I found some dessert looking so yummy,
then I'll bring for you.

459
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:26,626
Itt, are you free tomorrow?

460
00:27:26,792 --> 00:27:28,876
I will stop by to drop you some dessert.

461
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:30,334
I am not home.

462
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:32,292
Well, I am travelling to Kanchanaburi with Day.

463
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:33,042
Oh!!!

464
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:37,167
Ohhh feel pity...

465
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:38,167
No, that's ok!

466
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:41,042
I will bring it for you instead, next time.

467
00:27:41,918 --> 00:27:42,834
Thank you. Ball...

468
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:47,876
Oh...!

469
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:49,751
I'm hurt!!!

470
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:51,292
Itt, what's wrong?

471
00:27:53,751 --> 00:27:56,209
Oh, the dog bites me.

472
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:57,626
That's ok, not much, Ball...

473
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:00,751
Beware of rabies infection.

474
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:01,751
So worried about you.

475
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:04,209
Ok, Ball, that's all for now.

476
00:28:07,918 --> 00:28:08,626
Dog bites?

477
00:28:13,751 --> 00:28:14,250
Here.

478
00:28:15,334 --> 00:28:17,334
The mechanics have passed a present for you.

479
00:28:18,876 --> 00:28:19,876
Why do you look at me like this?

480
00:28:21,292 --> 00:28:22,959
Because you are their boss.

481
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:24,667
They should be worried about you.

482
00:28:25,751 --> 00:28:28,334
The other hand, you work for my dad too.

483
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:32,334
Um.

484
00:28:36,334 --> 00:28:37,584
So, what about the guy named Ball?

485
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:39,959
Ball will come to visit.

486
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:41,417
Just for a while, he should be arriving.

487
00:28:42,626 --> 00:28:43,292
Why does he have to come?

488
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,417
He wanted to come!

489
00:28:45,876 --> 00:28:46,667
So, I asked him to come.

490
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:49,000
You invited him?

491
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:51,000
You said, you have no relationship with him.

492
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:52,375
Why do you invite him?

493
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,417
If I didn't invite him,

494
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:57,918
you will be suspicious of me for sure.

495
00:28:59,209 --> 00:29:01,709
Ball... He is a good guy, really.

496
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:03,375
He is not thinking anything with me.

497
00:29:03,918 --> 00:29:04,918
Let's just have it passed and over.

498
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,584
Sound good to you?

499
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:09,209
(Knock)

500
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:12,584
Hello... Itt?

501
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,501
Ohh... Ball.. Here you come.

502
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:17,292
Ohh... Why did you bring so many things?

503
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:19,292
Get well very soon... P'Day.

504
00:29:19,751 --> 00:29:21,292
Bought something to visit!

505
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:24,667
There are premium grade Thai seasonal fruits, ready to eat.

506
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,083
You don't have to come to visit.

507
00:29:27,584 --> 00:29:28,667
I can be recovered myself as well.

508
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:31,375
Day!

509
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:33,501
Why you just suddenly a talkative person?

510
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:36,834
Thank you so much... Ball...

511
00:29:37,334 --> 00:29:39,501
You don't need to buy a lot of things for visit.

512
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:42,083
No, not a problem. I'm willing to.

513
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:45,584
All fruits look so delicious, Itt will like it.

514
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:46,584
Unfortunately,

515
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:50,334
I forgot to bring you a Japanese snack box
that I've told Itt last time.

516
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:52,125
Don't worry.

517
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:53,459
It's OK.

518
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:55,667
Thank you so much.

519
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:01,626
P'Day is like this.

520
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:04,459
Itt... You must be very tired.

521
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:07,000
A little bit. I'm still OK.

522
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:09,083
If you don't feel ok,

523
00:30:09,584 --> 00:30:11,125
please call me anytime.

524
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:12,459
Are you a doctor?

525
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,042
Day!!!

526
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:21,792
(Knock)

527
00:30:24,918 --> 00:30:26,000
Hi... Ball...

528
00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:27,501
P'Ball... What's up?

529
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:29,792
Hello Gear... Hello brother Night!

530
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:38,209
It's already noon.

531
00:30:38,876 --> 00:30:39,709
Itt... Have you had lunch yet?

532
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:41,417
Haven't eaten yet.

533
00:30:42,876 --> 00:30:43,459
So...

534
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:45,417
Have to bother you.

535
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:47,501
Ball, please go for lunch with P'Itt.

536
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:49,959
P'Day...

537
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:52,083
I will be taking care of him.

538
00:30:53,792 --> 00:30:54,918
Why do you have to go with him?

539
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:57,000
Where is Gear?

540
00:30:57,626 --> 00:30:58,709
You said... You were friends!

541
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:00,792
Yeah... Yeah...

542
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:02,709
I stay with my boyfriend.

543
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:06,876
Ball,

544
00:31:07,459 --> 00:31:08,334
please take care of my friend!

545
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:14,000
Itt... Go to eat!

546
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:16,125
But... Day...

547
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,417
Your younger brother is coming.

548
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:20,292
Just let Night take care of him.

549
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:22,417
So... You just go to eat now.

550
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,584
If you faint again,

551
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:26,042
I am on the meeting...

552
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:27,709
I can't leave the meeting to take care you.

553
00:31:30,459 --> 00:31:31,334
Maybe...

554
00:31:31,834 --> 00:31:34,250
must let Ball do it.

555
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:36,667
To take care of you instead...

556
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:38,918
Why you have to let him take care of Itt?

557
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:40,584
Ohh...

558
00:31:41,459 --> 00:31:43,292
Or you are going to take a cast off
and take care of Itt. Day!!!

559
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,501
Go... Eat!

560
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:47,209
Uh... Uhh...

561
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,834
Then you get to hurry to come back
and take care your boyfriend very soon...

562
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:49,959
Okay!

563
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:53,584
Let's eat...

564
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,751
Night... Please take care of Day too.

565
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,834
Don't worry bro...

566
00:32:10,584 --> 00:32:11,918
Hey... There are a lot of fruits.

567
00:32:12,209 --> 00:32:13,375
Who brought for you?

568
00:32:21,334 --> 00:32:24,459
Itt, drink water right here...
I will go to order some foods.

569
00:32:24,918 --> 00:32:26,125
You have been busy all day, Itt.

570
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:27,542
Thank you.

571
00:32:28,918 --> 00:32:32,125
So... Let me have an omelette over rice, please.

572
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:34,250
Easy and fast.

573
00:32:35,334 --> 00:32:36,959
Then I can go back to take care of Day faster.

574
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:40,751
Ok... Please wait a moment Itt.

575
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:01,417
Itt, have a piece of cake while waiting

576
00:33:03,042 --> 00:33:03,834
to boost your energey.

577
00:33:04,334 --> 00:33:04,959
It is your favorite too.

578
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:10,417
Thank you so much.

579
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:31,834
Why do they take so long?

580
00:33:33,292 --> 00:33:33,792
These...

581
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:36,667
Time has just passed not so long, P'Day.

582
00:33:37,709 --> 00:33:38,375
Until Now,

583
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:40,584
P'Itt probably hasn't finished lunch yet.

584
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:42,250
Should it be as you think...

585
00:33:43,626 --> 00:33:45,000
It is not just eating slowly.

586
00:33:45,751 --> 00:33:46,959
Because he wants to spend more time with Ball...

587
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:51,626
If my friend wants to spend more time with Ball...
It is right, isn't it?

588
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,584
Ball always talks sweet.

589
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:56,292
Take good care like you did before...

590
00:33:56,876 --> 00:33:58,000
Look at you now!!!

591
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:00,792
Always look grumpy and pissed off.

592
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,375
A good guy like Ball...

593
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,459
How's he become your friend?

594
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:08,209
Ball is not my friend.

595
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:12,125
Ouhh... Itt said Ball is your friend.

596
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:16,209
Both of them have been friends
since that travel trip up country.

597
00:34:16,751 --> 00:34:17,667
For me...

598
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,167
I have been friend with Itt since secondary school.

599
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:23,042
Up country.

600
00:34:25,876 --> 00:34:26,375
Which province?

601
00:34:30,292 --> 00:34:30,918
Where?

602
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:35,834
Curiousity... You can figure it out by yourself.

603
00:34:40,459 --> 00:34:41,167
You pissed me off!

604
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,083
For this matter...

605
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:46,792
Night agrees with P'Day.

606
00:34:48,626 --> 00:34:49,459
About P'Itt,

607
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:53,334
Night wants P'Day to try
to figure it out by yourself.

608
00:34:55,417 --> 00:34:57,626
Because it's important.

609
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:02,792
Itt!

610
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:05,959
My legs got sore, give me a massage.

611
00:35:08,626 --> 00:35:10,834
Day, you got sore again?

612
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:12,667
Or feel any pain?

613
00:35:12,876 --> 00:35:15,375
Where, I can apply some medicine there.

614
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:16,250
No, no need.

615
00:35:17,292 --> 00:35:18,292
Just a massage should be ok.

616
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:23,000
Ok, if you feel any hurt or pain anywhere, let me know.

617
00:35:24,751 --> 00:35:25,375
Um!!!

618
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:37,834
Like this...

619
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:41,876
P'Itt, you must ask P'Ball to come often.

620
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,334
P'Day will be jealous.

621
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:48,000
And could get memory back soon.

622
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:51,042
Umm...

623
00:35:52,626 --> 00:35:53,667
You're bad!

624
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:56,542
You are right to deserve each other.

625
00:36:13,292 --> 00:36:14,375
You are so charming...

626
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,334
I will put a collar on you.

627
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:20,375
Huh!!

628
00:36:21,876 --> 00:36:23,417
I will put a collar on you next time.

629
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:27,250
So that everyone will know that you belong to someone.

630
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,250
Hard core, right?

631
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:36,626
Too hard...

632
00:36:37,751 --> 00:36:38,918
Well, you told me to make harder.

633
00:36:56,751 --> 00:36:58,125
Day... Take it slowly.

634
00:37:01,584 --> 00:37:02,542
Be careful!

635
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:04,542
Is this your house?

636
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:06,542
No!

637
00:37:07,876 --> 00:37:09,000
This is our home, you and me.

638
00:37:09,834 --> 00:37:10,709
But...

639
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:12,626
You brought for Night,

640
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:14,542
and asked me to stay with you.

641
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,167
Did I ask you?

642
00:37:18,334 --> 00:37:19,042
Yes, that's right!

643
00:37:20,417 --> 00:37:21,375
Well, we are boyfriends.

644
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:27,334
Itt!

645
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:31,334
I think Day should stay
at Mom&Dad's house, do you think so?

646
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:33,959
There are many people living there
so they can help to take care of Day.

647
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:36,167
Right!

648
00:37:36,751 --> 00:37:39,709
Itt won't be too much tried.

649
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:47,167
No, it is ok Dad.

650
00:37:49,542 --> 00:37:50,626
I can definitely take care of Day.

651
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:51,959
I can handle it.

652
00:37:52,918 --> 00:37:54,584
I don't want to let Mom&Dad to be tried.

653
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,250
Okay son.

654
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,375
I want to take the familiar places

655
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:10,417
to help Day to get his memory back so soon.

656
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,000
Hey... Day...

657
00:38:16,042 --> 00:38:16,584
Ahaa...

658
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:46,626
Ohh Ohh...

659
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:50,751
Ohh Ohh...

660
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:53,209
Ohh...

661
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:07,459
Darn, Itt! Turn off the stove!

662
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:09,459
Oh haven't seen you come.

663
00:39:09,501 --> 00:39:10,292
It all got burnt.

664
00:39:10,501 --> 00:39:11,125
Wait a minute.

665
00:39:13,209 --> 00:39:14,918
The fish is cooked.

666
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:16,125
Is it cooked? Darn it.

667
00:39:16,918 --> 00:39:17,459
Ohhh.

668
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:27,000
Look...

669
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:40,292
Let me carry it.

670
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:50,167
So sweet...

671
00:39:52,501 --> 00:39:53,834
When I live with you, do I eat sweet things?

672
00:40:01,876 --> 00:40:02,375
Tasteless...

673
00:40:02,709 --> 00:40:03,626
The coffee won't be melted ha...

674
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:10,542
What can you do, anything?

675
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:11,876
And you want to take care of me?

676
00:40:12,876 --> 00:40:13,626
Darn! You did nothing, can't do anything.

677
00:40:14,834 --> 00:40:15,792
Are you stupid or an   idiot?

678
00:40:55,292 --> 00:40:56,459
Take it down for me.

679
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:01,751
Are you will do or not do it?

680
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:08,334
I am...

681
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:10,167
You are my sole mate.

682
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:41,584
What the hell you can do?

683
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:43,792
Even to cook, you can not do it yourself!

684
00:41:44,042 --> 00:41:45,542
The T-shirt was written "Stubbon Boyfriend".

685
00:41:45,876 --> 00:41:46,834
You mean that to me.

686
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:49,042
Well... A bit...

687
00:41:49,334 --> 00:41:52,125
Mean brought some skin treatment for you.

688
00:41:52,626 --> 00:41:54,626
Accept my apologise for not visiting
while you were at hospital.

689
00:41:54,834 --> 00:41:56,000
Don't make it complicate.

690
00:41:56,667 --> 00:42:00,209
Because I don't know who you are.

691
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:02,125
Day, what are you doing?

692
00:42:02,584 --> 00:42:03,834
What's the relationship between you and Mean?

693
00:42:03,876 --> 00:42:05,167
She is just a friend...

694
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:07,042
So how about relationships between you and me?

695
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:08,000
Boyfriend!

696
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:09,792
If you feel uncomfortable while you with me,

697
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:13,042
just go to hell!
