1
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,613
Om nom nom.

2
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,907
What are you having?

3
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,410
Can I join?

4
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,746
Actually, I'd like to hear your stupid idea

5
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,622
so I can teach you how normal people think.

6
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,917
Itt!

7
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,005
Why does this video still exist?

8
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,424
I should be the one to ask you.
What happened?

9
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,967
You forgot everything.

10
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,178
You need to remember everything

11
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,971
to understand all these.

12
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,098
I don't think I want to now.

13
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,992
Boss,

14
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,369
I just sent you the video.

15
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,973
Take this.

16
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,225
Boss,

17
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,935
do you want me to hit him?

18
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,687
Stay out. Stay here.
Be the lookout.

19
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:56,282
Day, do you know how long I've been waiting for this?

20
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,202
Why did you wait?

21
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:03,456
I'm sure it's you who never let this go.

22
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:08,002
You made my dad exile me abroad!

23
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,340
You made my parents scold me.

24
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,300
And I was left with no one!

25
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,935
You look like a loving son.

26
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,938
Maybe...

27
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,150
you should pick up his call sometimes.

28
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,156
Your dad might need your help.

29
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,333
Dad!

30
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,755
Day! What did you do to my dad?

31
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,176
I give your dad the taste of your own medicine that you gave Itt.

32
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,053
How do you feel

33
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,181
to see your loved one

34
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,017
being kidnapped?

35
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,563
Day! Release my dad!

36
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,898
Of course!

37
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,194
But this shenanigan ends.

38
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,033
Day!

39
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,951
Don't hurt him.

40
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,579
If you still press on with this,

41
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,499
get ready to attend your dad's funeral.

42
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,046
Day, I concede.

43
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,382
Do not hurt my dad!

44
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,551
I beg you.

45
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,306
It's your choice, P.

46
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,726
I concede.

47
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,519
Give him back to me.

48
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,397
Darn P!

49
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,233
Do not touch Day!

50
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,486
Darn it.

51
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,823
P!

52
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,089
Darn P!

53
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,718
Get off me!

54
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,589
P!

55
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,867
Hey!

56
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,208
Hey! Nan!

57
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,757
Are you alright?

58
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,217
Day!

59
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,140
Hey, hey. Wait.

60
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:35,061
I think you'd better face my guy first.

61
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,954
Come on!

62
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,460
Still up for it?

63
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,087
Get in there!

64
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,797
Damn you, P!

65
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,055
P!

66
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,770
Dad?

67
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,694
Who rescued you?

68
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,117
No one was actually kidnapped in the first place.

69
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,754
Day proposed that we stage my kidnapping

70
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,465
so that you peacefully step back from this.

71
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,718
So that we don't resort to violence.

72
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,849
Day!

73
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,601
Itt!

74
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,185
Dad?

75
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,812
Why are you here?

76
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,023
You ruined the plan!

77
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,152
Day and Uncle Supot planned this

78
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,363
so that no one has to get hurt.

79
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,747
Day! Day!

80
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,040
Day!

81
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,708
Day!

82
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,335
Day!

83
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,337
Day! Wake up!

84
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,546
Day!

85
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,052
You'll be alright.

86
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,428
You'll be safe.

87
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,305
Stay with us.

88
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,915
Yes.

89
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,131
His friend said that Day had arrived at the hospital.

90
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,008
Hopefully, he'll be fine.

91
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,805
Otherwise, your dad's plan

92
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,848
would be for nothing, P.

93
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,897
Why?

94
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,150
Why are you on Day's side?

95
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,573
I hope...

96
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,493
that you...

97
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,953
will change...

98
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,499
if you know how it feels to be the victim of your own actions.

99
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,168
I still want to know

100
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,212
if I...

101
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,674
still have any worth for you.

102
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,426
Dad.

103
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,180
Why waste your time with this?

104
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,349
You're stuck with it

105
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,144
and you keep suffering.

106
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,981
I don't want to be alone.

107
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,736
I don't want you and Mom to hate me.

108
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,532
Mom and I

109
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,242
never hate you.

110
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:28,038
We want you to return and live with us.

111
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,084
But I fear...

112
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,754
that you would hurt someone.

113
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,715
I failed to protect you,

114
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,468
and that made me lose you.

115
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,887
P.

116
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,389
You probably don't know

117
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,684
the length your dad would go for you.

118
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,352
Athit.

119
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,897
Just tell him.

120
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,776
Dad?

121
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,070
Is there anything you're still hiding from me?

122
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,617
[Three years ago.]

123
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,535
I'd like to ask you

124
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,247
to not hurt P.

125
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,168
Even though what he did

126
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,796
was hideous,

127
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,298
he's my only son.

128
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,926
His mom and I

129
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,846
can't lose him.

130
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,607
Uncle Supot, please. Don't do this.

131
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,400
Get up.
Don't do this.

132
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,946
Uncle Supot, please get up.

133
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,787
Uncle Supot.

134
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,081
People like him

135
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,750
need to learn it the hard way.

136
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,344
I'll stop him from bothering you and Itt again.

137
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,806
He will leave Thailand.

138
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,892
I'll send him abroad.

139
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,194
Just this one time

140
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,155
wouldn't hurt, right?

141
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,908
Day, please?

142
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,668
Thank you so much, Day.

143
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,717
Why did you have to lose so much of your dignity?

144
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,971
It's not for any stranger,

145
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,765
but it's for you.

146
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,353
Why did you have to do all of these for me?

147
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,024
When it comes to a dad and his child,

148
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,319
there's nothing a dad wouldn't do.

149
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,072
P.

150
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:13,579
You only look at what Day has, and you don't,

151
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,875
not knowing that it was him who was jealous of you

152
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,794
for having parents

153
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,463
who care about you.

154
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,926
He wants you to care more about what you have.

155
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,386
And your dad,

156
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,806
he put up this act solely for you.

157
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,310
I'll leave that for you to reflect on.

158
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,811
Mom and I

159
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,648
miss you dearly.

160
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,778
But why are you so focused on revenge?

161
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:50,950
I don't know if I can still trust you,

162
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,745
but if you want to return,

163
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,582
you need to show me that

164
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,293
I can still be hopeful that you can change.

165
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,462
Dad.

166
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,548
I'm sorry.

167
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,099
I'm sorry.

168
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,898
I'm sorry.

169
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,353
Itt, you don't have to worry.

170
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,897
I made six stitches for his head injury.

171
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:08,193
Fortunately, his CT scan seems fine

172
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,987
He is safe.

173
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,909
Hey.

174
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,329
He's fine. Why are you crying?

175
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,463
Day.

176
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,632
Day.

177
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,028
Itt.

178
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,697
Itt. Itt.

179
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,532
My son.

180
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,619
Why don't you sleep on the couch?

181
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,414
P'Itt, please take a break.

182
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:06,085
I'll take care of him.

183
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,464
I got enough sleep. Night.

184
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:13,175
I'll wash my face a bit.

185
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,185
P'Day!

186
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,731
- He's waking up! P'Day!
- Day.

187
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,109
- Day, you're waking up!
- Doctor!

188
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,028
- Honey! Press the button!
- P'Day.

189
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,656
Quick!

190
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,742
Mom and I will...

191
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,160
- We'll get the doctor.
- We'll get the doctor.

192
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,412
Stop talking! Quickly!

193
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,622
P'Day!

194
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,126
Night.

195
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,547
Night!

196
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,215
I need water.

197
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,411
- Night.
- Yes?

198
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,204
Who is that?

199
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,835
Day.

200
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,797
Night, who is he?

201
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:48,729
P'Itt.

202
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,357
Night,

203
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,194
why are we back to where it started?

204
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,530
I hurt him again.

205
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:14,463
Is Night with you?
Day's looking for Night.

206
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,968
Yes, he's with me.

207
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,512
You two, come in.

208
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,988
Night.

209
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,573
Adjust my bed.

210
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,492
Of course.

211
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,452
Consider it done.

212
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,383
Why are you standing there?

213
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,014
Respond when you're spoken to!

214
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,518
And where were you?

215
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,938
Why did you leave me alone, Itt?

216
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,316
What do you want me to say?
You can't remember...

217
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,654
You...

218
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,157
You remember my name?

219
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:27,035
Why can't I remember my boyfriend?

220
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,580
We've been together for almost three years.

221
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,624
Day.

222
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,252
You...

223
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,255
You remember?

224
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,341
Yeah,

225
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,843
I do.

226
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,679
Itt.

227
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,933
Itthipol Charoenarat.

228
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,936
Do you want your parents' names too?

229
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,981
Day, Day.

230
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,659
I thought you had forgotten me again.

231
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,495
Why did you have to ignore me?

232
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:14,750
Didn't you remember what you did wrong?

233
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:22,341
You ruined my plan to deal with P.

234
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,384
I'm sorry.

235
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,554
You stupidly risked yourself

236
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,514
despite our promise.

237
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:34,519
- I told you I couldn't help myself.
- Don't argue with me!

238
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,272
Day.

239
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,317
I'm sorry.

240
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,988
Ahem. I guess...

241
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,991
I should call Gear to tell him the good news.

242
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,326
P'Day and P'Itt.

243
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,295
Itt.

244
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,925
I'm sorry

245
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,761
for forgetting you,

246
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,723
for making you sad,

247
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,352
and for hurting you.

248
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,564
You didn't want to forget.

249
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,817
Don't blame yourself.

250
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,111
If someone is to be blamed,

251
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,363
shouldn't it be me

252
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:29,199
who was childish and got you into an accident?

253
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,575
No.

254
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,745
I got into an accident myself.

255
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,999
Don't say that again. Okay?

256
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,045
But...

257
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:46,591
Now that you remember, are you alright with the video?

258
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,052
When you got mad and left me,

259
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,888
I couldn't imagine

260
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,975
what I could do to make you forgive me again.

261
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,187
I didn't leave because I was mad at you.

262
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,607
I was mad at myself.

263
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,112
I regret...

264
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:10,031
hurting someone I love.

265
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,577
Even if with my memory intact,

266
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,247
anything that makes us fight

267
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,542
will make me regret.

268
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,252
Day,

269
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,546
we've come so far.

270
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,256
We've been through so much

271
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,675
before arriving on this day.

272
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,136
The version of you I see today

273
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,805
is someone who protects me.

274
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,935
If you've got time, think about the future.

275
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,315
Hm.

276
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:52,741
And my ring? Where's it?

277
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,454
It feels weirdly empty without it.

278
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,971
I gave it back to you

279
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,057
because I don't want to keep it to myself again.

280
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:22,354
Now that's more like my hand.

281
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,579
Come get a hug.

282
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,964
You're not going to forget me again?

283
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,590
No.

284
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,094
- Maybe.
- Hm!

285
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:57,180
Aw. That hurts.

286
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,911
And you dare to face us again? P.

287
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,748
Just tell us what you have in mind.

288
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,253
I want to apologize to you both

289
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,130
for having to deal with all these.

290
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,342
Someone who seeks revenge on us from the other side of the world

291
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,596
now turning into a good guy?
Why?

292
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,934
Because of my dad.

293
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,439
He had to kneel in front of you

294
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,275
because of me.

295
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,321
If he actually got hurt,

296
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:58,491
it would be because of me and the trouble I caused.

297
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:03,580
I don't want to cause my parents trouble anymore.

298
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,792
You should stop blaming others

299
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,462
and look at yourself.

300
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:17,510
That's why I want to end it all here.

301
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,680
I will pursue a study abroad

302
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,184
so I want to say sorry to you.

303
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,853
P.

304
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,813
Did you know

305
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,191
that the sincerest apology

306
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,818
is to not make the same mistake again.

307
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,242
I will not disappoint my parents again.

308
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,329
You are fortunate

309
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:51,544
to always have your parents by your side no matter how many times you cause trouble,

310
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,546
always giving you chances after chances.

311
00:27:55,715 --> 00:28:00,220
Are you aware that your dad is a very respectable man?

312
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,932
Don't hurt him ever again.

313
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:12,190
- Hm.
- As for your study,

314
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,068
work hard for it.

315
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,571
Otherwise, you might fail.

316
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:22,450
I'm convinced you have a surplus of stupid thoughts.

317
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,578
Do I have to stand here and take it?

318
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,542
Itt.

319
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:34,879
I know that you have so much to say about me.

320
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:40,135
Say it. Say it all.

321
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,224
I'm too tired for that.

322
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,768
It's a waste of time.

323
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,896
I'd like to punch you in the face once.

324
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,378
Night.

325
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,921
P'Itt.

326
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,133
I'd like to cook Day breakfast.

327
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,720
Are you sure?

328
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,431
Of course, it's a great idea.

329
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:53,977
What are you going to make?

330
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,691
Day's favorite,

331
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:02,193
Redtail catfish topped with sauce,

332
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,736
Fried tilapia and sour soup,

333
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,948
and Fried prawn in tamarind glaze.

334
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,493
I think you should go for just one dish.

335
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,038
Fine.

336
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,166
How about fried fish

337
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,836
and the sour sauce like we always do?

338
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,839
But you burned the kitchen last time.

339
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,717
It'll be different this time.

340
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,848
- You can be my assistant.
- No!

341
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,059
I'll do it myself.

342
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,395
And you

343
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:40,398
can be my assistant.

344
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,736
Are you sure?

345
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,405
Of course.

346
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,868
Slice it like that.

347
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,122
- Watch your fingers.
- I know.

348
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,210
How about some tears?

349
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,339
- No, that's fish sauce.
- Alright.

350
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,104
Night, when the fish is...

351
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:24,067
- crispy and yellow...
- Rest it to drain oil so it's not too wet.

352
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,697
- Okay.
- I'll go wake P'Gear up.

353
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,908
Sure.

354
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,453
I'll deal with the cooking.
It will be fine.

355
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,292
Go on. Don't worry.

356
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:18,037
Hey, Day. You're up?

357
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:22,959
- Your breakfast is still cooking.
- Haven't I told you to not cook again?

358
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,253
I don't want to call the fire department.

359
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,383
But I wanted to learn how.

360
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,928
Why?

361
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,264
You don't like my food?

362
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:40,601
I do. I want to eat what you cook for the rest of your life.

363
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,146
But I want to learn how

364
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,149
so I can cook for you when you're ill.

365
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,737
When you were hurt,

366
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,031
I wanted to do so many things for you,

367
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:55,533
but I had no idea how.

368
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,498
I can remember now.

369
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,043
It's okay.

370
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,879
I know,

371
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:13,634
but in a couple's life,
if someone got ill,

372
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,721
the other should take care of that someone.

373
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,684
How about you keep this until I'm ill?

374
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,728
Okay?

375
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,396
I'll teach you.

376
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,357
I don't want to rebuild the kitchen.

377
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,942
Seriously?

378
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:34,363
Then, please take a seat.

379
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,824
I'll serve you.

380
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,619
Go. Take a seat.

381
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,090
Now that you fried me a fish,

382
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,674
how about feeding me too?

383
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,302
Yes, sir.

384
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,351
So appetizing.

385
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:23,955
What do you think?

386
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,170
- Did Night make the sauce?
- What?

387
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,673
You didn't think I made that?

388
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,468
- You made that?
- Yeah.

389
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,388
Why can't you say nice things about it?

390
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,931
Huh?

391
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,685
Good.

392
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,436
Just "good"?

393
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,858
- Delicious.
- Good.

394
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,360
Then eat more.

395
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,904
Here.

396
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,993
- You got a lot better.
- Absolutely.

397
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,954
It's because I'm your boyfriend.

398
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,747
Wait.

399
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,291
Or am I your wife?

400
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,715
I forgot your reward.

401
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,891
- Day.
- Huh?

402
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,560
Can you teach me how to make other dishes?

403
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,669
You just recovered.
You don't need to rush back to work.

404
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,712
Hm?

405
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,381
Itt and I have had a long break, Dad.

406
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:01,928
I need to help you and Mom.

407
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,849
Itt said the same thing.

408
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,602
It's like you both discussed this before.

409
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:10,686
Hm?

410
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:54,313
If I had known this, I'd have hit him with a hard wooden stick on his head

411
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,482
the moment I learned he lost his memory.

412
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,359
We can't do that.

413
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,569
Hitting his head like that

414
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,030
could risk even more injuries

415
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,949
and you might put him into a coma.

416
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,663
The chance of getting a concussion and it returning your memory is slim.

417
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,331
This is a big deal.

418
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,171
Day's condition is nothing to worry about,

419
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:22,550
but Itt, you still have panic attacks.

420
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,263
I think I can deal with it.

421
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,641
When I rode a motorcycle to get to Day, I was fine.

422
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,893
We can't be sure.

423
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,855
You need to continue your treatment,

424
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,523
attend mental therapy,

425
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:41,193
and do not stop taking drugs without a doctor's advice.

426
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,782
Trust the doctor.

427
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,993
Don't act tough.

428
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,456
Yes, doctor.

429
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,875
Nan.

430
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:41,170
Day came to visit.
Aren't you going to say hi?

431
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,423
Hi, Boss.

432
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,219
Tell me if you need anything.

433
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:52,014
I just want to take Itt for a ride.

434
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,434
It looks like the track is free

435
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,019
since it's dead silent.

436
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,940
We close down for some maintenance,

437
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:05,069
but if you want to use it, make yourself at home.

438
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:13,411
And where's the guy driving this car?

439
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,415
In a good place

440
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,500
where people like him should be.

441
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,838
Day,

442
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:27,758
I don't think the track is closed for maintenance today,

443
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:31,512
but the track owner's heart is.

444
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,472
What are you talking about?

445
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,434
- This has nothing to do with Mac.
- What?

446
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,145
When did I mention Mac?

447
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,742
How can you both go through all that?

448
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,745
You two are really tough.

449
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,836
Hope.

450
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,131
Don't lose hope in love.

451
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,217
Otherwise,

452
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,554
pain will kill us.

453
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,190
Day, let's go.

454
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,901
Let's hit the track.

455
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,196
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

456
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,827
Do you want me to take the wheel, or do you want to?

457
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,330
Hm, I'll drive.

458
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:42,082
- If I reach my limit, you can take it.
- Sure.

459
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,464
Get in.

460
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,883
Thank you.

461
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,478
Day, didn't you say you don't believe this?

462
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,605
- Why are we here again?
- Hey.

463
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,690
How can he not believe her?

464
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,526
She was so accurate.

465
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,986
Her fortune-telling is exact!
Don't you remember?

466
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,655
Her fortune-telling is unmatched.

467
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,699
Remember how she said we should get something hard to hit your head with

468
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,618
to give Day back his memories?

469
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,913
See? That was so accurate.

470
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,917
What do you want me to look into this time?

471
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,711
I want to...

472
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,672
look into my marriage.

473
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,550
- What? Marriage?
- What? Marriage?

474
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,260
Day?

475
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,262
You're proposing me?

476
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,931
I don't need to

477
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,017
because...

478
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,645
I'm your only choice.

479
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,605
Come on, Day.

480
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:52,027
Why can't our proposal be a little more romantic?

481
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,697
- Are you not going to marry me?
- I will marry you!

482
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,326
Give me your hands.

483
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:10,296
The best moment for your marriage is...

484
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,006
anyday

485
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:17,595
because the best moment is when you're the readiest.

486
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:23,392
May you two love each other with the presence of mind.

487
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,123
A third wheel!

488
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,625
Aw.

489
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,631
So good!

490
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,934
What are you reading?

491
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,437
Hm?

492
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,272
Hm?

493
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,899
What are you reading?

494
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:14,109
The same old book.

495
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:20,366
Day and Itt's marriage is tomorrow.

496
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:25,663
Yeah, I guess Day got all his memories back.

497
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:33,921
Good times become good memories.

498
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:37,383
Bad times become good lessons.

499
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:41,261
Translate that. Have you got subtitles?

500
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:45,683
Right, I'll get you some subtitles.

501
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,976
It means that...

502
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,982
good times will become beautiful memories,

503
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:58,487
while bad times become lessons we learn from.

504
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,615
Wow, where did you get this?

505
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,701
Do I sound smart?

506
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,663
And...

507
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,666
are you going to tell me what happened in France?

508
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,003
Hm.

509
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,339
Nope.

510
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,885
So, what are we going to do?

511
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,681
I guess...

512
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,770
we can marry before Day and Itt do.

513
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,189
Oh god.

514
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,692
- A marriage?
- Yeah.

515
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,320
Are you going to say no?

516
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,365
- I'll marry someone else.
- Fine.

517
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:46,410
But there's a catch.

518
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,662
What?

519
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,331
It should've been you who proposed.

520
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,460
Come on. Just one.

521
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,628
Can't you do that for me?

522
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,089
I'm not doing this often.

523
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,051
You got ready for it, huh?

524
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,305
I'm waiting.

525
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,474
One more, please.

526
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:12,811
- Asked for an inch, and now taking a mile?
- One more.

527
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,984
You caught me off guard.

528
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,528
I didn't catch you off guard.
What are you talking about?

529
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,656
It was nothing.
Catching someone off guard

530
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,950
looks like this.

531
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:32,122
That's catching you off guard.

532
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,457
Get this now?

533
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:01,276
This is P's gift from America.

534
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:04,780
You know P too?

535
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,367
It's a long story.

536
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,459
Please get ready.
The ceremony is about to begin.

537
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,128
Congratulations, Itt.

538
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,673
Congratulations, P'Day.

539
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,092
Thank you.

540
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,554
What's that?

541
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,768
Nan, get dressed.

542
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,104
It's about to begin.

543
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,946
- Someone will help him get dressed.
- Huh?

544
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,323
Who?

545
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:51,368
- What does he mean?
- Who?

546
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,043
Nan.

547
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:04,464
- Get dressed.
- Mac?

548
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,223
We're third wheels.
Let's move out.

549
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:16,143
What are we there for? Move out.

550
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,398
Do you miss me?

551
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,318
It's been a long time.

552
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,236
I do.

553
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,864
I miss you dearly.

554
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,409
If you do,

555
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:35,746
then why are you still standing there?

556
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,592
Whose marriage is this?

557
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,260
It's mine!

558
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,137
- It's theirs!
- And what's with these two?

559
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,431
What?

560
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,266
What's up with you?

561
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,893
Stop! Get off, you two.

562
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,395
Separate, now!

563
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,439
Get dressed! You're going to be late.

564
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,942
- You'll be late for the parade!
- Put this on for me.

565
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:09,154
- “Put this on for me.”
- Can you please help me get dressed?

566
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:12,157
- Put this on for me.
- I don't know how to get dressed.

567
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,911
- Put this on for me.
- I somehow forgot how to put this on.

568
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:18,538
What's with all this?
Let's tidy it up.

569
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:24,127
This is just a marriage!

570
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:26,171
Stay cool.

571
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,298
What are you looking at? Set up the parade!

572
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,925
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

573
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,301
Quickly!

574
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,095
This is my marriage, and now I'm taking orders.

575
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,763
Who's taking what?

576
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,223
Just say it if you feel shy.

577
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:40,268
Get in line!

578
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,863
Let us marry next.

579
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,710
May your love intertwine like this garland.

580
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:39,638
Finally, this day has come.

581
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:43,600
Let this garland be a symbol of your love.

582
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,797
Kiss now. Kiss now. Kiss now.

583
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,258
Kiss now. Kiss now. Kiss now.

584
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,510
Kiss now. Kiss now. Kiss now.

585
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:04,639
Kiss now. Kiss now. Kiss now. Kiss now.

586
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:05,891
Three,

587
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,225
- two,
- Kiss now.

588
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:09,436
- one!
- Kiss now.

589
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,625
Kiss now. Kiss now. Kiss now.

590
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:34,169
Kiss now. Kiss now. Kiss now.

591
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,296
Kiss now. Kiss now. Kiss now.

592
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,256
Kiss now. Kiss now. Kiss now.

593
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:29,182
[The end.]
