1
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:35,201
Is it true that Itt and I are seeing each other?

2
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,327
Yeah.

3
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,787
Yeah, it's true.

4
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,081
You tried your best.

5
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,167
But if I tried hard enough,

6
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,753
Day would've regained his memory.

7
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,548
Or better yet, Day wouldn't have gotten hurt.

8
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,633
Hello, Itt.

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,469
Hello, Ball. Come on in.

10
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,472
Wow! What's with all these gifts?

11
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,849
Didn't you say there's nothing between you and him? Why did you invite him here?

12
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:01,019
You'd still be suspicious of us both if I hadn't invited him.

13
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,896
Ball is a nice guy.

14
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,731
- Hey! Day!
- Ugh!

15
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:09,986
Bring it down for me.

16
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,031
I...

17
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,787
Why does rubbing Day's body take so long?

18
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,547
Day wanted to wash his hair.

19
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,258
P'Day.

20
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,677
Do you think we should go to a temple?

21
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,097
We've been having a hard time recently.

22
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,598
A temple?

23
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,600
Night.

24
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,144
Do you think Day is ready for that?

25
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,438
Yeah, I'm going.

26
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,439
What?

27
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,109
Make up your mind!

28
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,125
Hey!

29
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,001
What's with the blackout?

30
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,586
I turned it off.

31
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,300
A horror movie should be watched in the dark.

32
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,472
Your hair is perfectly dry.

33
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,683
I'll go upstairs.

34
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,144
Give me a leg massage.

35
00:02:58,803 --> 00:02:59,971
I'm thirsty.

36
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,682
Grab me a drink.

37
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,493
You're teasing him.

38
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,705
So?

39
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,542
Right, I totally forgot.

40
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:35,381
Your past self loves to tease people you're interested in.

41
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,031
Itt!

42
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,206
Itt!

43
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,709
What a chicken.

44
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,169
It's just a cat.

45
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,796
A cat made you scream your heart out?

46
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,131
Day!

47
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,841
How did you even come here?

48
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,177
You felt scared because of the movie, didn't you?

49
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,139
Yeah! I'm scared. You knew it.

50
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,601
Know what? I don't remember anything.

51
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:30,645
You jerk!

52
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,648
You don't need to remember that!

53
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:37,402
You only just learned about it, and you played him!

54
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,831
Don't help him.

55
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,500
Have him do it himself.

56
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,336
Do you know how to do anything at all?

57
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,839
You can't even cook.

58
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,924
How am I even your boyfriend?

59
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,135
Day, you jerk!

60
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,053
You can't talk to him like that.

61
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,805
It's you...

62
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,057
who spoiled him.

63
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,393
You always did everything for him.

64
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,438
He's at the point where he can't live without you.

65
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,232
You only have yourself to blame.

66
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,824
Now that I heard it myself,

67
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,036
I don't want to go back to my old memories at all.

68
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,121
P'Day.

69
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:38,629
Night, I need a shower.

70
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,257
Please help me clean this mess.

71
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,563
P'Day

72
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,275
Why did you have to hurt P'Itt like that?

73
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,235
You dare stand up to me?

74
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,029
Of course.

75
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,907
Only with someone as mean as you.

76
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,742
I'm mean? What about it?

77
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,412
If he loves me, then he should be able to bear me.

78
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,664
If not, how did our relationship last for almost two years?

79
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,501
Before you lose your memory,

80
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,462
you weren't this person.

81
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,923
If you can't remember,

82
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,842
why don't you ask everyone?

83
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,553
Everyone!

84
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,829
Why are you here?

85
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,083
Why don't you go back to your home?

86
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,296
Wherever Night is, I'm always there.

87
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,590
You sleep with my brother?

88
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,758
We've been in a long relationship.

89
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,427
If Night were a girl,

90
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,721
you would've been an uncle.

91
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,059
P'Day, I'm a grown-up.

92
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,770
I'm not the high school boy you believe I was.

93
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:03,232
In fact, you already knew about this.

94
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,609
Fine.

95
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,153
But during my watch,

96
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,530
don't even think of crossing the line, Gear.

97
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,366
I can't guarantee

98
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,619
if I might accidentally hurt you or not.

99
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,954
With a single hand,

100
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,414
I think I can dodge it.

101
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,540
Hey!

102
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,045
Night, you'd better go to sleep.

103
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,005
Take Gear with you too.

104
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,258
I'll take care of Day.

105
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,941
Did you cry upstairs?

106
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,784
Don't tell me you haven't cried.

107
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,203
If you don't want me to cry,

108
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,789
you should stop talking to me that way.

109
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,958
Sensitive boy, huh?

110
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:07,129
The feelings of someone who lost their memory and someone who has been forgotten

111
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,967
are vastly different.

112
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,346
And you can't bear that?

113
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,810
No, I can.

114
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,729
I'm your soulmate.

115
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,983
Do whatever your heart tells you to do.

116
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,110
I will accept it.

117
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,739
Just go to sleep. It's late.

118
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,325
You'll embarrass me in front of the monks with this.

119
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,202
I'm not wearing it!

120
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:05,498
P'Day, how about wearing this at the party tonight?

121
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,459
Do you really want me to wear it that badly?

122
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:16,384
P'Itt design these couple shirts for yourselves, right?

123
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:20,554
Yes, it was his birthday gift

124
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,224
in the first year of our relationship.

125
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,231
P'Day!

126
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,233
Day!

127
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,068
Day, are you alright?

128
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,070
I'm fine.

129
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,241
Night, we'd better take him to the hospital.

130
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,451
I'm fine. It's nothing.

131
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,080
Day, let's go for a check-up.

132
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,875
I said I am fine!

133
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,891
This way, please.

134
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:31,041
May you have a long life, bright skin, happiness, and good health.

135
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,298
This accident

136
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:41,135
is the result of your past karma.

137
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,556
Don't blame this on anything,

138
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,142
thinking it is someone's fault.

139
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,562
The more you think about it, the more pain you bear.

140
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,397
At this moment,

141
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,108
the karma has not diminished.

142
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,569
Be patient.

143
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,070
Soon enough,

144
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,364
everything will get better.

145
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,000
Your shirt says, "naughty boyfriend."

146
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,128
Are you naughty to me?

147
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,551
I guess just a bit.

148
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,803
When the venerable monk told us

149
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,973
to not blame this on anyone,

150
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,183
what does it mean?

151
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:18,274
The venerable monk referred to the person who cut you off.

152
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,653
The venerable monk probably hopes that you won't feel resentment toward them.

153
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,321
Is that so?

154
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:32,037
I'm still mad, but Kamol cleared it up.

155
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,291
Do you think that was everyone?

156
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:40,504
Day, when you crashed,

157
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,259
you were an ordinary person, not a mafia.

158
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,554
There was nothing mysterious about it.

159
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,598
Don't think too much about it.

160
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,312
But when I came out of a coma,

161
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,940
someone told me this.

162
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,529
Day.

163
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,914
I'm going to tell you everything.

164
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,291
I can't stand it anymore.

165
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,543
That night,

166
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,546
I asked you to hurriedly return from Chonburi

167
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,924
despite a heavy rain

168
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,635
just to buy me a cake.

169
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,599
I threatened you that, without a cake,

170
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,935
I wouldn't take my medicine

171
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,980
I was being sarcastic,

172
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,485
saying that you're not coming back means you never love me.

173
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,030
Is this it?

174
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:52,034
The love everyone told me you have for me?

175
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,203
Ultimately,

176
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,539
it's only about you.

177
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,233
Give me a second.

178
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,160
Hello?

179
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,954
How's everything?

180
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,540
We're home now.

181
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,794
I'm sorry I didn't pay you guys a visit.

182
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,673
It's alright. Knowing that you're concerned is good enough.

183
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,466
Well...

184
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,052
Can I pay you a visit at home?

185
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,889
No, please. I don't want to bother you.

186
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,477
Who is it?

187
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:05,357
Meen. She'd like to pay Day a visit.

188
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,737
Tell her to come.

189
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,241
Okay, Meen.

190
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:17,536
I'll share my location with you.

191
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,625
Can you stop bringing strangers to see me?

192
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,169
You know Meen.

193
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,920
She knows you too.

194
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,881
She just wants to drop by.

195
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,967
Seriously?

196
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,805
Are you two really friends? Quite a friendly talk you had there.

197
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,016
She's polite to me.

198
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,935
Who am I to be rude to her?

199
00:17:55,115 --> 00:18:00,245
It's so hot. This shirt is making it worse!

200
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:17,679
- Meen.
- Hm!

201
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,224
How was your journey?

202
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,642
It wasn't hard to come here.

203
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,437
So, where's P'Day?

204
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,868
Meen, have a seat.

205
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,000
- Thank you.
- Give our guy some water.

206
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,513
This is for you.

207
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,559
This is Nick. He's my friend.

208
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:08,647
- Hi!
- And this is Nill. He's Day's friend.

209
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,819
This is Gear. He's also my friend.

210
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,781
And Night, he's a younger brother of...

211
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,408
P'Day.

212
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,285
Hello.

213
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,958
Uh, let's have our barbecue.

214
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,960
- Yeah.
- Let's have our barbecue.

215
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,545
Let me add some vegetables.

216
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,131
- Add them in.
- Oh.

217
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,759
I got you a get-well gift.

218
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,305
I'm sorry I didn't visit you at the hospital.

219
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,850
Don't trouble yourself.

220
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,897
I wouldn't know...

221
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,857
who you were anyway.

222
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,988
As I said, he lost his memory.

223
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,536
Let me take that from you.

224
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,043
If you're not having this, I am!

225
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,799
Meen, would you like some pork? Let me cook some for you.

226
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,510
Sauce?

227
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,933
- Here's water.
- I bought you guys a cake.

228
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,559
It's low-sugar.

229
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,146
Thank you, Meen.

230
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,858
Could that be an orange cake?

231
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:39,321
- This is not the time!
- I just wanted to have an orange!

232
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:44,243
So, how long do you have to keep the cast on? P'Day.

233
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,411
I'll take it off soon.

234
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:51,083
It's so nice to hear that it's not too bad.

235
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,210
Hm.

236
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,880
- Let's have our barbecue!
- Yeah.

237
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,507
- Let's have our barbecue!
- Do you want sauce?

238
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,510
This is your favorite, right? Let me cook it for you.

239
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,847
How's your job lately?

240
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,641
Well,

241
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,434
online sales.

242
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,104
Yeah, I think I saw you.

243
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:17,150
Do you do live broadcasts on Facebook? I think I saw it recently.

244
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,319
- Yes.
- The randomized boxes?

245
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,946
- Yes.
- Ah-hah!

246
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,781
How's business?

247
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,909
- It's doing well.
- What do you sell?

248
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,578
- Everything.
- Everything?

249
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,872
She sells everything!
(Laughing)

250
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,126
I need a toilet.

251
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,714
- Let me take you there.
- No!

252
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,218
That's my carer's job.

253
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,934
Stand up slowly.

254
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,614
Slowly.

255
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,302
Day, what are you doing?

256
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,013
- What's with you and the girl named Meen?
- I said we're friends!

257
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,725
- I told you we're friends.
- And what are we?

258
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,643
A couple.

259
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,772
And you two sitting next to each other, all close and personal?

260
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,440
Are you insulting me?

261
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:42,486
No! You misunderstood.

262
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,488
Meen is the only girl at our table.

263
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:48,033
There's a bunch of men Meen doesn't know who.

264
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,452
I just don't want her to feel uncomfortable.

265
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,996
A man and a woman get all close and personal like that?

266
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,750
I don't think you two are friends. Do you think I'm stupid?

267
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,752
Ugh!

268
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:03,215
Day! Day.

269
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:06,093
- You're hurting me.
- Tell me.

270
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:10,263
- Day, this is not funny.
- Tell me!

271
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:19,106
Fine, I'll tell you.

272
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,491
Meen...

273
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,036
is my ex-girlfriend.

274
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:39,978
Meen.

275
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,782
Meen.

276
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,993
I'm going to study communication arts.

277
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,704
What do you want to do after graduating?

278
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,207
I want to marry you.

279
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:08,256
I told my dad about this too, just so he could prepare.

280
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,303
Hey!

281
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,347
Do you not believe me?

282
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,350
I'll write down my promise here.

283
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,439
When Itt...

284
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,109
finished...

285
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,074
his bachelor,

286
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:40,872
he will marry...

287
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,583
Meen.

288
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,800
(Meen & Mac)

289
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,108
Meen?

290
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:22,038
I'm sorry, Itt.

291
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,292
No matter which way I choose,

292
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,420
it's never fair to you.

293
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,773
What do you have to say now?

294
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,443
We broke up.

295
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,448
Why did you try to hide if there's nothing to worry about?

296
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,575
Our relationship was done a long time ago.

297
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,452
We've been friends for a long time too.

298
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:03,747
Is it bad for me to consider her a friend?

299
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:07,667
There's no way I can know what is true or not.

300
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,171
Are you jealous?

301
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,798
I'm not.

302
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,009
I'm pissed.

303
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:19,429
You're pissed because I'm close to Meen.

304
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,765
That's being jealous.

305
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,602
Don't make assumptions about me.

306
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,687
I hate it.

307
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,775
- Day! Itt!
- What?

308
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,486
What are you doing in there? I need a toilet!

309
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,696
Give us a second.

310
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,073
What do you want to do?

311
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:41,534
Quickly! I'm going number two!

312
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,828
Fine, give us a few more seconds.

313
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,005
Remember this.

314
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,218
Don't piss me off again.

315
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,054
Careful.

316
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,392
Alright?

317
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,072
Vegetables?

318
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,035
Uh, I think I should get going.

319
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,372
I'll pay you a visit again when I have time, P'Day.

320
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,873
It's alright.

321
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,084
I'm doing fine.

322
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:34,629
Uh, thank you for coming.

323
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,256
Let me walk you to your car.

324
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:41,136
I'll follow your page and order something from you.

325
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,221
Thank you.

326
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,515
Bye-bye.

327
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,241
Meen.

328
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,495
- Hm?
- I'm sorry.

329
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,624
Day's mood is rather unstable.

330
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:15,837
Even with his memory lost,

331
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,382
I can still feel that he dislikes me the way he did before.

332
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,012
It's not that he doesn't like you. Don't think too hard about it.

333
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,264
I don't.

334
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:30,101
My point is, even though he forgot everything,

335
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:34,397
I believe that he's very protective of you deep down.

336
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,275
Because why would he act that way?

337
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,778
I can't deal with something too deep like that.

338
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,034
I wonder when he'll regain his memory.

339
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,038
You need to spark his memories

340
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,875
and don't do things that will make him angry.

341
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,169
I don't want you to get hurt.

342
00:29:56,211 --> 00:30:01,466
I feel uneasy thinking of the past version of P'Day.

343
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,011
Thank you so much, Meen.

344
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,639
It's alright.

345
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:13,728
You can always call me.

346
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,357
Remember. I'm your friend.

347
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,121
Oh.

348
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,586
Have you heard anything about Mac?

349
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:43,925
His family told me he hadn't come home for a while.

350
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:51,432
(3 years ago)

351
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,352
Darn Mac!

352
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,775
Chill out.

353
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,069
So bold of you to have come here.

354
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,738
Wait until I finish my race.

355
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,450
How could you do that to Meen?

356
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,119
When Meen left me,

357
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,039
I thought she would end up with someone she loves who loves her too!

358
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,625
Argh!

359
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,588
Well, I don't.

360
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,965
I've never loved her.

361
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,135
I love you.

362
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:32,807
I only approached Meen to keep her away from you!

363
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,893
Darn Mac!

364
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,562
Do you feel even a tiny bit of remorse?

365
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,231
You took our time away!

366
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:44,527
It's you who took mine!

367
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,989
I had to date someone I never loved.

368
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:52,076
I had to wait for you to give up so you could be with me.

369
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,621
But you...

370
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,831
You're still with someone else!

371
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,709
Urgh! Mac. What are you doing?

372
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:03,046
Ugh! Mac!

373
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,631
Ugh! Mac.

374
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,883
Hey!

375
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,970
Day!

376
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,391
He's mine only.

377
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,271
How many times have I told you

378
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,940
to not go out alone?

379
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,525
You may only go out with me!

380
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,830
And you.

381
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,668
How should I deal with you?

382
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,214
Agh!

383
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,132
What is this?

384
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,385
Let me go!

385
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,345
Nan.

386
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,562
He caused trouble in your territory.

387
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:05,274
Deal with him however you want.

388
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,780
Let me go!

389
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,743
Come fight me!

390
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:33,678
I'll tell you if I know anything.

391
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,501
Take a step with your right foot.

392
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,175
His body recovers very quickly,

393
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,303
but physical therapy is still needed.

394
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,972
What about his memories?

395
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,515
Hm.

396
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,392
That takes time.

397
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:26,606
Try to take him to familiar places,

398
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:29,358
do activities you always do together,

399
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:33,529
and show him objects with special meanings.

400
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:37,241
But it's up to Day too

401
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:42,121
how much he tries to regain his memories.

402
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:51,923
When he does, he always gets a headache.

403
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,634
That is normal.

404
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:59,305
If he gets a headache, stop thinking, and it should go away.

405
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,725
Otherwise, take some medication.

406
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:16,572
Mom wanted me to tell you that we should take Day to our home

407
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,950
so we all can help take care of him.

408
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,995
I don't want to give you and mom more responsibilities.

409
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:26,833
It's bad enough not having me at the repair shop.

410
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,752
It's alright.

411
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,839
Without me, I think it's alright

412
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:36,592
because I'm useless, to begin with.

413
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:40,888
Without Day, however, that's going to make your job harder.

414
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:46,644
I'm sorry for making it happen this way.

415
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:51,566
Everyone gave me so much, but I never gave them back.

416
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:56,821
At first, mom and I didn't like Day.

417
00:35:56,863 --> 00:36:00,950
We thought Day was going to take you from us.

418
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:05,163
In reality, he didn't.

419
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:08,583
He became another son of ours.

420
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,794
We feel at peace

421
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:15,923
to know that Day can take care of you when we're gone.

422
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,885
Dad! Don't say that.

423
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:23,890
Hey. You can stop words,

424
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:27,310
but you can't stop life from moving forward.

425
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,730
I know, but we don't need to mention it.

426
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,231
Do you understand?

427
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:37,820
I complained a lot because I wanted you to be able to take care of yourself.

428
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:42,408
No one is with us forever.

429
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,079
But from the look of you,

430
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:51,042
you're enough of an adult to take care of your soulmate now.

431
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,711
You're doing great.

432
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:56,505
- Thank you, dad.
- Hm.

433
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,050
- Take good care of yourself.
- Yes.

434
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:01,427
- You too.
- Yes.

435
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,682
- Tell mom I miss her.
- Sure.

436
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:12,688
- Have a safe journey.
- Of course.

437
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,693
P'Joe, don't drive too fast.

438
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,299
What?

439
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,972
Is it that uncomfortable being with me?

440
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:52,144
If that's the case, then don't.

441
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,230
You can drop dead wherever you please.

442
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,527
What is wrong with you? Why did you have to say that?

443
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:05,825
Wasn't it you who said you felt uncomfortable being with and taking care of me?

444
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,119
Did I?

445
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,371
You always jump to a conclusion.

446
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,127
Despite your hurtful words,

447
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:19,672
I never ever want to leave you, Day!

448
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,175
Why do you have to try driving me out?

449
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,643
What's with all the crying? That wasn't that hurtful.

450
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,688
Are you a man?

451
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,942
Who said a man can't cry?

452
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,820
Huh?

453
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,036
Come here.

454
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,875
If you don't want me to drive you out, come sit here!

455
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,386
Sit down.

456
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,060
I said sit down!

457
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,941
Stop crying

458
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,861
or Night is going to get on my nerves again.

459
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,593
Agh! It hurts.

460
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,014
Then stop crying.

461
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,563
Please bring back my old Day.

462
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,526
Bring back my old Day.

463
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:08,280
Bring back my old Day!

464
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,260
Why are you still with Nan?

465
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,637
Guess who made me stuck here.

466
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,723
Guess who made me do this.

467
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,560
Are we sleeping in this room?

468
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,313
- Ugh! Ugh.
- Day! Day!

469
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,939
You have had several headaches today.

470
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,650
Please don't race today. Let's go to the doctor.

471
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,236
If you want me to remember you,

472
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,406
make me feel it.
