1
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,698
- Augh!
- P'Itt!

2
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,533
What are you two?

3
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:34,951
Are you alright?

4
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,247
A couple.

5
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,586
Day?

6
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,087
In this tent,

7
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,798
you've laid on my lap like you just did, right?

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,217
I'm looking for Day and Itt.

9
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,927
I went to their house, and they weren't there.

10
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,850
If you're not going to say anything, hang up.

11
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,435
It's annoying.

12
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,312
Why did you pick up the call?

13
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,605
Day.

14
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:06,274
That's P's voice. It's definitely him.

15
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,818
Day?

16
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,195
P! No!

17
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,321
Die!

18
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,693
Itt.

19
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,654
Do you have a photo of P?

20
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,823
The guy that keeps calling us?

21
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,286
No,

22
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,204
but I have his Facebook.

23
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,624
Why? What do you remember?

24
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,918
Nothing.

25
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,173
You said I should watch out for him.

26
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,133
I figured I should know what he looks like.

27
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,385
Yeah, that's true.

28
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,316
Here is his profile picture.

29
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,901
His face should be clear.

30
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,704
What a little dog.

31
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,664
I will recognize him anywhere.

32
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,300
P!
[Three years ago.]

33
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,265
I told you never to come here again.

34
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,768
I'm just having a check-up.

35
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,732
I'll tell your dad that you're not nice to your customer.

36
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,948
What do you want to be checked?

37
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,745
Everything.

38
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,044
Ugh!

39
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,796
That hurts!

40
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,259
Day!

41
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,469
Why do you always hurt him?

42
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,471
Itt.

43
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,057
Do you want him to keep butting in?

44
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,810
If you do,

45
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,311
then I'll leave.

46
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,730
And you two and be together.

47
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,536
It's fine, P.
I'll deal with this.

48
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,975
Day, slow down.

49
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,476
Slow down!

50
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,604
Day! Stop! Stop!

51
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,612
Are you looking to die?
Why did you drive so fast?

52
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,578
I want to take you home as soon as possible.

53
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,913
Why? What's with the rush?

54
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,541
Are you alright?
You've been acting strange since this morning.

55
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,964
The person I saw at the waterfall...

56
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,176
was P.

57
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Hey! Jerk!

58
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,228
Day! No!

59
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,981
P! No!

60
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,566
Die!

61
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,303
Day.

62
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,771
I told my dad about your encounter with P.

63
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,023
He wants to see us at home.

64
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,360
Why did you tell him?

65
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,238
You're making him stressed out for no reason.

66
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,324
You lost your memory.

67
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,828
Without me telling, my dad will know anyway,

68
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,704
and that would make him more worried.

69
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,878
He wants to talk with us.

70
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,382
He doesn't want you to do anything drastic.

71
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,055
I don't too.

72
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,061
Day? Itt?

73
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,312
What is it?

74
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,235
There's a strange car in front of our house.

75
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,328
Gear, please do me a favor.

76
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,960
Please protect my brother while I'm taking it to his dad.

77
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,213
And...

78
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,175
deal with those insects for me.

79
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,104
Good luck.

80
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,115
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Uh.

81
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,325
Sorry. Sorry.

82
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,076
I'll move them for you.

83
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,703
Didn't you see my car?

84
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,538
There's a lot of trash.

85
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,541
Aw! Give me a moment.

86
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,084
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

87
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,758
- Hurry up!
- Of course! Will do!

88
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,176
Working on it.

89
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,385
There are a lot of them.

90
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,849
There's a lot to be moved. Stay calm!

91
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,185
I've got lots of trash.

92
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,854
Do you need a hand or what?

93
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,898
I'm in a hurry!

94
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,946
Give me a second.

95
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,247
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

96
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,047
Wait, wait. One more!

97
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,799
There you go!

98
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,259
I got everything.

99
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,512
Be careful next time!

100
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,223
Sorry.

101
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:19,976
Please.

102
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,292
I assume that you can't remember him.

103
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,628
This is Supot, P's dad.

104
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,464
Hello.

105
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:02,184
[Three years ago.]

106
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,636
You have crossed the line!

107
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,350
I hate him!

108
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,977
I hate Day!

109
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,687
I hate him!

110
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,902
And I am the one cleaning up after your doing!

111
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,657
You never...

112
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,410
loved me.

113
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,414
What kind of dad doesn't love his son?

114
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,791
Huh?

115
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,886
Uncle Supot,

116
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,056
Day is confident that he saw P at the waterfall.

117
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,849
Is he back in Thailand?

118
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,813
Could be.

119
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,274
I've been tracking his credit card.

120
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,152
He seemed to be in Las Vegas.

121
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,365
But lately, it has gone dark.

122
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,244
It's like he doesn't want me to know anything about him.

123
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:47,331
That's why I can't confirm if he's still in the US.

124
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,252
I'm afraid he's back for revenge.

125
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,629
He always thinks he's a victim,

126
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,756
but it's him who shot us.

127
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,717
Darn P!

128
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,270
Sorry.

129
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,188
I'm really angry.

130
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,318
It's alright.

131
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,655
My son did something wrong.

132
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,492
Hey, Athit.

133
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:28,998
I'll find him and stop him from doing anything stupid again.

134
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,332
That's good.

135
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,465
Please find him quickly

136
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,925
before I do.

137
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,102
Day.

138
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,563
No matter how evil he is,

139
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,190
he's still my son.

140
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,902
Please stop what you're doing.

141
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:02,948
Let me deal with this myself.

142
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,747
That's how I hope it goes.

143
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:29,475
You two will have to stay here for now.

144
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,317
I don't want Mom and Dad to worry.

145
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:42,571
We would still worry if you didn't.

146
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,658
Staying close to us will give us peace of mind.

147
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:49,745
There are people here looking out for you.

148
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,044
Day.

149
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,048
My dad won't back down.

150
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:06,554
Night can stay at Gear's.

151
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:12,810
If we insist on staying there, Night won't leave too.

152
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,404
I'm glad that you two aren't stubborn about this.

153
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,031
I really care about you.

154
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,117
Day had just recovered.

155
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:31,036
His memory isn't complete.

156
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:35,457
And you? You were kidnapped by P.

157
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,878
Dad, I'm not making that mistake again.

158
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,255
I hope so.

159
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:48,971
You always flip out and don't think enough if it's about Day.

160
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,140
Dad.

161
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,144
Go see Mom.

162
00:14:56,061 --> 00:15:00,357
Mom said that you two must stay here.

163
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,068
Yes.

164
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,695
What's mom cooking today?

165
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,822
- Let's go see her.
- Hm.

166
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,422
Is there anything you want to talk about with me?

167
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,469
Despite memory loss, you're still witty.

168
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:37,269
I don't want you two to get involved with P.

169
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,896
It's risky.

170
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,858
I'm worried that something might happen to you.

171
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,778
I understand,

172
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,948
but I really need to do this.

173
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,661
I have to protect Itt

174
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,245
and myself.

175
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,707
Day, this is too risky.

176
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,503
Don't you remember what P is like

177
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,130
and what he did?

178
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:10,928
To fight against someone who doesn't have anything to protect puts us at a disadvantage.

179
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,555
When you got in the accident,

180
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,474
Itt wasn't doing too well.

181
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,812
If anything happens to you again, what will he do?

182
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,899
I'm going to be fine.

183
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,360
I'll look out for myself.

184
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,279
Don't worry.

185
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,495
I wouldn't let Itt get involved.

186
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,878
Getting one of you out of this is good enough.

187
00:16:54,346 --> 00:17:00,185
Day, these mag wheels, shock absorbers, and springs are imported from Japan.

188
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:04,606
These car accessories too.

189
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,317
How awesome is that?

190
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,820
Look at them.

191
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,406
Don't take anything, though. They're for sale.

192
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,661
Day, would you like to know more about P?

193
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,873
Screw him.

194
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,917
I don't want to know anything about him.

195
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,464
I just want to know what your workplace is like.

196
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:35,387
I had been recovering for too long.
I want to work.

197
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,853
The mechanics are going to be happy to see you back.

198
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,774
Despite me not remembering who they are?

199
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:51,987
You coming back means you don't want to forget them.

200
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,865
They will be happy for sure.

201
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,290
That's where I work.

202
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,834
Whenever I'm tired,

203
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:10,047
I'll look at you, who's always busy with piles of paperwork.

204
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,636
That means...

205
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,387
I see you too?

206
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,725
I don't know.

207
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,729
You never turn to me whenever I look at you.

208
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,566
And...

209
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,820
you never tell me about it too.

210
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,580
Bas! Bas!

211
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,624
Look!

212
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,960
P'Day? Have you got better?

213
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,838
Bas!

214
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:54,258
Come help me!

215
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,385
I can't pay for all this if I drop it!

216
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,720
Sorry, P'Thep. I got too excited.

217
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,430
I miss them so much!

218
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,224
Always the same!

219
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,351
Agh!

220
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,979
You two have been away for so long!

221
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,023
Of course, I'd be happy to see you back!

222
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:13,735
I thought you would like it without me.

223
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,030
Wouldn't it be easier for you to slack off?

224
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:20,075
Hey, we never do that.

225
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,785
I'm not like P'Thep!

226
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,954
What? Why me?

227
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:27,040
I was just resting my eyes. I didn't slack off.

228
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,335
Aren't you two slacking off right now?

229
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,379
Get back to work.

230
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,843
I see a smile on P'Day's face.

231
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,262
The scent of engine oil

232
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:43,182
can't compete with the scent of your love.

233
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,184
How about the smell of getting beaten up?

234
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,437
I'll give one to you right here.

235
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,356
P'Itt! Stay cool.

236
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,110
P'Day,

237
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,154
I was just joking.

238
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,925
Day?

239
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,843
Where are you going?

240
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,012
I need to see something.

241
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,555
Maybe it'll refresh my memory.

242
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,067
Hello, sir.

243
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:37,903
Yes?

244
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,489
What are you looking for?

245
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,910
I'm looking for the new engine oil.

246
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,954
The engine oil?

247
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,665
It's over there. We have lots of options.

248
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,874
This way, please.

249
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,009
Stay quiet!

250
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,639
I'm not sure if you're too brave or too stupid

251
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,140
to come to me.

252
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,561
Tell P

253
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,439
to not hide like a cowardice dog

254
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,694
or I'll skin his dog skin myself.

255
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,420
Day? Day?

256
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,754
Hey, Day.

257
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,673
Where did the customer go?

258
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,551
He left.

259
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,597
He walked into the wrong store.

260
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,516
Oh.

261
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,729
P'Itt!

262
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,064
Did you meet your friend?

263
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,149
Friend?

264
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,152
What friend?

265
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,238
I didn't ask his name.

266
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,450
He said he wanted to see you and P'Day.

267
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,869
He said he didn't see you at home.

268
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:12,122
So, I told him you two went to a waterfall in Kanchanaburi.

269
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:21,298
Does he look like a game-addicted glass-wearing nerd with curly hair?

270
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,966
Also, as skinny as a small dog?

271
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,218
Hello, sir.

272
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,679
I'm looking for Day and Itt.

273
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,431
I went to their house, and they weren't there.

274
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,850
P'Day and P'Itt!

275
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,857
Yes, Day and Itt.

276
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,442
I'm their old friend.

277
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,569
I miss them. That's why I came.

278
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,447
Yes!

279
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,366
Does that mean you have met him?

280
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,205
Hit yourself in the mouth.

281
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,920
- Do you want me to do that myself?
- Day!

282
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:05,384
Bas! So, it's you who led P to the waterfall.

283
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:08,929
P?

284
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:14,267
P? The guy P'Thep said shot you?

285
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,603
God.

286
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:17,854
Yeah!

287
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:21,900
Hit yourself in the mouth 20 times! Now!

288
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,153
Quit having such a big mouth from now on.

289
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,448
I'll do 30!

290
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,368
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

291
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,078
Count!

292
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,287
Four!

293
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,455
Five!

294
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,706
Six!

295
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,125
Seven!

296
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,501
Eight!

297
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,753
- Nine!
- Enough!

298
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:56,810
Day, we still don't know where P is.

299
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,062
Is it a good idea to eat outside?

300
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:05,694
What if we don't find him in a year? Don't we want to live our lives?

301
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,369
You said you wanted to come here.

302
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,746
Here we are.

303
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,498
Hopefully, you'll be happier.

304
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,627
- I know, but...
- Hm.

305
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,797
Smile.

306
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:34,556
Fine! I'll eat as much as I can today.

307
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,767
I'm not letting him steal my happiness.

308
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:51,948
Uh.

309
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,909
I'll go to the toilet.

310
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,994
Pick a seat. I'll see you.

311
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,331
Hurry.

312
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,061
Come out.

313
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,326
An excellent smelling skill of a dog as always, Day.

314
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,666
And you?

315
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:43,959
Have you changed?

316
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:50,090
Why don't you ask Itt how much I have changed?

317
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:56,054
Oh, I forgot that you lost your memory.

318
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,641
Stop beating around the bush.

319
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,393
What do you want?

320
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,230
I'm just missing Itt.

321
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,984
We used to talk and used to be friends.

322
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,487
Don't you remember that?

323
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,326
What you're doing is called being a pervert.

324
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:23,915
Do you know...

325
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:28,545
that I have lots of fun plans for you two?

326
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:33,258
Just thinking about it makes me so happy.

327
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,927
Imagine actually doing it.

328
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,222
How fun is that going to be?

329
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,809
Why don't you do it now?

330
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,186
You're all talk.

331
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:04,456
If I were you, I'd return to Itt immediately.

332
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,510
Day.

333
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,805
What do you want to have?
I'll order food for you.

334
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:27,520
You're my boyfriend.
You should know what I like.

335
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:33,401
Sure, I'll order for you.

336
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:53,296
Tada! I ordered your favorites.

337
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,302
You know me too well.

338
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,230
When you were kidnapped by P,

339
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,858
how did it happen?

340
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,611
I doubt you're that weak.

341
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,286
He knew my weakness.

342
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,086
He used you as bait,

343
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,838
saying that he had kidnapped you.

344
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,508
I was stupid enough to follow him.

345
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,220
And you had to rescue me.

346
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,310
You just didn't know.

347
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,439
Now you do.

348
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,858
Don't be fooled twice.

349
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:59,487
If someone says I'm in danger, do not believe them.

350
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:05,410
If something bad happens, escape to the safest location.

351
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,163
Do not solo anything.

352
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,375
All these just to lecture me?

353
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,918
Am I supposed to be delighted?

354
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,755
Itt.

355
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,555
If you really are in danger,

356
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,183
I can't leave you.

357
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,852
Care about yourself before caring about me.

358
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,062
This is our mutual agreement.

359
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,900
Day, I won't accept this.

360
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,569
Do not wait for me. Do not waste any time.

361
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:43,573
You need to escape to where there are lots of people.

362
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,909
If you see his car, drive faster.

363
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,963
Let's eat.

364
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,884
I want to take you somewhere.

365
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,387
Where are you taking me?

366
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,391
A trip?

367
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,936
An amusement park?

368
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,606
You want some?

369
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,274
No, thank you.

370
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,818
Come on?

371
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,905
Here. Open your mouth.

372
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,199
Quickly. Come on.

373
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,929
I told you I hate this.

374
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,976
If you can't overcome your fear, your life will be hard.

375
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,044
Hey, Nan.

376
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,421
What's up, Itt?

377
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:26,718
Back on good terms with Day?
Is that why you two came?

378
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,389
Why do you look a bit worn out?

379
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,477
Hey!

380
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,315
What are you two doing around this car?

381
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,279
You know how much Itt loves cars.

382
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,616
He just wants to see this beautiful car up close.

383
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,584
Move.

384
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,504
Mac.

385
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,548
Aren't you going to check your engine?

386
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,595
Mac, isn't it almost time to race?

387
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,182
If you're late, you'll lose automatically.

388
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,936
Nan! What is wrong with you?

389
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,335
Didn't you say you let him go home?

390
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,672
I said he went home,

391
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,049
but I didn't say he was released.

392
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,551
What do you want from him?

393
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,681
Itt, I think I want to see the race.

394
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,768
I told him that if he won, he would get a reward.

395
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,855
But if he loses, I'll punish him.

396
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,275
What did you do to that car?

397
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,488
I just want the result to be certain.

398
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:15,118
Nan! What if an accident happens?

399
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,911
Did you think this through?

400
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,478
Itt.

401
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,648
Let's give it a go.

402
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,859
Tell me if you feel uncomfortable.

403
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,203
Nan.

404
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,290
Is that a professional racer in that car?

405
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,125
Yes, Boss.

406
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:08,880
Nan, you put him against a professional racer.

407
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,388
What?

408
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,312
Ask him what he did.

409
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,629
Hey?

410
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,468
What's happening?

411
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,471
Come on! Go!

412
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,353
Come on!

413
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,148
What is this?

414
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,471
- Here.
- What?

415
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,015
You drive.

416
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,516
No.

417
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,227
- Drive.
- No!

418
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,104
Drive!

419
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,814
No! You drive.

420
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,735
If not now, then when?

421
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,905
I'm afraid of driving. You drive!

422
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,867
You drive.

423
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,413
How about this? If you're afraid to drive,

424
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,457
you sit next to me.

425
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,462
That's what you did on our way back from Kanchanaburi.

426
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,471
Fine, you drive.

427
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,141
Okay. Got it.

428
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,353
- You drive.
- You drive!

429
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:23,217
[Three years ago.]

430
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,181
Whose car is that?

431
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,939
What are you doing?
Get out of the car!

432
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,071
Didn't you see where you were going?

433
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:47,116
- Didn't you see me coming out?
- Please calm down.

434
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:48,951
I'm so sorry.

435
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:55,249
Don't worry about a thing. I'll deal with everything.

436
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,044
I'm not going anywhere.

437
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,587
I'm so sorry.

438
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:02,048
I had just started driving a few days ago.

439
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,097
How will you pay for this?

440
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:16,187
- Where's the damage? I'll...
- Don't you see?

441
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,939
I'll deal with everything.

442
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,734
I'm not going anywhere.
Everything will be dealt with.

443
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,779
I am so sorry.

444
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,574
Look at this.

445
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,597
I hit your car?

446
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,604
Itt?

447
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,109
Itt.

448
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,611
Itt!

449
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,822
Itt!

450
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,408
Itt! Wake up!

451
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,326
Itt!

452
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,919
Itt? Itt. Wake up!

453
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,255
Itt. Itt!

454
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,757
Wake up! Itt!

455
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,887
Itt, wake up.

456
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,347
Itt.

457
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:34,890
Itt!

458
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,728
Wake up!

459
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,753
Om nom nom.

460
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,006
What are you having?

461
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,508
Can I join?

462
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,844
Actually, I'd like to hear your stupid idea

463
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,721
so I can teach you how normal people think.

464
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,016
Itt!

465
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,020
Why does this video still exist?

466
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,439
I should be the one to ask you.
What happened?

467
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:24,982
You forgot everything.

468
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,193
You need to remember everything

469
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:28,986
to understand all these.

470
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,113
I don't think I want to now.
