1
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,200
Where did loving me so much get you?

2
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,320
I love you so much, just like you do.

3
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,600
I'm so terrible to you, and you still love me?

4
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,680
Orange cake? Day? You remember?

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I don't.

6
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,920
Everything will go back to normal if you can remember.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,280
What if that never happens?

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,200
I will make you love me again.

9
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,760
(Cheering)

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,760
(Cheering)

11
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,120
Here you go!

12
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,120
Wow!

13
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,600
Let's eat!

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,080
So good!

15
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,200
You having a BBQ buffet with us reminds me of my birthday.

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,840
Oh, of course!

17
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,280
It was so heated!

18
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,040
Isn't that right? Jealous boy?

19
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,160
(Laughing)

20
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,760
What? J'Bale?

21
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,600
I didn't start it.

22
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,400
What you mean...

23
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,560
is that Day started it

24
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,640
because he was too hot?

25
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,440
What is this about?

26
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,320
You don't want to know.

27
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,280
I do.

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,880
Hey, there.

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,960
I'll tell you everything myself.

30
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,520
So, several months ago,

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,800
You and Itt came to Kanchanaburi.

32
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,520
On that day,

33
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,320
it was coincidentally Por's birthday too.

34
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:34,440
So, we went to celebrate her birthday at P'Bank's.

35
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,080
However,

36
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,360
the spicy part started when...

37
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,840
Poom,

38
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,520
your ex. Can you remember him?

39
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,440
He came, and...

40
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,680
Hoo!

41
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,560
Things got heated!

42
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,920
Hey!

43
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,320
Why did you step on my toe?

44
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,360
And I can't say what happened after that.

45
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,440
I could never forget that birthday.

46
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,680
Obviously.

47
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,520
After the incident,

48
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,160
Day and Itt

49
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,200
settled this.

50
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,080
Uh...

51
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,440
I really do not know what happened next.

52
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,400
♫ Happy birthday to you. Hey! Hey! ♫
[Six months before the accident.]

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,680
♫ Happy birthday to you. Hey! Hey! ♫

54
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,080
♫ Happy birthday. Happy birthday. ♫

55
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,320
♫ Happy birthday to you. ♫

56
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,760
♫ Happy birthday. ♫

57
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,400
Do you mind...

58
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,920
- Huh?
- if I have a toast with you?

59
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,320
He might not,

60
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,440
but I do.

61
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,400
It's just a toast.

62
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,320
What's wrong with that?

63
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,280
Then,

64
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,280
I will have a toast with you for him.

65
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,440
Hey!

66
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,920
I apologize for my boyfriend's behavior.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,200
Please go back to your table.

68
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,960
Are you siding with him?

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,840
He started it!

70
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,280
Didn't you see that?

71
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,520
Don't get too confident.

72
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,440
He'll leave you pretty soon.

73
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,960
I'm not as low as you.

74
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,640
He's been dating me for two years,

75
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,960
but you?

76
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,960
Wasn't it only a night?

77
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,000
You want to have a go?

78
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,240
What are you fighting for?

79
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,120
This is Por's birthday!

80
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,800
I don't like him!

81
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,280
I'm going home!

82
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,680
Itt!

83
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,360
What?

84
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,720
I'm going home!

85
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,400
Didn't you tell me...

86
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,320
that you're not ready for commitment?

87
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,080
And what is that?

88
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,600
I hadn't found the right one then.

89
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,520
Can I be yours too?

90
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,320
Poom, you know well...

91
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
that I'm not a perfectly decent person.

92
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,200
Well.

93
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,760
But I'm willing to do anything terrible if anyone messes with my lover.

94
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,680
Let's have our cake!

95
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,960
Stop with this nonsense!

96
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,160
Yeah, I'm nonsensical!

97
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,960
Being protective of you is nonsensical too, right?

98
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,600
You jumped to the conclusion,

99
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,440
and got mad all by yourself!

100
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,800
Yeah, I am! I'm annoying and nonsensical!

101
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,240
Nobody did anything. I'm the crazy one!

102
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,200
- Is that what you want to hear?
- Stop being sarcastic!

103
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,480
Why? I don't like him!

104
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,560
I don't like it when you're onto someone.

105
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,400
Do you think only you can be protective of me?

106
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,840
You believe I'm yours only! You are mine only too!

107
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,720
How is this hard to understand?

108
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,720
I don't like it when someone's messing with you.

109
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't like seeing you being close to anyone.

110
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,800
- Itt!
- Ugh!

111
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,200
Day!

112
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,640
- Day! Get off!
- Stop!

113
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,360
I'll make you believe

114
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,600
that I'm yours only.

115
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,560
I've never done this to anyone.

116
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,480
You will be my first

117
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,240
and my last.

118
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,200
I have no idea what happened after that.

119
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,080
Are you drunk?

120
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,560
No, I slipped on a carpet.

121
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,000
Are you sure?

122
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,840
Yeah.

123
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,960
And you? Drunk?

124
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,760
Hey! Day!

125
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,640
You said you're my lover.

126
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,320
Yeah.

127
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,200
So, can you help remind me of that?

128
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,320
Day.

129
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,720
How many times do we do it in a week?

130
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,480
Two or three?

131
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,640
Serious.

132
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,880
How many times?

133
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,720
Three or four?

134
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,000
That's quite a lot.

135
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,800
The doctor told me performing activities that I used to do a lot

136
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,840
will help me regain my memories.

137
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,960
I guess we have to...

138
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,680
Day.

139
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,120
Do you want to remember us

140
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
or am I just here to please you?

141
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,280
Sometimes,

142
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,920
I felt like you were protective of me.

143
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,920
And sometimes,

144
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,920
you made me feel like...

145
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,160
I'm just an object you want to keep.

146
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,080
So, what am I to you?

147
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,040
Whatever you believe you are.

148
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,000
I guess I'm just here to please you.

149
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,320
I'm just an object you want to keep.

150
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,280
Silly you!

151
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,760
If I want to fulfill my "needs",

152
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,520
anyone can fill that role for me.

153
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
What am I to you?

154
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,440
- A silly person.
- Hey!

155
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,360
Be serious.

156
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,680
Give me a straight answer.

157
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,080
I want to remember.

158
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,800
Really?

159
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,800
Yeah.

160
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,760
I want to remember

161
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,320
- why did I even date a silly person Iike you.
- Day!

162
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,760
This is for your trouble last night,

163
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,400
for hurting you.

164
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,840
You're my lover. How do you not know I don't like dessert?

165
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,760
I do,

166
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,160
but you always take it if it's me who gives you dessert.

167
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,920
And this is what you always do,

168
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,360
but you normally wash it off with black coffee.

169
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,880
Day, what's your plan for today?

170
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,680
Our shop is closed.

171
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,280
- Are you...
- I'm going to finish some accounting at the shop.

172
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
It's been a long time.

173
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,640
I guess I'll go with J'Bale.

174
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,360
I see everything.

175
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,520
Though, my eyes are closed,

176
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,520
my third eye is wide open.

177
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,960
- I'm leaving.
- Wait!

178
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,280
It's just a metaphor!

179
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,320
She's really accurate. Give her a chance.

180
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,240
What guidance do you seek?

181
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,840
Fortune teller, please. The story is...

182
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,520
this young man's boyfriend lost his memory.

183
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,880
We'd like you to see...

184
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,480
when will his boyfriend's memory return.

185
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,640
Of course, but I need to change my form.

186
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,240
Change your form?

187
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,440
She's like the biggest drag queen ever.

188
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,680
Extend to me thy hand.

189
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,360
Love has been unkind to you.

190
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,680
You have been giving your all to something that might not return you favor.

191
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,920
You give him a hundred. You are returned ten.

192
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,480
So sad that your true worth is not recognized.

193
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,800
You're just keeping with a hopeless thought of...

194
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,880
"He loves me. He's just bad at expressing himself."

195
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,400
Hey! I don't want you to do me!

196
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,800
That was my hand!

197
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,120
See this young man!

198
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,480
- Hard.
- Hard luck?

199
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,440
Harden muscles. All protein!

200
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,760
It's a biceps. It's a triceps. It's forceps. It's...

201
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,280
Ceps, ceps, ceps.

202
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,800
Ah! That feels pretty good.

203
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,640
You're almost done?

204
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,800
I am finished.

205
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,040
Are you done with your fortune-telling?

206
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,080
What is his fortune like?

207
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,520
Will his boyfriend's memory return?

208
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,080
The lost memory?

209
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,560
We need a tool. A hard object.

210
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,440
Hit him with a hardwood stick, and his memory will return.

211
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,880
Young man!

212
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I sense a person with previous deeds on you.

213
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,520
- A person with previous deeds on me?
- You see that too?

214
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,840
- That's my boyfriend.
- That's what I thought.

215
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,480
You two are as handsome as each other.

216
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,960
You're going to hit who with what?

217
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,680
We don't need to do that.

218
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,240
I'll look for new ways.

219
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,480
- Extend your hands!
- Here.

220
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,880
I can feel it!

221
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,720
Aw. God. Itai, itai. Iki, iki.

222
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,480
Argh. I can really feel it.

223
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,320
You can feel his fortune?

224
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,800
The veins on his arms. I can feel it.

225
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,280
I can feel the biceps and triceps.

226
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,240
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

227
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,080
eight, nine. Aw! Urgh! Get off of me!

228
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,520
Argh! That hurts. Release me!

229
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,960
In this young man's fortune,

230
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,920
I see a shadow of someone lurking.

231
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,920
It's following you.

232
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,640
And this shadow...

233
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:19,240
will lead you and your boyfriend...

234
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,200
to horrible misfortune

235
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,000
and leave you a scar.

236
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,480
That shadow is coming back.

237
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,960
Either one of you...

238
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,120
will fall prey to the karma of your past.

239
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,000
One of you might be gone.

240
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,520
Huh? Who am I?

241
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,720
Let's go.

242
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,680
Young man, remember this.

243
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,520
Love is driven by memories.

244
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,880
Who am I?

245
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,120
Do you believe that lunatic?

246
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,040
We should think about it.

247
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,040
I've had strange feelings lately.

248
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,720
Wait, N'Itt?

249
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,080
Do you have the sixth sense?

250
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,040
No, P'Bale.

251
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,280
Lately,

252
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,240
an unknown number has been calling me.

253
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,800
What? A scam call?

254
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,120
I picked up, and they didn't talk.

255
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,240
Who do you think it was?

256
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,360
I'll deal with them.

257
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,360
Day!

258
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,000
Calm down.

259
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,400
I'm not sure if it's him.

260
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,680
If you get the call again, let me know.

261
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,440
Uncle Day visits Ingfah!

262
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,440
Wow! She has grown up.

263
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,840
Three years of his memory were lost.

264
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,040
I guess Ingfah was a little girl then.

265
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,760
Uncle Itt is the boyfriend of uncle Day!

266
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,400
Do we know each other?

267
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,320
You used to bring me here.

268
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,880
Does that mean you forget about telling me to not bring Ingfah here?

269
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,360
If you can remember, why did you bring her here?

270
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,080
Life is complicated.

271
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,560
I'm a single dad.

272
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,240
Day, that unknown number is calling.

273
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,920
Take it and turn on the speaker.

274
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,600
Hello?

275
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,440
Who's that?

276
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,560
Hello?

277
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,600
Who do you want to talk to?

278
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,560
It hung up.

279
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,280
Do you think this is your past enemy, the one you told me about?

280
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,640
Who is it?

281
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,560
I'm not sure,

282
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,440
but I can think of someone.

283
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,720
Who?

284
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,240
You can't remember him.

285
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,200
I've seen this car for a long time. What's the issue with it?

286
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,120
Uh.

287
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,640
When will the client retrieve it?

288
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,960
Do you know when?

289
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,520
Yeah, today.

290
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,440
Deal with it.

291
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,720
Hey, Itt.

292
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,320
Dad.

293
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,520
Do you still contact uncle Supot?

294
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,360
What is it, Itt?

295
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,280
About Pee.

296
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,400
Is he still out of the country?

297
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,040
Supot ordered him to never come back to Thailand again.

298
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,720
What is it, Itt?

299
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,280
No, I was just wondering about something.

300
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,480
Let me know right away if there's anything.

301
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,000
Of course, Dad.

302
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,320
I doubt it.

303
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,160
If you return to Bangkok, pay your mom and me a visit.

304
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,160
Pee?

305
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,560
You can't remember him.

306
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,680
Losing memory has its good side. I can forget horrible people.

307
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,640
I don't want you to forget everything.

308
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,840
There's us in his story too.

309
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,040
We risked our lives,

310
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,600
and we saved each other.

311
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,520
Day, no!

312
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,800
He made me realize

313
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,400
what a selfless love looks like.

314
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,000
It's like what happened at this snooker club.

315
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,360
I was beaten on that day,

316
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,040
but I don't want to forget it

317
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,840
because you saved me.

318
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,760
Stop the car!

319
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,960
What?

320
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,000
Let me ask you this.

321
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,040
Have you ever driven fast in your life?

322
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,240
You never like me driving fast.

323
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,640
[Two years ago.]

324
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,560
Day, what?

325
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,320
Did you join this race to win money for a stupid motorbike?

326
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,000
What's with all the fuss?

327
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,200
Do you think this is worth risking losing your limbs or life?

328
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,880
Whatever, but I prefer you to go fast now!

329
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,280
Step on the gas. Metal to the pedal.

330
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,360
Why are you rushing me? We can just drive normally.

331
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,360
- We might want to take a break.
- I will not.

332
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,560
If you do, take me to Nan.

333
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,120
For what?

334
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,600
Do I need to ask your permission to see my henchman?

335
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,360
Nan, I'd like to drive a racecar.

336
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,160
Prepare the track for me.

337
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,520
I'd like to borrow your car too.

338
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,120
- Day, I think...
- Did I ask your opinion?

339
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,160
What's up with the two of you?

340
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,640
Nan,

341
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,640
where's Mac?

342
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,280
You come to see me and ask for Mac?

343
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,400
He's not here. He returned home.

344
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,080
Wait.

345
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,160
Please be in the car with Day.

346
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,280
How long have you been holding this?

347
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,520
Boss, there's someone on the track!

348
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,800
What is wrong with you?

349
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,320
Do you want to die that badly?

350
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,960
Do you know what you just did?

351
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,720
Do you know?

352
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,880
I see.

353
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,200
You don't remember

354
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,600
that you said you'll never lay your hands on me.

355
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,560
Day! What's wrong with you?

356
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,880
You always hurt me!

357
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,240
Day! It hurts! Let me go.

358
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,840
If you keep doing this, I'll leave you!

359
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,920
Day! It hurts! Why do you keep doing this?

360
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,800
Argh!

361
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,840
Why can't I remember?

362
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,840
Do you want to die that badly?

363
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,400
Boss! Boss!

364
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,360
What are you doing?

365
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,480
Boss! Don't do this!

366
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,840
Itt! You're back!

367
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,880
What's wrong?

368
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,480
And where's P'Day?

369
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,360
What's up, Night?

370
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,480
P'Day, what happened?

371
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,120
Is he home?

372
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,200
What's with the red bruise on P'Itt's face?

373
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,280
I hit him.

374
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,800
Why did you have to do this?

375
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,280
Do you realize this normally doesn't happen?

376
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,680
It's complicated.

377
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,960
Do not justify your violence!

378
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,120
Please take care of him for me.

379
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,160
I'm not coming home tonight.

380
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,760
I'm staying overnight at Nan's house.

381
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,800
Look at what happened.

382
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,000
He still won't even come home.

383
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,560
P'Itt.

384
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,520
Are you mad at P'Day?

385
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,160
No.

386
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,880
Do you feel disappointed?

387
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,480
Do you feel like giving up? It's been several months.

388
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,720
He still can't remember a thing.

389
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,800
What if it's not Day, but it's Night? Would you give up?

390
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,680
For me,

391
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,560
I'm not giving up.

392
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,840
I'm just tired.

393
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,040
I just want to live a simple life with him.

394
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,600
It's unfortunate.

395
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:20,040
I was robbed of my time and memories.

396
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,120
I wasted all this time

397
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,000
on fighting.

398
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,320
I have no idea what's the next step.

399
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,880
Sometimes, he'd the old Day.

400
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,960
Sometimes,

401
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,840
he's a complete stranger.

402
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,560
If you feel tired,

403
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,280
how about running away?

404
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,040
Running away?

405
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,000
From what?

406
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,120
Do you remember that time

407
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,600
when you wanted to test if P'Day loves you

408
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,120
so you ran away?

409
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,680
Once you were gone,

410
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,000
P'Day was afraid to lose you.

411
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,800
He followed his heart

412
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,840
to follow you.

413
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,800
What if he doesn't?

414
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,920
Then leave him!

415
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,280
If he knows where his heart is,

416
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,560
he'll try to get you back.

417
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,040
Where's Itt?

418
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,320
I asked a question!

419
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,040
Not home.

420
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,680
So where is he?

421
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,920
How am I supposed to know? I'm not his boyfriend.

422
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,680
He said...

423
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,160
he wanted to take a break.

424
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,160
So, he's getting tired

425
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,040
of taking care of someone like me.

426
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,960
That's why he ran away.

427
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,640
He's not getting tired of you.

428
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,840
Just look at what you did to him.

429
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,640
You insult him.

430
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,800
You dump water on his head.

431
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,480
This time, you hit him.

432
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,040
Screw you!

433
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,160
Itt is indeed your boyfriend,

434
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,760
but he's also my friend.

435
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,880
I asked you,

436
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,800
"Where is Itt?"

437
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,640
Find that out yourself.

438
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Where is Itt?

439
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,040
If you can't think of where he is,
you're not worthy of seeing him.

440
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,240
- Argh!
- Screw you!

441
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,720
P'Itt, are you afraid of me?

442
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,800
- No.
- That's good to hear.

443
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,760
I'm not going to do anything even though I want to.

444
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,920
Ugh!

445
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:38,600
P'Itt is now at an important site of memory for both of you.

446
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,080
A memory of you both.
