1
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,613
What can you even do?

2
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,574
You can't even cook.

3
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,827
Your shirt says, "naughty boyfriend."
Are you naughty to me?

4
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,037
I guess just a bit.

5
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,082
I got you a get-well gift.

6
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,418
I'm sorry I didn't visit you at the hospital.

7
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,086
Don't trouble yourself.

8
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,921
I wouldn't know...

9
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,424
who you were anyway.

10
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,134
Day, what are you doing?

11
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,262
- What's with you and the guy named Meen?
- I said we're friends!

12
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,889
And what are we?

13
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,015
A couple.

14
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,766
If you feel uneasy being with me,

15
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,145
just get lost.

16
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,651
Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!

17
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:16,326
Yeah!

18
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,912
- Nice drink!
- Yeah!

19
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,207
Woo! Woo! Woo!

20
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,750
Let's go! Yeah!

21
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,793
Woo!

22
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,296
Woohoo! Woo!

23
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,842
Thank you, everyone.

24
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:37,931
Welcome to Day's Cast-Off Party!

25
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,435
Woo!

26
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,645
Thank you so much, everyone.

27
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,104
Where's his cast?

28
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,023
Give me his cast!

29
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,234
Give me that!

30
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,362
Almost dropped it!

31
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,821
Let's do this again.

32
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:58,618
Welcome again to Day's Cast-Off Party!

33
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,374
Since it's his Cast-Off Party,

34
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:08,670
our theme today is Taking Off!

35
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:12,131
- Yeah!
- If you haven't taken anything off, look at your friends

36
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:15,176
and take their garments off!

37
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,887
Take it all off!

38
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:26,145
So, if you're still wearing a shirt, take it off!

39
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,939
Let's go!

40
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,816
You there! Take it off.

41
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:34,070
Wait, don't people normally sign on a cast?

42
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,780
Right, give me a moment, everyone.

43
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,365
I'll have these guys sign the cast.

44
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,200
Take it away!

45
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,868
Yeah!

46
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,496
Sign it and leave some space for me too!

47
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:46,749
Everyone, this party couldn't have come to life...

48
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,334
So, now that everyone has taken something off,

49
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,877
I can't let you all be cold.

50
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:55,508
I'll have these five on stage take off their shirts too!

51
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,179
Let's start with the first.

52
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:04,892
- So, to start things off, take it off!
- Yeah!

53
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:09,272
Three, two, one!

54
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,482
Woo!

55
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,489
I guess I'm taking my scarf off.

56
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,783
Okay! Keep that for me!

57
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,244
Make some noise to see those two up there
take off their jackets!

58
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,373
Whoa!

59
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,292
Has anybody seen Itt?

60
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,877
Itt! My friend!

61
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:34,338
He's over there. Everyone, make him some noise!

62
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,513
He's looking great today!

63
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,932
- It's rare seeing you like this.
- You look nice!

64
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,227
Our special guest.

65
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,355
I guess I'm coming down now.

66
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,233
Everyone, let's go and party!

67
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,445
Yeah!

68
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,364
Go, go, go!

69
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,203
You're late.

70
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:08,122
- Better than never.
- Let's celebrate! Yeah!

71
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,917
- Cheers!
- Woo!

72
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,672
- I'm tipsy.
- Are you?

73
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,049
I don't know what being drunk is.

74
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,468
Hey!

75
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,887
- Why are you so weak?
- You tell him!

76
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,348
- You tell him!
- Why so?

77
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,266
- That's too much!
- It's once in a while!

78
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,061
Why? I don't do this too often.

79
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:32,271
This is the Cast-Off Party.

80
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,899
If they aren't taking my shirt off, do you want me to do that myself?

81
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,734
Stop it. Stop acting naughty.

82
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:38,819
If not me, would you do it?

83
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,697
Fine. I'll take something off mine.

84
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,367
Hey! Hey! Hey!

85
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:46,285
He really took it off!

86
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:51,040
What about down there?

87
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,833
- That's enough.
- Hahaha.

88
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,253
Okay! Nill took his jacket off.

89
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,004
Who's next?

90
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,423
Hey, Night.

91
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,342
Do I have to?

92
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:04,053
- Of course! Everyone's doing it.
- Night doesn't have to.

93
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,430
I'll take something off instead of him. Two pieces.

94
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,099
Hey!

95
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,434
- You want to get started?
- What are you taking off?

96
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,311
Let's see!

97
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,146
I'm doing it. I'm a man of my word.

98
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,690
- Stand up to your words.
- I do!

99
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:18,109
- One more!
- Take it off!

100
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,403
- What about one more?
- Upper piece?

101
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:22,154
Why not something down there?

102
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,073
- That's enough.
- I prefer an upper piece.

103
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:28,119
Yeah!

104
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,745
- You'll get cold.
- I took something off.

105
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,497
- You'll get cold.
- What about you, you, and you?

106
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,582
What? I already took off my scarf!

107
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,252
Itt hasn't taken anything off.

108
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,337
Hm?

109
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,673
Itt, you dressed so well.

110
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:43,926
Day's going to be on high alert tonight.

111
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,972
I mean your mind is going to be bright.
Why give me that look?

112
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,517
Fine, I'm not mentioning that anymore.
He looks pissed.

113
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:55,771
I don't think having Itt take things off himself will be fun.

114
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,939
Day.

115
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,067
Decide what to take off from Itt.

116
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,902
Nick! You!

117
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,863
Take it off. Take it off!

118
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,574
Take it off! Take it off! Take it off!

119
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:09,201
Take it off! Take it off! Take it off!

120
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,328
Here he comes!

121
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,581
Whoa!

122
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,627
Whoa!

123
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,464
They're really doing it!

124
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,508
What about the button?

125
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,594
How about his zippers?

126
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,763
- Hey!
- Huh?

127
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:31,474
That's it?

128
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,852
Whoa!

129
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,146
This is my party.

130
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:39,607
Don't think you could be so charming to everyone.

131
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:41,901
Nan!

132
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:45,237
You have to stand out by taking something off!

133
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,575
I'm taking something off with my special guest.

134
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,078
What? Nice bracelets, though.

135
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:55,831
What does it read? Nan and... What?

136
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,041
That's my guest.

137
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:32,117
There.

138
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,329
I took something off. He took something off. Fits the theme nicely.

139
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,171
What is this?

140
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:47,091
Why are you still with Nan?

141
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:49,051
You dare to ask?

142
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:51,971
Guess who made me stuck here.

143
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:54,181
Guess who made me do this.

144
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,434
I thought we were done.

145
00:07:57,893 --> 00:07:59,478
Day said Nan let you go free.

146
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,729
Of course.

147
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,107
He then dragged me back.

148
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,568
These people won't ever let me go free.

149
00:08:06,193 --> 00:08:08,988
They did this as revenge for you!

150
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,114
Nan.

151
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,491
Day told you to let him go.

152
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,410
You even said you wouldn't do anything to him.

153
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:16,078
Itt, please.

154
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:17,871
I know what I'm doing.

155
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:19,915
Haven't you deleted that video?

156
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,417
The video you threatened him with?

157
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,419
Why do you care?

158
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:27,464
This is the time to laugh at him rather than to forgive.

159
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,883
If we couldn't forgive others,

160
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:35,431
all the horrible things we did to each other would've landed us in jail.

161
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:38,809
What do you mean by us? I'm not in this.

162
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,938
And me?

163
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,733
You left me to rot. Are you happy now?

164
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,068
Are you happy now?

165
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,828
Day!

166
00:08:57,911 --> 00:08:59,621
Argh!

167
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:00,998
Didn't I tell you?

168
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,834
You can only look at Itt being with Day.

169
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:06,879
You are not to mess with them again.

170
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,841
Itt!

171
00:09:10,924 --> 00:09:12,384
You must help me.

172
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,011
Help? Help what?

173
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:16,347
You were throwing tantrums at him, and now you're asking him for help?

174
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,598
(Muffled)

175
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:19,558
(Muffled)

176
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:22,519
- I want to go home, Itt!
- What's so bad with my house?

177
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:26,774
You wanted to race, I let you use my racetrack.

178
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,527
What do you want from me?

179
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:31,904
- Let's go!
- Itt!

180
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:33,864
- You dared mess with him?
- This is because of you!

181
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:36,533
Itt! You're getting me out of this!

182
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:42,372
Let's continue partying.

183
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:43,999
Trust me, everything is fine.

184
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,834
You're seeing things!

185
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,087
Let's drink some more beer.

186
00:09:48,128 --> 00:09:51,006
Everyone, everything is fine. Let's party!

187
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,549
Let's party!

188
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:53,967
DJ, play music!

189
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:56,011
Let's party! Everything's cool.

190
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:01,225
Who's that guy with Nan?

191
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:08,482
Did you mean Mac?

192
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:11,276
Do you know him?

193
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,823
He's an old friend from high school.

194
00:10:17,574 --> 00:10:19,326
We didn't like each other.

195
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,788
What's up with him and Nan?

196
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,623
And with me too.

197
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,962
He was having a problem with me, and Nan helped.

198
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,172
What is this problem?

199
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,969
It's something, but that's the past.

200
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,681
It looks like an unfinished business.

201
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,101
It's kind of.

202
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:47,604
Am I a part of this?

203
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,150
He looked at me like he wanted a fight.

204
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:56,446
Well, you're my boyfriend

205
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,532
and Nan's boss.

206
00:10:58,615 --> 00:11:00,576
- Correct.
- Right?

207
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:02,286
That's right.

208
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,079
That's right.

209
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:05,497
Is that everything?

210
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,584
That's really it.

211
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:11,587
Hey, you don't need to mind them.

212
00:11:11,628 --> 00:11:15,757
This party everyone organized for you is to make you happy. Is that right, everyone?

213
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,718
- Right, Nick?
- Exactly.

214
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:20,887
- You don't see Itt in this attire often.
- Yeah.

215
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:24,808
We all try to make your days the best.

216
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:29,229
- See? I hired these models and DJ for a hefty price!
- Wait, wait.

217
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,858
- What?
- I think you did that for yourself.

218
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:36,320
What are you talking about? I have no idea.

219
00:11:36,903 --> 00:11:38,905
- What's for me?
- Don't lie to me.

220
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,658
I love the music. I'm going to the front.

221
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,119
- Wait! Nick!
- Yeah!

222
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:47,789
Thank you. We meet again.

223
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,084
He's quick.

224
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,088
I never thought a guy like you would be played like that.

225
00:11:58,258 --> 00:12:01,261
I understand him.

226
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:05,057
He's a son of a mistress.

227
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,101
That's why he wants people to love and care about him a lot.

228
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:10,312
That's why he likes to make me jealous.

229
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,066
Don't think too hard about it.

230
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:15,901
Yeah, let's have a toast.

231
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:18,445
Come, let's go.

232
00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:20,906
Bottoms up.

233
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,033
- Bottoms up.
- Go.

234
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:24,242
Itt.

235
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:26,828
How about a smile?

236
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,831
- Smile?
- Yeah.

237
00:14:10,348 --> 00:14:13,643
Are we sleeping in this room?

238
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:15,103
Yeah.

239
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:17,606
I guess you're tired.

240
00:14:17,647 --> 00:14:19,441
Go take a shower.

241
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:21,401
I'll prepare your medication.

242
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,243
Ouch!

243
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:36,207
Let me help.

244
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,156
Give me a second. I'll get you a towel.

245
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:37,560
Can you stand up?

246
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,200
I can.

247
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:15,056
Day,

248
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:20,687
do you see me as a lover or a property?

249
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,744
Day, I want to have cake from P'Nam's bakery.

250
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:44,789
Day, do you know what day today is?

251
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:47,458
I'm not feeling well.

252
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:49,293
Please come back to take care of me.

253
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,629
I feel so lonely.

254
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:53,923
You need to come back and tell me what to do.

255
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:55,383
It's been so many days.

256
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,927
It's so lonely.

257
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:02,890
Argh!

258
00:19:04,642 --> 00:19:05,852
Day!

259
00:19:05,893 --> 00:19:07,395
What happened?

260
00:19:07,478 --> 00:19:09,564
- A headache.
- I'll grab the pills.

261
00:19:09,605 --> 00:19:11,524
- Ugh!
- Aw!

262
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:13,317
Be careful!

263
00:19:24,036 --> 00:19:26,581
Day, come take your medicine.

264
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:35,339
Where did the headache come from?

265
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,900
Forget it.

266
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,000
(One year ago)

267
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:08,748
Itt! Why are you always mad at me?

268
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,091
Salmon.

269
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:23,638
Uncle Itt is made at uncle Day. What do I do?

270
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:24,805
Kiss.

271
00:20:26,807 --> 00:20:28,976
Why kiss?

272
00:20:29,018 --> 00:20:32,313
When mom is mad at dad,

273
00:20:32,396 --> 00:20:34,482
dad will kiss mom.

274
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:36,317
What's that?

275
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,195
And your mom is mad at your dad,

276
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:41,822
your dad will...

277
00:20:47,536 --> 00:20:50,206
If uncle Itt isn't mad, give back a kiss.

278
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:51,582
Huh?

279
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:03,970
What if uncle Itt is still mad?

280
00:21:04,053 --> 00:21:05,638
What do I do?

281
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,683
Uncle Day keeps kissing him.

282
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:13,312
Ahem.

283
00:21:15,523 --> 00:21:17,566
What? Huh?

284
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:19,902
Day.

285
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:21,779
Salmon! Salmon!

286
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:24,532
Salmon! Salmon!

287
00:21:24,573 --> 00:21:27,702
Salmon! Help me! Salmon! Salmon!

288
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:40,965
Here's breakfast.

289
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:48,514
- Served hot.
- Thank you.

290
00:21:52,101 --> 00:21:53,352
Who is Salmon?

291
00:22:00,568 --> 00:22:02,987
Can't you remember your nephew too?

292
00:22:06,365 --> 00:22:07,700
That's my nephew.

293
00:22:09,618 --> 00:22:11,620
He's in America.

294
00:22:11,704 --> 00:22:14,039
He used to come to Thailand and stay with us.

295
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:18,085
You are very close to him.

296
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:23,549
You always video call each other.

297
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:25,843
P'Day, please talk to your nephew sometimes.

298
00:22:31,348 --> 00:22:32,850
Let's eat.

299
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:35,644
I know you can't remember him,

300
00:22:35,728 --> 00:22:38,689
but can you please pretend like you do for him?

301
00:22:43,652 --> 00:22:46,113
You're very important to my nephew.

302
00:23:07,426 --> 00:23:08,886
Hey.

303
00:23:08,969 --> 00:23:12,598
Uncle Day never calls me. I'm mad at you!

304
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:16,143
Uh...

305
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:17,853
I was busy.

306
00:23:17,895 --> 00:23:22,233
I miss uncle Day and uncle Itt a whole lot.

307
00:23:22,274 --> 00:23:24,193
Where's uncle Itt?

308
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,199
I wanted you to talk to uncle Day first.

309
00:23:30,282 --> 00:23:32,117
I thought you missed him.

310
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:36,789
Uncle Day, do you remember what we are going to see?

311
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,793
Alpaca.

312
00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:43,921
Oh, right.

313
00:23:44,004 --> 00:23:45,130
Alpacas.

314
00:23:45,172 --> 00:23:47,299
Alpaca! Yeah!

315
00:23:47,383 --> 00:23:50,928
Uncle Day, Uncle Itt. I drew you something.

316
00:23:54,014 --> 00:23:55,432
Ow!

317
00:23:55,516 --> 00:23:56,976
Salmon!

318
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:58,602
Do not help him.

319
00:24:04,441 --> 00:24:06,443
It hurts.

320
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:08,320
Who did that to you?

321
00:24:08,404 --> 00:24:12,032
You ran, you fell, and you hurt yourself.

322
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:15,494
Day,

323
00:24:15,577 --> 00:24:17,454
don't be hard on him.

324
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:19,039
Salmon,

325
00:24:20,582 --> 00:24:22,376
can't you get up by yourself?

326
00:24:22,459 --> 00:24:24,253
Do you always need help?

327
00:24:25,212 --> 00:24:26,630
I can.

328
00:24:33,012 --> 00:24:34,596
Very good.

329
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,765
What were you going to show me?

330
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:38,475
Huh?

331
00:24:38,517 --> 00:24:42,771
This is uncle Day. This is uncle Itt. This is me.

332
00:24:56,618 --> 00:24:58,078
Bye-bye.

333
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:08,464
Thank you for talking to Salmon.

334
00:25:17,347 --> 00:25:18,766
Salmon!

335
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:20,184
Uncle Day!

336
00:25:21,935 --> 00:25:23,687
Aah!

337
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:26,482
Aw.

338
00:25:26,523 --> 00:25:27,941
Salmon!

339
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,112
Are you alright?

340
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:37,117
Let's get inside.

341
00:25:55,969 --> 00:25:57,930
- Pee-pee.
- Hm?

342
00:25:58,013 --> 00:25:59,306
Pee-pee.

343
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:00,849
You want to pee?

344
00:26:03,393 --> 00:26:05,771
Okay, let's go. I'll go with you.

345
00:26:07,272 --> 00:26:09,525
Be quiet, okay?

346
00:26:14,821 --> 00:26:16,490
Slow down, slow down.

347
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:44,393
Uncle Itt and uncle Day, please don't forget me.

348
00:26:47,271 --> 00:26:49,064
We're not going to.

349
00:26:49,147 --> 00:26:50,899
We promise

350
00:26:51,441 --> 00:26:53,694
that we'll not forget you.

351
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:56,738
We're looking forward to seeing you back in Thailand.

352
00:27:00,993 --> 00:27:02,703
Let's go.

353
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,668
I'll come back, please don't forget me.

354
00:27:17,426 --> 00:27:18,510
Bye-bye.

355
00:27:18,552 --> 00:27:20,721
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

356
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:46,371
- Ugh!
- Day!

357
00:27:46,413 --> 00:27:47,539
Day!

358
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:51,501
You have had several headaches today.

359
00:27:52,085 --> 00:27:56,006
Please don't race today. Let's go to the doctor.

360
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:58,884
What's with all the fuss?

361
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:01,136
I'm not going to the doctor.

362
00:28:01,219 --> 00:28:03,680
I agreed to meet Nan today.

363
00:28:10,604 --> 00:28:12,230
Day.

364
00:28:38,632 --> 00:28:39,800
Boss.

365
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:42,803
You can use my racing car.

366
00:28:54,731 --> 00:28:57,776
Don't mind him. Let's race.

367
00:29:01,112 --> 00:29:02,447
Day.

368
00:29:03,365 --> 00:29:05,200
Go sit with your friends

369
00:29:05,283 --> 00:29:07,911
- and stay where you sit.
- Oh.

370
00:29:07,953 --> 00:29:11,540
What do you want him to do if he needs to go to the toilet?

371
00:29:11,581 --> 00:29:14,584
Hey, shorty. Don't piss him off.

372
00:29:14,584 --> 00:29:16,253
Isn't that right?

373
00:29:17,045 --> 00:29:18,463
Day.

374
00:29:18,547 --> 00:29:19,840
Please?

375
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:21,675
Don't race.

376
00:29:21,758 --> 00:29:24,177
Please, Day.

377
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:27,013
Day, I'm coming with you.

378
00:30:07,304 --> 00:30:09,598
Hey! Itt! Itt!

379
00:30:09,681 --> 00:30:11,016
What happened?

380
00:30:11,057 --> 00:30:12,309
I think he fainted.

381
00:30:12,392 --> 00:30:15,061
Take him to the office.

382
00:30:15,145 --> 00:30:17,731
- Go help him.
- Can you get up?

383
00:30:17,814 --> 00:30:19,107
Alright?

384
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:22,193
Slowly.

385
00:30:22,277 --> 00:30:23,737
- Day.
- Careful.

386
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:25,780
Day?

387
00:30:25,822 --> 00:30:28,033
- Ugh.
- There.

388
00:30:28,116 --> 00:30:31,202
I feel you. It's very hot today.

389
00:31:15,497 --> 00:31:17,290
Hello.

390
00:31:17,373 --> 00:31:19,250
Hello, Itt.

391
00:31:19,334 --> 00:31:20,877
Can you hear me?

392
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,754
He's sleeping.

393
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:24,631
What's your business?

394
00:31:24,714 --> 00:31:26,966
Uh, is this P'Day?

395
00:31:27,008 --> 00:31:29,302
Yes, it's me.

396
00:31:29,385 --> 00:31:31,888
What business do you have with him?

397
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,015
You can talk to me.

398
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:35,558
Uh...

399
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,105
I was going to ask about your condition and if it got better.

400
00:31:40,146 --> 00:31:41,731
I'm fine.

401
00:31:41,815 --> 00:31:43,399
You don't need to ask.

402
00:31:43,983 --> 00:31:45,944
I don't need a visitor.

403
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:23,982
Get up!

404
00:32:25,316 --> 00:32:28,611
How long are you going to sleep? Hey!

405
00:32:32,323 --> 00:32:34,075
What is it?

406
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,121
What do you need?

407
00:32:39,163 --> 00:32:42,000
Wash your face. It's late in the evening.

408
00:32:45,545 --> 00:32:47,005
Oh,

409
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,924
your other boyfriend called.

410
00:32:51,593 --> 00:32:53,511
What are you talking about?

411
00:32:53,595 --> 00:32:55,471
Ball and I are friends.

412
00:32:55,513 --> 00:32:58,933
How many times do I have to tell you? Why don't you listen?

413
00:32:59,017 --> 00:33:01,853
You also said that Mac is your friend,

414
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:05,064
but he nearly molested you.

415
00:33:05,148 --> 00:33:07,275
Darn Nan.

416
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:09,360
Why are you hiding this from me?

417
00:33:10,028 --> 00:33:13,615
Or maybe you started to like him?

418
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,204
Is this how you want to view it?

419
00:33:20,288 --> 00:33:21,789
I wouldn't talk about it again if so.

420
00:33:21,873 --> 00:33:24,876
I asked you why you are hiding this from me?

421
00:33:26,044 --> 00:33:28,379
How many times have you been hiding this?

422
00:33:28,421 --> 00:33:32,091
What you want now is to not stop Nan

423
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:35,178
and have Nan keep hurting Mac.
Is that what you want?

424
00:33:36,262 --> 00:33:37,889
So, you care about him?

425
00:33:38,473 --> 00:33:42,935
If you could remember, I wouldn't have to answer all these stupid questions, right?

426
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:44,854
I don't care.

427
00:33:44,896 --> 00:33:48,858
- I never wanted to remember them.
- What about me?

428
00:33:49,942 --> 00:33:52,820
Do you remember anything about me?

429
00:33:52,862 --> 00:33:56,115
Then make yourself memorable.

430
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:59,744
How? What do I do?

431
00:33:59,786 --> 00:34:02,205
Am I not good enough at taking care of you?

432
00:34:02,288 --> 00:34:04,499
Am I not good enough for you?

433
00:34:04,582 --> 00:34:07,543
Am I too worthless for you to remember?

434
00:34:07,585 --> 00:34:08,920
Huh?

435
00:34:19,931 --> 00:34:21,891
What is up with you again now?

436
00:34:23,434 --> 00:34:25,353
Why do you care?

437
00:34:28,106 --> 00:34:30,775
I'm not worth remembering anyway.

438
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:35,696
If you want me to remember you,

439
00:34:36,322 --> 00:34:38,950
make me feel it,

440
00:34:40,451 --> 00:34:43,162
feel your worth to me.

441
00:35:06,978 --> 00:35:09,188
Mr. Itthipol.

442
00:35:10,982 --> 00:35:12,024
Hm?

443
00:35:13,526 --> 00:35:17,321
You don't look too good. Are you okay?

444
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:20,199
I'm good.

445
00:35:20,908 --> 00:35:21,993
Oh.

446
00:35:23,077 --> 00:35:26,289
I guess I woke up too late in the evening.

447
00:35:26,372 --> 00:35:28,082
That's what made me feel sick.

448
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:30,710
Huh? What are you on about?

449
00:35:30,793 --> 00:35:32,587
Hey! Wait!

450
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,671
Chill out.

451
00:35:33,713 --> 00:35:36,424
Balance yourself. Be careful.

452
00:35:36,507 --> 00:35:38,593
Hey, your temperature...

453
00:35:38,926 --> 00:35:40,761
You have a fever!

454
00:35:41,345 --> 00:35:43,055
Turn to this side.

455
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:44,724
Coughing and fever?

456
00:35:44,765 --> 00:35:46,934
According to what I've studied,

457
00:35:46,976 --> 00:35:49,979
I think I can diagnose you.

458
00:35:50,021 --> 00:35:53,274
you're likely just sick.

459
00:35:55,526 --> 00:35:57,153
Do you want to go home?

460
00:35:57,612 --> 00:35:59,572
Of course.

461
00:35:59,655 --> 00:36:02,825
What about Day?

462
00:36:03,492 --> 00:36:05,536
You're in pretty bad shape.

463
00:36:31,896 --> 00:36:34,899
Hey! Itt! Itt! Itt!

464
00:36:35,441 --> 00:36:37,109
Are you good?

465
00:36:38,819 --> 00:36:40,780
Hey!

466
00:36:51,248 --> 00:36:54,627
Why are you looking at me like that?

467
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:58,839
I wasn't going to hurt him, I was going to help.

468
00:36:58,881 --> 00:37:00,925
Did I say anything?

469
00:37:02,802 --> 00:37:04,970
I'm fine, Day.

470
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,390
Itt.

471
00:37:07,431 --> 00:37:10,184
- What happened to you?
- He's sick.

472
00:37:10,226 --> 00:37:12,645
He just had a fever.

473
00:37:19,026 --> 00:37:22,822
You can stay here if you want to, but I'm taking Itt home.

474
00:37:24,031 --> 00:37:27,076
Let's go. Get up. Careful.

475
00:37:42,007 --> 00:37:44,760
You do know that he loves you, right?

476
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:47,555
Why does he love someone terrible like me?

477
00:37:48,681 --> 00:37:52,101
Why? Just knowing that he loves you isn't enough?

478
00:37:52,184 --> 00:37:56,188
I just want to know how long he can put up with me.

479
00:37:56,856 --> 00:37:59,066
I'm not the old Day.

480
00:38:00,985 --> 00:38:04,488
You need to slow down.

481
00:38:05,072 --> 00:38:08,242
Is it the weather? The fever is getting worse.

482
00:38:08,325 --> 00:38:10,619
Is this a menstrual fever?

483
00:38:10,703 --> 00:38:12,121
Are you on your period?

484
00:38:12,204 --> 00:38:14,582
Hey!

485
00:38:15,207 --> 00:38:17,793
Is this because of the car?

486
00:38:18,544 --> 00:38:20,754
You're afraid of taxis.

487
00:38:23,966 --> 00:38:26,051
Why are you afraid of taxis?

488
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:29,138
Nothing. It's just a joke.

489
00:38:32,808 --> 00:38:34,768
- Argh!
- Boss, what's up?

490
00:38:34,852 --> 00:38:37,229
- Augh.
- Are you having a headache?

491
00:38:40,649 --> 00:38:41,901
Mild headache.

492
00:38:45,029 --> 00:38:47,740
Don't mind it. I'll get going.

493
00:38:53,996 --> 00:38:55,289
Itt,

494
00:38:55,372 --> 00:38:57,708
call me if you've got any problem.

495
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,251
Nan.

496
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:01,170
Except for problems with him.

497
00:39:08,052 --> 00:39:11,013
I hope you know what you're doing.

498
00:39:14,224 --> 00:39:15,976
Take care of yourself first.

499
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,938
Get in the car. Get to the doctor.

500
00:39:19,396 --> 00:39:22,524
- I know!
- Let's go. Fasten your seatbelt!

501
00:39:22,566 --> 00:39:25,277
- Of course, sure.
- Do it!

502
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:26,570
I'm like his mom.

503
00:39:26,654 --> 00:39:29,782
And you! Take good care of my friend

504
00:39:29,865 --> 00:39:32,368
and not just vice versa.

505
00:39:32,785 --> 00:39:35,120
- That's enough.
- What a burden.

506
00:39:51,261 --> 00:39:52,471
Itt.

507
00:39:53,055 --> 00:39:54,390
Wake up.

508
00:39:55,432 --> 00:39:58,310
You can't sleep in that outfit.

509
00:40:00,729 --> 00:40:04,108
Sorry, I fell asleep.

510
00:40:04,191 --> 00:40:06,276
I'll go take a shower.

511
00:40:06,652 --> 00:40:08,195
No.

512
00:40:08,696 --> 00:40:10,114
You're sick.

513
00:40:11,073 --> 00:40:13,534
I'll take a warm shower.

514
00:40:13,575 --> 00:40:15,619
No!

515
00:40:17,913 --> 00:40:20,207
Take your medicine.

516
00:40:44,022 --> 00:40:45,733
Get a rest.

517
00:40:45,816 --> 00:40:47,735
I'll wipe you with a towel.

518
00:41:17,055 --> 00:41:19,016
Day.

519
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:22,060
Day.

520
00:41:53,842 --> 00:41:55,594
Where did loving me so much get you?

521
00:41:55,636 --> 00:41:58,722
I love you so much, just like you do.

522
00:41:58,805 --> 00:42:02,017
I'm so terrible to you, and you still love me?

523
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:06,063
Orange cake? Day? You remember?

524
00:42:10,692 --> 00:42:14,238
Everything will go back to normal if you can remember.

525
00:42:14,321 --> 00:42:16,615
What if that never happens?

526
00:42:16,657 --> 00:42:18,575
- Whoa!
- Day!

527
00:42:18,617 --> 00:42:20,786
Day!

528
00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:23,288
I'll make you love me again.
