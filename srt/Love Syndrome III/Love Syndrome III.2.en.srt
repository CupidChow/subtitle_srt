1
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,792
He promised to take me out to eat some cake today

2
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:36,501
but he is still sitting here.

3
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:37,876
Day...

4
00:00:46,292 --> 00:00:49,125
I help you get a robber but why you are upset with me?

5
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:50,667
But don't you forget to yourself.

6
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,083
What's going on if you fail?

7
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:54,292
If you don't go back,

8
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:55,375
there's no need to come back again!

9
00:00:55,918 --> 00:00:56,417
Ok,

10
00:00:57,209 --> 00:00:58,000
I'll go back soon.

11
00:01:09,042 --> 00:01:09,792
Hello.

12
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:11,501
We are Raweepol's cousin.

13
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:12,709
Raweepol's cousin.

14
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,042
Wait a second.

15
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:16,459
(Sobbed)

16
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:18,959
Yes.

17
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:21,667
Itt.

18
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:23,918
Itt.

19
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:25,792
Stand back.

20
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:27,292
Wake up.

21
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:29,751
Wake up Itt.

22
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:30,876
I want all of you to stand back.

23
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:36,125
Mom.

24
00:01:37,334 --> 00:01:38,959
I have only P'Day left in my family.

25
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:43,918
My parents all died beacuse of car accidents

26
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,709
Do I have to lose my bro because of this again?

27
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:49,709
Night.

28
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:51,334
I'm really sorry.

29
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:53,209
It's because of me...

30
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:54,834
because of me! Night.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,292
Because of Itt, why?

32
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,417
Because I rushed him back to home

33
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:03,209
so he fastly drove and became like this.

34
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:05,417
P'Itt,

35
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:11,542
we haven't known yet if this accidents
caused by he was drving so fast.

36
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:14,876
If I didn't rush him back to me,

37
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:18,209
last night he might stay at my dad at Chonburi.

38
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:20,709
It would not end up like this.

39
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:23,542
Night.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,042
I do apologize.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,167
I mess you up again.

42
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:36,459
We have alreay ended up for this.

43
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,250
Whatever we did before,

44
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:42,292
just engraved it in behind.

45
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,876
Dad and mom have frequently told me

46
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:52,083
that if I'm silly,

47
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:53,626
Day will leave me.

48
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:57,792
Day will be fine.

49
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:01,542
Is it good that we are obsessed
to think negatively about him?

50
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:03,501
Mom,

51
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,709
could you please bring me to Day?

52
00:03:07,918 --> 00:03:12,042
The patient lost a lot of blood because the body has been harshly hit.

53
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:14,250
He has a broken right arm bone

54
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:15,918
and fractured right leg.

55
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:17,834
But the most worrisome

56
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,209
is the head that has been severely smashed,

57
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:23,000
bleeded under the meninges

58
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,918
and brusied in part of his brain.

59
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:29,292
We have to put him under observation

60
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,792
and he must be placed in the ICU first.

61
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:34,209
But don't worry,
we will take care of him to the utmost.

62
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,125
Thank you so much Doctor.

63
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:07,250
Nothing much.

64
00:04:07,501 --> 00:04:08,209
Let it relax.

65
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:09,042
Are you serious?

66
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:10,584
He is in the ICU.

67
00:04:14,918 --> 00:04:15,417
Nick,

68
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:16,709
bring me to go there.

69
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,459
Why you specificlly choose me?

70
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:20,834
Cause you're my friend.

71
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,250
Gear is also your friend.

72
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:24,626
Why me? Or you know others will restain

73
00:04:24,876 --> 00:04:25,709
so you ask me instead?

74
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,709
Itt, you're sick.
ICU won't allow you to go there.

75
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,334
You can only knock the mirror.

76
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:33,792
Do you want to suck the mirror like a Sucker fish?

77
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:35,834
Just outside is fine.

78
00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:37,209
Please let me go there.

79
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:38,250
Nick.

80
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,292
Because of your word.

81
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:43,292
Let's try it again.

82
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:44,834
Itt, you're sick.

83
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:47,042
You should take care of yourself first.

84
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:49,125
After that, whe Day leaves from the ICU,

85
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:50,667
you can take care of him.

86
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:52,292
Yes.

87
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,375
Nick was right.

88
00:04:57,292 --> 00:04:58,501
I will do it by myself.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,501
Itt,

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,667
stop being indulged and listen to us.

91
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:04,876
Yeah,

92
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:08,876
it's because of me,

93
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:10,584
now Day is like this.

94
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,000
Keep walking.

95
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,375
Itt, just watch him outside.

96
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,876
You just recovered.

97
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,959
Why do you say he is better?

98
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,542
P'Day is okay right now.

99
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:53,751
Why doesn't he wake up?

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,083
And what is that tube?

101
00:05:56,584 --> 00:05:57,626
How much suffering is he undergoing?

102
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:01,209
What did he have to fight?

103
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:02,375
P'Day. He's just sleeping.

104
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,584
In a few days, he will move to a normal room.

105
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:09,959
Just a few days,

106
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,000
he will wake up.

107
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:14,918
Just a few days,

108
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:19,375
a few more days, we can go home.

109
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,834
Just a few days.

110
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:27,709
You should be patient.

111
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:38,125
Wish you get well soon.

112
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:52,042
Walk slowly.

113
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:02,667
No problem.

114
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,709
Day, he's out of the ICU.

115
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,000
He can recover quickly.

116
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:10,751
But why, he's still unconscious.

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,125
It's just a normal.

118
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:17,417
Same case with him,
some people take months to regain consciousness.

119
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:18,209
Oh...

120
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:20,959
I don't want him to be unconscious for a long time.

121
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:23,501
So, P'Arthit, how to take care of him?

122
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll take care of him.

123
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,459
Itt, he has a broken arm and leg.

124
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,959
You don't know anything about nursing.

125
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,334
I think, is it better to hire a specialty nurse?

126
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:35,918
Let the nurse take care.

127
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:38,918
Then you can learn from the nurses later.

128
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:43,834
Sure, let me do anything that I can
to take care of him.

129
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:47,167
Dr. Rueang, please do this for me.

130
00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:48,375
Yes bro.

131
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:52,667
How to clean a patient.

132
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:53,667
Wait a minute.

133
00:07:58,042 --> 00:08:01,626
The first step, his arm should be cleaned.

134
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,626
So, it should be specially careful.

135
00:08:03,626 --> 00:08:05,792
Watch out for his arms.
Because the patient had injured his arm.

136
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,125
Wipe from top to bottom.

137
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:14,918
You can flip his arms around, but be careful.

138
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:19,667
And also wipe his palm.

139
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,125
For his face,

140
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,918
we should change another cloth to wipe gently.

141
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:27,417
Ok, fine.

142
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,000
Hey! Itt, my friend.

143
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,417
I'm here...

144
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:12,667
with you now.

145
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:13,918
How are you?

146
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:16,000
You brought Neil with you.

147
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:17,209
You saw him too?

148
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:18,918
Why?

149
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:21,584
Why? When I'm away, does he have someone else?

150
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:24,334
What?

151
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:25,459
Are you paranoid with me?

152
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:29,792
Sorry to make you paranoid, because I'm very attractive.

153
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:34,959
Neil, did you visit Day?

154
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:36,709
Yes, I have visited him.

155
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,834
This is for you.

156
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,501
Oh!

157
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,584
I mean stuff for caregiver.

158
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,292
Take it for being better.

159
00:09:46,626 --> 00:09:48,959
Take it and eat!

160
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:50,709
Oh...So many.

161
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,667
Yes! To encourage you to fight with him again.

162
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:55,459
Thank you.

163
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:59,501
Your father is very kind for giving Day treatment
in a special patient room.

164
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:00,792
Awesome.

165
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:03,250
I'm very surprised

166
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:04,959
at the beginning.

167
00:10:05,918 --> 00:10:07,209
Dad didn't seem to accept him.

168
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:10,959
But now, it's like he's another son.

169
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:13,626
He helped with father's work,

170
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:15,501
not like me,

171
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:17,667
who act uselessly.

172
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,959
That's not the case.

173
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:21,876
The reason is that Day loves Itt.

174
00:10:22,876 --> 00:10:23,959
So your father accepted him,

175
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:26,709
and helped him in this accident.

176
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:29,125
Is his car at your garage?

177
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:30,751
How is the condition of the car?

178
00:10:31,918 --> 00:10:33,083
I recommend that

179
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:34,000
we don't fix that car.

180
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:35,250
It's better to buy a new car.

181
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:37,292
Nick!

182
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:41,125
What! The car was demolished.

183
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:44,501
I don't think the accident was that serious.

184
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:48,167
He had to endure the pain.

185
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,125
Don't worry.

186
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,292
Do not blame yourself.

187
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:54,167
Hey,

188
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:56,626
you look worse.

189
00:10:56,918 --> 00:10:58,042
Nun, long time no see.

190
00:10:58,709 --> 00:10:59,209
Ah... Well,

191
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:03,459
it's been a long time
since you and Day didn't go to my racetrack.

192
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:04,876
And...

193
00:11:05,918 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't have much free time these days.

194
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,209
I'm in love.

195
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:12,626
Well,

196
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:16,334
you don't have time to care about me.

197
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,250
Juniors at the race track want to visit him too.

198
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:21,959
Please! Don't let them come here.

199
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:23,792
It will cause trouble in the hospital.

200
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,209
Shit!

201
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:27,375
If you're not Nile's confidant, I'll kick you in the mouth.

202
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:28,334
I kick you back to.

203
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:30,542
Hey!! Stop, stop.

204
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:32,918
Well, Itt,

205
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:34,709
they say,

206
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:37,292
you don't have to worry

207
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:39,709
because there is their leader, Iron Bone.

208
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:44,459
I give it to you,

209
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:45,250
I saw you like it.

210
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:49,209
Cake?

211
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,400
(2 years ago)

212
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:08,667
Itt,

213
00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:10,167
wake up.

214
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:11,876
I want you to wake up.

215
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:14,667
Will you wake up by yourself or will I kick you?

216
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,209
Why don't you let me take?

217
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,209
I told you already.

218
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,209
Don't be out of sight.

219
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,501
Where are you going?

220
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:28,375
Who are you going with?

221
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,459
My head hurt.

222
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,792
I was tired and I wanted to go home soon.

223
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:34,501
You came pick me up late.

224
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:36,834
I couldn't wait anymore
so I had a friend send me over.

225
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,000
I made you wait

226
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:40,209
and you just had to wait.

227
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:42,125
I'm not your prisoner.

228
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:45,292
Day, how good is it that I'm willing to be with you?

229
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:46,918
Release me. I'm hurt.

230
00:12:54,626 --> 00:12:56,417
The food in the refrigerator, have you eaten yet?

231
00:12:58,209 --> 00:12:59,083
Not yet.

232
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:00,459
I haven't touched anything.

233
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:02,083
Don't pick a fight with me.

234
00:13:02,876 --> 00:13:03,459
Why not?

235
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:05,584
I didn't show it to play?

236
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,375
Watch it in the fridge!

237
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:22,334
Cake.

238
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:24,334
Did you buy it for me?

239
00:13:25,334 --> 00:13:25,876
For a dog.

240
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:27,584
Do you have a dog?

241
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Just use mirror, you will see.

242
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:31,834
You think I'm a dog, don't you?

243
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:32,751
Eat or not?

244
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:34,709
Eat.

245
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:36,709
I'll eat it all now.

246
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:37,751
Are you crazy?

247
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:39,125
4 large cup cakes.

248
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:41,375
Where did you get hungry from?

249
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:43,375
Hold this.

250
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:58,709
Um...

251
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:05,709
Very good.

252
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:10,209
You eat.

253
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,375
I want to eat cake now.

254
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,209
I want it now.

255
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:20,501
Itt, don't mess with me.

256
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,167
Can you not be a big deal with me?

257
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:25,083
You say I'm a big deal, right?

258
00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:28,292
Are you out of your mind, angry with me for the cake?

259
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,751
Do you think it's about the cake?

260
00:14:31,334 --> 00:14:33,834
The problem is that you don't keep your word.

261
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:39,751
Why...

262
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:41,834
What's wrong?

263
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:44,375
Nun.

264
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,292
Why don't you consult us first?

265
00:14:47,918 --> 00:14:49,042
This is cake!

266
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,667
Itt ordered Day to buy cake
until the car got into an accident.

267
00:14:56,501 --> 00:14:57,959
Why did you come again?

268
00:14:58,709 --> 00:14:59,250
Nick,

269
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:01,292
that's too much.

270
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,501
Wasn't he hospitalized
because the driver cut his face?

271
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:09,959
You take out the cake!

272
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:11,751
It's okay,

273
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,250
I can get it.

274
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,334
Oh...

275
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:21,792
I think don't eat it then. This cake is not delicious.

276
00:15:23,584 --> 00:15:24,459
I can take it.

277
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:25,542
Don't eat at all.

278
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,584
Itt, don't blame yourself.

279
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:33,083
You're not the part of his car accident.

280
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:36,250
Enough.

281
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:38,125
What, did we do something wrong?

282
00:15:38,626 --> 00:15:39,250
Enough.

283
00:15:41,334 --> 00:15:44,334
(3 days later)

284
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:45,042
Day,

285
00:15:45,918 --> 00:15:46,600
I'm lonely.

286
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I haven't heard you blame me for days.

287
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:51,083
I'm lonely.

288
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:57,334
When will you wake up

289
00:15:57,626 --> 00:15:59,250
After this, I'll take care of you.

290
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,834
If you don't wake up,

291
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:07,417
I'm secretly looking for Meen, secretly meeting Ball.

292
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,083
Please wake up, my jealous boy.

293
00:16:18,876 --> 00:16:19,375
Day,

294
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:21,292
you've heard me?

295
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:22,334
Day!

296
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:25,834
You wake up Day?

297
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:27,834
Day.

298
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:28,542
Day.

299
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:29,375
You wake up Day.

300
00:16:30,751 --> 00:16:31,250
Ah... I see.

301
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:34,542
Who are you?

302
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:36,250
Day,

303
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:40,709
are you kidding me?

304
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,709
Am I a joke to you?

305
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:44,167
Day,

306
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:47,876
don't tease me like that.

307
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:49,542
Day,

308
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,125
you don't love me?

309
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:52,626
Love what?

310
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:53,626
Who the hell are you?

311
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:55,542
Day!

312
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,501
Answer me or any punch?

313
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:04,542
I'm Itt, your lover.

314
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,751
What jerk lover?!

315
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:11,000
Day,

316
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:12,751
I'm sorry.

317
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:16,501
You're still angry at
which I have done to you, right?

318
00:17:25,918 --> 00:17:26,709
Day!

319
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:28,709
Ah...

320
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:30,375
I see.

321
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:32,959
This wound is because of you,

322
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:35,000
then take it back.

323
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:37,959
Day,

324
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:38,584
Ouch...

325
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:39,792
What are you doing?

326
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:41,501
Day.

327
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:41,501
Day.

328
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:45,083
Day!

329
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:46,751
What's wrong with you?

330
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,334
Ouch...

331
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:49,542
Day.

332
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:52,959
Day.

333
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:57,501
Ouch...

334
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:00,918
Day.

335
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:02,918
Are you crazy?

336
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,626
We used to promise that
you will become a new version.

337
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:10,751
You can't back to the last one.

338
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,626
I don't like it.

339
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:12,959
What the hell are you!?

340
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,042
I am who I am for long time.

341
00:18:18,584 --> 00:18:19,209
Day!

342
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:21,584
Darn!

343
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:27,792
Day.

344
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:31,334
Day, what are you doing?

345
00:18:31,334 --> 00:18:31,834
Day,

346
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:32,334
Ouch...

347
00:18:33,918 --> 00:18:34,584
Ouch...

348
00:18:35,876 --> 00:18:36,667
Day.

349
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:37,459
Day.

350
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:42,292
What is going on?

351
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:43,751
Don't come to me.

352
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:46,042
What's going on?

353
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,417
What happened?

354
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:51,334
Dad, Mom.

355
00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:53,584
Day.

356
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:54,626
Dad?

357
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:57,876
Mom?

358
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:09,042
Day.

359
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:16,250
My parents have already died.

360
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:17,042
Mom.

361
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:19,250
Who are you?

362
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:23,042
We're your dad and mom.

363
00:19:24,584 --> 00:19:25,417
Day.

364
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:27,959
This is dad and mom.

365
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,667
My dad is also your boss.

366
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:35,250
What?!

367
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,125
My boss is Mr.Kamol.

368
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:43,709
Did you remember Kamol?

369
00:19:43,709 --> 00:19:45,459
Then why you can't remember me?

370
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:47,918
Day, this is your family.

371
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:49,083
Are you fool?

372
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:51,000
My family is only Night.

373
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:52,626
I have only one brother.

374
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:55,042
Night.

375
00:19:55,876 --> 00:19:56,751
Night.

376
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:58,292
Night.

377
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,000
P'Day,

378
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,042
are you alright?

379
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:10,667
When you wake up?

380
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:12,334
Night,

381
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:13,417
who are them?

382
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,542
This is P'Itt

383
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:21,918
your lover.

384
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:25,667
Lover what?

385
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,459
I don't know who he is.

386
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,000
And this is dad and mom,

387
00:20:32,209 --> 00:20:33,000
P'Itt parents.

388
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:36,876
No.

389
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:37,876
No.

390
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:40,250
No, no, no...

391
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:40,959
Clam down P'Day.

392
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:41,542
No...

393
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:45,834
No P'Day.

394
00:20:46,918 --> 00:20:47,876
Because of you!

395
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:49,751
You made me like this!

396
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:52,417
Let's see.

397
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,209
Are you Ok?

398
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:54,709
I went to see Dr. Rueang.

399
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,709
Stop! Where are you going?

400
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,167
Let me go.

401
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:00,459
Let me go.

402
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:01,125
P'Day...

403
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:02,125
Day...

404
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:02,709
Night.

405
00:21:02,918 --> 00:21:03,501
Let me go.

406
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,000
Night...

407
00:21:06,209 --> 00:21:08,292
Don't touch my brother.

408
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:12,626
P'Day...

409
00:21:18,334 --> 00:21:19,209
Do you remember your name?

410
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:20,834
My name is Day,

411
00:21:21,334 --> 00:21:22,417
Raweepol Tharapiwat.

412
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:25,334
Do you remember the guy near to you?

413
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:28,459
Night, he is my brother.

414
00:21:29,626 --> 00:21:31,834
What is the capital city of Thailand in English?

415
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,709
Bangkok.

416
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:39,292
Could you please take the nib off from this pen?

417
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,918
Please watch this.
Do I completely arrange these picture?

418
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:09,918
I can't remember at all.

419
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:13,751
This is Itt's graduated ceremony in last year.

420
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:14,792
Is that him?

421
00:22:22,459 --> 00:22:26,375
And this is P'Day, P'Itt and Salmon, his Itt neice.

422
00:22:29,918 --> 00:22:30,834
Do you remember?

423
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,834
P'Day, P'Itt and Salmon,

424
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:34,709
his Itt neice.

425
00:22:36,501 --> 00:22:39,292
No, I don't.

426
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:42,167
Why is there still a picture of him?

427
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:51,125
I can't remember.

428
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,250
England picture in the last 3 years.

429
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:06,667
Yeah! I remembered.

430
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:08,667
The fist day I opened the barber.

431
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:14,542
So, who is your first customer?

432
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:16,250
It's Night.

433
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:19,709
Correct.

434
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:27,459
I remembered. Night was 17 years old.

435
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:30,626
We celebrated your birthday together.

436
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:35,751
Glad that you don't forget all.

437
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:41,375
So, how old are you?

438
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:47,918
Now, I'm 21 years old.

439
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:49,751
Huh!

440
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:00,083
After diagnosis,

441
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,292
Day has the Retograde Amnisia sympthom.

442
00:24:04,751 --> 00:24:11,959
His memories have been lost in the past 3 years.

443
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:15,000
All the memories are gone.

444
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:18,501
P'Day still remembers that I was in grade 12.

445
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:22,250
That means he hasn't met you yet.

446
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
But it's lucky because he lost a few parts of his memories.

447
00:24:31,626 --> 00:24:33,542
Although it's a short period,

448
00:24:35,334 --> 00:24:37,584
it's a time of us together.

449
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:39,250
It's not like that.

450
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:42,501
The Retograde Amnisia

451
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:46,000
can stimulate or recall memories back again.

452
00:24:46,542 --> 00:24:48,959
So, what we can do to help him?

453
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:52,792
It's probably hard

454
00:24:53,751 --> 00:24:57,042
because his brain has been affected enough.

455
00:24:57,751 --> 00:25:01,042
It takes time and follow-up-on continuous treatment

456
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:06,000
You have to take him into a familiar place with important people

457
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:08,792
to stimulate his memories back again.

458
00:25:09,292 --> 00:25:09,959
So, what about you, Itt?

459
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:14,042
I will take it.

460
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:17,542
I will help him to recall his memories.

461
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:21,125
But he is different before he met you.

462
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:28,292
I think we should go home
and let Night take care of him first.

463
00:25:29,792 --> 00:25:31,083
I will do it

464
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,501
although he can't remember me.

465
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:36,709
Day has been looking after me for a long time.

466
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:40,501
Let me help him instead.

467
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:50,709
Fighting together bro,

468
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,709
dad and mom.

469
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:55,542
Whatever you want.

470
00:25:56,334 --> 00:25:57,083
Fighting!

471
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:00,000
3 years ago so,

472
00:26:01,792 --> 00:26:03,334
it means before our story happened, doesn't it?

473
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:06,334
Yes,

474
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:10,459
it's before Nice found evil senior like us.

475
00:26:11,626 --> 00:26:15,167
Before I poisoned you to do that with Night.

476
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:18,834
That's clear.

477
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,542
If he reminds that time
but forgets that we have forgiven each other.

478
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:23,918
Itt, you and me,

479
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:25,292
will die here.

480
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:28,959
By the way, since he forgot it.

481
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:31,083
I think we shouldn't let him recall it.

482
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:32,292
Gear, what are you talking?

483
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:33,167
Ouch!

484
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,292
because we want to forget
what we've badly done to you, right?

485
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:42,167
Or do you think it is a romantic story, Itt?

486
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:44,209
Yes,

487
00:26:48,042 --> 00:26:50,250
I don't think it is a romatic story at all.

488
00:26:51,292 --> 00:26:53,334
It's hard.

489
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:58,751
It's where we get some hurt

490
00:26:59,209 --> 00:27:01,209
and can't fully say to anyone

491
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:05,125
that we are happy like other couples.

492
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:07,709
He jusr recalls a few parts, doesn't he?

493
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:08,792
Gear.

494
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:10,667
This way is only in a cartoon.

495
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:14,459
But at least,

496
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,375
if he remembers,

497
00:27:17,542 --> 00:27:19,375
hopefully he remembers all of them.

498
00:27:21,626 --> 00:27:24,000
He will know after what we've been through these,

499
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,209
we love each other so much.

500
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:28,417
And I really want him know

501
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:31,667
that he is my best lover

502
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:33,501
as much as he can.

503
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:39,751
But I really want all of you to understand P'Day.

504
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:43,626
The last 3 years,

505
00:27:45,334 --> 00:27:46,459
he worked for Mr. Kamol.

506
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:49,000
During the 3 years, he worked as a mafia, didn't he?

507
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:50,959
And it's also the time

508
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:55,834
he has no romantic love for anyone.

509
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:13,209
Day,

510
00:28:14,501 --> 00:28:15,292
Have you waken up?

511
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,918
Where is my brother?

512
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:26,083
Night is studying in university.

513
00:28:26,334 --> 00:28:27,375
He will back in the evening.

514
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:28,792
Ah...

515
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,167
Night is in 4th year of university

516
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:34,584
because you've paid tuition fee for your brother.

517
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,250
Do you want some water?

518
00:28:51,292 --> 00:28:52,667
Are you my lover?

519
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:02,083
Yes,

520
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:04,042
I am your lover,

521
00:29:04,918 --> 00:29:05,542
boyfriend,

522
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:07,167
couple,

523
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:08,584
partner,

524
00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:10,334
and whatever you want to call.

525
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:15,209
You didn't have amnesia in the 80's.

526
00:29:15,709 --> 00:29:18,626
You see our timeline and that proves
we really love each other, doesn't it?

527
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:19,501
I knew,

528
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:20,918
I'm not an idiot.

529
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:23,792
But I still don't know

530
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,167
what you're good at?

531
00:29:28,584 --> 00:29:29,709
Why I picked you?

532
00:29:36,334 --> 00:29:37,626
You figure it by yourself.

533
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:41,501
If I can figure it out,

534
00:29:41,501 --> 00:29:42,334
why do I ask you?

535
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:43,959
Stupid question.

536
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:50,876
Water, where is the tube?

537
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:53,375
(Breathed)

538
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:02,125
So, how did you and I meet?

539
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,167
It's no evidence in timeline.

540
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:19,501
We've met because of Night,

541
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:21,709
my best friend and your brother's boyfriend.

542
00:30:26,709 --> 00:30:27,792
My brother has a boyfriend, really?

543
00:30:30,792 --> 00:30:32,000
How do I let my brother have a boyfriend?

544
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:39,542
Night is Gear's friend...

545
00:30:41,501 --> 00:30:42,876
That's why Night is familier with Gear.

546
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:45,667
What's next?

547
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:51,417
(Knock)

548
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,709
Lunch menu ready to serve.

549
00:30:54,709 --> 00:30:55,209
Day,

550
00:30:55,501 --> 00:30:57,417
you have a lunch first.

551
00:30:57,584 --> 00:30:58,334
I'll take it.

552
00:31:28,876 --> 00:31:29,626
Yummy?

553
00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:38,918
Day,

554
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:41,375
are you hurt?

555
00:31:43,209 --> 00:31:44,751
Day, are you ok?

556
00:31:45,709 --> 00:31:46,709
Just choke.

557
00:31:48,584 --> 00:31:49,959
Let me call the doctor?

558
00:31:50,792 --> 00:31:51,751
I just told you I'm choked,

559
00:31:53,459 --> 00:31:54,209
so don't overacting.

560
00:31:55,292 --> 00:31:56,000
Ah...

561
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:59,959
Don't make your face like painful to me instead.

562
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:01,667
It's annoyed.

563
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,334
Day,

564
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,667
I feel what you feel.

565
00:32:06,918 --> 00:32:08,042
You call that butt in?

566
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:09,000
Darn.

567
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,459
Don't raise your voice to me.

568
00:32:11,792 --> 00:32:13,167
Why I can't raise my voice on you?

569
00:32:13,792 --> 00:32:15,626
I've always raised my voice to you before.

570
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:18,667
I don't know how we were dealing.

571
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,834
But for now, don't do that again.

572
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:21,667
I hate it.

573
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:30,334
Why you're crying?

574
00:32:31,501 --> 00:32:32,334
Who's died?

575
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:35,501
I'm not crying.

576
00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:38,209
You think I'm silly,

577
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:40,542
that I can't see you are crying?

578
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,918
You saw me cry. How do you feel?

579
00:32:46,501 --> 00:32:47,667
What do you want me to feel

580
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:49,959
because you cry by yourself.

581
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:51,209
Yes!

582
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,459
I cry for myself...

583
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:53,459
You...

584
00:32:53,792 --> 00:32:54,542
(Knock)

585
00:33:00,626 --> 00:33:03,083
What happened?

586
00:33:12,209 --> 00:33:15,751
Take good care of yourself.

587
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,292
Memories,

588
00:33:17,501 --> 00:33:18,792
will get back to you.

589
00:33:19,334 --> 00:33:21,417
And what about you, Itt?

590
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:25,000
Or do you want me to hire more nurses?

591
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:27,250
It's fine. I can handle it.

592
00:33:27,876 --> 00:33:29,709
If you can't, just tell me.

593
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:31,626
Yes, mom.

594
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:32,667
Shall we go?

595
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:34,083
Let's talk with the doctor.

596
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,501
Goodbye son.

597
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:39,375
Bye.

598
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:48,125
Take care.

599
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:52,250
Take care.

600
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:11,334
You've been grown up like a spoiled child.

601
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:13,876
Yes.

602
00:34:14,042 --> 00:34:17,334
So, why don't you drop your tear
while your parents were here?

603
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,709
And why don't you rage with me
while my parent were here?

604
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:30,000
By the way, thanks.

605
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:49,292
Don't want to talk to me.

606
00:34:50,709 --> 00:34:51,792
I thought I live with a rubber doll.

607
00:34:56,292 --> 00:34:57,501
What do you want me to say?

608
00:34:58,375 --> 00:34:59,209
About me, like...

609
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:02,542
who to flirt with another before.

610
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:04,959
You or me?

611
00:35:07,709 --> 00:35:08,209
You...

612
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:12,125
Is it me?

613
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:15,459
By the way you already did it.

614
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:21,792
Day,

615
00:35:23,709 --> 00:35:26,000
don't think too much. You will have a headache.

616
00:35:29,209 --> 00:35:32,918
Sometime I'd think that should I try to remember for all

617
00:35:34,876 --> 00:35:38,167
or let it go?

618
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:39,375
What do you mean?

619
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:42,125
Even you still don't want to talk about it.

620
00:35:43,751 --> 00:35:45,334
Is it important for me to remember?

621
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:06,959
What's wrong?

622
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,626
I ask you what's wrong?

623
00:36:15,209 --> 00:36:17,125
Why you're crying all the time?

624
00:36:20,459 --> 00:36:21,792
P'Day, clam down.

625
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:23,751
Day,

626
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,250
I'm hurt.

627
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,959
Bro, I can wipe you instead.

628
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:28,542
No.

629
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:32,292
He told me he's my lover.

630
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:34,876
He must do it for me.

631
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,042
If you want him to do it,

632
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:40,417
tell him gently.

633
00:36:41,292 --> 00:36:42,667
You act like a normal!

634
00:36:43,876 --> 00:36:44,501
Who are you?

635
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:46,959
He's my friend.

636
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:50,792
That's ok.

637
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,959
I will handle it.

638
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:57,959
Just wipe.

639
00:37:04,709 --> 00:37:05,876
Night, shall you go?

640
00:37:47,209 --> 00:37:47,751
Softly!

641
00:37:48,626 --> 00:37:49,542
I'm sorry.

642
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:22,209
Wipe it.

643
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:23,834
What are you looking for?

644
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:24,876
Yes I'm wiping.

645
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:56,042
Don't you think to wipe...

646
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:03,167
Under my elbow?

647
00:39:06,167 --> 00:39:07,375
It's all clean.

648
00:39:07,876 --> 00:39:08,375
Really?

649
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:12,083
There's a part that you haven't wiped.

650
00:39:17,709 --> 00:39:19,334
You are my lover, right?

651
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:27,667
But you act like a stranger
who has no sex experience.

652
00:39:31,709 --> 00:39:34,083
Because you don't know me...

653
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:40,375
Ok, I will wipe it.

654
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:48,083
Why my brother left me with a stranger?

655
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:50,959
I'm not a stranger.

656
00:40:51,209 --> 00:40:54,292
Guys whom I can't remember are all strangers.

657
00:41:06,209 --> 00:41:07,417
Why you don't turn off the light?

658
00:41:09,876 --> 00:41:10,667
Ah..

659
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:13,626
Whenever you want at night

660
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:16,667
how can I hurry to find you?

661
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:45,626
Hey.

662
00:41:56,542 --> 00:41:57,250
Mr. Kamol?

663
00:42:02,792 --> 00:42:04,751
You've tried your best.

664
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,209
But if I've tried my best,

665
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:09,125
Day should remember everything.

666
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:10,709
If I can give him more,

667
00:42:11,459 --> 00:42:13,083
he shouldn't be painful like this.

668
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:14,876
Hello Itt.

669
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:17,083
Ball, on time.

670
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:19,751
Oh! You brought a lot.

671
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:21,501
You told me you and Ball have nothing special.

672
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:22,209
Why do you invite him here?

673
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:23,751
If I do not invite him here,

674
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,501
you will be suspicious of me and Ball.

675
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,459
He's just a good guy.

676
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,626
Day,

677
00:42:33,292 --> 00:42:34,501
Put your hand down to me.

678
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:37,834
I...
