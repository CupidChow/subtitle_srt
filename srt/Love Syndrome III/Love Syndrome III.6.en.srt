1
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,864
Why are you still with Nan?

2
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:33,241
Guess who made me stuck here.

3
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,326
Guess who made me do this.

4
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:39,164
Are we sleeping in this room?

5
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,916
- Ugh! Ugh.
- Day! Day!

6
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,543
You have had several headaches today.

7
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,254
Please don't race today. Let's go to the doctor.

8
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,840
If you want me to remember you,

9
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:52,010
make me feel it.

10
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,460
I'll make you believe that I am yours only.

11
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,462
I've never done this with anyone.

12
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,883
You will be my first and my last.

13
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,742
Itt.

14
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,035
Wake up.

15
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,246
Night made you porridge.

16
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,123
Come have breakfast

17
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,125
so you can take your medicine.

18
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,846
Day.

19
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,266
Can you please feed me?

20
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,478
Don't you have a hand?

21
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,275
Fine.

22
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,042
Alright, fine.

23
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,544
I'll do it.

24
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,146
You took care of me before when I was recovering.

25
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,484
I can eat by myself.

26
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,987
Don't be picky.

27
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,739
Just do what I tell you.

28
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:29,083
I'm sick right now,
you need to come and take care of me!

29
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,836
Didn't you say you'll always be there for me?

30
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,566
During all the time we've been together,

31
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:57,820
you always care for me when I fall sick.

32
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,990
I want to see you.

33
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,534
Day, please.

34
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,918
What the hell is wrong with you?

35
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,962
Why did you start crying out of nowhere?

36
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,464
Why are you crying?

37
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,384
Nothing.

38
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,972
God!

39
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,976
Night will complain again about how I'm being too hard on you!

40
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,812
Hurry up.

41
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,064
You need to take your medicine.

42
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,644
Day.

43
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,522
Please put a mattress over there for tonight.

44
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,150
Why?

45
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,403
I'll sleep over there tonight.

46
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,572
I don't want you to get sick because of me.

47
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,492
We slept together last night.

48
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,162
Does it look like I'm sick?

49
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:36,502
Just take your medicine and rest.

50
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,381
I want you to stop babbling.

51
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,437
Aw.

52
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,773
Where's Day?

53
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,151
Asking about him as you're waking up?

54
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,569
What happened to “Hello”?

55
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,196
- What?
- Duh.

56
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,993
P'Day isn't home.

57
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,871
Where did he go?

58
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,331
He went out with Nill.

59
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:41,252
No idea where they went. I'm not that nosey.

60
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,796
Is that so?

61
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:49,343
- P'Itt, please have some porridge.
- But I just ate.

62
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,513
You slept for a long time. It's evening now.

63
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,140
Just eat.

64
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,226
You need to move sometimes, or you might get bedsores.

65
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,853
Can I not eat?

66
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,522
- I'm still...
- You have to eat.

67
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,401
You need to have your meal before you can take your medicine.

68
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,824
Speaking of the devil. Why don't you feed him?

69
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,536
It's alright. He can eat by himself.

70
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,789
Yeah, Night.

71
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,083
I can take care of myself.

72
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,607
Eat more.

73
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,153
I can't.

74
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,533
If you want him to eat more, then feed him yourself!

75
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,202
Go! Jeez!

76
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,002
Eat more.

77
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,129
Don't you want to recover?

78
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,174
I can't swallow any more food.

79
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,471
Nill.

80
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,849
Bring it in.

81
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,609
Orange cake?

82
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,487
Day bought this for you.

83
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,538
Take it out.

84
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,789
Baa.

85
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,543
Stop joking around.

86
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,679
Day? You remember?

87
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,855
I don't.

88
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,774
Then why did you buy it?

89
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,528
Just because.

90
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,949
- But...
- If it's too much of an issue for you, don't eat it.

91
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,703
Are you going to eat your cake? I'll happily take it.

92
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,413
Hey!

93
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,000
Let me feed you.

94
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,093
It's so good!

95
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,768
Are you eating or crying? Make up your mind!

96
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,314
- You gotta watch your mouth!
- Hey, hey, hey!

97
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,733
Night, is there anything for us in the kitchen?

98
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,276
I'm not going! I'm having this cake here!

99
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:56,447
- Go.
- Give me that orange cake! Argh!

100
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,323
More.

101
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,413
More. Quickly.

102
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,708
Alright, fine.

103
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,587
Hmm.

104
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,124
Hey, hey, hey!

105
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,001
Get up and sit straight.

106
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,211
You're going to get heartburn.

107
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,020
Hey!

108
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,583
What are you looking at me for?

109
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,259
I don't want you to drive a race car.

110
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,307
How about we make a deal?

111
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,978
You need to stop eating orange cakes.

112
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,608
Sure!

113
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:42,029
Despite it being my most favorite thing in the world, I'll do it.

114
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,576
Why?

115
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,788
You love me that bad?

116
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,457
Yes.

117
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,501
I love you so much

118
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,170
just like how you love me.

119
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:08,013
But I'm being so terrible to you.

120
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,642
And you still love me?

121
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,731
It's only because you can't remember.

122
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:22,403
Everything will go back to normal if you can remember.

123
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,950
And...

124
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,622
what if that never happens?

125
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,549
I'll make you love me again.

126
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,521
Quite a confidence you have there.

127
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:20,210
I learned from Nick that you're sick. I was quite worried.

128
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,841
This shorty.

129
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,350
Nick was overly dramatic. Don't worry too much.

130
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,560
It is my pleasure.

131
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,187
Oh,

132
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:41,106
I bought you some sore throat lozenges.

133
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,816
Thank you.

134
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,618
Day.

135
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:58,874
Don't you know that these tablets contain antibiotics?

136
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,170
Uh.

137
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,221
It's going to cause drug resistance.

138
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,979
I wasn't aware of this.

139
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:25,526
Don't think too hard about it. Thank you anyway for your gift.

140
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,947
Don't worry. It's my pleasure.

141
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,366
We're friends.

142
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,580
I noticed that P'Day just had his cast removed.

143
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,374
How's your condition?

144
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,001
Fine.

145
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:50,676
He has to occasionally move his arms and legs since he hasn't moved them for so long.

146
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:55,180
I guess he still has limb weakness?

147
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,474
No,

148
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:01,228
I could beat someone up pretty easily right now.

149
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,814
Day.

150
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,738
Ugh.

151
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,533
It's time for Itt to take his medicine and rest.

152
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:19,163
You can just go home.

153
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,712
Night.

154
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,173
Have you seen Itt?

155
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,651
Why are you out here? Have you recovered?

156
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,779
I'm fine.

157
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,448
You once told me yourself to water these plants every day.

158
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,705
Since I lost my memory, you don't need to anymore.

159
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:50,504
I can't bother to take care of you if you fall sick again.

160
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:59,847
I heard people say how I never let you do anything.

161
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:05,769
There were only a few things you allowed me to do.

162
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,231
I watered the plants every morning.

163
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,567
I sometimes helped you wash our car.

164
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:17,322
We drove to work at my dad's repair shop.

165
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,159
Once we arrived,

166
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:23,036
you took care of all the papers.

167
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,498
And I helped with the mechanical jobs.

168
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,834
At lunchtime,

169
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,879
we sometimes had food made by my mom.

170
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,923
If not, we ate out somewhere.

171
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,971
But actually, you preferred to cook for me.

172
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,892
You went grocery shopping and cooked yourself.

173
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,477
I just waited for the food.

174
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,649
If we didn't go to my dad's repair shop

175
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,195
and you didn't take me anywhere,

176
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,697
we'd stayed home watching movies.

177
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:04,786
If not, we would go to your barbershop at Kanchanaburi.

178
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,378
That was how we spent our lives every day.

179
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,925
We repeated it over and over,

180
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,762
but I was so happy

181
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:27,184
to spend all my time with you.

182
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:33,190
No matter how repetitive it is,

183
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,317
I'll do it again

184
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,697
if it's you.

185
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,161
Right now,

186
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,083
I miss those moments so much.

187
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,256
When...

188
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,346
When can we go back to that life?

189
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,378
Jeez!

190
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,006
What's with your driving?

191
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,800
It normally takes me two hours to drive from Bangkok to Kanchanaburi,

192
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,095
but it took you over four hours?

193
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,775
Day, let me help.

194
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,610
You just had your cast removed.

195
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,031
I'm good. Didn't you just get well yourself?

196
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,575
- Nah.
- N'Day! N'Itt!

197
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:13,081
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

198
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,710
Do you know how much I miss you two?

199
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:23,091
This place isn't just the same without you two!

200
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,635
And look at you two coming here without a heads-up.

201
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:29,514
That calls for a celebration! Hahaha!

202
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,224
Let's have a Thai barbecue!

203
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:35,312
Kids! We're having a Thai barbecue today!

204
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,189
Don't rush home today

205
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,482
and close early.

206
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:42,110
We're going to need to for some grilling!

207
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,995
Would that be alright with you?

208
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,209
I haven't said anything.

209
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,629
I'll go to the market with you.

210
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,255
Huh!

211
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,758
You're coming to the market with us?

212
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,552
That is A-OK!

213
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,097
I'll put the luggage inside.

214
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,516
Of course, make yourself at home.

215
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,018
Same old room, cleaned and ready,

216
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,271
waiting for you two!

217
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,204
Hello?

218
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,873
Hello.

219
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,503
Hello?

220
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,716
Is this a scam phone call?

221
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,811
Itt!

222
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:04,693
When selecting shrimps, you must pick translucent and large ones with their head and tail intact.

223
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,028
Don't you even know this?

224
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,283
I told you that you were the one doing this every time.

225
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:14,077
You never let me deal with cooking.

226
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,123
Forget it.

227
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,375
Since the memory is lost,

228
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:24,421
I'll have you start doing things on your own.

229
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,423
What if I die one day?

230
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:29,551
- Are you going to starve to death?
- Stop saying that.

231
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:33,013
I'm not letting you go anywhere. You stay with me!

232
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,556
What is wrong with you?

233
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,892
- You...
- What?

234
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:40,395
If you're not going to do anything, wait in the car.

235
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,066
Hey, there.

236
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,153
Be nice to each other, you two.

237
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,489
Speak softly.

238
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:11,551
Despite him hating me, viewing me as a burden, or wanting to leave me,

239
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,929
he shouldn't have mentioned his death.

240
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,889
Itt,

241
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:20,227
you don't need to follow along with every single word he says.

242
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:24,439
What he was trying to tell you was that...

243
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:29,277
he wanted you to be able to take care of yourself

244
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:33,198
- when he's no more.
- That's another one that said this.

245
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,283
Huff.

246
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:39,663
Everyone wants to take care of their loved one,

247
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:44,125
but life is filled with uncertainties.

248
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,212
You must be prepared.

249
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,966
If Day's gone one day,

250
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:54,678
you need to continue living by yourself

251
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,681
and be the best at it too.

252
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:02,477
Isn't that love?

253
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,439
I know that he cares

254
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,483
and I know that he can't remember,

255
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,570
but he shouldn't have said something like that.

256
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:16,283
His words take a large toll on my mind.

257
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,828
I have been extremely patient.

258
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,747
I almost couldn't bear this anymore.

259
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:26,418
I know. I understand

260
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:30,297
that you've been very patient.

261
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:36,970
However, your patience must be accompanied by understanding.

262
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,973
Once you get through these hard days,

263
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:44,311
everything will become moments to cherish

264
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,856
for both you and Day.

265
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,149
Okay?

266
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:55,989
Hm?

267
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,920
K'Itt? It's really you.

268
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,631
Are you well?

269
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,637
Uh.

270
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,222
Can you remember me?

271
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,725
I'm Korn. We met at the snooker club.

272
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:27,145
I helped you when you were having trouble with those teens.

273
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,356
Oh, right.

274
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,735
Uh.

275
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,280
We haven't met for a long time.

276
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,867
I never thought our encounter would be this convenient.

277
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,161
Yeah.

278
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,165
I'm thinking of going to the snooker club today.

279
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,751
Would you be interested?

280
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,900
No.

281
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,549
And I heard that...

282
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,551
K'Day owns a barbershop?

283
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,844
Where is it?

284
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,639
I really need to get a new cut.

285
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:06,017
I'd like a cool new cut. Will I be able to get that from K'Day?

286
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,269
It's at the bus terminal.

287
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,649
- It's called DNN.
- DNN?

288
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,569
It's a little hot out today.

289
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,863
I know a coffee shop nearby.

290
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:22,158
They have nice coffee and cakes.

291
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,286
Would you like to go? Everything is on me.

292
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,956
It's alright.

293
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,834
I know how to treat my boyfriend right.

294
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,337
Aw!

295
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:38,591
So nice of you!

296
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:47,934
Then I guess it was nice meeting you today. I'll go to your barbershop later today

297
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,936
for the cut.

298
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:53,189
- I'll see you.
- Hehehe.

299
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,125
You two only met once,

300
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,461
but talked like you've known each other for ages?

301
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,671
Hm.

302
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,715
We've got a jealous guy on our hands.

303
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,926
What are you two talking about?

304
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,931
Are you jealous?

305
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:31,102
You're always good at taking your own side.

306
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,856
Is it bad that I am?

307
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,984
It's not,

308
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,861
but don't let it get to your head.

309
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,698
Hand me vegetables, I'll wash them.

310
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,828
Not bad, but don't let it get to my head?

311
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,247
What is that supposed to mean?

312
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:57,378
Are you saying I can take my own side but not too often?

313
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,757
Make a guess.

314
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,261
What he meant was...

315
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,723
don't make him feel jealous too often.

316
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,104
J'Bel?

317
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:20,068
You're giving me a fierce look again.

318
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,487
I'm scared.

319
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,281
- Hey!
- Hm?

320
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:28,827
We have another apron. Put it on.

321
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,225
What can you even do?

322
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,529
Cut onions and tomatoes for me.

323
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,907
- I'll make the spicy salad.
- Sure.

324
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,809
What's wrong?

325
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,269
- It burns my eyes.
- Hey!

326
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,104
- Don't rub it.
- Huh?

327
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,731
You're going to make it worse.

328
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,191
Let me see.

329
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:51,284
- Hey, hey, hey! Don't.
- Huh?

330
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:55,330
Why? We aren't married.

331
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,875
Is it going to be like that?

332
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,943
- Whoa!
- Day!

333
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,237
Day? Are you getting a headache?

334
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,740
Do you need your medicine? Day?

335
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,283
No!

336
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,369
I'll just take a break.

337
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,128
Wow!

338
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,090
I'll let you have a bit for our taste test.

339
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,342
Just one?

340
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,552
It's a taste test.

341
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,429
More than a bite would be eating.

342
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,979
Delicious.

343
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,064
This one looks just as appetizing.

344
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,528
This one isn't bad.

345
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,616
Can I smell it?

346
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,493
What was that?

347
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,619
Can I smell it?

348
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,330
Okay...

349
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,541
Stay here.

350
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,088
Sweet and sour chicken,

351
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,175
clear soup with seaweed,

352
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,515
and mackerel in dried red curry.

353
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,559
What are these?

354
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,895
- They're in my head.
- Day!

355
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:46,983
Those are the dishes you made for me! Do you remember now?

356
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,279
- He remembers!
- You remember!

357
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,489
That's all I can remember.

358
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,159
That's good enough.

359
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,328
Yeah! Good!

360
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:06,252
- He remembers!
- Let's continue cooking.

361
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:12,008
His memories are coming back!

362
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,682
Can you please turn the chair for me?

363
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,896
Hello, K'Day and K'Itt.

364
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,151
You invited him.

365
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,155
Have I said anything?

366
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,869
Hm!

367
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:45,333
You came right to us! I'll give you my best service!

368
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:49,837
No, that's okay. I want my barber to be K'Day.

369
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,298
You can take a break.

370
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,424
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

371
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:57,011
- They only cut for...
- It's okay.

372
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,888
I'm free anyway.

373
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,223
Day!

374
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,144
Can you give him a haircut? You got away from it a long time ago.

375
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:10,149
My memory is lost, but my hands aren't.

376
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,382
How about your ears?

377
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,302
- Do you want me to keep them?
- Excuse me?

378
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,850
Well, so...

379
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:50,481
N'Day meant whether you want to keep your hair around your ears.

380
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,442
Hmm, is that right?

381
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,362
I guess I was just hearing things.

382
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,990
I've been hearing a bunch of nonsense lately.

383
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,868
- Sure.
- I need to see a doctor.

384
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:08,166
If you don't like them, then I'll remove them!

385
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,086
This is your customer!

386
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,463
Keep that in mind. It's your customer.

387
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,925
So what? It's just one customer.

388
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:25,266
Nobody will come here if you continue talking like this to your customers.

389
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:30,313
Come on! Don't stir things up!

390
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,735
Day.

391
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:42,575
Cut his head... No! Cut this customer's hair nicely, please.

392
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,578
You told me yourself

393
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:50,750
to separate work and personal matters.

394
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,502
Keep them away from each other.

395
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,134
- Okay?
- Sure.

396
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,470
I'll get this done.

397
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,557
This isn't the best service, huh? K'Itt?

398
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:10,353
How can he keep the business running, talking to customers like that?

399
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:15,858
Other customers aren't getting on our nerves.

400
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,915
Do I look good to you? K'Itt.

401
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:40,007
Anyway, thank you, K'Day.

402
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,809
Excellent service.

403
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,394
Thanks.

404
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,567
Someone like me doesn't have a whole lot of patience.

405
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:03,155
I don't care how much you're going to bad-mouth my barbershop,

406
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,575
but if you mess with my boyfriend,

407
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,830
I'm going to make your life hell.

408
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,875
Are you threatening me?

409
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,630
I'm leaving. Don't be too serious.

410
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,595
Thanks.

411
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,015
Please come again.

412
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:32,601
Goodbye. Thank you.

413
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,063
Please don't get on our nerves next time.

414
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,065
I thought we weren't going to make it.

415
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,942
Oh my.

416
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,446
God!

417
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,198
Day, you could've treated him better.

418
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,409
He's still our customer.

419
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,456
- Good thing I didn't stab his face.
- Day!

420
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,875
Hey!

421
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,794
You told me once

422
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:02,590
to separate work and personal matters!

423
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,050
And what's this?

424
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,886
You can't do this.

425
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,804
God.

426
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,264
How is this better?

427
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,600
You said he got better.

428
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,769
Day is...

429
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,979
Hello!

430
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,358
- Hello.
- Hello.

431
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,651
J'Bee!

432
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,862
Please have a seat.

433
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,824
This is our VIP customer.

434
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,118
J'Bee!

435
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,081
Hello.

436
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:39,460
Only N'Day gets to cut my hair!

437
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,595
I love it!

438
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:53,391
- Excellent as always.
- Exactly.

439
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,810
Ooh!

440
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,522
Bale, this is yours.

441
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,487
- This is Itt's.
- Thank you.

442
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,824
And this is for you, Day.

443
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,452
Let me keep that for him.

444
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,287
Standing around got you a hundred baht?

445
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,915
I had been talking for hours, and I got 20 baht?

446
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,837
Of course. Let me take you to your car.

447
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,047
- I'll get going now.
- Goodbye.

448
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,800
20 baht?

449
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,594
Of course.

450
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,556
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

451
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:36,183
Please come again.

452
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,567
Come on.

453
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,529
Let me help you.

454
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:40,122
You want to have a go?

455
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:44,710
On that day, it was so fierce!

456
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:49,632
- How many times do we do it in a week?
- Two or three?

457
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:53,636
- Be real.
- Three or four?

458
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:57,014
Love is driven by memories.

459
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,849
Nonsense!

460
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,935
Whoa!

461
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,562
Boss! Where did that come from?

462
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,484
What is wrong with you?

463
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,445
Do you want to die that badly?
