1
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,440
You want to have a go?

2
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,760
On that day, it was so fierce!

3
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,680
- How many times do we do it in a week?
- Two or three?

4
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,680
- Be real.
- Three or four?

5
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,080
Love is driven by memories.

6
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,560
Nonsense!

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,000
Whoa!

8
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,200
How long have you been holding this?

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,560
What is wrong with you?

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,960
Do you want to die that badly?

11
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,320
I've arrived.

12
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,480
How's Day?

13
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,480
He's home.

14
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,040
Once he knew you were nowhere to be found,

15
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,720
he just went ballistic.

16
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,760
He said you got tired of him for his condition and ran away.

17
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,080
Itt,

18
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,000
don't think too hard about it.

19
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,000
Day has been a blamer since forever.

20
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,760
Once he calms down,

21
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,840
he should realize where to find you.

22
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,400
I haven't picked up many of his calls.

23
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,040
Turn it off.

24
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,840
The harder it is to get in touch with you,

25
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,520
the crazier he gets.

26
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,520
That'll get him to think hard.

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,040
I'm afraid he might be stressed out by me not answering his calls.

28
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,920
Itt!

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,720
You care about him, but does he care about you?

30
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,080
This time, you'll know for sure

31
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,000
because if he can find you, then that means he cares.

32
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,960
What if he never comes?

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,960
Find a new boyfriend.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You met Ball last time.

35
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,600
I think finding a new one this time wouldn't be so hard.

36
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,400
Gear!

37
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,760
Listen.

38
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,480
If he's still the old Day,

39
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,160
he will find you.

40
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,880
Right.

41
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,400
I'll turn off my phone.

42
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,040
I'll call you if I've got anything.

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,840
Do not pick up his calls. Stay strong.

44
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,000
Stay safe there.

45
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,560
- Oh my!
- So handsome!

46
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,520
He looks Korean!

47
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,800
Wow! So handsome.

48
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,320
Look over there.

49
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,160
Hey!

50
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,920
I see fish!

51
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,480
- Where is it?
- There!

52
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,080
- You like it?
- Of course.

53
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,520
You meant the fish?

54
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,920
- Hey!
- Hm?

55
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,080
Look up.

56
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,560
- What?
- Right there.

57
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,760
What?

58
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,960
What is this?

59
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,320
Happy birthday.

60
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,560
Couple rings?

61
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,280
With our names on them?

62
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,960
Where is Itt?

63
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,480
Somewhere without a hot-tempered guy like you!

64
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,200
You think this is a joke?

65
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,320
Find that out yourself!

66
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,120
If you can't think of where he is,

67
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,280
you're not worthy of seeing him.

68
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,760
- Argh!
- Screw you! Get off of me!

69
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,960
He can never leave me!

70
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,120
You can't remember him!

71
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,480
You insult him. You hit him.

72
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,360
He doesn't need to put up with someone like you.

73
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,480
He can leave you at any moment.

74
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,840
Darn you!

75
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,320
Get off of me!

76
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,560
- Screw you!
- Get off!

77
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,680
P'Day!

78
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,320
P'Day! Enough!

79
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,120
Gear!

80
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,640
Gear!

81
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,560
Where is Itt?

82
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,320
- I'm asking you a question!
- We'll tell you!

83
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,720
Screw you, Day!

84
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,040
Were you trying to kill me?

85
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,120
Are you alright?

86
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,280
Hey.

87
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,040
What's your name?

88
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,520
I'm Itt.

89
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,840
I'm Kung.

90
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,240
This is Tal, and that is Han.

91
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,440
Did you come alone?

92
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,920
Yes.

93
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,080
Do you want to join us?

94
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,960
Yeah.

95
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,040
- Of course.
- Yeah! Nice.

96
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,240
Let's get down there. Han, you go first.

97
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,920
I need to take off my shirt.

98
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,040
Do we? Okay.

99
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,280
Be careful over there.

100
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,440
Night!

101
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,080
Where is he?

102
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,920
P'Itt is now at...

103
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,960
an important site of memory...

104
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,120
for both of you.

105
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,960
I'm not joking.

106
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,000
It's so important...

107
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,120
that I'm convinced...

108
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,280
you can remember it.

109
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,680
It's a memory of you both.

110
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,160
- Oh!
- Sorry.

111
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,600
Be careful.

112
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,160
It's slippery.

113
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,800
Han, you're seeing this?

114
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,040
Seize the opportunity, huh? Peace?

115
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,240
- I can't let him fall.
- Hm!

116
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,800
It's alright. Let's enjoy the waterfall.

117
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,600
Let's go.

118
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,880
So, it's going to be like that?

119
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,640
P'Itt is now at an important site of memory for both of you.

120
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,360
It's so important that I'm convinced you can remember it

121
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,560
It's a memory of you both.

122
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,640
We'll remember all the time we had together,

123
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,560
both good

124
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,080
and bad.

125
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,080
P'Itt, I ordered a spicy mushroom salad,

126
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,040
Kanchanaburi jungle curry, and a few grilled fish.

127
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,320
Can I borrow your container to get the food?

128
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,080
- Of course. Thank you.
- No worries.

129
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,760
Do you know how to cook?

130
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,200
No, but I'd like to.

131
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,120
- Ah-huh.
- But...

132
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,520
my family won't let me.

133
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,120
Huh? Why?

134
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,720
I burned our kitchen.

135
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,280
Sorry, it's not possible to reach the number you dialed at the moment.

136
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,720
Sorry, it's not possible to reach the number you dialed at the moment.

137
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,280
- P'Itt, would you like a jacket?
- Hey.

138
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,680
- It's okay. You'll get your jacket wet.
- It's alright.

139
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,280
- Such nice weather.
- Ah-huh

140
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,880
How about we find some activities for tomorrow?

141
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,680
Would you like to join?

142
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,680
P'Itt?

143
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,080
P'Itt?

144
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,600
P'Itt, would you like more water?

145
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,640
Oh! I'm good.

146
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,520
There is our house.

147
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,880
Seriously, read this.

148
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,160
It will be always you.

149
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,680
- What does that mean?
- It has always been you.

150
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,800
It is to be read with your heart.

151
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,880
What is this?

152
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,440
Take it.

153
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,360
It's your best friend.

154
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,040
He just killed the mood.

155
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,720
Hello?

156
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,560
Did you call to ask about Itt?

157
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,360
Yeah.

158
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,160
Can you tell me?

159
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,520
I'm not telling!

160
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,600
Night told me everything.

161
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,800
Considering everything you did to my friend, you dare to cheat your way to find him?

162
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
I was talking to Nill.

163
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,320
I'm not letting my boyfriend tell you.

164
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,520
Nill!

165
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,480
Alright.

166
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,520
Well...

167
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,800
This is not about Nick,

168
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,840
but rather more about you.

169
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,520
I want you to remember it by yourself

170
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,840
so it's better for you.

171
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,400
Sorry.

172
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,360
If you still have no clue,

173
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,440
then you're an idiot!

174
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,960
I guess I have to think of it myself?

175
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,200
Okay.

176
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,160
And for your boyfriend,

177
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,240
please kick him in the mouth for me.

178
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,640
You're going to get hurt.

179
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,840
Huh? I'm going to get hurt?

180
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,640
Sure!

181
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,440
I'll spark your memory!

182
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,280
- Bring it.
- Listen to this!

183
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,280
We'll remember all the time we had together,

184
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,400
both good

185
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,160
and bad.

186
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,200
Okay?

187
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,120
Thank you.

188
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,000
Thank you for everything.

189
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,840
And I...

190
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,600
thank you too

191
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,080
for everything.

192
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,760
Hey!

193
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,680
The waterfall?

194
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,760
Huai Mae Khamin Waterfall.

195
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,040
What?

196
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,160
Going to Huai Mae Khamin Waterfall at this time?

197
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,320
Look at the time!

198
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,800
Who's going with you?

199
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,840
I just want to borrow a car. I can drive there myself.

200
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,520
Driving by yourself at night is dangerous.

201
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,000
Gear can drive you there tomorrow.

202
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,560
We'll leave in the morning instead.

203
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,000
Let's go to bed for now.

204
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,000
Alright, fine.

205
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,440
Sure.

206
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,800
We leave at 3 A.M.

207
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,280
What? 3 A.M.?

208
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,120
Day? Are you serious?

209
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,480
It's still dark at that time!

210
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,920
Please.

211
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,600
This is for P'Itt.

212
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,560
Please?

213
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,160
Fine! 3 A.M.

214
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,760
Your brother is horrible.

215
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,360
But my Gear...

216
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,800
is adorable.

217
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,480
Did you mean it?

218
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,200
Did you?

219
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,360
- What are you doing?
- We can do this in five minutes.

220
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,600
- Five minutes what?
- It's only five minutes!

221
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,600
- Just a quicky?
- Yeah.

222
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,320
With a mood like this,

223
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,360
let's tell horror stories.

224
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,920
Good idea.

225
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,800
- I'll start.
- Let's go.

226
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,600
This is a true story.

227
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,520
My brother, who studied at one of the universities in the north, told me this.

228
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,320
He said that on every Buddhist Lent Day,

229
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,680
there will be the Red Ghost Parade.

230
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,520
What is that?

231
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,600
It's a parade for ghosts at the university.

232
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,760
They organized this parade to plead for merits from shrines in the university.

233
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,240
On the day,

234
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,720
most students will return home.

235
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,040
If it's possible for them,

236
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,280
they'll try to avoid staying at the dormitory.

237
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,800
Most will return home.

238
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,960
My brother stayed at the dormitory.

239
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,080
He didn't believe any of this.

240
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:40,920
He thought it was a story made up to play pranks on the new students,

241
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,640
the first-year students.

242
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,920
He thought nothing of it.

243
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,880
He went to bed on the day,

244
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,840
and something strange happened.

245
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,440
At midnight,

246
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,000
he heard a noise.

247
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,680
What's the noise?

248
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,880
He heard traditional Lanna music.

249
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
The old traditional music.

250
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,280
I'm getting goosebumps.

251
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,520
He heard this from far away.

252
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,400
It's as if there was an actual parade.

253
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,080
It was far away,

254
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,680
and it got closer and closer.

255
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,040
Then, he heard a knock on the door.

256
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,280
So,

257
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,800
he thought it was his roommate.

258
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,760
He shouted,

259
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,680
"Just come in! You already have the key!

260
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,600
Why do you need to knock?"

261
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,280
Then, the knocking stopped.

262
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
The bed next to him

263
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,200
flattened.

264
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,600
Yeah.

265
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,120
He thought it was his roommate lying next to him.

266
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,280
And?

267
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,880
And he said,

268
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,320
"Why did you lay next to me? Your bed is over there!

269
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,360
Go sleep on your bed!"

270
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,320
And he felt like something was coming closer

271
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,880
and closer.

272
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,200
He couldn't take it anymore

273
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,880
so he turned to the other side to tell off his roommate.

274
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,160
- He did not find his friend.
- What?

275
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,880
- Do you know who he found?
- Who?

276
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,440
A large man

277
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:50,360
chained like a prisoner.

278
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,480
His entire body was bloody.

279
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,480
And worse,

280
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,160
he didn't have a head.

281
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,360
Where is his head?

282
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,280
- Here it is!
- What are you doing?

283
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,720
- Hey, are you okay?
- Why did you do this?

284
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,560
Hey! Let's stop.

285
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,240
We're only scaring ourselves. Let's do something else.

286
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,920
- Alright, let's do something else.
- Let's eat.

287
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,440
- I'm not telling any more stories.
- Are you okay?

288
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,880
Would you like to have this?

289
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,720
P'Itt!

290
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,520
What is it, Peace?

291
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,920
Can you sleep alone tonight?

292
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,640
You didn't look too good when we were telling that horror story.

293
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,040
You saw that?

294
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,480
Do you need a friend tonight?

295
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,080
Wouldn't it be better than sleeping alone in the middle of the forest like this?

296
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,200
If you can sleep alone, then...

297
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,640
I'm leaving.

298
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,840
Wait!

299
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,200
Yeah.

300
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,880
Sleeping with a friend is better than with a ghost.

301
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,160
I'll go get my pillow and blanket.

302
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,560
Are you afraid of me?

303
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,120
No. Why would I?

304
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,640
Oh, it's because I separated us with a backpack.

305
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,880
Haven't you heard about the "Middle-Person Ghost?"

306
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,440
A ghost will come for someone in the middle.

307
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,400
That's great.

308
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,920
I'm not going to do anything even though I want to.

309
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,040
Just kidding.

310
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,560
Good night.

311
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,880
Did I make the right choice?

312
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,720
I know! I know!

313
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,880
What's with all the knocking?

314
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,840
- I'm getting dressed!
- You're late.

315
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,480
Late? We agreed on 3 A.M.

316
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,200
It is 3 A.M.

317
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,760
Look at the time.

318
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,560
I'll wait at the car.

319
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,600
If I don't see you in five minutes, I'm driving there myself.

320
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,680
What? Not even a thank you?

321
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,080
And you dared have an attitude? Drive there yourself!

322
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,080
Calm down.

323
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,280
He just wants to see P'Itt as soon as possible.

324
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,400
If it wasn't for you and Itt,

325
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,680
I wouldn't do this.

326
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,240
Let's continue to sleep, Day.

327
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,760
Sorry, I forgot to turn it off.

328
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,440
P'Itt, let's continue sleeping.

329
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,320
It's okay. I'm up.

330
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,840
Thank you for last night.

331
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,080
No worries.

332
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,320
Here's his car!

333
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,560
Slow down!

334
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,600
It's alright.

335
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,640
Let him.

336
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,080
Let's unpack.

337
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,320
Peace!

338
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,120
Take your pillow and blanket with you.

339
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,720
You will need them tonight.

340
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,800
I intend to leave them here

341
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,760
just in case you can't sleep alone tonight

342
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,800
so I can come to stay with you again.

343
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,560
Always having an angle.

344
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,120
And he left me to make his bed.

345
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,440
Hey.

346
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,320
Are you at the wrong tent?

347
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,520
No.

348
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,080
Did you see the owner of this tent?

349
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,640
His name is Itt.

350
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:17,680
Oh, you're P'Itt's friend. He's taking a shower over there.

351
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,120
Day?

352
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,040
Why did you run away?

353
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,240
This is why I ran away.

354
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,040
You can't ever be nice to me. That's why I left.

355
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,600
Day.

356
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,960
Day.

357
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,640
Day.

358
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,680
It hurts.

359
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,880
You're getting tired

360
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,240
of taking care of someone who lost memories like me.

361
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,720
I have never gotten tired of you.

362
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,240
If you can remember, you'll know why I ran away.

363
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,240
If you can remember, you'll know why I hit you.

364
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,560
You hit me because I care about you.

365
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,040
I was worried about your life, a life that isn't even mine.

366
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,160
I hit you because you were too selfless.

367
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,520
What do you think would've happened if I couldn't break?

368
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,840
Have you ever thought...

369
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,600
what would happen?

370
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,640
Day, what happened to your hand?

371
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,720
Nothing.

372
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,880
I'll ask Night. I'm sure he knows.

373
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,280
No, it's just a minor injury.

374
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,880
Don't make a fuss about it.

375
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,560
A minor injury to you

376
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,720
is a big deal to me.

377
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,240
Do you know that guy?

378
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,880
Yes.

379
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,840
They noticed that I was alone.

380
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,080
So, they invited me to join them.

381
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,440
That's all.

382
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,360
Good.

383
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,680
Back on good terms?

384
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,160
Look at you.

385
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,160
With big smiles on your faces. Have you two talked?

386
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,400
Yeah.

387
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,440
Without us waking up early and driving you here,

388
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,320
you two wouldn't have had the smiles you have right now.

389
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,840
Thank you, Gear.

390
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,680
If you want a new car stereo set,

391
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,600
bring your car to my dad's shop,

392
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,080
Free of charge!

393
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,080
What? Deal!

394
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,360
Deal! My friend!

395
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,840
- Free?
- Free.

396
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,720
- A big set!
- Okay.

397
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,320
- Let's set up our tent.
- Are you for real?

398
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,680
Set up the tent!

399
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,640
- Free of charge?
- Okay!

400
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,160
Let's swim!

401
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,960
- Let's go.
- Come here.

402
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,160
Who were you with?

403
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,560
Alone.

404
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,040
Two pillows and two blankets?

405
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,400
Whose are they?

406
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,000
Uh.

407
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,000
That dead-faced guy?

408
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,480
Don't lie to me.

409
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,760
You always find out anyway.

410
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,880
Confess.

411
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,840
They are Peace's.

412
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,920
Day!

413
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,880
Don't get mad at me.

414
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,800
Day.

415
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,840
They were telling a horror story last night

416
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,960
and you know how much I am afraid of ghosts.

417
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,360
Peace offered to stay with me for a night.

418
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,880
I figured it was fine. We're both men anyway.

419
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,120
Your boyfriend...

420
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,240
is also a man.

421
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,400
I, who sleep with you,

422
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,800
am also a man.

423
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,600
- Augh!
- P'Itt!

424
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,440
What are you two?

425
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,240
Are you alright?

426
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,360
A couple.

427
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,840
Day, what's wrong?

428
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,360
In this tent,

429
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,400
you've laid on my lap like you just did, right?

430
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,640
Hello?

431
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,640
The last time I checked, I called Itt.

432
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,920
Why did you pick up the call? Jerk.
