Don't go disappearing on me.

Didn't you say you would stay with me forever?

4

5

This is the cardiologist at the hospital I worked previously—

7

Did your boyfriend come to take you back to Tokyo?

8

Fine. You can get off work now.

- Mom, watch what you're saying.

For real? Is that why you're here?

31

If that's not it, then why is he here?

36

Have you been toying with our Nanase?

37
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:28,420
Toying with her? Our household has rotten luck with men for generations,

38
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,960
so having the dreamy son-in-law... but it was a dream after all.

He is my fated man!

45

I met him during the school trip, and he helped me to realize my calling.

46

He's very, very important to me!

- Give it a rest, and quiet down!

- Mr. Tendo, I'm terribly sorry for our rowdy family.
- No worries.

Dr. Tendo, I have a question for you.

What do you love about Nanase?

59
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,570
What kind of question is that, Big Bro?

60
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,610
Since he's here, we might as well ask.

61

- How did the relationship start?
- How did you confess to her?

He's even more handsome than rumored.

- No.

I can't have Dr. Tendo bathe in our rundown bathroom! What should we do?

You've never told me.

but she's a capable nurse now.

106

She completed her segment.

Yet, she was smiling brightly.

00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:19,840
However, my main role is to watch over the people who are dying.

165
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:28,710
Once people have given life, they are bound to die eventually.

166
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:36,950
That's why I don't give up on life, but rather accept death.

167
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:45,190
In order to do so, one must be satisfied with their way of living.

168
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,890
I’ll be there to support them, so they can die in peace.

169
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,450
Die in peace?

170
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,890
With that said, my body is frail.

171
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,120
I have no idea how much longer I can continue this.

172
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,860
Sakura.

173
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,340
Yes?

174
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,650
If you have a place to work, return there.

175
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,520
- But—
- If you want to learn something new, this ain’t the place.

176
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,560
Dr. Tendo,

177
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:29,350
please save the lives of those who wish to live.

178
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,370
I will.

179
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,160
Now, have some tea.

180
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,490
Please, come in.

181
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:04,600
W-W-What is this?

182
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,020
No need to be embarrassed, you two are a couple.

183
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,550
Mom!

184
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,550
Have a pleasant night, you two.

185
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:42,340
I'm sorry... my family's getting all worked up.

186
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,350
You have a nice family.

187
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,960
I'm glad to have met them.

188
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,800
Thank you very much.

189
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,050
To be honest,

190
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:20,220
I was incredibly lonely when I couldn't see you.

191
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,840
Back when I used to live in this town,

192
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:32,390
I thought to myself, "I want to meet the doctor", "I just want to tell him my feelings".

193
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,010
But now...

194
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,030
if I can't be by your side, I feel lonely.

195
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,990
Wait a second.

196
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:12,120
I've been feeling some sort of presence.

197
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:26,700
H-Hold on! How long have you been there?

198
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,030
When he said, "you have a nice family. I'm glad to have met them."

199
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,870
That's the very beginning! Go away, go away!

200
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:38,720
- Good night!
- Alright, alright!

201
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,890
I'm so, so sorry!

202
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:55,400
Use the bed. I'll sleep over here.

203
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,900
No, you shouldn't.

204
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,320
Then should we sleep together?

205
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,670
I'm joking, idiot. Go to sleep already.

206
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,260
Sleep in the bed.

207
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,090
I won't.

208
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,360
I want to stay here.

209
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,510
Idiot.

210
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:10,780
I'm terribly sorry to have caused so much trouble and turmoil.

211
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,110
Words can't describe how sorry I am.

212
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,140
- Let us begin our meeting for the day.
- Yes.

213
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:20,590
Sawatari in room 712 had an arrhythmia at night. Please monitor the electrocardiogram.

214
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,410
I'm terribly sorry!

215
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,290
We're only kidding.

216
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,590
Hey, Miss Hero.

217
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,820
Welcome back!

218
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,080
We were worried about you.

219
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,010
I'm glad you're back.

220
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,300
Welcome back!

221
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:45,710
- Welcome back, Miss Hero!
- We've been waiting for you!

222
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,550
Give us souvenirs. Did you bring us some?

223
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,250
I did.

224
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,160
- What is this?
- It's pretty big.

225
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,250
- It's big.
- It must be something expensive.

226
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,880
- What is this?
- Is that Kagoshima's fried fishcakes?

227
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,190
Sakai...

228
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,940
Why not? There must be some for me.

229
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,750
Sakura, you're the only newbie besides me in the department.

230
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,460
I'll be sad if you're not here.

231
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,580
It was deep-fried.

232
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,990
Sakura?

233
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,150
Your happiness aura is blinding me.

234
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,870
Really?

235
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,460
Is that what happened? Finally?

236
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,060
Isn't that obvious? He even went to meet her family.

237
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,000
It'd be weird if nothing has happened.

238
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:43,120
Oh, that's true! It'd be weird if nothing has happened.

239
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,760
Don't ask her something so uncouth.

240
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,430
But aren't you curious?

241
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,840
What do you think happened? What exactly happened?

242
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,860
Nothing...

243
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,680
Nothing's happened yet, though.

244
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,480
I'm glad to hear Sakura's back.

245
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,000
Indeed.

246
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,100
I need to apologize to you.

247
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,190
I...

248
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,640
confessed my love to Sakura.

249
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,950
Well, she rejected me immediately, though.

250
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:33,400
You're always so honest and straightforward about those sorts of things.

251
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,200
I didn't want to regret not confessing.

252
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,240
Nishi...

253
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:07,510
I know I'm not a good catch.

254
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,530
I'm a greenhorn,

255
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:16,300
I don't own a house, nor do I have a lot of money saved up.

256
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:24,280
However... I like you, Ryuko.

257
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,760
Isn't that enough?

258
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,190
I'm really happy to hear that.

259
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,130
But you know...

260
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,530
words aren't enough.

261
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,860
We can't overcome reality.

262
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:16,640
Kenzo Sugawara. He has paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.

263
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,200
I'm in the final stages of pancreatic cancer.

264
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,680
I only have six months left to live.

265
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,480
I've quit my therapy and left the hospital.

266
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:32,030
No hospital will give me an ablation.

267
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,790
Why do you wish to undergo ablation?

268
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,920
I want to go on a trip with my wife.

269
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,460
I had always been busy working,

270
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:54,860
so I wish to travel around Japan while time still allows me to.

271
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,870
My wife and I have been looking at a map and planning a trip.

272
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:05,060
I understand. Let's do the ablation.

273
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,340
Thank you so much.

274
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,350
I'll be in your care.

275
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,550
Dr. Tendo!

276
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,540
I heard Sakura has returned.

277
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,210
Yes.

278
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,060
I'm sorry to have caused you worry.

279
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,240
Well...

280
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,420
I... still like you, Doctor.

281
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:57,050
I'm not the one you pine for...

282
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:00,980
but the shadow of your sister who was with me.

283
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,630
Pardon?

284
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,710
You should free yourself now.

285
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:24,530
It must be nice that you can see the Devil whenever you wish.

286
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:30,200
I haven't seen my girlfriend in two weeks.

287
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,320
- Let me ask you, Numazu.
- Yes?

288
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:46,770
This is about a friend of mine...

289
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,550
It's been a while since they've started dating.

290
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:55,730
But nothing has occurred. Is that strange?

291
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,370
Nothing has happened?

292
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:01,700
I'm talking about my friend.

293
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,550
Your friend, right?

294
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:11,900
I see! Yes! Okay.

295
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:18,340
Listen, there are two reasons why a man won't lay his hands on his girlfriend.

296
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,910
One is that he feels no sex appeal towards her.

297
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:24,070
The other is that he cares for her dearly.

298
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,050
It'd be one or the other.

299
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,630
He feels no sex appeal?

300
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:33,710
Don't worry, I'm sure it's the second reason.

301
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,840
If that's the case,

302
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,710
he is a fine young man.

303
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,270
Don't let go of him.

304
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:45,570
Tell that to your friend.

305
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:50,040
- Oh, right! I will tell that to my friend!
- To your friend!

306
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,530
Doctor!

307
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,580
Did you eat something rotten?

308
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,020
I did not!

309
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:11,050
We'll hold a cream festival tonight.

310
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,940
What exactly is that?

311
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,910
Your long-awaited feast of cream croquette, cream stew and—

312
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,950
I haven't been waiting for such things, but...

313
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,320
sure, if you insist.

314
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:28,840
There may be dessert afterwards.

315
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,890
Maybe!

316
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,630
The Devil definitely has ED!
(T/N: Erectile Dysfunction)

317
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,380
The fact that nothing has happened, is unbelievable.

318
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:49,120
Either that or he has no sexual desire.

319
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,940
Maybe he's sexually passive, despite his looks!

320
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:56,420
Is the Devil passive? That's hilarious!

321
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:02,650
There's no way he's passive. He's wasting his good looks.

322
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,100
Welcome, Doctor.

323
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:18,630
We're having a long-awaited cream festival tonight.

324
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,860
Please, have a seat.

325
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,130
Let's dig in.

326
