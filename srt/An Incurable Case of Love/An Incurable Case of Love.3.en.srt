- No.

That's right. She was a fellow resident.

Those two.

490
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,860
Those two? Who and who?

491
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,650
Lower your voice.

492
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,830
Here you are!

493
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:43,780
Do you at least care for Miss Hero like the rest of us do, right?

494
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,400
Say what?

495
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,790
Of course, he does! He hugged her gently, after all!

496
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:54,690
"You're on Team Tendo, aren't you?"

497
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:57,080
What were you blabbing about?

498
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,390
I'm sorry!

499
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,650
Does that mean it's true?

500
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,340
What? She didn't just imagine it?

501
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:06,550
- What? Imagine what?
- I told you, those two—

502
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,430
Look!

503
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:13,650
I'm sorry for causing so much trouble over this!

504
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:22,210
But you're wrong. He was just taking care of me when I was sick.

505
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,100
It was nothing romantic!

506
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,500
- Wait, really?
- Obviously.

507
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:35,120
I keep messing up every day.

508
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,960
I always think that I'm not cut out for this job, so I should just quit.

509
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,630
It's true that...

510
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,980
I like Dr. Tendo.

511
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,090
I really like him.

512
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:56,930
But... that's why...

513
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:02,000
I want to become an outstanding nurse.

514
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,100
That's why... from now on,

515
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:11,470
I'm going to devote myself to my work! I'm going to press on!

516
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:14,900
I appreciate everyone's guidance and encouragement!

517
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,300
Fantastic!

518
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,300
Good for you, Miss Hero!

519
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,760
Thank you for listening!

520
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,730
Bottom's up!

521
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:44,490
Ah, wait! Dr. Koshikawa! You haven't drunk at all!

522
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:48,730
- Oh! Thanks for pouring my glass.
- Please allow me.

523
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,400
I can't lose, either.

524
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,980
What are you smiling about?

525
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:05,700
I was thinking about joining the game, too.

526
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,120
Excuse me!

527
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,100
One more beer, please!

528

Man, she's completely drunk!

Of course, I'll remember.

No one's said that.

You can say it.

554

I'm just a... useless failure of a nurse.

555
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,790
If you were serious

556
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:47,110
about what you said before...

557
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:55,510
If you are serious about becoming an outstanding nurse...

558
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,190
I do want to. Seriously.

559
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:13,610
If so, I'll nurture you.

560
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,600
I wouldn't say that if you didn't have potential.

561
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,100
I'll make you indispensable.

562
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,680
So...

563
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,390
have confidence.

Even if you hit a wall,

just overcome it.

566
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:50,950
You too.

567
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:57,640
I wouldn't say overcome it, but...

568

it must be painful maintaining that stern expression all the time.

571
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:32,900
So I'll make you smile, Doctor.

572
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:44,650
Whether it's a forced smile, a half-smile, or laughing for joy...

573
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,650
Any will do!
