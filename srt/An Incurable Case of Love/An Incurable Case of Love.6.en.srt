I should have told you Wakabayashi was coming.

33

Our cardiac surgery department was searching for another doctor

34
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:10,280
and she was a fellow at the Michigan Medical Center, a famous heart transplant institute.

So they're going to meet with her today.

Ichitaro Tsutsumi, 67 years old.

204
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:30,020
- He collapsed after chest pains and we started chest compressions right away.
- Okay.

205
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,670
- We performed defibrillation with an AED and he started breathing again.
- Understood.

206
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,680
The chest pain suggests a heart attack.

If you couldn't please her, I don't think any of us could.

Your mom?

She's an ex-nurse.

She tests me every time, if I'm doing the job perfectly right.

That's probably why I'm tense around Wada.

My mom's a pharmacist.

She still doubts whether I can fill a prescription correctly.

What's the most important thing to you as a doctor?

370
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,800
Good question.

371
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,680
I once thought this profession

372
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:56,900
was a battle between me as a doctor and the patient's illness.

373
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,260
A battle that I could never lose.

374
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,910
But I was wrong.

375
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,540
Because if I lose that battle,

376
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:13,680
the patient, not I, pays the price.

377
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:19,330
If I lose the battle, there's nothing I can do to bring them back.

378
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:27,550
But doctors aren't superheroes. We can't save everyone.

379
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:33,890
The unfortunate truth is, there are lives that can't be saved.

I take on a debt for all the lives I couldn't save.

383
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,370
To pay back that debt even a little bit,

384

I do all I can to heal my future patients.

There are 2,535 steps in the Sky Tree.

they said no because it's for emergency use only.
