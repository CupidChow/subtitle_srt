00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,060
Or if I didn't work...

328
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,350
I could have noticed his illness sooner.

329
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,370
That's why...

330
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:52,290
I want to give him the best treatment possible.

331
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:58,230
So please don't use Sakura this time.

332
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,910
Use a more experienced nurse.

333
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:07,550
As the head nurse, I know I shouldn't be saying this...

334
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:11,470
But, this one time... as a parent...

335
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:16,020
I'm begging you, please.

336
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:24,980
Next, the nurses who will assist with Shinji's ablation...

337
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:31,290
will be Ishihara and Nakano, at Dr. Tendo's request.

338
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,440
Please take care of the preparations.

339
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,980
You're not going to do it?

340
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,750
I'll leave it to you two.

341
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,730
- Okay.
- Okay.

342
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,850
We'll have to keep a close eye on his blood pressure.

343
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,880
Check his data and look at the in and out fluid balance.

344
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,740
Let's give him a sponge bath after we check Ogawa's vitals in room 705.

345
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,790
Excuse me, Head Nurse?

346
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:22,360
Sorry, but do you know why I wasn't chosen for Shinji's ablation?

347
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,270
Dr. Tendo made the decision.

348
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,820
Now you're literally in my way.

349
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:58,260
Why wasn't I chosen for Shinji's ablation?

350
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:12,210
Didn't you say you were going to help me become a great nurse?

351
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,530
Is it because I was so excited to be your girlfriend?

352
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:20,830
Did you think that made me incapable of doing the job?

353
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,370
I wanted...

354
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,380
you to evaluate me as a nurse.

355
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,860
You're the one bringing our personal lives into work!

356
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,360
Do you really mean that?

357
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,560
I'm so frustrated.

358
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,750
I see.

359
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,900
Did you really said that to him?

360
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,750
I wasn't planning on it.

361
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,420
I just got so frustrated...

362
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,840
I'm done for now.

363
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,220
I see.

364
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:30,080
I was trying the best of my ability.

365
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,330
Was it a rude awakening?

366
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,540
Do you not like him anymore?

367
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:58,400
He's inconsiderate, cold, and indifferent.

368
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,760
But...

369
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,660
But what?

370
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,300
I love him.

371
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:24,720
He can't win out against a parent's love.

372
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:33,910
The head nurse asked him as a favor.

373
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,090
What?

374
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:45,600
I think he knows how hard you've worked.

375
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,120
Go back now

376
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,000
and clear the things with him.

377
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,020
Go!

378
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,410
Miss Hero!

379
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,590
Okay!

380
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:39,250
Do you know where Dr. Tendo is?

381
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:43,880
Shinji had a VT attack. Dr. Tendo's doing an emergency ablation.

382
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,400
What?

383
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,750
What about here?

384
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,700
It's close.

385
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,520
And here?

386
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,360
Even closer.

387
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,940
I'll burn here. Starting the electricity.

388
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:23,810
It's not stopping. A little higher?

389
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,200
How about here?

390
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,060
The flow is a little slow there.

391
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,900
Then...

392
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:41,170
How about here?

393
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,600
It's close.

394
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:47,100
I'll do it here. Starting the electricity.

395
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,690
His blood pressure's low. We'll stop for now.

396
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:56,660
Okay.

397
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,120
Run the IV wide open.

398
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,600
Okay.

399
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:06,680
Shinji, do you feel discomfort anywhere?

400
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,860
I feel okay.

401
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,530
His saturation's a little low...

402
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,020
Check his respiration.

403
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,520
Okay.

404
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,900
There's a little wheezing.

405
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,380
Heart failure?

406
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,400
But it doesn't look decompensated...

407
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,900
Wheezing?

408
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,120
I really want to go back.

409
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:03,570
First I find out where they are from their footsteps...

410
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,170
Dr. Tendo!

411
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:13,510
His wheezing might be a reaction to the contrast medium!

412
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,500
What do you mean? Elaborate.

413
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:21,510
I saw him coughing a few times.

414
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:24,840
And he was always eating menthol breath mints.

415
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,240
If he was eating them to help with the coughing...

416
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,880
Shinji might have asthma!

417
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,520
Give him steroids and increase the oxygen by five liters.

418
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,980
Okay.

419
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,860
Get in here, Sakura.

420
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,380
Okay!

421
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,190
How are his vitals?

422
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:34,340
Blood pressure is 118/70. Heart rate is regular at 77 BPM.

423
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,600
He can be taken off bedrest tomorrow morning.

424
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,080
Okay.

425
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,020
Dr. Tendo?

426
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,710
Thank you.

427
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,220
Thank goodness!

428
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,730
What's that?

429
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,970
Oh! This...

430
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:18,370
A cute girl on his team gave it to Shinji.

431
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,290
Really?

432
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,780
I didn't notice about his cough.

433
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:32,640
He's my son, but I don't know a thing about him.

434
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,490
I'm a failure as a mother.

435
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:42,000
You saved him, Sakura. Thank you.

436
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,350
Oh, no! I didn't do much.

437
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:59,960
I'm very sorry about the ablation.

438
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:07,320
As the head nurse, I want to nurture you.

439
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:13,590
But when it comes to my own son,

440
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:22,290
I was the one who lost my composure.

441
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:30,650
As a mother and as a head nurse...

442
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,230
you work so hard every day.

443
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,590
You're my inspiration, Negishi.

444
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:43,530
I hope you'll continue to mentor me.

445
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:50,710
Sure. It would be my pleasure.

446
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,230
Yesterday...

447
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:34,980
I'm sorry for getting so emotional.

448
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:58,820
Here. Hungry?

449
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,660
What?

450
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,370
Thank you.

451
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:12,830
It's still warm! Freshly baked...

452
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:17,590
For your first operation, you did well.

453
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:46,660
Back then, you were amazing.

454
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:57,250
The way you went deeper and deeper into his heart and healing it.

455
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:04,090
It was like you were in a completely different world.

456
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:13,670
I realized you've been doing stuff like that for many years...

457
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:18,680
which has made you who you are today.

458
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:28,230
One day, I hope to become someone who can support you.

459
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:38,040
Having celebratory bread with you like this

460
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,600
is the best date I could ask for.

461
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:53,920
Oh? A chocolate corone?

462
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,900
♫ In the scenery I look at ♫

463
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,300
I'll eat it up!

464
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:04,340
♫ The world has changed since you came in ♫

465
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,820

♫ In the midst of my flawless days, ♫

♫ I couldn’t resist the mysterious gravitation and it collapses ♫

♫ I love, I love, so many times ♫

470
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:30,590
[Today is Valentine's Day! Show your love with a pastry! How about a chocolate corone?]

471

♫ Like paints diving into a water tank and melting ♫

474
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:50,850
I've been through my share of experiences, you know.

475
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:56,200
While I've been a doctor here, I've fallen in love and broke up.

476
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,430
Married and divorced.

477
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,520
I don't want to hear the details of your story.

478
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:10,380
Our memories are tied to many things.

479
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:16,370
The first time I did a PCI, I was at rock bottom with a broken heart.

480
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:24,210
When I went to a conference in America, I was still a newlywed. Things like that.

481
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:33,660
Don't keep your work and love life separate. Enjoy the chaos of daily life.

482
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:38,170
You can't draw a line in your heart, can you?

483
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:44,650
♫ So beautiful that it makes me dizzy ♫

484
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:49,190
For next month's shifts, if anyone wants time off—

485
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,760
I do! Every Friday!

486
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,070
- I want to go to a hot spring with my girlfriend on a weekend.
- Sorry, but I have a seminar on the weekends.

487
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:55,770
- I want to visit my family!
- Me, too!

488
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:57,760
Don't shout all at once!

489
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:59,510
- I'll go first—
- No, me first.

490
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:01,330
I really want to go to a hot spring.

491
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:04,050
Wait. What about you, Miss Hero?

492
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:07,370
- I don't have any requests.
- What? Are you sure?

493
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,940
Yes. I want to get more experience helping with tests and patients,

494
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,020
so schedule me anywhere.

495
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,430
What a great intention.

496
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:19,500
It's short notice, but could you take Sunday the 8th?

497
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,330
- Yes! I'd love to.
- You're such a big help.

498
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:28,260
Negishi, that day won't work.

499
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,070
- Give her that day off.
- What?

500
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,640
Does she have something that day?

501
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,590
- We're going out to eat together.
- What?

502
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,890
To eat?

503
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:44,080
Why is Miss Hero eating out with you?

504
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,000
Because she's my girlfriend.

505
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:51,850
What?

506
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:54,680
- Girlfriend?
- What?

507
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,280
Hey! Good for you, Miss Hero!

508
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,070
- You did it, Miss Hero!
- Congratulations, Miss Hero!

509
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:04,080
- Miss Hero!
- You did it!

510
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,080
- You're amazing, Miss Hero!
- Congratulations!

511
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,930
- Miss Hero! Miss Hero! Miss Hero!
- Doctor!

512
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:14,470
- Could you repeat what you just said?
- I'm not saying it again.

513
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:16,160
Why not, Doctor?

514
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,590
Dr. Tendo!

[Next Episode: A rival appears!?]
I have a bad feeling about this!

517
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:56,550
The Devil is going on a business trip!
[A business trip with the rival!? Steal mission time!]

518
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,300
I'll come right back. Just stay here.

519
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,790
I just had to check.

520
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:03,580
- Shall we have a pillow fight?
- Absolute not!

521
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:07,020
I've had a crush on him for five years.
