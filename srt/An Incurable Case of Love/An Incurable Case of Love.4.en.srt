But... I like Dr. Tendo.

5

- Yes?
- Dr. Tendo, a patient from the CCU network is arriving at the ER.

46
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,570
Got it.

47

We're going to the ER.

48

- She had a heart attack, Doctor.
- What are her vitals?

49

BP 90/54, heart rate regular at 110 BPM, she's still alert.

50

You couldn't do anything?

56
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,860
Right. Responding to an emergency patient is rough.

57
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,200
That's a given. Even we haven't even gotten used to it.

58
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,600
You shouldn't get used to it. You would always be on edge.

59

But I feel like I haven't been useful as a nurse.

Right! Keiko Tsuruoka is 52 years old.

64
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,610
She's stable for now. When her condition improves, we're going to run a cardiac catheter test.

65

She may have another heart attack. Let's keep a close eye on her.

Falling for him means trouble.

He seems nice, but he doesn't let his guard down so easily.

165
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,840
What?

166
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,800
But I'm 30 minutes early.

167
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,770
He's probably talking to me.

168
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,230
Sorry.

169
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,820
Are these the results from Tsuruoka's test?

170
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,430
Three-vessel coronary artery disease. It looks to be critical.

171
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,100
She needs revascularization right away.

172
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,400
- A surgery?
- As soon as possible.

173
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,300
Let's keep her stable here and request a cardiac surgeon.

174
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,660
- I'll talk to Tsuruoka now.
- Okay.

175
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,780
Sakura, could you check her vitals?

176
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,540
Sure.

177
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,500
What? When did Sakura join Team Kisugi—

178
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,310
Let's start Watanabe's cardiac rehab in room 701.

179
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,970
Okay.

180
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,070
Coronary artery bypass surgery?

181
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,950
That's right.

182
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,900
This is plaque. It's a buildup that's narrowing your blood vessels.

183
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:43,200
In this procedure, we'll create a bypass around the buildup to restore blood flow.

184
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:48,500
- With your current condition, I recommend this as soon as—
- I refuse!

185
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,900
- The surgery?
- Yes. I don't want to.

186
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,240
I'm sorry.

187
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,410
Why not? She'll be at risk for another heart attack.

188
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,650
I did explain that to her, yet she refused to have surgery.

189
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,950
She must have a reason.

190
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:27,070
[No contact info for family... Currently lives alone.]

191

Excuse me!

192
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,190
Tsuruoka? Any changes?

193
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,700
Is it still difficult to breathe?

194
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,400
I feel nauseous.

195
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,260
Feeling sick? Do you want to vomit?

196
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,430
That's not it. I'm talking about that.

197
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,250
Excuse me?

198
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:57,490
Sorry for the trouble.

199
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:02,430
When I see messy hair, I have the tendency to fix it.

200
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,860
I guess it's an occupational hazard.

201
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,180
You're a hairdresser, right?

202
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,800
That's right. I've been working for the last 30 years.

203
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,040
That's amazing! You have my respect.

204
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,700
Alright! All done.

205
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,500
Take a look. Here.

206
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:35,400
Oh my, it looks amazing! Thank you.

207
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40,950
This reminded me of when I used to braid my daughter's hair.

208
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,010
Your daughter?

209
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:56,400
She's so adorable! What a nice picture!

210
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:02,510
- A wedding?
- Yes, her daughter's wedding is in ten days.

211
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:07,070
She wants to attend her wedding. That's why she doesn't want the surgery.

212
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:13,230
If she undergoes the surgery, she won't be discharged for three weeks.

213
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:19,510
I sympathize, but her daughter surely wouldn't agree with her attending.

214
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,700
She could collapse again at any moment.

215
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,560
It's been twenty years.

216

What?

217
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,930
After she divorced and left home,

218
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,480
she hasn't seen her since then.

219
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,140
Her ex-husband contacted her,

220
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,840
and he arranged their reunion on the wedding day.

221
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,420
Her daughter doesn't know about it.

222
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:54,300
So she wants to schedule the surgery for after the wedding.

223
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,870
She wants to take medicine until then.

224
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,100
I'll try talking to her later.

225
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:07,700
Let's think of a way we can respect her wishes as much as possible.

226

You're right. I'm not.

229

You're going to yield to the patient's demands.

230
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,020
You're reluctant to treat her or prepare for surgery.

231
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,690
You're not pleased that Sakura's working with me?

232
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,580
What?

233
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,620
I don't give a crap about that.

234
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll bear the responsibility for treating Tsuruoka and for protecting Sakura.

236
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,240
Yeah.

237
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,580
It's probably being overblown,

238
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:14,550
but Dr. Kisugi is worried, so he walks me to work and back whenever he can.

239

Stay away from her! I forbid you from interacting with her.

I wonder what she's doing now.

00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,240
It sounds like they're having fun.

257
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,120
She probably invited her friends over because she's afraid of the stalker.

258

- You should invite some friends over, too!

For Tsuruoka in room 708,

271
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,780
we'll do cardiac catheterization instead of bypass surgery.

272
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:43,440
Well, catheterization would be easier on the patient.

273

And the wedding's in a week, so she'll probably be able to go.

We'll be doing the surgery, after all.

325
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:47,390
Did Tsuruoka agree?

326
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:50,340
Her treatment plan has changed?

327
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,380
What about the wedding?

328
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,050
Dr. Kisugi made the call.

329
00:23:55,050 --> 00:24:00,000
In her condition, he couldn't approve it.

330
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,550
I guess he's right. She could have another attack.

331
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:10,060
Negishi, can I talk to you?

332
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,060
Today...

333
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:19,900
I would like to discuss with you all...

334
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,950
Miss Hero, fight!

335
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,660
[Patient Information: Keiko Tsuruoka]

336
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,190
After a heart attack caused by ischemia,

337
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:40,730
she has been recommended coronary artery bypass surgery.

338
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,980
The patient's name is Keiko Tsuruoka.

339
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,040
As written on the application, and per her request,

340
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,760
finding a way to support her to attend her daughter's wedding.

341
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,450
Support her to go out?

342
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,560
The wedding venue is one hour away,

343
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,600
so the outing would take three hours total.

344
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:07,260
I understand it's difficult,

345
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:11,910
- but if a nurse accompanies her—
- I'm sorry, Sakura.

346
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:17,010
I'd like to approve, but if she goes out in her current condition,

347
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:21,330
she will very likely have another heart attack.

348
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:26,270
As her attending physician, I can't approve this.

349
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:31,720
But she wouldn't consent to the surgery.

350
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:37,300
From a nurse's perspective, it's important to try to fulfill Tsuruoka's wishes

351
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:42,600
to improve her willingness to accept treatment.

352
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,540
And who will accompany her?

353
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,010
If I can get that day off, I'll go with her.

354
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:58,500
But you're a new nurse, aren't you?

355
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,250
You wouldn't be able to handle the crisis unless a doctor comes along.

356
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,550
If anything were to happen, we might get sued.

357
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,820
I'll make the time to talk with Tsuruoka later.

358
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:16,620
I'll help her understand her condition. We want her to live a long life.

359
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,540
For what?

360
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:33,300
When I tried to persuade Tsuroka, that's what she asked me.

361
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,700
What will I live for?

362
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,550
I don't care if that would be my last day.

363
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:53,440
On the happiest day of my daughter's life,

364
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,650
I want to be with her.

365
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:06,270
That's my last wish.

366
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:23,580
I want her to see her daughter so she'll remember her reason for living.

367
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:28,050
I want her to remember that there's a future after she gets better.

368
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:36,000
I won't let that be her last day!

369
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:43,210
I may not be very helpful. I may be as useless as a rock.

370
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,780
But I won't make an excuse like "it's impossible", "we can't", "there's nothing we can do".

371
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,010
I'll say we can!

372
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:54,660
Then Tsuruoka might stick with her treatment.

373
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,690
She'll start to think, "I can do this! I'll live!"

374
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,350
I'll guarantee her safety during transport.

375
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:05,260
I'll find hospitals for emergencies. I'll take care of everything.

376
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:10,830
So please... Please allow her to attend the wedding.

377
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,550
I'll go with her.

378
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:27,270
I'll take that day off and go with her.

379
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:32,130
I'll take responsibility for reviewing her plan.

380
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,770
So...

381
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:40,460
on that day, please get ready in case of an emergency.

382
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,400
Please.

383
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,450
Please!

384
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,660
Please.

385
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,500
We're not just here to cure illnesses, but

386
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,090
we're also here to help patients.

387
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,700
Understood. However, we'll make the final decision on that morning.

388
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,990
We'll continue to discuss things until then.

389
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,610
Thank you so much!

390
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:23,860
Alright, then. Meeting adjourned.

391
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,200
- Great job, Miss Hero!
- Thank you.

392
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:33,330
I'll go tell Tsuruoka right now!

393
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,520
Hold it.

394
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,250
I'll be reviewing your nursing plan.

395
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,530
Okay!

396
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:48,020
Cannula... check.

397
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,160
Equipment check...

398
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,770
finished!

399
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,610
- Miss Hero!
- Oh!

400
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,430
- You're helping the patient with an outing today, right?
- Yeah.

401
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,020
What a great idea! Good luck!

402
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,850
- Thank you!
- See you later.

403
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,650
Doctor, thanks for coming along today.

404
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:26,000
This isn't a field trip. Stay focused!

405
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,230
Yes, of course!

406
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,100
Excuse me.

407
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,980
- Give her some oxygen.
- Okay!

408
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,620
[Welcome to our wedding! Kento & Eri]

409
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:16,760
Tsuruoka, we have arrived!

410
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:26,990
It'll put a strain on your body, so we can't stay too long.

411
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:30,630
Let's go!

412
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,670
The father of the bride looks handsome!

413
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,900
Eri...

414
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,280
She's gorgeous!

415
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,940
Dad...?

416
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,580
Go to her.

417
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,770
Eri...

418
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,430
I'm Dr. Tendo, from Hiura General Hospital.

419
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:11,760
It's putting a strain on her body,

420
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,640
so I can only allow her to stay ten minutes.

421
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,600
What?

422
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,260
Your mother made a painstaking effort to spend ten minutes with you.

423
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,100
Eri...

424
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,820
Congratulations.

425
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,980
Thank you...

426
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:56,500
for coming, Mom.

427
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,050
I'll introduce you to my husband.

428
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,920
Let her sit down.

429
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,520
Sorry, may I...?

430
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,670
I'm so happy.

431
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:43,790
I'm so happy for Tsuruoka.

432
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,360
Smile!

433
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,790
It's only for ten minutes,

434
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:03,100
but the ten minutes are so meaningful.

435
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:09,550
She will never forget the precious ten minutes.

436
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:12,390
Why are you crying?

437
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:17,940
How can you watch that and not shed a tear?

438
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,880
You really are the Devil!

439
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,660
I'm so happy!

440
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,870
That was fast.

441
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,630
My prayer was answered.

442
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,830
They say this place is good for that kind of stuff.

443
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,370
We're back.

444
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,690
Welcome back, Tsuruoka.

445
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,300
We'll take over from here.

446
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:35,920
Thank you both for everything.

447
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,300
I'll listen to Dr. Kisugi now

448
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:46,200
and do the surgery.

449
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:51,370
Get better so you can visit your daughter again, okay?

450
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:57,040
Sakura, thank you so much for today.

451
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,680
Get well soon.

452
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,820
Ready to go back?

453
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,720
This was all thanks to Sakura. She's such a lovely girl.

454
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,660
She's stolen my heart.

455
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,960
I know what you mean.

456
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,520
What?

457
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,730
Oh? It's not here.

458
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,190
I forgot my cell phone!

459
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,890
What?

460
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,590
- At the wedding venue?
- Yeah, probably...

461
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,830
Let's go, then.

462
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:53,500
Oh, it's fine! I'll go get it!

463
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,780
Seriously? This is kind of scary.

464
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,310
- How scary.
- Indeed, it is.

465
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:05,420
Doctor, look. It was on the floor of the women's locker room.

466
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,030
There's no doubt about it! A stalker wrote these!

467
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:17,670
[ I want to talk to you. I'll come to see you today.]

468
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:37,100
Are you looking... for this?

469
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:46,090
I figured if I waited here, you would come back.

470
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,270
Tazawa?

471
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:52,300
We're finally alone together.

472
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:58,660
Did you not realize it was me?

473
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,140
Why are you here? How—

474
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:05,270
You didn't contact me at all.

475
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,150
Give it back!

476
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:11,760
You were with a different guy every time I saw you!

477
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,690
Please stop!

478
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,110
But today we can finally talk!

479
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:19,980
Let go! Please let go!

480
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,940
What are you doing?

481
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,760
Doctor!

482
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,470
Don't interrupt us.

483
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,310
Stay back.

484
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,420
You're in my way...

485
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,070
Doctor!

486
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,620
Sakura!

487
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,940
Stay with me, Sakura.

488
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,900
- Go to Hiura General Hospital!
- One, two, three, lift!

489
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,600
- Ask if they can take her in. I'm a doctor there.
- Okay!

490
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,590
Let's go! On the rail.

491
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:46,230
- Gauze?
- Here.

492
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,740
- Hold this, please.
- Okay.

493
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,840
- Doctor...
- Don't talk.

494
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,960
- Dr. Tendo...
- You're bleeding more than I thought.

495
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,790
Do you feel nauseous?

496
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,130
No.

497
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,590
Dr. Tendo, thank you for coming after me.

498
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,800
I'm sorry about tomorrow. You have surgery in the morning.

499
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,850
That doesn't matter.

500
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:41,390
It's like what Tsuruoka said...

501
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:49,450
When I thought it was the end...

502
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,060
What I truly wished for...

503
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,370
Be quiet.

504
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:03,720
was a day like today. Going out with you,

505
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:09,230
like a boyfriend and a girlfriend,

506
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:15,400
holding hands... on a date...

507
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,980
and kissing...

508
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,750
That's enough.

509
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,990
I know...

510
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:33,140
you already have someone in your heart,

511
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,020
and you don't even see me.

512
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,580
But...

513
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:48,060
I still love you.

514
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:57,170
I'll say it over and over. Hundreds of times!

515
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:03,210
I love you, Doctor.

516
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,520
Hey, Sakura!

517
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,660
- I wish I could have spent more time with you...
- Hey.

518
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,360
Hey!

519
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,240
- Doctor...
- Hang in there! We're almost there!

520
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,080
I heard you. If you get through this,

521
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,100
I'll grant any wish you want.

522
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,520
I'll kiss you or go on a date!

523
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,290
So Sakura...

524
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,270
Sakura!

525
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:54,300
I almost feel like I didn't get the proper care.

526
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,840
I hit my head and bled so much,

527
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,490
but I wasn't treated kindly or even admitted—

528
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:02,070
Obviously not, you idiot!

529
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,720
Your voice is giving me headaches.

530
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,390
Then so be it, idiot!

531
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:08,930
Why are you so angry?

532
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:11,880
When you suddenly stop responding,

533
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,380
so I assume you've lost consciousness.

534
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:17,530
But you just fell asleep...

535
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,950
Sorry. I've been a little sleep-deprived.

536
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:23,590
And your head injury only needed two stitches.

537
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:25,480
What? Only two?

538
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,470
- I thought it would be more...
- You probably just have a lot of blood in your thick skull.

539
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,060
Doctor?

540
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:39,550
It could've been my imagination since I did hit my head.

541
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:45,860
But... didn't you say something in the ambulance?

542
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:51,830
"If you get through this, I'll grant any wish you want."

543
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,250
It must have been your imagination.

544
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,780
You definitely said it.

545
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:02,470
Probably...

546
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:10,170
I thought I was going to die, so I told you my feelings.

547
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:16,520
I'm starting to remember!

548
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,200
You said you would kiss me! Go on a date! Anything!

549
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:28,520
You have to keep the promise!

550
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:34,730
As I said, I didn't promise you anything.

551
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:39,910
Doctor! A Japanese man never goes back on his word, right?
