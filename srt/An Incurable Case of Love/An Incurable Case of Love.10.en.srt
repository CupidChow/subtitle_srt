1
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,370
Morning.

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,820
Good morning!

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,200
I'm making breakfast now... I mean, brunch.

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,950
I bet you're tired, so...

5
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:36,050
Be patient, Doctor. It'll be done soon.

6
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,680
Doctor, the eggs will burn.

7
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,480
How is it?

8
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,390
Yeah. It's good.

9
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,650
I'm glad.

10
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,140
Look at the time! I need to get ready for the night shift.

11
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,210
I'll be back in three minutes!

12
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,130
Nope.

13
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,420
Kairi and Nanako, are you here?

14
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,800
Yes!

15
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,700
Nanako!

16
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,880
Why are you wearing kimono?

17
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,380
Sakura, I did it! I became a Hero!

18
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,680
What? What's going on?

19
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,910
I went to an arranged marriage meeting today,

20
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,030
and they forced an unreasonable demand on me.

21
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:14,690
- No drinking?
- Right. No one in our household drinks alcohol, so it's forbidden.

22
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,470
You do the same! Besides, I want to see my grandkids soon.

23
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,020
- Hey now!
- Why can't I say that?

24
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:26,930
- Sir, please stop causing a ruckus!
- What's going on?

25
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,980
- Nishi?
- Ryuko.

26
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,810
- Don't get married.
- What?

27
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,700
Ms. Tendo, who is that young man?

28
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,520
Come with me!

29
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,600
Wow. Oh, my.

30
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,890
Ms. Ryuko? Ms. Ryuko? What?

31
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,540
Wait! Don't go, Ms. Ryuko!

32
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,060
What? Did you steal the bride?

33
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,300
I'll be in your care, Brother-in-law.

34
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,120
Who the heck are you?

35
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,410
With that said, what do you think, Kairi?

36
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,090
- Would you visit our parents with me just once?
- Why would I?

37
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,270
If you show them how you're having a serious relationship with Nanako,

38
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,800
- I bet our parents would feel at ease a little.
- I decline.

39
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,660
Don't decline, idiot!

40
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:42,820
Kairi probably doesn't want to involve you in our family issues.

41
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,160
Do you think so?

42
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,690
Either way, you'll come with me, won't you?

43
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,550
- To the Tendo household?
- Yes.

44
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,760
Our father's been aggressively calling me.

45
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,680
Plus, if I go with someone, he might go easy on me!

46
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,160
As I recall, he's the "sadistic father", right?

47
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,830
If Kairi's the "Demon Lord",

48
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,490
then our father's like... the "Last Boss".

49
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,690
- "Last Boss"?
- Yes.

50
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,560
Nanako, you're also thinking of marring Kairi, right?

51
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,160
Marriage?

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,400
Congratulations!

53
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,260
Nanako?

54
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,830
Nanako? Nanako, hello?

55
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,900
We're here!

56
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,020
What is this gorgeous mansion I'm seeing?

57
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,570
It's just spacious! Our grandfather owned a lot of lands.

58
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,900
By the way, you're dressed a bit plain, aren't you?

59
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:16,260
I didn't want to be rude. I brought cherry blossom sweet rice cakes. Is that alright?

60
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,010
Really? Thanks, it looks delicious! Can I eat this later?

61
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,340
Yes, of course! This place sells delicious cakes.

62
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,230
You're in the way, you rock.

63
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,160
If she's a solicitor, turn her away, Ryuko.

64
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,270
She's not!

65
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,840
Her name is Nanako.

66
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,110
Who are you?

67
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:44,270
Nice to meet you. I am Nanase Sakura.

68
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,830
Although I may be incompetent, I'll greatly appreciate

69
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,360
your guidance and support.

70
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,870
I have a bad feeling about something.

71
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,670
What's up?

72
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:08,230
It's nothing. By the way, Sawatari in room 715...

73
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,370
- Needs a new OCT scan.
- Yeah, thank you.
(T/N: OCT - Optical coherence tomography)

74
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,460
I'll have it arranged.

75
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,650
- By the way, good luck with the press conference.
- Excuse me?

76
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:23,550
It's about Anri's artificial heart, the MMI.

77
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,910
The operation was a success.

78
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:34,700
As the first success case in Japan, they've decided to hold a press conference.

79
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,020
As the doctor in charge, we're counting on you to explain.

80
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,080
That's amazing, Dr. Tendo.

81
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,370
I rather not. Dr. Koishikawa, I leave it to you.

82
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,590
You're expecting me to take all the credit for my junior's work?

83
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,150
You sure are a Demon!

84
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,170
Alright, I'll do it.

85
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,980
Welcome, Ms. Nanako!

86
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,800
It's nice to meet you. Actually, my name is "Nanase" Sakura.

87
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,400
Why're you smirking?

88
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,530
Hey now, that was rude.

89
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,510
- I'm sorry.
- Not at all.

90
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,490
It's disturbing, isn't it? I'm sorry.

91
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:59,110
Oh, I just made some dim sum! Ms. Nanako, join us if you'd like.

92
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,550
Xiao long bao is my mother's signature dish.

93
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,640
- I love dim sum!
- Really? I'm so glad!

94
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,740
Ryuko, that was an opportune marriage arrangement,

95
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,530
yet you ruin it by running off with some dubious kid.

96
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,620
What were you thinking?

97
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,570
I told you... I'm sorry.

98
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,290
You live in idleness at your age, and you're still unemployed.

99
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,750
She's working hard as a building manager.

100
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,250
That's a job we gave her.

101
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,390
Here you are, sitting on your high horse, making light of the world.

102
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,690
That's not my intention!

103
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,670
I'm disappointed in you.

104
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,660
You're not planning on inheriting the family business, nor setting down.

105
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,950
You have no hope for the future. Are you alright with that?

106
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,970
With all due respect...

107
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,750
Ryuko is someone I look up to.

108
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,460
Her future is not bleak!

109
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:14,010
I'm always depending on her. She encourages me, and she cares for her younger brother.

110
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,790
Ryuko is... the coolest woman in Japan.

111
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,310
Nanako...

112
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,210
Now dim sum's ready! Eat it while it's hot.

113
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,400
This has nothing to do with you.

114
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,190
Ryuko, I'm simply asking you to think of your future.

115
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,060
You don't need to remind me. I am thinking of my future.

116
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,220
- You're always—
- Excuse me!

117
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,430
Since the food is ready, why don't we eat?

118
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,500
My goodness, it looks so delicious!

119
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,720
Please, eat it while it's warm!

120
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,010
Thank you. I'd love to.

121
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,690
Let's dig in!

122
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,100
It's hot!

123
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,120
Be careful!

124
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,100
It's delicious!

125
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,430
How shameless.

126
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,900
Don't butt in, since you're not even part of our family.

127
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,780
Who the hell are you anyway?

128
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,500
Hey now.

129
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,360
She's my girlfriend.

130
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,000
Kairi...

131
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,750
My girlfriend is...

132
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,100
a shameless idiot,

133
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,900
who'd march in here to help my big sis.

134
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,200
Your girlfriend, you say?

135
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,150
You have a girlfriend?

136
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,130
She's the one who changed me.

137
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:06,810
Father, Mother, allow me to introduce her.

138
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,350
This is Ms. Nanase Sakura.

139
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,730
She is...

140
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,750
the woman I wish to marry.

141
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,790
My apologies, I lost my composure.

142
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:57,040
Let's eat before it gets cold.

143
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,380
Yes, let's eat! Come on, Kairi. Have a seat.

144
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,230
Let's eat. It'll get cold!

145
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,230
Time to dig in.

146
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,700
- Thank you for the food!
- Eat it while it's hot!

147
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,300
Wow, it looks delicious!

148
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,050
Hot!

149
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,760
Nanako, be careful! This is your second time.

150
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,460
It's tasty!

151
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,740
I'm glad you like it.

152
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:28,450
[Tendo]

153
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,780
Nishi?

154
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,720
Ryuko...

155
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,380
What brings you here, Nishi?

156
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:53,490
I'm here to apologize to your parents.

157
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,260
It's already settled.

158
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,350
What?

159
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,290
I think I've come to understand

160
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,560
why exactly I was attracted to you, Nishi.

161
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,360
Why's that?

162
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,720
You told me you liked me in an honest way.

163
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,780

00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,170
Okay.

325
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,930
Doctor, that's cheating!

326
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:56,360
All I did was stare at you.

327
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,090
One more! Rematch me, please!

328

You're close.

329
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,220
Stop that.

330
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,860
I won this time.

331
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,210
That was foul play.

332
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,900
Thank you very much.

335
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:08,810
What a life-changing decision!

336
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:12,060
We have to go congratulate her at some point.

337

You're right.

By the way, I'm sorry

339
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,860
for speaking my mind to your father.

340
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,170
It's fine.

341
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:32,590
It's been so long since I've seen my father smile.

342
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:38,360
At first, I thought he was scary,

343
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,660
but he's actually a nice person.

344
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,670
He's like you, Doctor.

You're making a big deal out of it.

"Just do it."

I'm a nurse.

Not only that, but I'm a nurse you mentored.

389

- Go.
- What?

391
00:33:56,190 --> 00:34:01,520
Study abroad. You want to go, don't you?

392
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,230
I won't go. There's no way I'd go!

393
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:13,820
Doctor, you may be fine with it.

394
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:22,460
But I can't bear being apart from you for a whole year.

395
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,070
Obviously, I...

396
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:37,150
don't want to be apart from you, either.

397

Then why...?

398

"Actually, I want to go". It's written all over your face.

399
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:08,710
On that day, right here...

400
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:15,200
I received two things from you, Doctor.

401
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,150
That is the feeling of love,

402
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:26,020
and your dream... the dream of saving people.

403
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:36,020
I... want to become even more qualified as a nurse.

404
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,030
Then don't hesitate and go.

405

As I am right now, I can't be strict with you.

Why is that?

Because all I can do now... is dote on you.

- Are you all prepared?
- Yes.

It's going to be lonely around here!

413
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,520
I'll be back in a year!

414
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,020
- I'll be praying for your swift recovery.
- That's important, too.

415
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,990
- I'll focus on my treatment.
- Please do.

Our Hero that caused the most worry...

417
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,750
I feel like a mother, watching over her little chicks leave the nest.

418
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:11,000
I'll do my best to soar.

419
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,530
- But to think the Hero would go...
- Exactly. I still can't believe it.

420
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:20,960
I thought Sakai would be the one to study abroad.

422
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,920
I'm off to assist Dr. Kisugi with his examinations.

423
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,750
I wish you the best of luck.

424
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:44,510
I'll go study hard, so I can catch up to you, Sakai.

425

You can leave now. You have dinner plans with Dr. Tendo tonight, right?

00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:58,950
Yes. It's my first time eating at a fancy restaurant!

427
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:02,300

440

We’ve only been apart for a few hours,

441
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:04,420
yet I become so lonely, my mind doesn't function.

442
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:10,410
But to be alone... from now on...

443
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,770
I’m not confident I can bear that solitude!

444
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,880
So Sakura's flight is today.

445
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,380
Yeah.

446
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,750
Are you going to the airport?

447
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:46,010
As soon as the press conference is over.

448

We would like to thank you for gathering here today.

449
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:57,850
As we have previously reported,

450
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:01,820
soon after we were given approval of the MMI artificial heart surgery,

451
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:08,510
our hospital created a surgical team with Dr. Tendo at its core…

452
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,600
Wait a second. Is it 6 PM?

453
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,610
Did the Hero say her flight was at 6 PM?

454
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,460
That's what I heard.

455
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,260
Did she mix it up with 16:00?

456
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,600
What?

457
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,690
You're right!

458
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,660
How can she make the mistake?

459
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:28,720
I don't think Dr. Tendo knows.

460
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,400
What's going on?

461
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:41,000
Until now, artificial hearts were used as a replacement for patients with severe heart failure.

462
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:45,660
The medical device works as a pump to restore blood circulation.

463
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:49,640
Normally, this medical device would be attached—

- However, recovery is—
- Please excuse us.

Dr. Tendo has been called for an urgent matter of utmost importance.

469
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:30,330
For here onwards, I will take up explanations.

474
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,530
Yes, please hurry!

475
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:13,070

Just let me embrace you for now.

As I said, the patient requested solely aspirin.
