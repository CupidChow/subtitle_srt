WINTER OF 2006

3
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,282
POLICE OFFICER ENTRANCE EXAM

4
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,630
That's 2,000 won, please.

5
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:02,103
The power is out again,
and my mom's not even here.

6
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,027
Where's the lighter?

7
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,914
Excuse me.

8
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,917
The last time we had a blackout,

9
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,337
the fruit store
across the street was robbed.

10
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,048
But they haven't caught who did it yet.

11
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,930
Never mind. Good night.

12
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:10,255
What is he doing? Why is he still here?

13

15
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,172
You hit on me first!

16
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,550
When I told my friends about it,

17
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,595
they said you must've been
interested in me.

18
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:41,679
SPRING OF 2008

19
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,724
I did you a big favor
by telling you I liked you first.

20
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,268
How dare you play hard to get?

21
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,145
I hate stuff like that.

22
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,397
Get up. It's late.

23
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:52,982
Go home.

24
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,445
Why do you care whether
I go home or sleep out here?

25
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,323
Who do you think you are?

26
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,367
Why do you care where I am?

27
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,828
Why do you call me?

28
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,960
When you don't go home, your mom
gets anxious and comes to me.

29
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,545
Give me a piggyback.

30
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,593
-What?
-I'm too exhausted to walk.

31
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,928
Carry me home.

32
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,730
Mister, just go on your way.

33
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,817
You're not supposed to talk to a woman
you're not interested in.

34
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,735
Have it your way.

35
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,491
You have feelings for me.

36
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,288
I know it. I can see it.

37
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,706
I can tell.

38
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,964
What do you know?

39
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,474
What do you know about me?

40
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,814
Do you want me to tell you?

41
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,192
About who I really am?

42
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,462
We found this in the warehouse back there.

43
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,797
We were wondering if it was yours.

44
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,457
Yes?

45
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,002
Did you call a cab?

46
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,382
No. I didn't call one.

47
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,927
Then what is the taxi doing here
right in front of my place?

48
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,971
But I needed one.

49
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,599
Maybe I should go ask.

50
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,030
Get in.

51
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,453
Is that your watch?

52
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,502
Detective Cha?

53
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,629
Yes?

54
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,965
The watch.
Should I hand it over to forensics?

55
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,977
SWEET PEANUT

56
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,364
It's nice to see you.
I really wanted to meet you.

57
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,369
How have you been hiding so well?

58
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,789
What do you want?

59
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,835
Jung Mi-suk.

60
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,046
Jung Mi-suk.

61
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:49,343
Jung Mi-suk? I'm sure
I've heard of the name before.

62
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,678
Jung Mi-suk?

63
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,139
-Isn't that the woman?
-Who?

64
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,433
The woman whose body wasn't found.

65
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,312
Gosh, I'm scared to even mention the name.

66
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,856
That's right. The last victim
Do Min-seok killed.

67
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,109
Hey, stay still, will you?

68
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,447
I know neither you nor Jung Mi-suk.

69
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,450
Oh, dear. You don't know.

70
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:17,788
I feel so bad, then. I guess
Nam Sun-gil got killed for nothing.

71
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,798
Take it or decline it.

72
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,522
-Yes?
-I found out who Jung Mi-suk is.

73
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,482
She's Do Min-seok's last victim.

74
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,192
What?

75
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,445
Don't you get it?
He's the victim's husband.

76
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,988
Where are you now?

77
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,745
-I'm nowâ€¦
-Where are you?

78
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,208
None of your business. I'm hanging up.

79
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,381
Your kid must've grown a lot.
Is it a girl or a boy?

80
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,311
You're on the run after committing murder,

81
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,022
but you got married and have a kid now?
How impressive.

82
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,775
I have nothing to do
with what Do Min-seok did.

83
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,152
Of course, you say that.

84
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:33,739
But,

85
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,326
just tell me if you want
any kind of compensation.

86
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,204
Who knows?

87
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,498
We might find common ground.

88
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,233
Gosh, what's going on?

89
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,487
This is mine.

90
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,243
I've been looking for it.
I guess I dropped it in the warehouse.

91
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,286
Thank you.

92
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,498
You're welcome. I'll get going, then.

93
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,711
A taxi driver is assaulting a passenger.

94
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:55,256
in front of a bed and breakfast
near a fishing site. Please send backup.

95
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,094
Wiretapping?
The police wiretapped by a criminal?

96
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,013
Why don't you go ask him
to catch criminals, then?

97
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,724
This is humiliating.

98
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,976
Calm down. We need
to catch Park Gyeong-chun first.

99
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,354
-What about the press?
-We'll have to deal with them.

100
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,566
Darn. Choi Jae-seop, that idiot.

101
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,651
-Hey, Choi Jae-seop.
-Sir.

102
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,945
Hey!

103
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:21,907
-What are you doing, sir?
-I'll kill Jae-seop and go to hell today.

104
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,993
I've solved countless cases until now.

105
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,328
You can't be like this
when I made one single mistake.

106
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,206
What? A mistake?
A cop can't afford to make any mistake.

107
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,751
-Let go of me!
-That's enough, Mr. Yoon.

108
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,878
Okay, I'll stop. Just let go of me.

109
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,839
Hey. Shouldn't you be investigating?
Just get back to work.

110
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:38,758
Come here.

111
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,764
My goodness.

112
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,266
How could you disgrace
the police like that?

113
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,518
I have sensitive hair. Let go of it.

114
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,396
How could a cop be fooled
by a criminal like that?

115
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,064
-Let go until I count to three.
-Go ahead.

116
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,399
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

117
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,486
Gosh, stop it.

118
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,113
-How dare you pull your boss' hair?
-This is self-defense.

119
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,616
-That's excessive self-defense, you idiot.
-Please stop.

120
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,160
-How dare youâ€¦
-Stop it.

121
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,620
-My gosh.
-Let go of it.

122
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,706
I told you to stop, you damn cops!

123
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,633
We have to catch Park Gyeong-chun tonight.

124
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,220
We're going to be slated
by everyone tomorrow morning.

125
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:28,349
We should at least catch the culprit
before the briefing if we're to save face.

126
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,478
So what's your plan?

127
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,356
Park Gyeong-chun drives a taxi.

128
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,775
I've contacted
the tachograph manufacturer.

129
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,570
And I already got Park Gyeong-chun's
call history and credit card statements.

130
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,950
Team Five is looking into
his family and financial status now.

131
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,454
Listen. We must catch him
before anyone else does.

132
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,374
If you let other stations find him first,

133
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,043
or fail to catch him by the morning,

134
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,839
I'll shave all of your heads
starting with you, okay?

135
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,426
And about the wiretapping,
make sure to keep your mouths shut.

136
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,095
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

137
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,681
Get on it now!
I can't stand the sight of you.

138
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,516
-Hey, let's go.
-My gosh.

139
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,892
-Damn it.
-Let's go.

140
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,982
Where are you now?

141
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:21,235
We got a report about a taxi driver
who kidnapped a passenger,

142
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,653
so we're on our way.

143
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,197
We will start tracking down
Park Gyeong-chun's taxi soon.

144
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,700
Be on standby
so you can move out right away.

145
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,076
Yes, sir.

146
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,120
Do Hyeon-su!

147
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,478
Well, Ji-won.

148
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,565
About the watch you got
from the police officer.

149
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,192
What?

150
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,529
Since when did you
carry around a spare watch?

151
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:15,497
The watch strap came off,
so I was going to have it repaired.

152
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,249
But I forgot it was in my pocket.

153
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,710
I've never seen it before, though.

154
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,880
When did you buy it?
It looked pretty expensive.

155
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,008
It's my husband's.

156
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,470
I was going to take it
to a repair shop on my way to work.

157
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,684
You just said it was yours.

158
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,814
What belongs to my husband is also mine.

159
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,653
Why do you even care about something
so trivial? We have no time for this.

160
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,075
Well, okay butâ€¦

161
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,078
Will you just let it go?

162
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,788
Why? What's wrong?

163
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,624
What's the big deal about the watch?

164
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,460
No, that's not what I was going to say.

165
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,422
You're not wearing your seat belt.
That's what I was trying to tell you.

166
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,801
You didn't even try to listen.

167
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,311
Gosh, not again.

168
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,647
Just mind your own head. It's done.

169
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,984
Gosh, whatever.

170
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,279
Doctor, I'm not the Kim Moo-jin
you used to know.

171
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,117
The head you just put stitches into

172
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,912
is not the same head that got hurt
from falling off a cultivator.

173
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,417
I got hurt this time while chasing
after a murderer. You should know that.

174
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,295
He's been searching all over
the neighborhood for his wife's body.

175
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,715
He ended up killing someone?

176
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,759
It's his mind that's sick.

177
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,804
Anyway, I should get back to work.

178
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,473
I hope they catch Do Hyeon-su soon.

179
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,351
What does he have to do with this?

180
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,271
They need to catch Do Hyeon-su
to find the body.

181
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,272
Why?

182
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,315
You're so clueless.

183
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,693
He must know where the body is

184
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,529
because he went around
killing people with his dad.

185
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,866
Doctor, this is called witch-hunting.

186
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,077
The police concluded a long time ago
that Do Min-seok acted alone.

187
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:21,957
Do Hyeon-su is not a serial killer.
He's just a killer.

188
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,043
He did it with his dad.
What are you talking about?

189
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:28,380
Guilt by association
isn't trendy anymore, Doctor.

190
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,674
How can you be so ignorant
when you're a reporter?

191
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:35,179
Gosh, you're educated enough.
You shouldn't mislead people like that.

192
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,015
Do you really not know?

193
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,350
Know what?

194
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,227
Thatâ€¦

195
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,815
Gosh, this is frustrating.

196
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,776
I'm the one who's frustrated.

197
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,695
What is it that I don't know?

198
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,489
Was it this guy?

199
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,326
Yes, it was him.

200
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,995
He beat up my customer
and dragged him away.

201
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,705
I was so terrified.

202
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,210
Yes, Captain. It was Park Gyeong-chun.

203
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,799
Do you know the victim?

204
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:16,428
No. He seemed to be from another town.
He said he was here on vacation.

205
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,347
How did he pay?

206
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,016
-He paid in cash.
-What about a cash receipt?

207
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,142
He didn't get one.

208
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,441
Gosh, this must be his phone.

209
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,736
This is exactly where it happened.

210
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,697
What's going on?

211
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,408
What do I do, Ho-jun?

212
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,661
I think my husband is the oneâ€¦

213
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,373
who was abducted.

214
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,793
What? What are you talking about?

215
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,588
I know I'm not making any sense now.

216
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,842
But this phone belongs to my husband.

217
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,095
What? But howâ€¦

218
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,936
Is this the guy

219
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,314
who was kidnapped?

220
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,942
Yes. I'm sure it was him.

221
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,113
Hello, Detective Choi.

222
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,699
Park Gyeong-chun is still
near the village. Where are you now?

223
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,034
We're at the bed and breakfast.

224
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,623
Can you locate Park Gyeong-chun's taxi?

225
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,334
What are you waiting for? Get in the car!

226
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,214
Move the car.

227
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,551
What? Ji-won.

228
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:43,575
Park Gyeong-chun isn't speeding that much.
I bet he's not in a hurry.

229
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,620
Take the road along the reservoir.
You can catch up with him.

230
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,206
Gosh, Ji-won. Slow down.

231
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,626
My gosh.

232
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,059
Gosh, Ji-won.

233
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,110
Ho-jun. Wake up, Ho-jun!

234
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,573
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

235
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,034
I'm fine.

236
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,495
I'm sorry.

237
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,706
I forgot that you were in the car.

238
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,961
I must've lost my mind.

239
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,214
What's wrong with me?

240
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,508
We have no time for this.

241
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,301
We have to find your husband.

242
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,679
We have to.

243
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,933
So what is it that I don't know, Doctor?

244
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,061
Tell me what it is.

245
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,439
Why are you so impatient?

246
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:01,982
Hang on.

247
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,526
I need to take my medicine now.

248
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,154
I'll tell you after taking this.

249
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,826
Have a seat. Just sit.

250
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,299
Soâ€¦

251
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,594
The thing isâ€¦

252
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,389
Darn it.

253
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,309
Are you feeling all right?

254
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,104
I'm from Yeonju Police Station.

255
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,815
I'd like you to testify about

256
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,234
the trespass and assault case
on Ms. Oh Bok-ja.

257
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,487
-We need your statement.
-Okay.

258
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,655
Gyeong-sik, you tell him.

259
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,407
Sorry?

260
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:56,745
He worked on the serial murder case
when he was a constable.

261
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,249
And he's a reporter from Seoul.

262
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,920
You should tell him the story.

263
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,422
He won't leave until he hears about it.

264
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,341
What story?

265
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,468
You know the story.

266
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,764
Oh, that one.

267
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:18,808
Doctor.

268
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:22,103
I'm not supposed
to tell civilians about it.

269
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,357
It's been 18 years already.
What's the big deal?

270
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,695
That wasâ€¦

271
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,200
I don't think I should.

272
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,785
I guess you're right.

273
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,579
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

274
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,040
Just let me in on it.

275
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:47,879
A witness.

276
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,549
A witness?

277
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,176
What witness?

278
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,847
Baek Hee-seong.

279
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,440
Do Hyeon-su has
a driver's license in the name

280
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,109
of Baek Hee-seong.

281
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,154
Why is that?

282
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,840
So you got a new identity?

283
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:16,801
My gosh.

284
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,350
Who would've imagined that?

285
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,520
A serial killer

286
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:32,400
changed his identity,
got married, and had a kid.

287
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:38,239
And he even gets his hair
trimmed regularly like this.

288
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,667
Do you want to be more jealous?

289
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,046
I have a two-story house in Seoul.

290
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:54,923
I own it.

291
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,258
Of course,

292
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,137
the bank has a bigger share for now.

293
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:07,977
Are you laughing?

294
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,985
Isn't it pathetic?

295
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,323
What's so pathetic?

296
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,746
The one you wanted
to take revenge on is dead.

297
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,834
So you thought Do Hyeon-su,
Do Min-seok's son, might be

298
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,630
the perfect target
to vent your unresolved anger on.

299
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,221
"He's just like his father."

300
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,725
"He's possessed by an evil spirit."
"He was in a mental hospital."

301
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,435
"He is heartless."

302
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,270
"They were always together."

303
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,106
-They were always together.
-He's just like his father.

304
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:56,276
-He's possessed by an evil spirit.
-He was in a mental hospital.

305
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,695
"He knew all about
what his father had done."

306
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,697
"They did it together."

307
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,203
Isn't that it?

308
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,292
You're just as I heard.

309
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,837
Are you really fearless?

310
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,173
You know

311
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,760
I can kill you with a single stroke now.

312
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:29,809
When I can see through you,

313
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,729
why should I fear you?

314
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,275
It's just boring.

315
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,284
But you do feel pain.

316
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,294
I will

317
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,924
torment you until you give me
the right answer.

318
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,803
Tell me.

319
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,764
Where's Jung Mi-suk?

320
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:15,313
You could've done it.

321
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,191
What?

322
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,277
Say that again.

323
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,239
It wasâ€¦

324
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,282
close enoughâ€¦

325
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:49,931
Revenge?

326
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,272
You've failed completely.

327
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,275
You fail even if you kill me.

328
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,528
If you cut off my limbs

329
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:06,656
and put numerous holes
in my body, you will still fail.

330
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,907
Becauseâ€¦

331
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,952
I don't have the ability

332
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,163
to prove

333
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,835
what I don't know and what I didn't do.

334
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,336
Do you understand?

335
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,684
It's obvious what you will do to me.

336
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,271
Butâ€¦

337
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,984
I wonder how you willâ€¦

338
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,821
be ruined.

339
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,576
Why don't you show me?

340
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,237
Are you guys all right?

341
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,447
We're fine.

342
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:33,618
But we have to find
Park Gyeong-chun as soon as possible.

343
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,370
We put up more security checks

344
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:39,248
and detectives are staking out his house,
workplace, and acquaintances' places.

345
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,752
We just asked for his tachograph record,
so we will find something soon.

346
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,213
Before that, have you
identified the victim?

347
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,426
I think it's my husband.

348
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,096
What? What are you talking about?

349
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,140
The victim of the kidnapping is Hee-seong.

350
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,059
What? But why?

351
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,771
I don't know. I have no idea.

352
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,648
I don't know anything now.

353
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:07,443
I don't even know
why he was in the bed and breakfast.

354
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,488
The owner said he was on vacation.

355
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,909
Jae-seop, what am I supposed to do?

356
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:18,079
Let me do something.
I have to do something.

357
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,540
Otherwise, I will lose my mind.

358
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,335
How dare the scumbag
mess with a cop's family?

359
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,212
What should I do now?

360
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,632
-Ji-won, please calm down.
-Don't tell me to calm down!

361
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,303
He kidnapped your husband.
It means he has a place to confine him.

362
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,305
He's a taxi driver.

363
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,684
Abandoned factories, abandoned buildings,
and redevelopment areas.

364
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,270
He must know
tons of places like that in Seoul.

365
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,440
We'll find it once we analyze
his tachograph record.

366
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,275
"Once we analyze"?

367
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,570
Okay.

368
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:55,491
Of course, we'll find it.
Along with my husband's mangled corpse!

369
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,163
-Ji-won.
-Jae-seop.

370
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,876
I want to find my husband,
not Park Gyeong-chun.

371
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,210
While he's still alive!

372
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,798
You saw how Park Gyeong-chun
murdered Nam Sun-gil.

373
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,469
We're trying our best.
You know that better than anyone.

374
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,180
You've dealt with
a lot of criminals like him.

375
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:20,558
You're the one who caught
the Juha-dong kidnapper last year.

376
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,268
Even before a suspect was identified.

377
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:25,521
That was just innate instinct.
You know, like animals have.

378
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,733
I was snooping around, talking to people,
when he suddenly caught my eyes.

379
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:31,486
I literally got goosebumps on my arms.

380
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:35,239
That's why you followed him around
and did some digging to find the evidence.

381
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,327
Criminals like him
must have certain habits.

382
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,454
I can't just sit around and wait.

383
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,790
Tell me what to do right now.

384
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,042
Please come up with something.

385
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,628
What can we do right now?

386
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,006
Hang on.

387
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,885
What made me do it?

388
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,305
Why did I find him suspicious?

389
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,308
Why was that, Ji-won?

390
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,315
That's right. I remember.

391
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:14,612
I'll see you guys
at Park Gyeong-chun's house now. Hurry.

392
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,492
"Kidnapped"?

393
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,412
Who kidnapped him?

394
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:26,999
We believe it's the suspect
in the Chinese restaurant murder case,

395
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,751
so we're working on it.

396
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,962
What does Hee-seong
have to do with the case?

397
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:35,883
Why would the suspect
kidnap my son, Detective?

398
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:40,680
Have you heard of a Do Hyeon-su?

399
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,687
No. I've never heard that name before.

400
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,856
Do Hyeon-su has been on the run

401
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:53,109
since he killed the village head
in Yeonju 18 years ago.

402
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,404
And do you remember the serial murder case

403
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,531
that happened in Yeonju?

404
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,116
No. I don't know.

405
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,662
Oh, right. I think I remember it vaguely.

406
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,208
Do Hyeon-su is the son
of the serial killer,

407
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,918
Do Min-seok.

408
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,629
So?

409
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,884
What does Do Hyeon-su
have to do with my son?

410
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,471
Your son's kidnapper has only one target.

411
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,099
It's Do Hyeon-su.

412
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,270
We believe he's trying to make it look

413
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,565
as if Do Hyeon-su did the murder
so the police will find him.

414
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:35,902
And we think kidnapping your son
is part of his plan.

415
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:39,822
So what is the kidnapper trying to do

416
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,532
with Do Hyeon-su?

417
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,452
Honey, let's leave it

418
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,246
to the detectives.

419
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:56,005
Our current priority
is to rescue your son.

420
00:36:56,088 --> 00:37:00,051
Detectives will be staking out
your house just in case.

421
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,845
Okay. I understand.

422
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:08,434
Please make sure to find my son.

423
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,145
We will.

424
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:33,292
-That went more smoothly than I expected.
-Pardon?

425
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:36,837
You know,
in situations like this, it's usually

426
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,258
very difficult to have a conversation
with the victim's family.

427
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:44,679
They beg us to save their child

428
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,807
and even question
the investigation process.

429
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,434
I also found that a little strange.

430
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:54,897
They seemed more interested
in the case than their son.

431
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:59,527
Well, you never know what kinds
of relationships family members have.

432
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,321
Let's go.

433
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,743
This is crazy.

434
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,579
What on earth has he been doing?

435
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:15,084
What did I tell you?
I said I should live with him.

436
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:18,170
That wouldn't have made any difference.

437
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:23,509
We knew something like this might happen
when we took in a guy with a shady past.

438
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,951
He kidnapped Hee-seong
knowing he's Do Hyeon-su.

439
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:50,536
I'm pretty sure.

440
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,832
What are we going to do now?

441
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,876
Once the culprit gets caught,

442
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:00,379
they will find out Hyeon-su has been
living with Hee-seong's identity.

443
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,173
If something happens to us,

444
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,676
who will take care of Hee-seong?

445
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,096
The culprit will

446
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,476
kill Do Hyeon-su for sure.

447
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:16,771
What?

448
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,069
Listen.

449
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,448
If Hyeon-su dies,

450
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,743
we will be the only ones
who know the truth.

451
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:36,874
We're just a poor old couple
who have been used by him.

452
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,584
We didn't know anything.

453
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,631
That he was the son of a serial killer.

454
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,550
That he was wanted for murder.

455
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,678
We didn't even know
that he was Do Hyeon-su.

456
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:56,519
We can be understood.

457
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,969
How much time do you think
you have until your lungs are

458
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,096
filled up with water?

459
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,890
The good news is

460
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,602
that you still have time
to defend yourself.

461
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,569
As I said,

462
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,613
I can't prove what I don't know.

463
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,159
May 12, 2002.

464
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,828
It was Sunday,
and the weather was very nice.

465
00:40:55,911 --> 00:41:00,291
It was a day that made me
want to go on a picnic or a date.

466
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,668
What did you do that day?

467
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,005
Are you

468
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,507
joking with me right now?

469
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,888
That's the day Mi-suk went missing.

470
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:18,017
A black SUV with the plate number, 3194.

471
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:22,480
Mi-suk was in the car
on the day of her disappearance.

472
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:25,691
Oh, right. You must know that
because it was your dad's car.

473
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,873
Where is it from?

474
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:41,957
-This timeâ€¦
-Yes.

475
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,876
â€¦let me give you some French wine.

476
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:47,755
Hey, you said we'd drink just a little.
But this is too much.

477
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:51,300
Who knew we'd hit it off like this?

478
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,468
I guess you're right.

479
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:56,388
But I think
I've been talking too much today.

480
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:01,268
You're not trying
to pull some trick on me, are you?

481
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,605
Gosh, what do you take me for?

482
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,941
-Fine.
-What?

483
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:07,858
Here.

484
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,611
What else?

485
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,489
What? Where did it go?

486
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,116
-What?
-My recorder.

487
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,493
I'm sure I had it in here.

488
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:20,454
Look at you. You're being suspicious.

489
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,709
You know what?
I'll give you an arrest warrant.

490
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,003
Here. Go ahead and search me.

491
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,006
I'll really do a body search.

492
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,511
Forget it. I believe you. Just sit.

493
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,847
Drink it up. Let's drink.

494
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,434
I'm going to make sure
you black out tonight.

495
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,146
-Let me go to the restroom.
-Okay.

496
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:03,497
It's 2002. May 12, 2002.

497
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:09,712
May 12, 2002.

498
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,755
At 2:00 a.m.

499
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:16,051
Sehyeon 2-dong.

500
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,680
Witness, Jang Yeong-hui.

501
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:24,018
Worked at JNQ Hotel.

502
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:31,442
Gosh, this is getting more interesting.

503
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,760
Sehyeon 2-dong intersection, at 2:30 a.m.

504
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:03,098
There was a witness who saw Mi-suk
being forced into Do Min-seok's car.

505
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:04,892
GYEONGGI 58 GA 3194

506
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:08,145
The witness memorized the plate number
and reported it to the police.

507
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,106
And Do Min-seok was investigated.

508
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,567
But he was released without charge.

509
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,075
Because his son

510
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:25,663
proved his alibi
for the time of the crime.

511
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:31,168
If Do Min-seok was caught back then,
Mi-suk wouldn't have died.

512
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:34,338
It was the last chance to save Mi-suk.

513
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,382
I just told them the truth.

514
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,968
From that morning until the next morning,

515
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,847
I was with my dad the whole time.

516
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,476
I consistently told them

517
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:51,230
the detailed information about
his whereabouts by ten minutes repeatedly.

518
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,360
If what you say is true,

519
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:02,074
it means Do Min-seok's car was going
around itself kidnapping people.

520
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,451
Because that's quite common, right?

521
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,954
The witness was drunkâ€¦

522
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:11,834
and changed the testimony later on.
Why are you leaving that out?

523
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,504
I gave a consistent testimony,

524
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,716
whereas the witness changed her statement.

525
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,134
She said she didn't remember.

526
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,888
Killing me

527
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,850
won't fill the holes in your imagination.

528
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,573
Why is itâ€¦

529
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,324
It seems familiar, doesn't it?

530
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:48,787
Mi-suk had the same thing.

531
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,498
But Nam Sun-gil said you used to carry it.

532
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:53,834
Why is that?

533
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,591
Why aren't you saying anything?

534
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,509
Tell me.

535
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:07,306
Who could've had Mi-suk's belongings that
she had until the moment she went missing?

536
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,099
Who do you think it is?

537
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,226
Tell me.

538
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,986
THE LATE DO MIN-SEOK

539
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:28,494
Hyeon-su.

540
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,795
What is this?

541
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:43,050
A golden fish brings good luck.

542
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,596
Make sure to carry it with you.

543
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,437
Ms. Do Hae-su, just a moment.

544
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,441
Ms. Do Hae-su, I'd like to interview you.

545
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,444
The people have the right to know.

546
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:06,323
Do Hyeon-su is getting
public attention again.

547
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:09,243
And some suspect that
you're harboring your brother.

548
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,331
She's coming out.

549
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,083
-What?
-Where?

550
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,963
Please go away. I don't know anything.

551
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:24,258
You were 19 when Do Min-seok
committed the killings.

552
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,052
Did you really not know
your father was a serial killer?

553
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,804
No, I didn't.

554
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:33,016
What about your college? After your father
turned out to be a serial killer,

555
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,561
and your brother killed
the village head and fled,

556
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:39,815
you went to art school. A prestigious
school that anyone would want to go to.

557
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,526
Please say something
to the victims' families.

558
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,029
I'm sorry.

559
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,741
Wait. If you have nothing
to do with Do Hyeon-su's escape,

560
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,994
why don't you reveal your face in public?

561
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,538
I think you're pretty.

562
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,502
I'm sorry.

563
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:03,755
-Wait.
-Open it, Ms. Do Hae-su.

564
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,550
Ms. Do Hae-su!

565
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,093
Does she really feel sorry?

566
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,429
-She is pretty, though.
-Open it.

567
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:33,994
I thought about why I was obsessed
with that guy Juha-dong kidnapping case.

568
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,162
And I remembered.

569
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:39,291
He lived in the redevelopment area,
but his door lock seemed quite fancy.

570
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,792
I could tell it was new.

571
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:44,421
He was about to move out, but he had one
with auto-lock and fingerprint scanning.

572
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:47,966
Park Gyeong-chun would've needed
a lock as well to control his hideout.

573
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,678
Exactly. He must've had a locksmith
install one and he must've paid for it.

574
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:55,432
If we search his house,
we'll find something for sure.

575
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,991
Go ahead and explain.

576
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:17,245
How did Mi-suk's belonging
end up in your hands?

577
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:34,137
Why? Why can't you say anything?

578
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,807
You've been rattling on
without batting an eyelid.

579
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:39,768
But you can't explain this?

580
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,066
Tell me.

581
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,069
Where's Jung Mi-suk?

582
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,294
It's over there.

583
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,137
Spread out.

584
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,881
Take a look at this.

585
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:52,132
DOOR LOCK, LOCK AND KEY

586
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,218
Find the rest of the number.

587
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,101
It's here.

588
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,109
TELEPHONE

589
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,028
I remember.

590
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:16,406
Reconstruction of the building
has been on hold for a while.

591
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,284
So I thought it was strange
that he wanted a new door lock.

592
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,176
Where did you bury Mi-suk?
Just tell me that.

593
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:40,597
Then I will spare your life.

594
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,766
I don't know.

595
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,561
If you consider yourself a human being,

596
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:52,150
you should live as one at least
for a moment, don't you think?

597
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,907
In the dark, damp, and cold place,

598
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,367
she must be waiting

599
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,495
for me to get her out.

600
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,582
Please tell me. I'm begging you.

601
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:09,835
Please.

602
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,087
It wasn't me.

603
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,709
There's a taxi.

604
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,549
Ask for backup and block the exit.

605
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:02,179
We've located Park Gyeong-chun.
Send backup.

606
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:03,138
Move over!

607
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:04,115
Park Gyeong-chun, you're under arrest

608
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:07,077
for murdering Nam Sun-gil
and kidnapping Baek Hee-seong.

609
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,335
Park Gyeong-chun!

610
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:01,923
Drop the knife.

611
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:03,800
I said drop the knife!

612
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,640
Hey, just shoot him.

613
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,143
-Go ahead and shoot him.
-Shoot me!

614
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,352
Let's see who will die.

615
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:57,562
Go ahead. Just shoot him.

616
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:58,772
Move out of my way.

617
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,857
Move!

618
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,716
Detective Choi. Wake up.

619
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:28,927
Detective Choi!

620
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,288
Do you want me to tell you

621
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,291
what kind of person I am?

622
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:07,090
I didn't even finish high school.

623
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,135
Why not?

624
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:13,263
No reason. I had a hard time adjusting.

625
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,058
I used to live on the street.

626
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:21,646
Back then, all I did was get into fights.

627
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,276
Have you punched anyone before?

628
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:29,320
No.

629
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:33,616
I beat someone up
and didn't even feel my fists being cut.

630
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:36,995
When I did thatâ€¦

631
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:41,416
I felt really good.

632
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,172
Andâ€¦

633
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,353
I also see things.

634
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,197
There's something wrong with this.

635
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,373
What do you see?

636
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,379
A dead person.

637
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:33,176
You must've loved the person a lot.

638
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:38,348
I've seen my late grandma in my dream too.

639
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:42,936
"Grandma, you should go now."

640
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,564
"Don't worry about me
and rest in peace," I said.

641
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:49,359
Then she turned around and left silently.

642
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,112
You're soâ€¦

643
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,366
You're so clueless.

644
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:02,080
You feel bad that you're no better
than me and have nothing?

645
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:07,293
-I don't have feelings like that.
-You have only one problem.

646
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:11,464
You can't see yourself the way I see you.

647
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:18,304
I'll love you even more from now on.

648
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,557
I will be really good to you.

649
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,643
I'll teach you what you don't know.

650
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,483
Then everything will change at some point.

651
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,278
Like magic.

652
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,252
See? You're doing it again.

653
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:54,132
You're staring at me like that again.
It makes my heart flutter.

654
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,845
And yet you say
you have no feelings for me.

655
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:06,311
I really

656
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:09,230
don't get you.

657
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,526
Is thatâ€¦

658
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,697
a confession?

659
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,539
The mood is nice out here,

660
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:30,501
and I have nothing else to say.
Let's just make out.

661
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:55,902
Dad.

662
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:59,072
Please leave now.

663
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,825
I want to stay here.

664
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:05,745
Please. Please go away.

665
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,157
What do we do now?

666
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,035
Do you want to have a drink?

667
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:23,758
No, Hee-seong!

668
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:36,145
Help!

669
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:45,404
I always thought

670
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:49,992
I was lucky to have met you.

671
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,454
But,

672
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,791
for this time, I feelâ€¦

673
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,087
you should never have met me.

674
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,424
Right.

675
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:10,012
I finally understand
what you meant back then.

676
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:12,014
I'mâ€¦

677
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:18,563
sorry.

678
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:43,880
