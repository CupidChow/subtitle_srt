1
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,411
How do you like it here?

2
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,872
FALL 2005

3
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,624
I get three meals a day,
and the bed is comfortable.

4
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,503
I'm comfortably confined here.

5
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:49,007
You're quite bold, aren't you?

6
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,468
I like that.

7
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,512
I have a question.

8
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:56,890
Sure, anything.

9
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,893
I'm the one who got hit by the car,

10
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,645
so why is the driver in a coma?

11
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,999
It's similar to the reason
that you've become a fugitive.

12
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,212
An incident no one intended happened.

13
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,299
What kind of benefit do you get

14
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,554
for giving me his identity?

15
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:47,941
I may have lost my son,
but I want to protect everything else.

16
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,945
My wife and myself.

17
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,699
Last week,

18
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,078
I became the chief of surgery.

19
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,749
Do you know what that means?

20
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,463
It means if people find out
about your son's condition,

21
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,466
you may lose your position.

22
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,261
That's right.

23
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,555
What if I refuse?

24
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,850
What will you do to me?

25
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,983
I don't need to do anything.
Isn't it obvious?

26
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:35,655
You'll be sent to prison,
and my life will be ruined.

27
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,664
What do you need me to do?

28
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,172
This is my son's past.

29
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,677
He finished his military service last year
and has been preparing for CSAT.

30
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,804
CERTIFICATE OF AWARD

31
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,182
Take a look at his social media pages

32
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,642
to find out about people around him.

33
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,603
OUR SMART BOY

34
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,565
You can just slowly cut ties
with all of them.

35
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,193
The real problem…

36
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,198
is this.

37
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,420
RESERVE FORCES TRAINING NOTICE
BAEK HEE-SEONG

38
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:36,174
Do you think you can become even bolder?

39
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,150
VERIFICATION FAILED

40
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,485
It's acting up again.

41
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,487
I'm sorry, but could you do it again?

42
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,697
It usually fails three out of ten times.

43
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,369
I have a tight schedule.
Do I need to keep doing this?

44
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,123
Then let me ask you a few questions.

45
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,001
Could you tell me your parents' names?

46
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,090
Baek Man-u and Gong Mi-ja.

47
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,386
And your home address?

48
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,681
488-2 Hanjeong-dong, Yongsan-gu, Seoul.

49
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,143
Okay, everything looks right.

50
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,355
I'll print out the certificate
for confirmation now. Wait one moment.

51
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,906
Here you go. It'll expire in a month.

52
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,325
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

53
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,412
CERTIFICATE FOR CONFIRMATION
OF ID CARD RE-ISSUANCE

54
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,581
NAME: BAEK HEE-SEONG

55
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,959
You're so shameless.

56
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,838
No matter how much I think about it,
you're so shameless.

57
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,673
You want me to find your sister?

58
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,134
Why would I do that?

59
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,470
Ji-won…

60
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,934
wants to catch Do Hyeon-su.

61
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,187
What? Why all of a sudden?

62
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:18,860
Because you made him
an accomplice in the serial killing.

63
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,200
Do you really believe
that I was my father's accomplice?

64
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,953
So?

65
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,623
Do you think you can catch the accomplice?

66
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,168
How?

67
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,837
Why are you looking for your sister?

68
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:53,436
She's met the accomplice before.

69
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:00,443
If you agree to help me,
I'll tell you everything I know.

70
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,820
Who knows?

71
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,866
You could be the one who reveals
the face of the accomplice

72
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,286
in the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

73
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,555
Kim Moo-jin?

74
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,809
He went to see him this late at night?

75
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:37,021
Why? What is he up to?

76
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,581
-Where have you been?
-What?

77
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,086
I must've woken you up.

78
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,089
I couldn't sleep,
so I went to the workshop.

79
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,091
Liar.

80
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,805
I can smell your car's air freshener.

81
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,437
Why are you upset?

82
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:25,319
Upset? I'm not upset.

83
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,408
I see. I thought you were.

84
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,041
I took some stuff out of the car.

85
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,128
The materials I picked up yesterday.

86
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,014
Turn over.

87
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,276
Happy now?

88
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,028
Yes.

89
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,642
He was at the workshop
from the morning to 3:00 p.m.

90
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:51,405
Are you sure we can catch
the lettuce thief by sitting here?

91
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,325
That's how they do it.

92
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:58,371
They train minors with small crimes
and make them commit bigger ones.

93
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,957
Just trust me and wait.

94
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,561
Seong-sik has finally found his prey.

95
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:26,732
Ji-won, six o'clock. The woman in her 20s
wearing a striped shirt is yours.

96
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,650
Okay.

97
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,986
-We'll take care of Seong-sik's crew.
-Yes, sir.

98
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:34,657
We need to catch the minor to arrest
Seong-sik for inciting theft. Got it?

99
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,138
Let's go.

100
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,728
Are you sure that's yours?

101
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,027
In-seo? You're In-seo, right?

102
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,946
What are you doing here?

103
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,412
In-seo!

104
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,707
-Don't follow me!
-I won't.

105
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,294
Let's talk. First, let's go home.

106
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,379
Your mom must be worried.

107
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:31,881
I've ruined everything.

108
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,636
My mom, dad, and our house.
It's all my fault.

109
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,471
What?

110
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,101
I know you have a reason for lying.

111
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,021
I thought if I made Dad

112
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,191
a bad person,

113
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,195
Mom would be less sad.

114
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,864
I'm sorry.

115
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,824
I regret it so much.

116
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,161
I should've turned a blind eye then.

117
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,511
After my husband was arrested…

118
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,266
In-seo started going astray.

119
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,397
I think it tormented him to be with me…

120
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,275
since I reminded him of his dad.

121
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,284
The police keep telling me to wait.

122
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,121
But waiting like this…

123
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,958
is too hard for me.

124
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,795
If he's just run away from home,
you just have to wait and--

125
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,463
You should check the Internet cafe

126
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,550
near the five-way intersection
in Bangjeong-dong.

127
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,596
Okay. I should get going, then.

128
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,223
Goodbye.

129
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,397
Do you think In-seo is still there?

130
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,274
He saw us there.

131
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,901
She just gave her something to do.

132
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,027
Well done.

133
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,321
Had In-seo

134
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,242
kept it secret,

135
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,996
don't you think his family
would've been better off?

136
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,082
How could one pretend not to know
something he already knows?

137
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:32,918
I mean,

138
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,882
he must've had many good memories about
his family. He could've kept it secret.

139
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,717
What if it were you?

140
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,512
Do you think you wouldn't doubt
those good memories?

141
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,893
Are you sure you wouldn't question
whether they were being true to you?

142
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,689
That would've been even worse.

143
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,066
We're having a company dinner tonight.

144
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,616
Try to wrap up the cases you work on
by the end of the week.

145
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,368
We've been chosen, haven't we?

146
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,913
We'll be reinvestigating
the Yeonju Serial Murder Case, right?

147
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,165
Seriously?

148
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:26,722
I bet Do Hyeon-su is still metal crafting.

149
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,392
Even people who didn't know much about
metal crafting could tell he was good.

150
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,031
KIM MOO-JIN

151
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:48,953
Yes?

152
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,330
I found Hae-su.

153
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,378
-Already?
-I'm that good.

154
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,635
Have you been in touch with her all along?

155
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:08,055
Come by 7:00 p.m. today.
I'll text you the location later.

156
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,351
Okay. Also…

157
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,647
I have one more favor to ask you.

158
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,192
How would you have managed without me?

159
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,113
I looked into Jung Mi-suk's files
and found something strange.

160
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,116
Jung Mi-suk packed up and left
after fighting with her husband,

161
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,452
so why did Park Gyeong-chun
report her missing?

162
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,205
That is strange.

163
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:37,209
Go visit Park Gyeong-chun.
If you mention me, he'll cooperate.

164
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,088
By the way, where's my thank you?

165
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,591
Hello?

166
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:50,514
Keep this up,
and I may turn you in for reward money.

167
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,019
That'll be all for today. Wrap it up well.

168
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,353
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

169
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,856
Thank you.

170
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,984
Thank you.

171
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,958
Hyeon-su didn't do
anything wrong. I did it.

172
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,419
I killed him.

173
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,012
How could you

174
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,433
leave without giving me a chance to talk?

175
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,603
I'm sorry.

176
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,563
What?

177
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,441
No, I wasn't asking for an apology.

178
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,984
I wanted you to know that

179
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,612
because it is the truth.

180
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,405
Right.

181
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:53,285
I came here to drop a bomb on you as well.

182
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,877
I'm prepared.

183
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,297
Every day has been a living hell
ever since that day.

184
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,596
I found your brother.

185
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,687
I'm that good.

186
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,983
About the reinvestigation
of the Yeonju case…

187
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,694
I'm sure you already know,

188
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,823
but the high-ups want our team
to take up the case.

189
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,533
What do you think?

190
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,994
Of course, we should.
We solved the Park Gyeong-chun case.

191
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,495
Right, Ji-won?

192
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,665
Is this a good thing?

193
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,250
I'm not too sure.

194
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,129
We'll be catching a serial killer.
What's there to hesitate about?

195
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,672
I'm against it.

196
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,845
It's a high-profile case, but
it's highly unlikely that it'll be solved.

197
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,016
You're so clueless.
If it's us, it can be solved.

198
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,642
We don't have any key suspects.

199
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:02,438
It's been almost 20 years now.
We won't find any evidence or witnesses.

200
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,441
Of course, we have a suspect. Do Hyeon-su.

201
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,404
The very fact that you're obsessing
over a ghost like him

202
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,823
proves that we're completely lost
on this case.

203
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:16,076
You were bugged by Park Gyeong-chun
because you kept mentioning Do Hyeon-su.

204
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,749
Do you have to rub salt
into my wound like that?

205
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,335
What I'm saying is,
we've already become too biased

206
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,171
due to the Park Gyeong-chun case.

207
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,257
We can't begin the reinvestigation
with a clean slate.

208
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,052
Hand it over to another team, okay?

209
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,475
What is it?

210
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,479
This is unlike you.

211
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,523
To be frank, I thought you'd be happiest

212
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,026
to hear about the reinvestigation.

213
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,530
I was just being reasonable.

214
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,450
You're acting really suspicious
these days.

215
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,161
You're always lost in thought,

216
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,080
you leave without a word,

217
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,415
and you're uninterested
in the investigation.

218
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:04,875
Are you…

219
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,257
working on another case by yourself?

220
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,301
-What?
-Seriously?

221
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,969
You've kept it secret from us?

222
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,013
I'm a bit hurt to hear that.

223
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,140
Did you find something suspicious?

224
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,350
No.

225
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,311
Why would I do that?
It's nothing like that.

226
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,525
Put on a poker face at least.

227
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,193
Who is it? Your source?

228
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,570
Ji-won, we've caught you.

229
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,157
That's enough.
We should understand if it's a secret.

230
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,744
It's my husband.

231
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,083
I'm going to be a bit late today.

232
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,711
Do you remember
the planning director of Athena?

233
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,839
The person who wanted
to hold an exhibition?

234
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,715
I thought you turned it down.

235
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:59,471
I did, but he kept calling me,
so I met with him. But it's talking long.

236
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:01,807
Are you drinking?

237
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,017
Just a little bit.

238
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,271
-Don't drink too much.
-I won't.

239
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,397
Okay.

240
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,704
He's lying again.

241
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,661
MARRONNIER PUB

242
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:13,981
I was never

243
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,608
going to look for you.

244
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,700
But there's a problem.

245
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,287
I need your help.

246
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,793
At our dad's funeral,
someone approached you.

247
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,879
He gave you a fish keychain…

248
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,766
Did you do this?

249
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,935
I came here…

250
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,940
to tell him not to perform exorcisms…

251
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,777
on you anymore.

252
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,321
But he suddenly…

253
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,199
He suddenly tried to…

254
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,500
DO HYEON-SU

255
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,712
Hyeon-su.

256
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,217
Hyeon-su, don't do this.

257
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,177
Give that

258
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,513
to me.

259
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,683
You shouldn't do this.

260
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,477
Hae-su.

261
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,271
This doesn't feel too bad.

262
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,067
It really doesn't.

263
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:24,903
Hyeon-su.

264
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,656
You should live a normal life.

265
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,117
Strive to live a good life.

266
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,078
I have no hope anyway.

267
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,998
So it's fine.

268
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,178
Have you been well?

269
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,145
"Have you been well?"

270
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:02,357
"How could you live well
after leaving me like that?"

271
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,609
"Can you sleep or eat in peace?"

272
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,778
This is what you should say.
You should hate me.

273
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:10,407
How could you ask me
how I've been doing, you fool?

274
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,334
Don't be mistaken.

275
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,337
That was my choice.

276
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,038
I can't believe I'm doing this for you.

277
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:15,764
Try it.

278
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,642
It's been a while, so it may not be good.

279
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:29,361
What? Are you expecting me to feed you?

280
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,821
I can't use chopsticks well.

281
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,493
My goodness.

282
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,673
You should blow on it first.

283
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,552
Am I your slave or what?

284
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,234
How does it taste?

285
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,155
How is it?

286
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,241
Is it not good?

287
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,536
It's tastier than my mom's.

288
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:22,581
Really?

289
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,167
But my dad's food is tastier.

290
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,921
You're one cheeky little girl, aren't you?

291
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,898
What are you doing?

292
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,071
How could you not notice that I was home?

293
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:59,659
Well… I was…

294
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,247
Eun-ha, say hi to your grandpa.

295
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,125
Hello.

296
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,254
Hi. Have fun.

297
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,428
I need to talk to you.

298
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,410
How could you bring someone in here?

299
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,621
Are you out of your mind?

300
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,707
How thoughtless can you be?

301
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:49,793
She's a little kid.

302
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,004
I just brought
a six-year-old home to feed her.

303
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,298
Is that something to get worked up about?

304
00:27:56,257 --> 00:28:00,011
Don't you even feel bad for Hee-seong?

305
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,515
How could you laugh here

306
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,643
when he's lying in bed in this house?

307
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,939
You want me to live
with guilt forever, don't you?

308
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,274
I want to live

309
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,070
like everyone else.

310
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:20,365
Then you shouldn't have done that to him!

311
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,832
Watching her eat what I made

312
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,127
and smelling food in this house

313
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,879
made me teary-eyed.

314
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,510
Your depression is back.

315
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,887
You should go to the hospital.

316
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,306
What?

317
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,275
Ma'am, I need to pee.

318
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,161
Ma'am, I said, I need to pee.

319
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:26,639
What?

320
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:06,554
Every day in that room,

321
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,849
Hee-seong can't smell anything

322
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:13,853
and is only fed tasteless rice gruel.

323
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,481
And yet…

324
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:21,611
you teared up over the smell of food?

325
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,322
How could you call yourself a mother?

326
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,371
Where were you

327
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,290
when Hee-seong was learning how to walk?

328
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,504
Where were you when he first learned

329
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,923
how to write his name?

330
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,511
When he was hospitalized
for pneumonia, attended competitions,

331
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,806
and brought home awards, where were you?

332
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,182
That's enough.

333
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:56,396
Where were you when he got into the car
accident and cried out for help from you?

334
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,232
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

335
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:03,361
I did my utmost best.

336
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,321
To keep him barely breathing?

337
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,200
Was that for him? Or for me?

338
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:12,537
No. It was all for yourself.

339
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,501
You're the only one among us
who's living like a decent human being.

340
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:23,798
I'm going insane,
and Hee-seong is good as dead.

341
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,133
Do you call that living?

342
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,052
If he could talk, he'd beg us

343
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,345
to kill him--

344
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,066
I'm sorry.

345
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,570
I lost it for a moment.

346
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,075
See?

347
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,412
This is the most you can take.

348
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,124
I poked at your wound a little,

349
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,085
and you took off

350
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,796
your dignified mask so easily.

351
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:20,063
I need to pee,
but I can't find the bathroom.

352
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:31,074
A mere six-year-old
was wandering around our house.

353
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,827
Make sure she doesn't say anything.

354
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,808
Let's go. I'll take you to the bathroom.

355
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,939
And you should go home after that.

356
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,620
You're crying again?

357
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,208
I'm just so happy.

358
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,837
What's her name?

359
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,006
Baek Eun-ha.

360
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,133
Baek Hee-seong.

361
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,593
Baek Eun-ha.

362
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,181
Look at this.

363
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,644
Don't they look alike?

364
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,897
They have the same personality too.

365
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,360
She's not like me. I'm sure of it.

366
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,447
I kept checking as I raised her.

367
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,116
Hyeon-su.

368
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,872
You've changed a lot.

369
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,833
What?

370
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,502
Did you not think I'd age?

371
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,006
That's not what I meant.

372
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,428
Hae-su.

373
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,806
I never worried about you.

374
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,726
I only thought about myself.

375
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:29,358
This time too. I reached out to you
just because I needed help.

376
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,527
I'll help in any way I can.

377
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,577
Our father had an accomplice.

378
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,083
And you've met them.

379
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:50,588
I've met his accomplice?

380
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,175
You've talked with them too.

381
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,428
I think it was at Dad's funeral.

382
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,147
The fish keychain you gave me back then…

383
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,111
used to belong to Jung Mi-suk,
his last victim.

384
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:16,948
What?

385
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,829
He's looking for the accomplice.

386
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:26,874
Hyeon-su wasn't the accomplice.

387
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:31,629
Because of that,
Park Gyeong-chun, her husband,

388
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,715
mistook me for the accomplice
and committed those crimes.

389
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:38,177
He and Park Gyeong-chun
made a deal as I thought.

390
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,097
That's why he didn't talk about Hyeon-su.

391
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,894
A detective visited me
because of that case.

392
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,566
Back then, I had no idea I'd meet you…

393
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:54,735
Ms. Do Hae-su?

394
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,989
I'm Detective Cha Ji-won,
the one who called.

395
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,161
Hyeon-su, your…

396
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,248
Your wife isn't…

397
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,627
No, right?

398
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,636
You're right. She's a detective.

399
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,307
She was in charge
of the Park Gyeong-chun case.

400
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,103
I'm still walking on thin ice.

401
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,939
I can't make any mistakes.

402
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,860
Don't worry.

403
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,279
I won't make any.

404
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:46,204
I'm going to live as Baek Hee-seong
until the day I die.

405
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:50,666
Do

406
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,835
you…

407
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,340
love her?

408
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,475
No.

409
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:14,065
I've never loved her.
Not even for a moment.

410
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,319
I don't know how love feels.

411
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,990
You should've known.

412
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,368
What were you expecting?

413
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,004
MOM

414
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,180
Hey, Eun-ha.

415
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,599
At least your mom picked up.

416
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,269
Mom, Dad's not picking up.

417
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,022
I wanted to show him my drawing.

418
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,775
Show it to me instead.

419
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,278
Ta-da. It's our house.

420
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,989
That's a nice drawing.

421
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:29,784
Eun-ha.

422
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,285
Yes?

423
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:36,999
I love you so much.

424
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,713
Me too. I love you, Mom.

425
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,757
How much?

426
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,844
To the moon and back.

427
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,430
As much as I love Dad.

428
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,769
Goodness, you're unbelievable.

429
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:59,605
Don't forget to have dinner, okay?

430
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,532
Fine.

431
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,452
I'll let you live as Baek Hee-seong.

432
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,535
-What are you doing here by yourself?
-Do you want a drink too?

433
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,083
What about Eun-ha?

434
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,378
She's asleep. She fell asleep
as soon as she came home.

435
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,932
Is something wrong?

436
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,603
Work's tough.

437
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,359
Why? What's going on?

438
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:13,572
It's nothing, really. You know, sometimes…

439
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:17,910
I chose to pursue it because I liked it.

440
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:22,540
But it just feels sad
that I'm not getting much in return.

441
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,131
Should I just quit?

442
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:35,886
Should I?

443
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,684
If it's too tough, you can quit.

444
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,815
It's easy for you to say
since it's not about you.

445
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,319
Don't live a hard life.

446
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,321
Stay true to who you are.

447
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,074
What am I like?

448
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:05,082
You're cheerful, innocent,
and laugh easily.

449
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,169
You also get mad and sulky easily,

450
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,046
but you are forgiving as well.

451
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,882
I'm easily fooled too.

452
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,971
I'm quite naive, you know?

453
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,640
You are?

454
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,977
Come on, that's not true.

455
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,108
Gosh, time flies indeed.

456
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:34,612
By next week,
it'll be our fifth year at this house.

457
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,034
Sofas, beds, closets,

458
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:43,162
shoe racks, wallpapers, and slippers.

459
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:46,040
We chose, made,
and fixed all of them together.

460
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,791
It was really a lot of fun.

461
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,420
We even had a party.

462
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,008
I was truly happy that day.

463
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,263
Should we have another party
for our fifth year here?

464
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,392
I'll prepare everything.

465
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,603
You just need to enjoy it.

466
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,027
Do you love me?

467
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:34,505
Why do you ask something so obvious?

468
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,890
Live as Baek Hee-seong
until the day you die.

469
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,309
Do it for Eun-ha.

470
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,648
Let's part ways
as Baek Hee-seong and Cha Ji-won

471
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,193
pretending not to know anything.

472
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:01,365
That is my last gift to you.

473
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,080
Right.

474
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:13,293
My team is going to reinvestigate
the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

475
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:20,092
I'm going to get pretty busy.
I'm going to give it my all.

476
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,230
Try to remember, Hae-su.

477
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:37,276
No one cried as much as he did

478
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:40,571
during the funeral.

479
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,831
I don't remember his face at all.

480
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,918
I don't think
anything about him stood out.

481
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,923
He said he owed our father…

482
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,052
and gave me that keychain.

483
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,765
He said it'd bring good luck.

484
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,269
He sounded

485
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,813
so kindhearted.

486
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,316
I almost cried.

487
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,818
Thank you.

488
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,197
But after that,

489
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:27,117
he stared at you
while you were sleeping and asked,

490
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,870
"He's Do Hyeon-su, right?"

491
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,040
"I pity him so much."

492
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,960
"He's going to be
so miserable in the future."

493
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:42,758
After hearing that,

494
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,969
I decided to give the keychain to you.

495
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,520
He approached me on purpose.

496
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,107
Who could it be?

497
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,652
One more thing.

498
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:06,448
This popped into my mind while
watching the witness' interview again.

499
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:11,328
He told me to call him

500
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,456
when I have no one to rely on…

501
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,086
and feel helpless. He said he'd help me.

502
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,129
His number.

503
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,508
Do you have it?

504
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,761
His number…

505
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,347
I wrote it down back then.

506
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,809
But our house burned down.

507
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,937
Why did you have to set it on fire?

508
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,814
After Hyeon-su left,

509
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:42,442
I had to burn all his traces and my bloody

510
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:44,528
school uniform.

511
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,781
I see. I understand.

512
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,784
Then let's move on.

513
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:56,623
The witness from August 21, 2002.

514
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,003
The threatening phone call.

515
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,846
Here. Check this out.

516
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,724
You are not the only one who saw me.

517
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,768
-I saw you as well.
-Don't focus on his voice.

518
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,438
Focus on the background noise.

519
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:25,068
Have you heard about the Gagyeong-ri
Village Head Murder Case?

520
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:29,323
-This noise. Do you hear it?
-Do you know why he was killed?

521
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,784
-Yes.
-Because he was nosy.

522
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,412
What do you think it is?

523
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:41,335
I'm not sure. Maybe it's from a workshop.

524
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,129
No.

525
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,882
I'm sure I've heard this sound before.

526
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,763
I think I've been to this place before.

527
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:59,186
-Moo-jin.
-Why are you so damn gorgeous?

528
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:00,771
What?

529
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,272
What?

530
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:03,899
What did you just say?

531
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,611
What? I said nothing.

532
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:09,321
You just said something to me.

533
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,205
I have something serious to tell you,

534
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,165
so please listen carefully.

535
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:25,170
I'm not going to get involved
in another mess with you two.

536
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:27,881
We're going to be professionals.

537
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,299
Got that?

538
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:33,345
We've gathered here
for the sole purpose of catching

539
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:36,682
the accomplice
in the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

540
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:40,227
Once this gets solved,
we will part ways immediately.

541
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:41,812
Forever.

542
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:43,772
Okay.

543
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:45,565
What?

544
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,735
I mean… Right.

545
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,405
I'm glad you know that.

546
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:55,325
-Moo-jin.
-What? Did I say something wrong?

547
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,661
What did Park Gyeong-chun say?

548
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,248
-What?
-You met with him, right?

549
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,419
Gosh, we have our own office.

550
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,839
-It's just us here.
-Everything's changed.

551
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,966
You can put those here.

552
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,638
I'm already so motivated to work.

553
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,105
5TH ANNIVERSARY AT THIS HOUSE!

554
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:29,276
"Fifth anniversary at this house"?
It's today.

555
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,362
Do you celebrate such things too?

556
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,072
Lucky you.

557
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,950
They're still like newlyweds.

558
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,578
I want my marriage life to be like yours.

559
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:42,622
If you do, you need to meet the right one.

560
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,960
I heard Detective Choi told you to break
up with him before you got married.

561
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:53,008
Come on. Humans can be wrong
and make mistakes.

562
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,384
That's what makes us human.

563
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:57,804
Right. Just like how you were bugged?

564
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,058
-You little--
-Organize your things and get to work.

565
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:01,975
Yes, sir.

566
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,951
On May 9,

567
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,871
Jung Mi-suk left home
after fighting with her husband.

568
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:25,290
LEFT HOME AFTER FIGHTING WITH HER HUSBAND

569
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:28,960
Then at 7:00 p.m. on May 11,
three days after she left home,

570
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,838
she spoke with her husband on the phone

571
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,257
at the bus station in Yongsan Station.

572
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:39,137
But coincidentally,
he had gotten into a car accident

573
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,847
and was in the hospital at that time.

574
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,266
Surprised to hear that, she asked

575
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,727
where he was hospitalized
and hung up hurriedly.

576
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:50,524
And right after that,
she vanished into thin air.

577
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:54,194
Could she have gotten kidnapped
on her way to the hospital?

578
00:51:57,072 --> 00:52:00,075
Something's off.
That's not how our father operated.

579
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:01,910
It's too reckless.

580
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,206
He hated unpredictable situations.

581
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,834
Right, I forgot to tell you this.

582
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:14,089
After reading over the news articles
from back then,

583
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,425
I learned that the victims
shared one thing in common.

584
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:23,181
At a glance, I see nothing in common.

585
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,099
You're wrong.

586
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:28,478
All the victims disappeared suddenly,

587
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:30,272
but no one looked for them.

588
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:34,651
Since Do Min-seok had died,
they didn't look into the victims much.

589
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:38,071
There's almost no information
regarding the victims

590
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,240
except for Jung Mi-suk.

591
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,409
Thanks to her husband
who reported her missing,

592
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,412
we could trace her whereabouts
up until May 11, 2002,

593
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:46,746
the day she went missing.

594
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,623
Ho-jun, show us what you made.

595
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,172
They are Do Min-seok's
whereabouts on May 11.

596
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,133
He and his son

597
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:00,760
didn't cross paths
with Jung Mi-suk that day.

598
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,180
What were they doing in Seoul?

599
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,641
According to the statement
written by Do Hyeon-su,

600
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,810
he and his father
went to exhibitions often.

601
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:10,812
And how can we believe that?

602
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,816
His statement is very detailed
to be an alibi.

603
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,485
You should actually take a look.

604
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,448
God, this is lengthy.

605
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,201
Do Min-seok lent his vehicle,

606
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:26,536
and his accomplice approached the victim.

607
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,664
These statements were written by those

608
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,667
who'd spoken or met with her
during those three days in between.

609
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,378
There were 57 of them in total.

610
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:38,632
She called the majority of them
while looking for a job.

611
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:42,219
I'm sure we'll be able to find
the accomplice among them.

612
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:45,388
No.

613
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,058
I'm certain.

614
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:51,478
Hey, you seem very motivated.

615
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,855
Up until a few days ago,
you were against this.

616
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,775
I really want to solve

617
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,277
this case.

618
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:04,574
That way, I can determine
which step to take next.

619
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:11,331
Our father and his accomplice knew
that Jung Mi-suk had run away from home.

620
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,791
Exactly.

621
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:15,210
They must've planned to kidnap her.

622
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,880
She was waiting at the bus station
to go to the hospital.

623
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,424
So how was she kidnapped?

624
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,263
Dad would…

625
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,143
Do you want it?

626
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,071
It's yours now.

627
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:47,450
Do whatever you want with it.

628
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,830
Whether you use your bare hands
or weapons, do as you wish.

629
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:56,960
I'll just watch

630
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,879
without saying anything.

631
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,259
He would've set a trap.

632
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,972
He particularly liked traps.

633
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:13,560
She must've walked into that trap herself.

634
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:14,561
What?

635
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:18,690
She allowed herself to get kidnapped?

636
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:19,899
How?

637
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,757
Her husband was hospitalized.

638
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:49,304
Where else could she have had
to go urgently beforehand?

639
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,146
It's okay. Come here.

640
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,078
Shall we go inside? Let's go.

641
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,330
Go in.

642
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:23,922
EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

643
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:28,760
PRESIDENT
YEOM SANG-CHEOL

644
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:49,864
Are you not hungry?

645
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,325
I'm okay.

646
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,087
How did you know about this place?

647
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:16,891
I called this number,
and she came to meet me.

648
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,727
You ran away from home?

649
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:24,732
Is it true that I can make money?

650
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,038
Let me see your résumé.

651
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,627
Over a million people signed a petition,
demanding the reinvestigation

652
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,087
of the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

653
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,965
While the key suspect,
Do Hyeon-su, is still on the run,

654
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:51,676
the police have finally begun
to reinvestigate the case.

655
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:53,470
Reporter Cho Su-hyeon has the details.

656
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:20,163
SEARCH

657
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:37,347
Sir, something's wrong with Ms. Gong.

658
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,516
She hasn't come out
of your son's room all day.

659
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:46,105
If he could talk,
he'd beg us to kill him--

660
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:51,986
TRAP?

661
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,738
We need more information.

662
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:57,200
Can you get hold of her call history

663
00:58:57,283 --> 00:59:00,036
or her case record
on the day she went missing?

664
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:03,373
I'm a reporter, not a spy.

665
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,961
I should've remembered his number.

666
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:15,176
You were barely 19 years old.
Of course you don't remember.

667
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,595
I should've at least remembered his face.

668
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:22,183
How could she have killed a man?

669
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,936
What on earth happened back then?

670
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:36,239
Come on, guys. Cheer up.
You guys look so depressed right now.

671
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:39,534
Let's grab something to eat first.
I'm famished.

672
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:43,663
Hae-su, you used to love pizza.
Do you remember that?

673
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:48,876
We used to say we'd have an entire
pizza each once we became adults.

674
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:50,837
What do you say?

675
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:54,132
Now that we're adults,
shall we give it a go?

676
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:00,221
Moo-jin.

677
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,640
You're having a blast, aren't you?

678
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:07,520
You think catching the accomplice
is a game.

679
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:12,942
Your real motive is
to get back together with my sister.

680
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,029
-What?
-Am I wrong?

681
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:21,075
If I am, look her in the eye right now

682
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,620
and repeat what you said to her
18 years ago.

683
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:27,498
"Do Hae-su."

684
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,169
"You give me the creeps."

685
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:35,923
Don't you remember, Hae-su?

686
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:40,720
That day,
you came home crying and asked me

687
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:45,433
if you had our father's eyes.

688
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,604
Hey, Hyeon-su.

689
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,272
Moo-jin, stop.

690
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:57,028
I don't care if you get back together.
It's none of my business.

691
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,490
But this isn't a playground.

692
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,413
Right now, I need you to focus on this.

693
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:15,296
Focus on the sound.

694
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,424
You should be careful since you have kids.

695
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,468
We need to find out…

696
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:23,680
-Have you heard…
-…where he was calling.

697
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:26,015
…about the Gagyeong-ri
Village Head Murder Case?

698
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:29,602
-I'm positive I've been there before.
-Do you know why he was killed?

699
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,022
Because he was nosy.

700
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,986
-What are you doing?
-Moo-jin.

701
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:42,824
You always dissuade me, and not him.

702
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:46,285
I'm a normal person
who feels various emotions.

703
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:47,704
And he's not.

704
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:51,958
What do you take me for?

705
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:56,462
Do you think I'm a pushover?

706
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,507
You don't know
how to be grateful or sorry.

707
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,300
You feel no shame, and you're selfish.

708
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,053
Who'd want to stay by your side?

709
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:07,890
You don't feel a thing
even after hearing this, do you?

710
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,269
But you know what?

711
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:14,814
Ordinary people
can't stand the likes of you.

712
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,067
Right.

713
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:22,488
Why don't you show your true colors
to your wife as well?

714
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:26,993
Hyeon-su is just focused
on solving this case right now.

715
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,995
Do you still speak for him?

716
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,038
When will you stop?

717
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:39,797
In the end,

718
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,925
this place has turned into a playground.

719
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,388
You're really useless.

720
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,064
Sit down, Hyeon-su.

721
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:03,279
Sit down and listen to me.

722
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:21,964
Hyeon-su, tell him
what you really want to say.

723
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:25,927
Only then will he willingly help you.

724
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,388
I've already said what I wanted to say.

725
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,516
Don't just blurt things out.

726
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:37,814
Look into your heart, determine
what you want the most, and say it.

727
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:43,194
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

728
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:46,447
-No, you do.
-I don't.

729
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:48,991
How do I know something that I don't?

730
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:51,410
Because you've changed.

731
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,456
You've changed, Hyeon-su.

732
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,544
Back then, you didn't wish for anything.

733
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,005
But now, you do.

734
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:18,145
WITNESS STATEMENT

735
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:27,572
I'm so sick of this.
Let's just chase after Do Hyeon-su.

736
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:28,781
He's not the accomplice.

737
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:31,993
I'm sure. Trust me on this.

738
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:35,788
No, what I mean is…
Think about how the kidnapping was done.

739
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:39,083
The accomplice kidnapped the victim
using Do Min-seok's car,

740
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:42,378
locked her up in the trunk,
and left the car there.

741
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:44,463
Then Do Min-seok came and drove it

742
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:48,050
back to his workshop
and locked her up in the basement. Right?

743
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:50,136
Yes. So?

744
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,388
Then those two
must've met up at least twice

745
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:54,348
while handing over the car key.

746
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:56,726
Then, Do Hyeon-su
must've seen the accomplice.

747
01:04:57,685 --> 01:05:01,772
But they could've left the key
inside the car.

748
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:04,984
Only normal people would do that
to make things more convenient.

749
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:08,905
Leaving the key inside the car
means leaving the doors unlocked.

750
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,199
They left the victim in the car

751
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:15,202
along with the car key? That's ridiculous.

752
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:20,791
What if they agreed
to hide it in a specific spot?

753
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,335
The car key was too important.

754
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:25,338
If it were me,
I would've handed it to him in person.

755
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:29,592
If not, it'd only increase the variables
and make the situation unpredictable.

756
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:34,388
But how are we going to find Do Hyeon-su?

757
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:36,933
Even the cold case team couldn't do it.

758
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,226
That is why

759
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:42,605
we're reading these.

760
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:48,611
I need to go somewhere.

761
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:50,363
What? Where?

762
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:53,157
To the bank.

763
01:05:58,162 --> 01:06:01,874
Didn't she just come up
with her destination later?

764
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:07,922
He could've met the accomplice
without realizing it.

765
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:09,882
He needs to know that.

766
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:30,403
Are you a kid or what?

767
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:47,003
All right.

768
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:52,425
Mom, you too. Open your mouth.

769
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:11,694
I want to live as Baek Hee-seong.

770
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:19,243
There's nothing else
I want to become or do.

771
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:23,372
I want to live as him. That's all.

772
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,295
I don't want to lose the life I have.

773
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:31,464
Ever.

774
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:43,142
That's the only thing I want.

775
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:48,022
I never meant to make you angry.

776
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,945
I thought I knew enough

777
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:57,865
about why people felt certain feelings.

778
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:04,163
But at times, I don't know
why people get angry.

779
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:13,047
Am I supposed to thank you and apologize

780
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:14,924
right now?

781
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,220
I can do so as many times as you want…

782
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,306
as long as you keep helping me.

783
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:30,106
Forget it. It feels like
I'm putting words into your mouth.

784
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:36,403
Anyway, this just isn't working out.

785
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:39,573
We will never find out what this sound is.

786
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:42,493
However, this is different.

787
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:45,704
I'm close with Detective Im
from the reinvestigation team.

788
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:49,458
I'll call him and hit the booze with him.

789
01:08:50,918 --> 01:08:52,169
He may blurt out something.

790
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:54,088
Thanks, Moo-jin.

791
01:08:55,422 --> 01:08:58,717
Well, no worries. It's nothing.

792
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:02,429
Go on. Call him already.

793
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:05,099
I will. I'll do it right now.
I'm doing it.

794
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:06,350
Gosh.

795
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:11,105

What the hell?

797
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,733
It's Detective Cha.

798
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:20,114
Calm down, guys. Relax. It's okay.

799
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:22,741
Don't panic. It's okay.

800
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:26,787
Especially you, Hyeon-su.
Be completely silent.

803

Hello, Detective Cha.

804
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:41,010
How may I help you?

805
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,095
Are you sick?

806
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:46,765
I have enteritis.

807
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:50,895
Is something wrong?

808
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:54,648
I'd like to meet with you. Are you home?

809
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,569
I'm sorry.

810
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:04,158
I can't even move my fingers right now.

811
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:07,411
Then take good care of yourself.

812
01:10:07,494 --> 01:10:09,872
-I'll see you next time.
-Okay.

813
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:26,805
Guys, our pizza's finally here.

814
01:10:29,516 --> 01:10:30,893
Coming.

815
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:44,573
Hello… Hello, Detective Cha.

816
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:46,742
I called your workplace.

817
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:49,870
They were excited because they thought
you were working on another exclusive.

818
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:52,331
So I wanted to know what it was about.

819
01:10:53,874 --> 01:10:55,292
I do have something big,

820
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:59,171
but I can't work on it
because of this enteritis.

821
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:01,340
Your pizza's here.

822
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:04,176
I see.

823
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:12,142
You ordered pizza
when you're suffering from enteritis?

824
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:16,272
They say you should eat well
when you're feeling ill.

825
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:20,276
You have guests?

826
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:32,538
You suffered so much…

827
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:36,417
striving to survive all this time.

828
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:41,964
You've done enough.

829
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,052
You will never

830
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:50,055
feel lonely.

831
01:11:52,766 --> 01:11:54,226
Go first and wait for me.

832
01:11:58,188 --> 01:11:59,231
I'll

833
01:12:00,774 --> 01:12:01,984
see you soon.

834
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,331
Honey.

835
01:12:58,707 --> 01:12:59,666
Honey.

836
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,504
-Hee-seong!
-Let him go!

837
01:13:03,587 --> 01:13:05,631
-Have you gone insane?
-This is the right thing to do!

838
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:06,799
It is!

839
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:10,719
How are you going to live
with yourself after doing this?

840
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:12,971
I'm not going to!
You can live all you want.

841
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:15,682
Enjoy your status as a hospital director

842
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:17,810
and live in luxury!

843
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:19,436
You can live that way!

844
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:22,773
Are you with the informant?

845
01:13:24,274 --> 01:13:26,402
I wouldn't invite them to my house.

846
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:29,488
Look, Detective Cha.

847
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:33,117
How about we meet
at a nearby cafe in an hour?

848
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:36,620
I'll wait here until you're done.

849
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:38,831
Or you can share your information with me.

850
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:41,917
What information?
I don't have any information.

851
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,002
Mr. Kim, is something wrong?

852
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:50,634
-Please! Let's end this!
-Let me go!

853
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:53,303
No!

854
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:00,579
OUR HAPPY HOUSE

855
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,597
I think I can find the place
where the accomplice made the call.

856
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,433
I finally figured out what that sound was.

857
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:24,019
You don't need to worry
about the accident that day.

858
01:15:24,102 --> 01:15:25,479
I took care of everything.

859
01:15:25,562 --> 01:15:28,815
You can't even report it to the police,
so tell me.

860
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:30,859
A trap? You want to set a trap?

861
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:34,196
To find out which one of them
threw the bait at Jung Mi-suk,

862
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:35,822
we should throw one ourselves.

863
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:39,034
Ms. Do Hae-su.
Is there anything you want to tell me?

864
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:40,202
The truth is…

865
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:42,162
I want you to trust me.

866
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:44,790
The way you're looking at me now
is how I want you to look at me always.

867
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:49,836
