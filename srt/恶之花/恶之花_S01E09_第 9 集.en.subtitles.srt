1
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:35,744
What is it?

2
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,997
What's going on? Why am I doing this?

3
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:40,957
Hang on.

4
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,710
-Watch your step here.
-Okay.

5
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:55,847
Here.

6
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,183
-Can I look now?
-Yes.

7
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,069
This is beautiful.

8
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,698
I love this. When did you do all this?

9
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,536
Baby, do you love it too?

10
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,624
It's kicking.

11
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,919
Feel it.

12
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,342
Do you feel her kicking?

13
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,144
You get startled like that every time.

14
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,271
It's strange.

15
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:49,025
To think that something alive
is growing inside you.

16
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,238
Honestly, I'm not
quite used to it myself either.

17
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,241
Say something to our baby.

18
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,535
To celebrate moving in here.

19
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,622
Okay.

20
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,135
You don't have to clear your throat.

21
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,221
Our baby's hearing is developing now,
so I want to be careful.

22
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,850
All right, sir. Whenever you're ready.

23
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,236
We have

24
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,530
moved into a new house.

25
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,368
We picked yellow for your room.

26
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,330
I hope you will like it.

27
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,377
She will love it.

28
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,930
Let's eat. I made your favorite pork dish.

29
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,393
It's boiled pork with oysters.

30
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,854
Yes. Boiled pork and oysters.

31
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:11,065
How did you know
I was craving boiled pork?

32
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,400
You do know me well.

33
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,278
I thought it was about time.

34
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,407
I feel like I'm always the one receiving.

35
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,035
Is there anything you want from me?

36
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,666
There's one.

37
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,471
Ji-won. What are you doing here?

38
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,266
I didn't expect to see you here.

39
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,851
Well,

40
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,772
I was helping Mr. Kim with his work.

41
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:54,484
He wanted to ask me
about Do Min-seok as a metal craftsman.

42
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,280
You're so silly, Mr. Kim.

43
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,325
Why did you try so hard to hide
that you were with my husband?

44
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,369
I would find it out anyway.

45
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:09,290
Mr. Kim, was our meeting
supposed to be a secret?

46
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,377
I didn't know.

47
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,464
Well, I don't know why I tried to hide it.

48
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,135
Can I come in to join you?

49
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,306
What should we do?

50
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,653
Who is this?

51
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,575
You're Detective Cha, right?

52
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,662
What a coincidence.

53
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,915
How have you been?

54
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,710
I'm sorry, but who are you?

55
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,171
What? Oh, well…

56
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:03,469
You came to see me once
for the Park Gyeong-chun case.

57
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,019
I guess cops these days investigate
based on imagination.

58
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,689
Ms. Do Hae-su?

59
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,025
Yes.

60
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,405
You seem really different from last time.
I didn't recognize you at once.

61
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,200
You were quite cold to me back then.

62
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,288
And you weren't very cooperative.

63
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,664
That day…

64
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,461
I'm sorry about that day.

65
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,547
No, you don't need to apologize.

66
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,177
Mr. Kim, you seem
to be working on something huge.

67
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,347
My husband and even Ms. Do Hae-su?

68
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,184
I met Mr. Baek Hee-seong
for the first time here today.

69
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,898
Well, Moo…

70
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,818
I mean, Mr. Kim.

71
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,779
Actually, we go way back.

72
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,489
We're childhood friends.

73
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,825
I thought I could help him
find the accomplice.

74
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,333
I'm not here to interrogate you.

75
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:17,752
Pardon?

76
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,837
You don't need to explain.

77
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,006
I see.

78
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,175
Okay.

79
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,136
JUNG MI-SUK, ACCOMPLICE

80
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,473
What's all this?

81
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,606
KIDNAPPING JUNG MI-SUK, YEONJU,
DO MIN-SEOK'S FUNERAL

82
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,194
Get Ji-won some coffee.

83
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,655
Something sweet like Einspänner.

84
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,550
Trap?

85
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,135
TRAP?

86
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,262
What does that mean?

87
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,473
Ji-won.

88
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:21,023
If I help Mr. Kim with it,

89
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,609
does it obstruct the investigation?

90
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,196
No. Mr. Kim is just doing his job.

91
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,410
All right. Have some coffee.

92
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,995
Here, Detective Cha.

93
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,207
I was craving some sweet coffee.
How did you know?

94
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,168
I'm good like that.

95
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,753
I think I'm born this way.

96
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,091
We should help each other.

97
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,262
You're looking for the accomplice anyway.

98
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,310
I wouldn't be of much help, though.

99
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,856
About this. What do you mean by "trap"?

100
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,110
Well, it's nothing really.

101
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,282
Do Min-seok liked to set traps.

102
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:15,786
So I thought he might have set some traps
when he kidnapped the victims.

103
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,919
Actually, that's what Hae-su thinks.

104
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,964
That's just what I think.

105
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,428
Mr. Kim, about what you asked me earlier.

106
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,431
Why don't you ask my wife?

107
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,269
What did I ask you, Mr. Baek?

108
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,313
The recording file.

109
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,815
The recording file?

110
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,819
Oh, that.

111
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,625
Honey. A cotton swab.

112
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,961
Oh, okay.

113
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,777
Mom…

114
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,076
Mom…

115
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,039
What are you doing?
Hee-seong is calling you.

116
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,292
Okay.

117
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,424
Hee-seong. I'm right here.

118
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:56,345
It's me, your mom. Do you recognize me?

119
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,181
Mom.

120
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:04,729
It's not your fault.

121
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,942
I'm sorry, Hee-seong.

122
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,070
I'm sorry.

123
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,239
I'm so sorry.

124
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:24,415
Mom. Don't cry.

125
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:35,092
The… The man…

126
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,094
What?

127
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,557
What happened to him?

128
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,851
What did you say?

129
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,104
The man

130
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:49,982
who was…

131
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,612
hit by my car.

132
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,296
Have you heard about the Gagyeong-ri
Village Head Murder Case?

133
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,050
Do you know why he was killed?

134
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,804
Because he was nosy.

135
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,183
That worthless bastard
didn't know his place.

136
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,067
Did you hear the strange sound
in the background?

137
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:37,405
There is no pattern,
so I don't think it's a machine.

138
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,282
What do you think it is, then?

139
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,414
I don't know. How would I know?

140
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:51,502
Right. Of course, you can't figure out
what it is only with the sound.

141
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,713
If you can,
it means you're the accomplice.

142
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,257
But

143
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,386
there's an agency that
analyzes recordings for the police.

144
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,264
My team needs to analyze it anyway,

145
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,434
so I'll ask the agency
if they can analyze the sound.

146
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:10,187
That's great. This is why it's good
to have a detective in a family.

147
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:15,860
Excuse me.

148
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,320
I should

149
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,616
get going now. Bye.

150
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,704
Ms. Do, do you want
the accomplice to get caught?

151
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,588
Of course.

152
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,508
I think that's what everyone wants.

153
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,929
But it might be Do Hyeon-su.

154
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,643
No. Hyeon-su is not the accomplice.

155
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,229
How can you be so sure?

156
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:56,567
Because the Hyeon-su I know
would never do such a thing.

157
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:01,197
I guess the Do Hyeon-su
that you know is quite different

158
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,865
from the one I know.

159
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,412
I met the psychiatrist who treated
Do Hyeon-su when he was a kid.

160
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:13,083
She said Do Hyeon-su
lacked emotional empathy,

161
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,586
but he had excellent cognitive empathy.

162
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,132
So she's pretty sure he has grown up

163
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:24,804
into a man who's good
at manipulating others for his benefits.

164
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,848
I see.

165
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,685
I watched the video of his session.

166
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,605
And he said this himself.

167
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,275
He wanted to kill someone,

168
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,864
but he killed his dog instead because
it'd be hard to get rid of a human body.

169
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,658
That wasn't Hyeon-su's doing.

170
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,286
Then who did it?

171
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,416
Isn't it obvious who did it?

172
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:58,754
Do Min-seok?

173
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:01,799
Yes.

174
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,555
Why do you think Do Hyeon-su said
he did something that Do Min-seok did?

175
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,306
I also want to ask him…

176
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,726
why he said that.

177
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,730
How could he possibly do that?

178
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:22,111
What was he thinking when he said that?

179
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,571
Why would he take the blame…

180
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,615
Ms. Do Hae-su.

181
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,660
Is there anything you want to tell me?

182
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,504
Yes.

183
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,384
I want you to know…

184
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,721
what I did.

185
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,640
What Hyeon-su didn't do.

186
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,351
What do you mean?

187
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,606
The truth is, Gagyeong-ri…

188
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,360
-Gosh.
-Oh, my God.

189
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,196
-I'm so sorry.
-Darn it.

190
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,451
Darn, do you know how expensive it is?

191
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,537
Do you, Mr. Baek?

192
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,207
I'm sorry. It slipped from my hand.

193
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,628
Why did you not drink it
when I gave it to you, Mr. Baek?

194
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,714
-Gosh, this is the latest model.
-I'm really sorry.

195
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,799
I don't know what to do.

196
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,635
Forget it.

197
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,471
I just want you guys to leave now.

198
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,599
I want to be alone.

199
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,114
Hang on.

200
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,617
Oh, right.

201
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,207
I'm sorry.

202
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,042
For what?

203
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,170
For not telling you I was helping Mr. Kim.

204
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,883
You don't have to tell me everything
just because we're married. It's okay.

205
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:09,718
Thank you.

206
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,682
It's not like I tell you
everything either.

207
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,188
Let's go. I've been out for too long.

208
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,564
Okay.

209
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,573
Were you really going
to tell Detective Cha everything?

210
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,200
Moo-jin.

211
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,786
I want to see a hypnotherapist.

212
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,621
What?

213
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,748
I'm sure I saw the accomplice.

214
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,377
I want to try recalling
the memory under hypnosis.

215
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,132
I need to do something to help Hyeon-su.

216
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,969
And what??

217
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,057
When Hyeon-su
doesn't need your help anymore,

218
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,059
what will you do then?

219
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,524
Will you hang out with me?

220
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,317
Like we did before.

221
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,240
If

222
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,952
Hyeon-su doesn't need me anymore,

223
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,165
I'll do what I was supposed to do.

224
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,421
Something I should've done but didn't.

225
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,507
What?

226
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,677
I'll get going.

227
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:05,667
Do Min-seok and the accomplice
must've met up at least twice.

228
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,586
To exchange the car key.

229
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,214
Then Do Hyeon-su
must've seen the accomplice.

230
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,549
If…

231
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,678
If you were Do Min-seok,

232
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,389
how would you give your car key
to your accomplice?

233
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,894
What do you mean?

234
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,980
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

235
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,901
Do Hyeon-su's role was
to prove Do Min-seok's alibi.

236
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,321
It means someone else kidnapped

237
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,615
the victim using Do Min-seok's car.

238
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,035
You think?

239
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,580
So I'm sure he handed his car key
over to his accomplice in person.

240
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,749
That's my team's conclusion.

241
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,379
Continue. That sounds interesting.

242
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,466
According to Do Hyeon-su's
written statement,

243
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,968
that day, Do Min-seok

244
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,304
went around places where he could
meet random people all day.

245
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,769
Do Min-seok and Do Hyeon-su
parked the car in a motel garage,

246
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,563
and at 3:40 p.m.,

247
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:11,066
they arrived at the gallery
and saw an unknown artist's exhibition.

248
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:17,614
At 7:00 p.m., they had dinner
at a popular family restaurant.

249
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,741
-What do you want to eat?
-Well…

250
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,001
At 8:30 p.m., he drank at a bar.

251
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:34,131
8:30 P.M., BAR

252
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,676
After midnight,
they went to a movie theater.

253
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,887
WATCHED A MOVIE AT 12:45 A.M.

254
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,764
CAME HOME AT 3:10 A.M.

255
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,476
After the time of the incident,
they left the movie theater.

256
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,733
From the gallery to the movie theater,

257
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:56,570
Do Min-seok could've met up
with the accomplice at some point.

258
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,660
Do you think
Do Hyeon-su saw the accomplice?

259
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,124
Honey.

260
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,714
-I'm sorry. Are you all right?
-Yes.

261
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,347
By the way, where's your ring?

262
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,391
I left it in the office.

263
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,854
I took it off to wash my hands
and forgot to put it back on.

264
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,607
But you never do that.

265
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,984
You said you feel
uncomfortable without the ring.

266
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,653
I did.

267
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,614
But I got used to not wearing it
quite quickly.

268
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,788
-The light.
-What?

269
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,623
Okay.

270
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,338
Oh, right. You didn't forget
about tonight, did you?

271
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,381
What?

272
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,675
About the party.

273
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,053
Eun-ha is really excited.

274
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,097
Don't be late.

275
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:06,932
Okay.

276
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,692
It's a miracle.

277
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,928
You don't need to worry
about the accident that day.

278
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,099
I took care of everything.

279
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,186
That day,

280
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,439
why

281
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:59,860
did you not answer the phone?

282
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:03,405
I called you many times.

283
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,201
I was busy.

284
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:16,418
Was it more

285
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,797
important than me?

286
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,927
Nothing's more important to me than you.

287
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,554
But

288
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,098
will I

289
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,809
be able

290
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,980
to walk again?

291
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,450
Not just walk.

292
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,662
You'll get a job you want,

293
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,291
marry a good woman,

294
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,920
and have a lovely daughter.

295
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,006
At a beautiful two-story house,

296
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:07,094
you will live happily ever after.

297
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,770
You can do all those things.

298
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,661
Mom.

299
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,122
Mom, hurry on up!

300
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:19,124
All right. Dinner is ready.

301
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,670
-Congratulations. Enjoy.
-It looks delicious.

302
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,924
This is for you, Eun-ha.

303
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,428
This is shrimp, your favorite.

304
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,895
This doesn't work anymore?
You used to love it.

305
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,356
That's not true. I love this.

306
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,485
I'm really happy,

307
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,906
but I've just realized

308
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,283
how much you must have tried.

309
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,870
I'm just doing this
because it makes me happy.

310
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,290
-Do you want some shrimp?
-Yes.

311
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,336
There you go.

312
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,591
You always try hard to show me…

313
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,720
only what I want to see.

314
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,392
I mean, I'm grateful for that.

315
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,815
You don't have to thank me.

316
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,318
I want more shrimp.

317
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:32,239
Eun-ha, you sound so sweet
only when you need something.

318
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,080
Do you

319
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,249
love her?

320
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,128
No.

321
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:53,051
I've never loved her.
Not even for a moment.

322
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:02,477
MR. KIM

323
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:04,896
Hello, Mr. Kim.

324
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,691
Is the analysis finished?

325
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,318
I filtered out some noise

326
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,738
and amplified the unidentified signal.

327
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,490
Okay.

328
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,368
I see.

329
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,205
Once you're done analyzing the voiceprint,

330
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,541
please email me.

331
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,585
Thank you.

332
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,051
Is that what Mr. Kim asked you earlier?

333
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,469
Yes.

334
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,013
I see.

335
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:44,144
Did they find out what the sound is?

336
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,148
No. He says it's impossible.

337
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,026
Well, I see.

338
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,031
But he filtered out some noise…

339
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,119
and detected another man's voice.

340
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,919
AUDIO FILE

341
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,093
Do you need an ashtray?

342
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,557
Can you make it out?

343
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,436
Do you need an ashtray?

344
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,941
Do you need an ashtray?

345
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,446
Do you need an ashtray?

346
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,992
Do you need an ashtray?

347
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,915
An ashtray.

348
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,628
All right.

349
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,631
Give me one.

350
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,187
Honey.

351
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,734
Why are you standing like that?

352
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,032
Nothing. Never mind.

353
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,208
Eun-ha do you want anything else?

354
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,627
-I want shrimp.
-Shrimp?

355
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,005
Okay. I'll get you some more.

356
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,647
You've been forcing a smile these days.

357
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:42,155
Tell me. What's going on?

358
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,284
Nothing.

359
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,540
Then why are you being like that?

360
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,843
Maybe my feelings for you have changed.

361
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,030
What do you mean by that?

362
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,159
It's been 14 years since we met.

363
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,162
Things can't always stay the same.

364
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,503
But how could you change all of a sudden?

365
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,259
What about you?

366
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:48,638
Have your feelings for me
not changed at all?

367
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,736
They're still the same.

368
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,530
I see.

369
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,741
So that's how you feel.

370
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,005
This is all because of work.

371
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,716
You're so stressed out.

372
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:29,387
You're always in danger
and don't get sleep.

373
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:34,475
Besides, there hasn't been any break
in the case you're working on.

374
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,228
This is what I've been thinking lately.

375
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,026
"If we break up,
what will my life be like?"

376
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,535
Ji-won.

377
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,371
Don't talk as if you know
everything about me.

378
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:03,004
I'm the one who knows
about my feelings best, not you.

379
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,927
Was there any reason
that I fell in love with you?

380
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,554
No, there wasn't.

381
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,016
So I don't need a reason
to fall out of love.

382
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,605
I don't love you.

383
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,900
I don't love you anymore.

384
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:28,613
I hate everything about you.

385
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:31,032
I hate it even when you try
to be nice to me.

386
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:35,828
Why?

387
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,503
I guess falling out of love with you
made me hate you.

388
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,509
You say you hate me,

389
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,887
but why are you crying?

390
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,935
Because I hate that this is all I can say.

391
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,442
I… I just don't get it.

392
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,155
I don't understand
why you're being like this.

393
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,703
I'm going to break up with you.

394
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,665
I don't want to see you

395
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,292
sleep and eat next to me.

396
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,424
Ji-won.

397
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,093
What do you want me to do?

398
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,179
Tell me.

399
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,431
Well…

400
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:41,227
Just tell me what to do.
And I'll work on it.

401
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,896
I'll do everything I can.

402
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,774
Don't do anything.

403
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,402
That's what I want.

404
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,168
YEONJU SERIAL MURDER CASE

405
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,465
Ji-won.

406
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,677
I need to read this.
Let's talk about us later.

407
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,638
What's more important than us now?

408
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,518
Do you know what the first thing
I see when I get to work is?

409
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,313
The faces of Do Min-seok's victims.

410
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,193
Do you know how I feel
looking at the faces?

411
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,779
I feel guilty.

412
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,617
Why? You didn't do anything wrong.

413
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,828
Because I don't know anything.

414
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,749
I don't know what I need to know.

415
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:49,796
I haven't even found out
how Do Min-seok searched for the victims.

416
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,926
This might be the last chance for them.

417
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,761
They are all counting on me.

418
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:00,556
But I still don't know anything.

419
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:06,229
Ji-won, this is just work.

420
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,856
You don't need to empathize
so much with them.

421
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,569
Now I know.

422
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,575
How I have managed to put up
with all those horrible cases.

423
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,871
You worked hard today.

424
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,549
It was you.

425
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:40,054
You made it possible. I could
forget about it when I was with you.

426
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,641
But not anymore.

427
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,782
What? Marital ennui?

428
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:03,786
I think I heard you wrong.

429
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,081
Did you just say the word, "ennui"?

430
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,126
That's what Ji-won said.

431
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,961
But

432
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,591
I have no idea what I should do now.

433
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:20,970
You woke me up early in the morning saying
it's an emergency, and you say ennui?

434
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,638
This is serious.

435
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:27,852
It's worse than when
I got stabbed by Sun-gil in the mountain.

436
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,521
I'm at a loss.

437
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:31,856
Oh, dear.

438
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,447
I couldn't even
get changed because of you.

439
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,949
Darn it.

440
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,164
-Where's Hyeon-su?
-He's in here.

441
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,338
What's the matter? What's the emergency?

442
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,514
I see.

443
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,560
Marital ennui…

444
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,647
That's serious.

445
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,775
Isn't he just ridiculous?

446
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,611
Ji-won is having a hard time.

447
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,573
I don't know what to do
to make her feel better.

448
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,700
Isn't that obvious?

449
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:28,913
"You're the love of my life.
I can't live without you."

450
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:32,416
Get her some gifts and flowers
with candles.

451
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,544
Just express your passionate love for her

452
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,756
until she gets carried away.

453
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,216
Then she'll be groggy.

454
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,177
"Honey, what is going on?"
"What do you think it is? It's love."

455
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,887
And after some time,

456
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:48,099
"Honey, what is this now?"
"What do you think? It's ennui."

457
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,059
That's just how people live.

458
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:52,979
That's right.

459
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,524
The best gift for Ji-won right now is…

460
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,030
The accomplice.

461
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:04,824
What?

462
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,034
If I catch the accomplice for her,

463
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,954
she will be thrilled.

464
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,083
I can imagine that.

465
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,003
What kind of couple overcomes

466
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,672
marital ennui with a serial killer?

467
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:25,011
I can tell Ji-won means a lot to you.

468
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:26,721
She does.

469
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,931
She's very important to me.

470
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,224
No.

471
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,435
She's precious to you.

472
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,898
What's the difference?

473
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,569
What's important will eventually

474
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:46,073
end up becoming
less important after some time.

475
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,701
But what's precious…

476
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,705
breaks your heart.

477
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,636
-I should get going.
-Where are you going?

478
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,558
I think I can find the place
where the accomplice made the call.

479
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,896
I finally figured out what that sound was.

480
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,647
-What?
-Really?

481
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,191
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

482
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:24,195
Where? How did you find out?
I mean, what was that sound?

483
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,030
I'll tell you when I'm back.

484
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:31,577
See you. Don't hang out
with Moo-jin for too long.

485
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,124
Hey, how dare you tell her what to do?

486
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,834
We're not minors.

487
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,683
So what are you doing today?

488
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:01,524
Well, it's not like I'm asking you out.

489
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,612
We can just eat something delicious
together like we used to.

490
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,324
Or we can drink together.

491
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,326
Moo-jin.

492
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:13,953
Yes?

493
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,289
I want you to take me home.

494
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,334
What?

495
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,657
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT?
SHALL WE EXERCISE TOGETHER?

496
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,202
DID YOU EAT ANYTHING?

497
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,750
HAVE YOU NOT BOUGHT ONE YET? HURRY

498
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,003
GRILLED PORK

499
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:06,213
WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THIS?

500
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,632
CAN I BUY THIS?

501
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,848
HONEY, HOW MUCH DO YOU LOVE ME?

502
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:23,272
HONEY, THE SKY IS SO BEAUTIFUL

503
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:38,162
What? A trap? You want to set a trap?

504
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:42,875
These are the witnesses Jung Mi-suk spoke
with on the phone after she left home.

505
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,377
While Jung Mi-suk was looking for a job,

506
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,672
the fact that she'd left home
must've been revealed.

507
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,259
To find out which one of them
threw the bait at Jung Mi-suk,

508
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,136
we should throw one ourselves.

509
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,681
What bait do we have to use?

510
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,476
Me.

511
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,102
What?

512
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,232
I'll be Jung Mi-suk.

513
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:10,903
But sting operations have legality issues.

514
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:13,072
If he's still committing crimes,
this is legitimate.

515
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:18,285
Fine. I get your point.

516
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,621
Captain, I'm with her.

517
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,831
We have nothing to lose.

518
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,375
Trying wouldn't hurt.

519
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,054
First, we should buy a prepaid phone.

520
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,740
I'm really okay. I can just go.

521
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,952
Really? Do you want to go?

522
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:01,954
No.

523
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,989
Are you moving out?

524
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,201
It's almost empty.

525
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,412
This is how I live.

526
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,582
I see. Like minimalism.

527
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,710
I knew it. It looks sophisticated.

528
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,589
Isn't it too dark, though?

529
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,050
Should I turn on the light?

530
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,476
You need to replace the light.

531
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,854
I rarely turn on the light.

532
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,273
I didn't even know it was out.

533
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,584
I have insomnia.

534
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,462
I can't sleep well.

535
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,383
Sometimes, I cry all night
like a crazy person.

536
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:42,680
And sometimes, I don't even
step out of my place for days.

537
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,516
Moo-jin.

538
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,727
I'm not the Do Hae-su you used to know.

539
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,480
I'm ruined.

540
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,360
We can never get back together.

541
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,911
You can leave now.

542
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,587
Hello.

543
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,201
This place hasn't changed at all,
which is strange.

544
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,663
I guess you've been here before.

545
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:18,293
Yes. I came with my dad when I was young.

546
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,630
And nothing has changed since then.

547
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:23,924
What can I get you?

548
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,260
Whatever you recommend. On the rocks.

549
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,178
Okay.

550
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,781
When I came with my dad,

551
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,576
you carved the ice yourself.

552
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,247
I guess your father
was a special customer.

553
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:58,625
We do ice carving
only for special customers.

554
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,838
Special customers?

555
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:07,092
Like regulars.

556
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:09,928
Then

557
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:14,308
the person I'm looking for must be
one of the special customers.

558
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:26,361
Hey, lady. You better not be nosy.

559
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:30,490
You are not the only one who saw me.

560
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,868
I saw you as well.

561
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,121
You drive a small, red car.

562
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:39,750
Do you recognize this voice?

563
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,294
I know where you work and where you live.

564
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,713
No. I have no idea.

565
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:47,257
You should be careful since you have kids.

566
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:54,890
If you remember anything,
please give me a call.

567
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,516
I will.

568
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,103
Please leave your number here.

569
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:08,070
-Can I use your pen?
-Sure.

570
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,262
Hyeon-su, do you want to pick one for me?

571
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,642
I'm going to give my friend a gift.

572
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,605
To thank him for always
getting me nice materials.

573
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:47,651
But you always find materials yourself.

574
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,531
There are materials that are

575
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,033
too risky to find myself.

576
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,785
Like what?

577
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,375
I wonder what kind of face you will make…

578
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,337
if I show you.

579
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,338
Show me.

580
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,383
Once your eyes and hands

581
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,927
grow ripe.

582
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,018
I pick this one.

583
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,079
LIST OF WITNESS CONTACT INFORMATION

584
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:51,089
Hello?

585
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:55,677
Well, I'm looking for a job.

586
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,013
You have the wrong number.

587
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,517
HWANG JEONG-SUN

588
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,770
Hwang Jeong-sun?

589
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:07,189
It sounds like a woman's name.
Let's skip it.

590
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:11,735
My father's name is Sun-jin. Choi Sun-jin.

591
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,236
Oh, really?

592
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:14,905
Hello?

593
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:18,533
Well, I'm looking for a job.

594
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,453
I see. So you saw our flyer.

595
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,791
Yes. But I have bad credit. Is that okay?

596
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,292
Really?

597
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:30,128
You don't need to worry.
That doesn't matter.

598
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,096
What's the matter?

599
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:41,890
Do you really not know

600
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,559
about the voice?

601
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:49,606
What about Do Min-seok?

602
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,527
Do you not know Do Min-seok?

603
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,114
I don't.

604
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:07,124
You have Do Min-seok's artwork,

605
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,959
and you say you don't know him?

606
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,545
You said he was a special customer.

607
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,797
But you don't know him?

608
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,758
I don't know anything.

609
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,009
Then who knows?

610
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,596
Who are you?

611
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,891
Do you really just sell liquor here?

612
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,060
Tell me.

613
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,049
Why are you doing this?

614
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,427
I really don't know anything.

615
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:01,761
Tell me.

616
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:06,683
Who can resolve this situation?

617
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,478
Where are you now?

618
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,274
I'm in a motel near Yongsan Station.

619
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,359
What's the name of the motel?

620
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,572
Well, please wait.

621
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:21,656
HAPPY WORLD

622
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,534
The name is Happy World.

623
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:28,121
I'll be there.
It will take an hour or two.

624
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,332
Are you coming over here?

625
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:35,962
It's like a job interview. And I'd like
to hear what you've been through.

626
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,423
Sure. You can come.

627
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,342
I'll call you back on this number.

628
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,802
Okay.

629
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,057
That was suspicious.

630
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:51,478
Her tone of voice got higher
when you said you're having difficulties.

631
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:53,772
But why is it a woman?

632
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,191
Wait. It's a woman.

633
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,109
But the accomplice is a man.

634
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:02,155
Maybe there was someone else
who lured the victims to him.

635
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,699
So is the trap thing really working?

636
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:08,119
Don't you think we're being too lucky?

637
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,498
What's wrong with being lucky?
What's your problem?

638
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,792
I mean, I just have
a bad feeling about this.

639
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:16,044
Let's hurry and check it out.

640
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,134
We have one more in our trap.

641
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,678
PRESIDENT YEOM SANG-CHEOL

642
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,054
That doesn't feel good, though.

643
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,140
What are you talking about?

644
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,268
We just got one from your area.

645
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,561
This seems a little too soon.

646
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:38,942
The media is all about the reinvestigation
of the Do Min-seok case these days.

647
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,278
If it goes wrong, we might get caught.

648
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:46,700
Gosh, what a coward.

649
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,159
Just give me my share.

650
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,376
Is this it?

651
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,129
It hasn't been sold yet.

652
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,882
Later. I'll give you more once it's sold.

653
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,927
You always say that.

654
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,012
Damn it.

655
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:17,439
What?

656
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:21,985
Mr. Yeom, the thing is,
some lunatic is making a fuss here…

657
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,611
What is he talking about?

658
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:28,658
Is it you? Are you
Do Min-seok's accomplice?

659
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:35,165
Who are you?

660
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:00,565
Hee-seong!

661
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,153
What are you doing here?

662
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:12,243
Mom. I…

663
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:16,539
There's someone I need to meet.

664
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:20,335
I remember it now.

665
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:24,214
I… I was

666
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:27,759
on my way to meet the person.

667
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,136
What?

668
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:34,307
I… I have to hurry up.

669
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:40,397
Mom. Please help me up. Please.

670
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,400
Help me up now.

671
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,778
Please.

672
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,841
SEARCH

673
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,692
EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

674
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:04,230
Gosh, I didn't realize earlier,
but this building's really tall.

675
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,153
What are you doing? Open the door.

676
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:14,949
I need to replace the light.

677
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:29,047
You're Do Min-seok's son?

678
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:33,009
How can I believe you?

679
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:37,180
How do you think I found the bar?

680
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:40,225
Because my dad took me there.

681
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:48,566
Do Min-seok always
ordered the same drink there.

682
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:50,777
Do you know what it is?

683
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:58,535
My dad didn't order any drink.

684
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,912
He just said he made a reservation.

685
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,511
You look just like him.

686
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,805
Have a seat.

687
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,479
Now tell me.

688
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:31,526
Who are you and how do you know
my dad's accomplice?

689
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,113
The question is way over the line.

690
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:38,491
You…

691
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,828
I know you're wanted for murder.

692
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,249
I watch the news too.

693
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:52,505
Then you must know
why I'm looking for him.

694
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:54,799
You watch the news.

695
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,845
He screwed me.

696
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:01,639
So I need to get back at him.

697
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,227
But you don't know who he is.

698
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,441
How fearless.

699
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:20,533
Say the exact same thing to him.

700
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:24,621
How fearless he was
to have messed with me.

701
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:30,376
What a lunatic.

702
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:37,925
My gosh. I'm kind of tired
in between two lunatics.

703
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:41,512
As if you were not a lunatic yourself.

704
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:46,392
Me? I'm just a businessman.

705
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:50,688
I just buy, sell, and make profits.

706
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:51,773
It's simple.

707
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:56,027
So what do you buy and sell?

708
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,364
Everything.

709
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:02,533
Whatever it is.

710
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:10,166
Since you left home
when you were in middle school,

711
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:12,043
you've been out of touch with your family?

712
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:16,589
I don't think they even care
whether I'm alive or dead.

713
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,425
Oh, dear. That must've been tough.

714
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,845
Will I be able to make a lot of money?

715
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:26,057
If there's a job that pays
a person with bad credit a lot of money,

716
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,101
it won't be something legal, right?

717
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,145
That's all you need to know for now.

718
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,942
Is it really something illegal?

719
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:39,237
It's not dangerous, though.

720
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,740
You'll just go somewhere
and deliver things.

721
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:47,578
There are two entrances.
And they are guarded by teams of two.

722
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,581
Ho-jun is waiting
in front of the motel room.

723
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:52,959
Just go on your way.

724
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,379
Is Ji-won doing a good job?

725
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:06,806
Deliver things? What are they?

726
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:11,728
Just try it. Then you'll find out.

727
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:14,564
Okay.

728
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,901
Oh, right. You need to pay a commission.

729
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:23,156
-How much is it?
-How much do you have now?

730
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:27,410
Here.

731
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:34,417
You'll be sitting on a pile of money soon.

732
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,003
Don't mind spending
chicken feed like this.

733
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:40,715
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

734
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,217
Do you know anything about the law?

735
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:47,555
Why? Is there anything you want to ask me?

736
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,267
Unless otherwise prescribed by law,

737
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,811
no one shall intervene
in employment of others for profit

738
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:57,064
or benefit from it as a go-between.

739
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:58,816
What?

740
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:00,693
You just violated

741
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:04,030
the Labor Standards Act
and the Employment Security Act.

742
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:11,162
Shall we go to the police station
and talk more about the delivery?

743
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,331
Ms. Hwang Jeong-sun.

744
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:16,042
-Who are you?
-Me?

745
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:20,755
I'm Jung Mi-suk.

746
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:24,383
I'll go get her.

747
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:36,854
I was told I'd meet someone noble today.
That damn psychic.

748
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,397
The psychic is pretty good.

749
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,040
Hey, Hwang Jeong-sun!

750
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:59,168
Just stay right there.

751
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:01,379
You can't run away anyway.

752
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:03,756
Hwang Jeong-sun, you might fall.

753
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:07,426
Come here. No, just come back.

754
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,096
It's really dangerous.

755
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,348
Seriously, you might fall.

756
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,268
My gosh. Come here.

757
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:16,269
Oh, no.

758
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,584
Is this good enough for you?

759
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:48,551
This is tricky.

760
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:52,263
Which is more profitable?
Selling you to him?

761
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:54,849
Or selling him to you?

762
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,978
Which one would be more profitable for me?

763
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:01,898
Oh, well.

764
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:06,944
Those who weigh up
the benefit don't last long.

765
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,779
Exactly. You're right.

766
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:12,575
I may be a thug,
but I shouldn't sell my client.

767
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:14,827
I won't be able to die in my bed.

768
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:16,913
Your client?

769
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:21,667
So…

770
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:26,631
does that mean you sold
the materials that my dad used to buy

771
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:28,674
to him as well?

772
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:30,217
"Materials"?

773
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:33,429
That's how…

774
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:36,599
Do Min-seok called them.

775
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,398
There are materials that are

776
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:47,318
too risky to find myself.

777
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:52,156
Okay. I've made up my mind.

778
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,868
I'm going to sell you.

779
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,758
Ji-won, what were you thinking?

780
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,177
How could you leave her alone
after cuffing her?

781
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,304
Have you forgotten about the protocol?

782
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:18,724
Listen to me, Mr. Yoon.
It just happened so quickly.

783
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,643
Detective Cha stuck to the plan.

784
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:23,104
I'll take full responsibility.

785
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:24,647
Look at you.

786
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,733
Hey, U-cheol. You think
it'll just end with you?

787
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,653
What if Hwang Jeong-sun dies?

788
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:33,239
What if she dies due to a sting operation?

789
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:36,033
Damn it!

790
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,123
Detective Im, how did it go?

791
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,835
She's having emergency surgery now.

792
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:48,087
We need to wait until it's done.

793
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:51,382
The doctor says we can't be sure yet.

794
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:08,274
Honey.

795
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:43,768
MY HUSBAND

796
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,520
How are you feeling?

797
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:49,356
You didn't eat breakfast.

798
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,777
Is there anything you want?

799
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,406
Shall we exercise together?

800
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:01,160
Did you eat anything?

801
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:04,205
Ji-won.

802
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:06,540
JI-WON, I FEEL SO FRUSTRATED

803
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:07,875
Ji-won.

804
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:10,961
I feel so frustrated.

805
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,173
I want to talk to you.

806
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:18,719
I wish time would fly.

807
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,764
I want time to fly by quickly

808
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:26,393
so we will be able to share
the same memories.

809
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:32,566
So that I'll be able to think and feel

810
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,277
the way you do.

811
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,201
I feel like I'm always the one receiving.

812
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,496
Is there anything you want from me?

813
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:48,040
There's one.

814
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:50,501
What is it?

815
01:08:58,259 --> 01:08:59,593
Please don't change.

816
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:05,766
The way you're looking at me now
is how I want you to look at me always.

817
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,311
I want you to trust me.

818
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:12,857
Gosh, that's so easy.

819
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:16,569
If you do, I will live

820
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,155
only for you all my life.

821
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:28,455
What do I do?

822
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:30,666
I miss you.

823
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:46,223
Let go of me!

824
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:54,732
I shouldn't be doing this
to Do Min-seok's son.

825
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,901
But what can I do? Do Min-seok is dead,

826
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:58,527
and he's alive.

827
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:01,238
You can't do this to me.

828
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:03,574
I do feel bad, though.

829
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,202
Just have a good sleep.

830
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:09,747
Then you will wake up
in front of the guy you're looking for.

831
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:13,417
Hold him tight.

832
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,336
-Let go!
-Come on.

833
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:16,837
Just open it up.

834
01:10:19,089 --> 01:10:20,132
Stay still.

835
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:22,843
Open it! Hey!

836
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:25,346
I can be your client.

837
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:34,855
A long-standing client.

838
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,038
Do you know

839
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:54,250
what I sell?

840
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:02,716
People.

841
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:12,643
Are you saying you're like your father?

842
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:15,729
Didn't my dad tell you about me?

843
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:19,149
He did. He said you were just like him.

844
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:24,071
But I didn't know this is what he meant.

845
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:41,505
JI-WON

846
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:47,386
Answer it.

847
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:03,152
Yes.

848
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:06,280
I wanted to hear your voice.

849
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,161
The thing is…

850
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:16,498
I had a long day.

851
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:21,211
And you were the only person
I could think of.

852
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:28,177
I'm busy now.

853
01:12:30,637 --> 01:12:31,680
What?

854
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:34,058
I said I'm busy.

855
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:37,644
Oh.

856
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:41,148
Okay.

857
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:51,992
I want you to trust me.

858
01:13:00,584 --> 01:13:01,919
From now on,

859
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:07,091
answer my questions
only with a yes or a no.

860
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:09,259
Can you do that?

861
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:15,182
Yes.

862
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,060
Do you need help?

863
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,438
No.

864
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:25,109
Can you handle it by yourself?

865
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:28,320
Yes.

866
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:34,535
I'll give you an hour.

867
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:37,871
Come to me in an hour.

868
01:13:45,462 --> 01:13:46,672
I miss you.

869
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:52,761
Yes.

870
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:29,006
The deal will begin at midnight tomorrow.

871
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:30,716
First, bring 100 million won
to my office.

872
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:32,301
You shouldn't underestimate him.

873
01:14:32,384 --> 01:14:35,554
Once he finds out you're awake,
he won't be happy.

874
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:38,932
We're also after Do Hyeon-su, right?

875
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:41,393
I need money. 100 million won in cash.

876
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:44,563
I think I can catch the accomplice
in the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

877
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:49,193
I want to be a decent person for you.

878
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:52,112
I'd like to report something important
regarding the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

879
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:54,198
May I ask who's calling?

880
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:59,912
