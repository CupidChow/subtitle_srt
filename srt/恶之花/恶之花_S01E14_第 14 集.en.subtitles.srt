1
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,112
MISSING PERSON
JUNG MI-SUK

2
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:37,370
If you hadn't left any witnesses,
this wouldn't have happened.

3
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,043
Okay, I made a mistake.

4
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,546
So what do you expect me to do?

5
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,966
You should take responsibility for it.

6
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,302
After all, that's our rule.

7
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,897
What do you want me to do?

8
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,778
Go straight in that direction,
and you'll find a cliff.

9
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,615
Take care of her there.

10
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,910
Then turn yourself in.

11
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:22,040
Tell them she fell off the cliff
while running away.

12
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:27,003
If you hire the right lawyers,
you'll be out in no time.

13
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,634
You don't have a choice.

14
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,769
Let's make Hyeon-su do it.

15
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,021
What?

16
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,898
You said he obeys you no matter what.

17
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,332
Had I wanted to kill you,

18
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,668
you would've been dead right here.

19
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,173
Don't you dare utter his name ever again.

20
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,467
Got that?

21
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:22,267
Just have faith in me and do as I say.

22
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:29,315
If you do, you'll be able
to stay happy for a very long time.

23
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,318
Understood?

24
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,744
Now, do your job.

25
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,621
It looks like you and the culprit
know each other.

26
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,498
Do you have any idea who it is?

27
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,378
Ms. Gong?

28
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,260
Yes.

29
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:40,970
I do.

30
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,516
There's only one person.

31
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,561
And who's that?

32
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,234
Do Hyeon-su.

33
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,695
Do Hyeon-su?

34
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,869
IF YOU DO THIS AGAIN,
I'LL TELL THE MADAM AND DIRECTOR

35
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,830
Ms. Gong?

36
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,086
What we did

37
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,839
was out of good intentions.

38
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,260
We pitied him for being a wanderer,

39
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,305
and it felt like the son we had lost
was back once again.

40
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,600
At that time, my husband and I

41
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,228
needed someone to dote on.

42
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,737
Do Hyeon-su has

43
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,824
been living as my son

44
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,119
for the past 15 years.

45
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,372
As Baek Hee-seong.

46
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,924
From this moment on…

47
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,803
I won't trust anyone.

48
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,932
What are you planning to do?

49
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,477
Raise your hands slowly.

50
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,232
Do you understand me?

51
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,359
Honey, don't do this.

52
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,988
You won't get anything out of this.

53
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,077
Do you really think…

54
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,041
you can convince me right now?

55
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,764
Move to the monitor.

56
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,692
Pull out all the video cables.

57
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,903
There are four of them.

58
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,062
Give me three days.

59
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,980
No, one day will do.

60
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,524
I promise to return.

61
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,569
How dare you hold a knife to my throat?

62
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,155
I'm going to flee right now.

63
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:50,118
That was the most effective way to
make it look like you're not helping me.

64
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,078
How dare you hold a knife to my throat?

65
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,016
It's just unsharpened silver.

66
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,686
It's just something
you use to open envelopes.

67
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,730
How should I know
whether it's sharpened or not?

68
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:24,026
What matters is that
you just threatened to hurt me.

69
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,239
You're right.

70
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,618
We've only known each other
for a mere 14 years.

71
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:37,206
It's natural that you don't understand
anything that I do. Right?

72
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,001
I thought at least you…

73
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,590
would know my intentions right away.

74
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,427
Are you getting mad at me?

75
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,138
I obviously have no right to do that

76
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,725
since I'm an idiot who left
his fingerprints at a crime scene

77
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,101
his wife is investigating!

78
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,770
This isn't the time to get emotional.

79
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,232
Am I?

80
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,155
You think I'm being emotional?

81
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,532
You're wrong.

82
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,661
I'm insanely rational right now.

83
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,684
I'm sorry.

84
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,692
Jung Mi-suk is still alive.

85
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,530
What?

86
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,491
Yeom Sang-cheol has her.

87
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,495
What the hell are you talking about?

88
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,541
The police are on their way.
We have no time.

89
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,875
I can't explain in detail.

90
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,128
Ji-won.

91
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,632
I'll catch the real killer myself…

92
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,343
and make sure I return.

93
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,556
I won't let you go.

94
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,863
WHERE THE RISING STAR STAYS

95
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,334
The CCTV camera. Check that.

96
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,947
Play that once again.

97
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,369
Enlarge cam one.

98
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:29,837
The closet.

99
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,424
What about it?

100
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,184
He couldn't have gotten far.

101
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,936
-Make an emergency call.
-Yes, sir.

102
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,105
This is an emergency.
67 Sanseo-ro, Mapo-gu.

103
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,274
A murder suspect on the run
holding his wife hostage.

104
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,194
The suspect, a male in his 30s.
The hostage, a female in her 30s.

105
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,699
Please. It's not too late.

106
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,326
Let's go outside.

107
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,454
If I get arrested right now,
Jung Mi-suk will die.

108
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,626
Find where they're going first.

109
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,670
-You two, go to the control center.
-Yes, sir.

110
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,631
Make sure no one goes in there
until the forensics team comes.

111
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:14,715
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

112
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,018
What are you talking about?

113
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,480
Jun Mi-suk is alive? And she'll die?

114
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,818
Uncuff me first.

115
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,654
No, explain first.

116
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,824
Give me one day.

117
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,868
I will come back. I promise.

118
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,204
What can you do in a single day?

119
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,957
I'm going to make everything right.

120
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,584
For me, Jung Mi-suk,

121
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,962
and the killer.

122
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,548
We'll go back to where we belong.

123
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,973
Ji-won, you need to trust me.

124
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,480
Let me come with you.

125
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,024
What?

126
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,110
I'll trust you as you asked me to.

127
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,867
In cuffs?

128
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,244
This is the most I can do for you.

129
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,719
All right, then. Let's go.

130
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,069
Wait.

131
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,029
What's wrong?

132
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,531
Take some cash.

133
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,318
Wait.

134
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,656
What was with that space in the closet?

135
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,200
Tell me.

136
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,452
What else don't I know?

137
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,958
Uncuff me first.
It's difficult for us to move.

138
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,045
I know you'll run without me if I do.

139
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,965
Do you really have no trust in me?

140
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,635
It's not that.
It's just that I know you too well.

141
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,434
Then can you at least take this off?

142
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,447
CHA JI-WON
POLICE AGENCY

143
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,784
Do you think this makes sense?

144
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,704
You were reinvestigating
the Yeonju Serial Murder Case

145
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:35,708
and had no idea that Do Hyeon-su
was right in front of you?

146
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,793
And you call yourselves cops?

147
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,254
We're extremely humiliated!

148
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,716
Even the Cold Case Team
failed to find him for 20 years.

149
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,551
So how could we find him?

150
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,387
We're cops, not some shamans.

151
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,724
He's been living
as someone else for 15 years.

152
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,225
Even so!

153
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,103
Detective Cha is in danger right now.

154
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,481
Our top priority is to save her.

155
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,650
Are you sure

156
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,445
that she wasn't aware of this at all?

157
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,238
Is that even a question?

158
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,240
She's been taken hostage.

159
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,410
She found out about his real identity,

160
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,329
so he went batshit crazy.

161
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:17,082
Anyway, U-cheol, just know that
your team will be inspected later on.

162
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,168
Yes, sir.

163
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,132
You must catch Do Hyeon-su at all costs.

164
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,762
Yes, sir. Don't get me started.
It's a disaster.

165
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:35,893
U-cheol.

166
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,608
Detective Cha really has nothing
to do with this, right?

167
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,029
Even when Do Hyeon-su
tipped us off about Yeom Sang-cheol,

168
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,448
she had no clue, right?

169
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,411
Jae-seop, let go of her.
What are you doing?

170
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,871
You knew everything.

171
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,083
And all this time…

172
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,087
you've been manipulating us.

173
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,755
You have…

174
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,550
deceived us.

175
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:13,430
Yes, I am positive. She knew nothing.

176
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,936
First, we need to find out where he is.

177
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,314
Team One and Two, check the CCTV cameras,
witnesses, and dashcams.

178
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,400
Be thorough and find out where he went.

179
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,319
Team Three, check his call logs,
transactions, and hospital records

180
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,696
in real time.

181
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,657
Team Four and Five,
handle people around Do Hyeon-su.

182
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:36,203
But the most important fact is
that our fellow detective is held hostage.

183
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,539
Nothing is more important

184
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,208
than her safety. Understood?

185
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,334
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

186
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,252
Get moving.

187
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,326
Your palms will be full of heat rashes.

188
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,662
Pardon?

189
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,336
My girlfriend just hates
being apart from me.

190
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,466
I feel really anxious when we're apart.

191
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,508
Babe.

192
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,804
Let's keep such sensitive information
to ourselves.

193
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,900
No!

194
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,444
Why are you doing this? Don't.

195
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,154
-Shut up.
-Why are you doing this?

196
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,656
-Mr. Yeom!
-Shut up!

197
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,368
Why are you doing this to me?

198
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,212
Tell me the truth, okay?

199
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,506
Okay.

200
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,051
What did you tell Do Hyeon-su…

201
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,012
No, the guy you spoke on the phone?

202
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,430
What?

203
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,768
He asked me who I was.

204
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,061
So?

205
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,149
I said I was Jung Mi-suk. That's all.

206
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,366
Did I make a mistake?

207
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,453
Did you tell him where you were?

208
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,164
No, I didn't.

209
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,543
I don't even know where I am.

210
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,073
I've been here before.

211
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,208
Do you remember it?

212
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,462
Those people.

213
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:21,303
Those people. They locked me up in here.

214
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,390
Open this.

215
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,769
Get me out of here!

216
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,063
Sir, let me out of here.

217
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,523
Please open this door.

218
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,198
Were you lying when you offered…

219
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,701
to find my family?

220
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,834
No. Don't leave.

221
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,672
No! Don't go! No, don't go!

222
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,683
You did a fantastic job.

223
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,770
What

224
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,773
will happen to us now?

225
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,277
Whether it be a car accident
or bodily harm,

226
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,363
the statute of limitations
has already expired.

227
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,657
When

228
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,660
the dust settles,

229
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,330
I'll just wake up like a miracle.

230
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,003
Do you think

231
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:40,757
things will go as planned?

232
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,677
I'm sure of it.

233
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,098
No matter how much Do Hyeon-su
claims his innocence,

234
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,642
it's true that he's wanted for murder.

235
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,270
And he also stole someone else's identity.

236
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,731
He's already guilty.

237
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,483
This is

238
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,279
really the end, right?

239
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,659
You just need to give
your statement to the police.

240
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,414
Try to sound sincere as we practiced.

241
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,594
Who's calling?

242
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,679
INCOMING CALL

243
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,892
The scraps left

244
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,186
from the main course.

245
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,237
I thought we were through.

246
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,323
We still got a bill to settle.

247
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,368
But I already took care of Do Hyeon-su.

248
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,787
How much will you pay for Jung Mi-suk?

249
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,247
Jung Mi-suk?

250
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,541
She's with me.

251
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,338
Yes, I'm on my way.

252
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,674
By the way, how did…

253
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,553
they look?

254
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,067
Right.

255
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:24,861
She completely

256
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,406
slipped my mind.

257
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,039
Bring 500 million won by midnight.

258
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,251
This will be an exchange, right?

259
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:42,045
Give me a call when you have the money.

260
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:44,965
Okay.

261
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,926
I'll do my best to come up with it.

262
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,606
This way, sir.

263
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,865
Hey.

264
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,964
There's always someone
who monitors the CCTVs.

265
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,424
Act natural.

266
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,886
At the entrance, reception,
elevator, and hallway…

267
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,306
While being caught on four cameras,
you glanced around every time

268
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,476
as if you were being chased.

269
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,602
And what about you?

270
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,813
You seem like you've run a simulation
of this situation numerous times.

271
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,401
What's wrong?

272
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:48,862
This is it.

273
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,513
You shouldn't mind
being a bit uncomfortable.

274
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:18,683
That man roaming around your house
could be a serial killer.

275
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,395
I know this is uncomfortable,
but just bear with me, all right?

276
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,318
Come on in.

277
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,739
You can use this room.

278
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,076
Let me change the bed sheet
and the blanket right away.

279
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,037
No, I can sleep on the sofa.
I'll sleep there.

280
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,206
You can lock the door this way.

281
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,999
I know I bother you.

282
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,420
I can see it in your face
that you're uncomfortable because of me.

283
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,256
No, it's just that…

284
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,217
I shouldn't be doing this to you.

285
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,348
Doing what to me?

286
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:04,604
I hurt you all the time,
then use you when I need help.

287
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,898
That's what I'm doing.

288
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:13,238
Why am I always such a burden
to those around me?

289
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:15,991
Look.

290
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,537
You're not a burden to me.

291
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,333
One minute.

292
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,173
-Yes, Ms. Kang.
-Did you know or not?

293
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,635
-About?
-Do Hyeon-su!

294
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,929
Did you really have no idea?

295
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,102
I'm in front of the killer
Do Hyeon-su's workshop.

296
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,980
Baek, the suspect
in the Makmun-dong murder case,

297
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,441
has been revealed to be Do Hyeon-su,

298
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:53,320
a wanted criminal of 18 years for killing
the Gagyeong-ri village head in 2002.

299
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:56,281
It has been confirmed that Do Hyeon-su

300
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,825
has been living as Baek since 2005.

301
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:02,579
He also married Detective Cha

302
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:06,249
as part of a meticulous plan
to change his identity thoroughly.

303
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,501
The police are currently investigating

304
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,087
how he was able to steal
someone else's identity.

305
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:14,924
Do Hyeon-su has been living
a fake life as a fugitive for 18 years.

306
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,470
Ironically, that life has come to an end
due to another murder of his.

307
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,306
Do Hyeon-su has currently taken
his wife hostage and fled

308
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:24,392
after the police found out
about his crime.

309
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,818
Let's hear your plan.

310
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:41,910
What kind of fugitive
tells a cop his plans?

311
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,122
What?

312
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:54,381
I've unwillingly found out that
it's no use trying to reason with a person

313
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,965
who's already suspecting me.

314
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,978
I'm truly sorry that things turned out
this way because of me.

315
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,317
No. I'm not.

316
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,820
I'm not sorry one bit.

317
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,990
Because even I don't know
why I have to go through this.

318
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,287
Why do you keep taking it out on me?

319
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,791
How do you think I feel right now?

320
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,753
How do you think I felt
when your fingerprints were found

321
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,714
on the tape used to tie the victim?

322
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,217
I know my fingerprints
aren't in the database.

323
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,766
You seemed suspicious.

324
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,936
So I checked.

325
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,190
Was that so wrong of me?

326
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:59,446
Anyone in my shoes would've done the same.

327
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,326
But you're not just anyone.

328
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,371
At least to me.

329
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,259
I was really completely fine…

330
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:27,015
no matter how much people hated me
and suspected me for no reason.

331
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,684
I was fine.

332
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,978
But…

333
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:35,940
But

334
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,610
now that it's you…

335
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,946
Now that you're suspecting me…

336
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,202
it's unbearable.

337
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,538
Do you think I know everything?

338
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,667
How could you expect me to trust you
blindly when I know nothing?

339
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,297
How could you expect me

340
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,468
to read your thoughts and your heart?

341
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:06,846
I'm not

342
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,308
capable of doing that.

343
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,981
As far as I know, the police station
is the safest place,

344
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:23,196
so I was only focused on taking you there.

345
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,201
So why are you mad at me?

346
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:29,994
Why?

347
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,248
How would I know if you didn't tell me?

348
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,417
You should've explained it to me.

349
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,421
Look at this.

350
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,924
What have we gotten ourselves into?

351
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,138
Ji-won.

352
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,481
I didn't kill Park Sun-yeong.

353
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,361
I…

354
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,991
didn't kill her.

355
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,020
I only found out

356
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,231
when the police visited our house
regarding Park Gyeong-chun.

357
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,359
You had no idea until then?

358
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,153
If I did,

359
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,657
do you think I would've given him
my precious son's identity?

360
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:54,245
Never in my wildest dreams did I think
things would turn out this way.

361
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,957
This is exactly why I'm asking you
to prevent our admirable Director Baek

362
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,794
from suffering because of all this.

363
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,087
Goodness.

364
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,715
Sir.

365
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:10,094
I don't want to seem like I'm soliciting.

366
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:13,681
Let me pour you one.

367
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,689
I wanted

368
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:26,277
to speak with you today because

369
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,405
I'm extremely concerned
about Detective Cha Ji-won.

370
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,909
I've been curious about the investigation.

371
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,162
I just couldn't sit and watch.

372
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,040
THE HANJOOGAN

373
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:49,842
Kim Moo-jin!

374
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,928
Are you out of your mind?

375
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,472
I know you were focused
on getting the exclusive,

376
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,265
but how could you harbor a wanted killer

377
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,601
and get information from him
for your article?

378
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,396
We shared a common goal
of catching the accomplice

379
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,897
in the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

380
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,441
Do Hyeon-su took his own wife hostage
in order to run away.

381
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,318
Ms. Kang.

382
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,196
There's something to this case.

383
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:13,574
Last night, Do Hyeon-su got a call
from someone and went to Makmun-dong.

384
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,617
And the voice was--

385
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,328
Do you know that Park Sun-yeong's hair
was found in his trunk?

386
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,205
What?

387
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:23,543
Snap out of it. He's a killer.

388
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,336
Who are you trying to defend?

389
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,799
The guy who called me out
to Makmun-dong last night

390
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,093
has framed me.

391
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,433
I'm sure he's the accomplice
we've been looking for.

392
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:45,398
There was a car with a dashcam
parked in front of the phone booth,

393
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,733
so I called the owner.

394
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,528
The number should be on my phone.

395
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,323
The accomplice is very thorough.

396
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,534
Do you think he just
let the dashcam catch him?

397
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,873
I'm sure he covered his face.

398
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,544
Why are you so certain
that the woman who picked up

399
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,088
Yeom Sang-cheol's phone was Jung Mi-suk?

400
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,434
Because she said so herself.

401
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,519
And it didn't sound like a lie.

402
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,023
However,

403
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,193
I wasn't sure
if I could convince the police.

404
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,945
And

405
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,908
I wasn't sure
if they'd prove my innocence either.

406
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,828
That's why I refused to be arrested.

407
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,042
Because they'd probably want
to investigate me first.

408
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,418
And meanwhile,

409
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,755
Yeom Sang-cheol
would sell Jung Mi-suk to him.

410
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,258
But how does running away
so aimlessly help?

411
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,803
By running,

412
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,474
I'm sending Yeom Sang-cheol a message.

413
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,226
A message?

414
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:11,359
A message that I'm no longer
working with the police.

415
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,403
Why would you want to send
such a message to him?

416
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,198
Because I will…

417
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,284
join hands with him.

418
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,678
Baek, the suspect
in the Makmun-dong murder case,

419
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,680
has been revealed to be Do Hyeon-su,

420
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:43,474
a wanted criminal of 18 years for killing
the Gagyeong-ri village head

421
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,684
-in 2002.
-It's 33,000 won.

422
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,978
It has been confirmed that Do Hyeon-su

423
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:50,231
has been living as Baek since 2005.

424
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,026
He also married Detective Cha

425
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,530
as part of a meticulous plan
to change his identity thoroughly.

426
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,824
The police are currently investigating

427
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:02,368
how he was able to steal
someone else's identity.

428
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,121
But I already took care of Do Hyeon-su.

429
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:07,999
What a freak.

430
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,685
What is this?

431
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,150
-Who is this?
-I'm not sure if you're aware of this.

432
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:37,236
But I'm in quite a pickle right now.

433
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,529
Is this Do Hyeon-su?

434
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,699
How dare you frame me?

435
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,910
Life's full of surprises, isn't it?

436
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:47,205
As a fugitive, you've been
brown-nosing the police.

437
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,998
But now, you and I are in the same boat.

438
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,042
How the hell did you do it?

439
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,711
How were you able to frame me?

440
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,548
You're mistaken.
It wasn't me. It was all his doing.

441
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,468
Help me meet with him.

442
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,304
My life motto is

443
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,224
to never stand surety
or arrange any meetings for anyone.

444
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,977
All I want is him.

445
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,939
And I know all you want is the money.

446
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,399
So?

447
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,528
Let's join hands.

448
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,202
Why should I?

449
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,292
Is Jung Mi-suk doing well?

450
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,170
That's not your concern.

451
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,589
I'm sure

452
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:43,928
you still have her.
You haven't handed her over to him.

453
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,263
Aren't I right?

454
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,099
Why do you think so?

455
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:52,103
Because had you met him,
you would've been killed already.

456
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,816
Do you really think he'll let you live?

457
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,361
When he knows you'll blackmail him
for the rest of his life?

458
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,406
I'm not a fool
who can be deceived that easily.

459
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,327
But I deceived you.

460
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,207
And that bastard deceived me.

461
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:18,004
You'll get your money, I'll get him,

462
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,423
and Jung Mi-suk will be spared.

463
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,508
What do you say?

464
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,094
I have to think about it.

465
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:31,058
He's too dangerous.
I don't want him as an enemy.

466
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,604
Don't you have any other
tempting offers for me?

467
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,649
NEGOTIATION X

468
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,116
I won't negotiate with you.

469
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,786
Hello? Hey.

470
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,793
That impudent asshole hung up on me.

471
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,628
That son of a bitch.

472
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,715
He should've been begging on his knees.

473
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,177
If the call drags on,
it'll put you at a disadvantage

474
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,970
since you don't have much choice.

475
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,389
But he said everything we wanted to hear.

476
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:14,185
Do you think he'll agree
to join hands with me?

477
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,396
Seeing how he wanted
to keep speaking to you,

478
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,357
I'd say he's half-convinced.

479
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,665
Here's food.

480
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,045
Have it if you want.

481
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,056
Will it be Do Hyeon-su

482
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,850
or Baek Hee-seong?

483
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:07,071
This side is Do Hyeon-su.

484
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,784
This side is Baek Hee-seong.

485
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,916
Can you just kill me now…

486
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,879
instead of handing me over
to that yellow-haired guy?

487
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:26,882
Yellow-haired guy?

488
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,722
Go straight in that direction,
and you'll find a cliff.

489
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,226
Take care of her there.

490
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,770
He even killed his partner…

491
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,524
from behind.

492
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,818
He grabbed a rock…

493
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,323
and smashed his head.

494
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,251
Then Do Min-seok didn't commit suicide?

495
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:03,103
You're mistaken.
It wasn't me. It was all his doing.

496
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,898
Help me meet with him.

497
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,776
My life motto is…

498
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,073
It was all his doing.

499
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:22,540
Hello, this is room 908.
We're out of towels.

500
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:23,874
Could you bring some up?

501
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,043
-Okay.
-Thank you.

502
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,050
Everything has been recorded.

503
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:37,638
It's only circumstantial evidence,
but it'll prove your innocence.

504
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,683
We just need to figure out
how to lure him.

505
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,895
For Yeom Sang-cheol
to trust you completely,

506
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,065
I need to stay as your hostage.

507
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:52,778
If you tell him that
I'll be kept as your hostage

508
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,697
until he leaves safely with the money,

509
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,074
he'll never turn it down.

510
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,559
I love you.

511
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,190
But why do you sound so sad?

512
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,945
Now, go back to your place.

513
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,659
Go back to where you belong.

514
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,788
What do you mean?

515
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,876
It's a good idea

516
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,837
for you to continue being my hostage.

517
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:53,464
What?

518
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,179
Are you serious?

519
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,266
Uncuff me! Let me free right now!

520
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,144
Tell them I dragged you here
against your will.

521
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:10,606
You deceived me again.

522
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:13,400
I need to join hands
with an obnoxious guy like him.

523
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:18,322
I refuse to pull you
into this, no matter what.

524
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,616
I don't mind.

525
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,952
You're going to give your all
to reveal the truth…

526
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:26,997
as a detective.

527
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:34,463
So…

528
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,930
Don't even think about tailing me.

529
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:48,852
If you leave now like this,
I will never see you again.

530
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,147
I really won't.

531
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,073
So don't leave.

532
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,243
Don't leave me behind.

533
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,522
I'll be back.

534
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,697
We will meet again soon,

535
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,534
so don't talk like
this is our last goodbye.

536
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,786
Instead, wish me luck.

537
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,544
Stay safe, okay?

538
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,362
Have you made up your mind?
Whom will you side with?

539
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:07,658
Let's make this clear.
It's you who's siding with me.

540
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,955
Where should we meet?

541
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,876
Hae-su, you can't just leave like this.

542
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,588
You told me to keep my distance
from Hyeon-su. How can I do that?

543
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,550
All the evidence says
that he's Park Sun-yeong's killer.

544
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:28,554
I don't want people
to suspect you for defending him.

545
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,430
I'm doing this for you.

546
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:34,268
He received a call from the accomplice.
It means he's been framed.

547
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,062
There's no proof
that he was the accomplice.

548
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,899
And it's only Hyeon-su who thinks
that the voice sounds similar.

549
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,902
He had a motive for murder,
and now, there's even proof.

550
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,696
Of course, we trust him.

551
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,948
But there's no way
we can convince other people.

552
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,116
Why…

553
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:54,037
do you always become a coward
when I need you the most?

554
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,249
What?

555
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:23,942
Right, the car keys.

556
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:35,829
Mr. Kim Moo-jin?

557
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:37,873
Yes?

558
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,419
You're guilty of harboring Do Hyeon-su.

559
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,921
Please come with us.

560
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,883
I told you, I'm really fine.

561
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,968
Still, you should go to the hospital.

562
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,762
Nothing happened.

563
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,056
He didn't even touch a hair.

564
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:57,809
You may be a detective,
but before that, you're a kidnap victim.

565
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,853
So you should get
a checkup at the hospital.

566
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,980
-If you wait there--
-I'm not a victim.

567
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:04,441
Of course, you are. You were tied up.

568
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:07,694
That's

569
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,656
sensitive information
about this investigation,

570
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,574
so I can't disclose the details.

571
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,452
Detective Cha.

572
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:17,663
Captain.

573
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,874
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

574
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:22,542
No, I'm fine.

575
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:26,964
But we need to check the Park Sun-yeong
case again from the start.

576
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,009
The person

577
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:35,555
who killed Park Sun-yeong
is Do Min-seok's accomplice.

578
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:49,903
Hey, you…

579
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,532
I'm sorry for causing you concern, sir.

580
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:58,996
You'll get your money, I'll get him,

581
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,498
and Jung Mi-suk will be spared.

582
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,500
What do you say?

583
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,169
I have to think about it.

584
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:10,048
He's too dangerous.
I don't want him as an enemy.

585
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:15,053
Don't you have any other
tempting offers for me?

586
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:16,972
I won't negotiate with you.

587
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:20,726
That is all.

588
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,645
Are you certain that this Jung Mi-suk

589
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:25,939
is the one we know?

590
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,233
Circumstantially, she must be.

591
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:32,446
It explains why we haven't
been able to find her body.

592
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,951
Detective Cha's return
needs to be kept secret.

593
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:39,911
Why?

594
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:42,539
If the press becomes interested in her,

595
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:45,042
this recording might get leaked.

596
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,669
If the accomplice finds out,
things will go awry.

597
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:52,466
Have you all forgotten that
she's also a subject of the investigation?

598
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,470
Despite that, you'll make a move
based on what she said?

599
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:01,391
If we suffer a bigger loss
by not trusting her, then we should

600
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,476
trust her.

601
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,936
He's the accomplice
in the serial murder case.

602
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:08,356
We must use this opportunity to catch him.

603
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,735
Yes, that would be great.

604
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,280
If we can catch him,
it'll be best for all of us.

605
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,952
Are you positive you can identify him?

606
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:22,829
Yes, I am.

607
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,457
We can, sir.

608
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,751
We will at all costs.

609
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:31,546
Yoon, take Team Three
and go about this discreetly.

610
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,090
Yes, sir.

611
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:44,726
Why are you giving in
to Yeom Sang-cheol's demands?

612
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,854
I have to give him what he wants

613
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,232
to make him leave this country.

614
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,318
Is that all?

615
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,823
Then what else?

616
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:01,159
He will be demanding more money.

617
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,001
CHIEF KANG

618
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,922
Hello, Chief Kang.

619
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:19,052
Are you saying
Do Hyeon-su has been caught?

620
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:24,766
I see.

621
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:28,186
Detective Cha's return
should be kept secret.

622
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,689
Please be careful.

623
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,482
Of course.

624
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,068
Thank you for calling.

625
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,156
What was that about?

626
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:43,618
They found Cha Ji-won
locked up in a motel.

627
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,163
Do Hyeon-su wasn't there.

628
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:49,040
How is she?

629
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:54,838
She's completely fine.
She wasn't injured one bit.

630
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,091
But most importantly,

631
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:03,221
she claims that Do Hyeon-su had
nothing to do with Park Sun-yeong's death.

632
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,434
Why so?

633
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,228
On what grounds?

634
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:14,733
I don't know the details
regarding the investigation.

635
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,904
Could she have discovered something?

636
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,095
Who are you?

637
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,727
Who are you?

638
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,080
Do Hyeon-su.

639
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,333
You're under arrest
for the murder of Park Sun-yeong.

640
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,628
I knew it. Staking out
Do Hae-su's house surely paid off.

641
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:22,467
Don't let him run away!
He's the accomplice!

642
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,804
What's going on? This isn't Do Hyeon-su?

643
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,269
Hello.

644
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,946
Wait. If you have nothing
to do with Do Hyeon-su's escape…

645
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:45,824
Do you see the guy
who's reading a book behind me?

646
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,755
I think you're mistaken.

647
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,341
We'll listen
to the victim's statement first.

648
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:05,677
Pardon?

649
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:14,144
We found your phone in the workshop.

650
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:18,857
Captain.

651
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,861
You're very disappointed in me,
aren't you?

652
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,531
I have no excuse.

653
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:30,076
It's true that I deceived
everyone on the team.

654
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,120
I haven't had time to feel disappointed.

655
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,205
I've been too worried about you.

656
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,542
This way.

657
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,669
Ji-won.

658
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:45,133
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

659
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,719
I'm fine. I'm not hurt.

660
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:48,928
Hey, Ji-won.

661
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:53,141
I almost got a heart attack
because of you. You know that?

662
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,601
Do you know how worried I was?

663
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:57,645
How did you escape?
Where's Do Hyeon-su now?

664
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:58,813
Well…

665
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:04,861
Ms. Do?

666
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:18,750
What happened?

667
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,712
Why did you go to Ms. Do's house?

668
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,465
To catch Do Hyeon-su, of course.

669
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:29,010
Isn't that why you were nearby as well?

670
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,678
You invaded her privacy.

671
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,555
-You also stalked her.
-I stalked her?

672
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:36,142
Ask him where he was
at 2:30 a.m. last night.

673
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:40,313
Where were you at 2:30 a.m. last night?

674
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,190
Why is that important?

675
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:46,403
I was with my colleagues
from 9:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. last night.

676
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,738
At 2:30 a.m., the accomplice called

677
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:52,367
my husband from a payphone in Makmun-dong.

678
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:55,453
That's why he went to Makmun-dong and…

679
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:59,332
Mom!

680
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:00,708
Eun-ha.

681
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,464
Why are you here? Where's Grandma?

682
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,676
I'm sorry for not telling you sooner.

683
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,680
Your mother is hospitalized right now.

684
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,265
What?

685
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,267
Mom.

686
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,395
Where's Dad?

687
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:26,693
Where is he?

688
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,532
Mom, are you all right?

689
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,994
I'm at the police station.

690
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,497
I'm okay.

691
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:41,916
I really am.

692
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:44,836
What about you?

693
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,592
No, not me. Are you okay?

694
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:05,732
By the way, who are you?

695
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,318
Me?

696
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,991
Well… I'm…

697
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,834
Eun-Ha can't go to kindergarten
at the moment,

698
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,629
so someone needs
to look after her all day.

699
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:32,634
And you're the only one
I can trust right now.

700
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,262
-For a few days--
-I have a lot of time on my hands.

701
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,765
So,

702
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,310
I'll take good care of her.
I'll do my best.

703
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,358
Eun-ha.

704
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:51,611
She's going to teach you
how to draw from now on.

705
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:53,696
Be a good student

706
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,323
and get along with her, okay?

707
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:56,741
Okay.

708
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:01,538
Teacher, I really love to draw.

709
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,171
I can't tell you the details just yet,

710
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,090
but don't worry too much.

711
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:16,135
We will catch him at all costs.

712
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:18,888
Okay.

713
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:20,598
Mom.

714
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,393
Where's Dad?

715
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,690
He said he'd be back soon.

716
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,901
He will keep his promise.

717
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,656
-Here's your jacket.
-Take it with you.

718
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:40,410
Once this is all over,
I'll invite you over to our house.

719
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:41,494
Give it back then.

720
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,174
How about you just leave like this?

721
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,224
Mimicking Cha Ji-won

722
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,602
won't make you become like her.

723
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:11,024
Until the moment of truth comes,

724
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:15,778
no one knows what their true face is like.

725
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:50,938
I forgot to give this to her.

726
01:00:57,195 --> 01:01:01,407
REPORTER KIM

727
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:06,371
-Yes, Moo-jin.
-Where are you right now?

728
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:09,832
After being questioned,
I came straight over to your house.

729
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,461
But all I see here is your suitcase.

730
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:17,090
I'm with Eun-ha right now.

731
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:18,925
Eun-ha?

732
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,428
Let me pack some stuff for her
before heading to your place.

733
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:26,140
Sure. I'm not sure what this is about,
but I'll pick you up.

734
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:27,809
No, it's all right.

735
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:31,646
They caught the person
who was lurking around my house.

736
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,648
They did? Who was it?

737
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,192
I'll tell you when we meet.

738
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:41,114
And I'm sorry about what I said earlier.

739
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:42,782
What?

740
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:47,495
I was being too harsh.

741
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,791
I've already forgotten about that.
Don't worry.

742
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:54,836
-Moo-jin.
-Yes?

743
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:59,507
How does this necklace look
exactly the same?

744
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:04,053
It's still shining so beautifully.

745
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,890
Are you wearing the necklace I gave you?

746
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:12,019
-Since when?
-I'll see you at your place.

747
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,521
Okay.

748
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:06,866
What happened to the door?

749
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:10,703
Did they search the house too?

750
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:11,996
What?

751
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:16,501
What? Oh, it's nothing.
Let's hurry and pack your stuff.

752
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,254
What was that?

753
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,339
Maybe my dad's here.

754
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:09,345
Stay here, Eun-ha. I'll go check.

755
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:10,930
Okay.

756
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:21,524
What?

757
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,151
Why are the lights off?

758
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,005
Detective Cha Ji-won?

759
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:48,301
-Dad?
-Don't come out.

760
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:57,101
Eun-ha, lock the door.

761
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,149
Promise me

762
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:07,153
that you won't open the door
unless it's Mom.

763
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:11,157
Can you do that, Eun-ha?

764
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,576
Okay.

765
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:33,012
CHA JI-WON
POLICE AGENCY

766
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,544
I didn't want to do this either.

767
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:52,466
But you're too unpredictable.

768
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:57,388
You're like an uncontrollable variable.

769
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:16,282
CHA JI-WON
POLICE AGENCY

770
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,994
That's why I have no choice
but to kill you.

771
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,792
Spare my daughter.

772
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,253
I beg you.

773
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:33,049
I will…

774
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:39,013
if you answer…

775
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:42,475
my question.

776
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:51,400
Why do you think Do Hyeon-su is innocent?

777
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,615
I want to know if I made any mistake

778
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:00,493
when I took care of Park Sun-yeong.

779
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,041
There must be a reason.

780
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,051
Murdering someone…

781
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:20,763
isn't something…

782
01:08:23,557 --> 01:08:25,142
Hyeon-su is capable of.

783
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,607
Because Hyeon-su…

784
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:36,570
can't feel hatred towards other people.

785
01:09:01,345 --> 01:09:03,973
Since I talked with him
on the phone last night,

786
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:05,558
I haven't erased anything.

787
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:07,935
Thank you for your cooperation.

788
01:09:08,602 --> 01:09:09,645
Let's go.

789
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:18,612
HIDE-AND-SEEK
I CAN SEE YOU, BUT YOU CAN'T SEE ME

790
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:34,628
Let me repeat myself.

791
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:38,090
I need to get my hands
on the money first, got that?

792
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:03,115
CHA JI-WON
POLICE AGENCY

793
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:37,316
-Gosh!
-Hey, isn't it so refreshing?

794
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:44,573
Hey.

795
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,618
Yes, it is refreshing. Isn't it?

796
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:50,371
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

797
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:52,998
-Stop that.
-Okay.

798
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,460
-Hey!
-Hyeon-su, help me.

799
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:58,921
Hyeon-su.

800
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:02,549
All right!

801
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:04,093
Gosh!

802
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:21,837
Baek Hee-seong.

803
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:25,591
Baek Hee-seong has come around.

804
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,260
Where is your son?

805
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:33,307
Because you have no idea
why you're going through all this.

806
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:36,018
And that's exactly how I feel now.

807
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:39,063
Hi. Nice to see you.

808
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:41,732
You must've been dying to know who I was.

809
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:43,525
Please hurry and come.

810
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:46,737
Please come and save Do Hyeon-su.

811
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:52,826
