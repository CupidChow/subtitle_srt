1
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,741
Yes, I'm on my way.

2
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,619
No, it's all right.

3
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,873
I appreciate you saying that.

4
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,170
It's going to be tough,
but I'll have to face it myself.

5
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,465
By the way,

6
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,426
how did…

7
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,763
they look?

8
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,934
That's a relief.

9
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,725
Hey.

10
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,435
Are you okay?

11
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:50,568
I'll call 911. Hang in there.

12
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,453
-No.
-What?

13
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,209
No… No hospital.

14
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,586
Sorry?

15
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,882
No… No hospital.

16
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,646
One, two, three.

17
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,540
Get the defibrillator. 150 joules.

18
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,462
Step back.

19
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,715
Shock.

20
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,427
Two hundred joules.

21
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,265
Shock.

22
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,602
Hae-su.

23
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,103
Hae-su!

24
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,606
Come down for a minute.

25
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:11,941
Why?

26
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,535
Hae-su.

27
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,216
You should live

28
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,427
a normal life.

29
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,056
And don't you ever…

30
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,643
look for me.

31
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,356
I…

32
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,153
I'm never…

33
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,033
going to live as Do Hyeon-su.

34
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,404
PATIENT: BAEK HEE-SEONG

35
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,087
He's up.

36
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,715
Do Hyeon-su.

37
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,930
POLICE

38
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,686
It's all over.

39
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,529
Do

40
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,991
Hyeon-su.

41
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,084
Are you okay?

42
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,047
I'll escort you to your room.

43
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,054
Let's go.

44
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,999
It's okay.

45
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,210
I'm all right.

46
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,896
Can you meet me just once? Please?

47
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,814
I'm around your workplace.

48
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,941
Then just one question.

49
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:08,988
On May 12, 2002, you witnessed
Jung Mi-suk getting kidnapped, right?

50
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:10,865
Hello?

51
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,450
-What is that?
-Ms. Jang Yeong-hui?

52
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,494
-Look at that. Is that real?
-What?

53
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,622
Park Gyeong-chun, the suspect
in the Chinese restaurant murder case,

54
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,999
turned out to be the husband
of Jung Mi-suk,

55
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,919
one of the victims
of the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

56
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,297
Park, a taxi driver,
brutally murdered Nam, his passenger,

57
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,800
at Nam's Chinese restaurant.

58
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,178
Park's crimes didn't stop there.

59
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,847
He kidnapped and confined
another passenger, Baek,

60
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,350
and caused him severe injuries.

61
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,644
It's been raising questions

62
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:43,231
about Park's motive
and his relationship with the victims.

63
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,483
Meanwhile, the police have announced

64
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,110
that they're investigating his motive.

65
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,031
Name, Baek Hee-seong. Age, 39.

66
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:55,535
He was brought here ten days ago
after suffering from a cardiac arrest.

67
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,036
His heart stopped for eight minutes,

68
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,080
so we administered
targeted temperature management.

69
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,667
-In two days, his temperature rose--
-"Targeted temperature management"?

70
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,211
Let me put it simply.
When an animal hibernates,

71
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,129
its metabolism slows down, right?

72
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,423
We quickly lowered your temperature

73
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,677
to slow your metabolism to prevent
as much cell damage as possible.

74
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,681
Your memory could get mixed up or lost,

75
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,391
so I'll ask you a few questions.

76
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,560
Sure.

77
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,020
Tell me your birth date and name.

78
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,816
I was born on March 15,

79
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,194
1982, and my name is Baek Hee-seong.

80
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,656
What's your wife's name?

81
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,246
Cha Ji-won.

82
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,207
And your daughter's?

83
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:46,919
My daughter?

84
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,590
Do I have a daughter?

85
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,595
Dad, it's me.

86
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,431
Why don't you remember me?

87
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,225
It's all right.

88
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,894
One's memory gets restored
in inverse order.

89
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,439
This could happen.

90
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,820
She's Baek Eun-ha, and she's six.

91
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,780
She was born in September, 2015.

92
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,075
She goes to Tiny Bird Kindergarten.

93
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,869
I hate you.

94
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,624
Goodness, your husband is completely fine.

95
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,711
-Professor Shin.
-Director Baek.

96
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,050
Hello.

97
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,594
How is he?

98
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,889
Sir, I'm afraid we'll have to kick him out
of the hospital.

99
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,392
-He's messing around with his doctor.
-His vitals?

100
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,479
Since he's very healthy,
he's recovering very quickly.

101
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,397
I'll let you guys be.

102
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,107
Let's go.

103
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,073
You must've been extremely worried.

104
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,411
He's finally free
from all the medical equipment.

105
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,749
I have nothing more to ask for.

106
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,752
How are you feeling?

107
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,963
-Are you in pain anywhere?
-I'm okay.

108
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,634
I'm sorry for worrying you.

109
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,014
What in the world have you been doing?

110
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,266
-Do you think your life is yours--
-Honey.

111
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,394
His mother-in-law is here.

112
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:32,066
-Hello.
-Hello. I'm so relieved Hee-seong…

113
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,987
I'm so relieved that
my son-in-law is recovering well.

114
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,700
You should've told me
if your mother was coming.

115
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,412
I was thoughtless. I'm sorry.

116
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,916
I'd like to have some privacy
with my family.

117
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,836
Pardon? "My family"?

118
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,631
There are no strangers here.
We're all family.

119
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,966
Mom.

120
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,472
Eun-ha, I'll buy you some snacks.
Let's go.

121
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,142
No. I want to be with him.

122
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,061
He's exhausted.

123
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,896
-Let's go.
-No.

124
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,524
I don't want to. I hate you.

125
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,610
I hate you.

126
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,405
Eun-ha.

127
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,867
You need to listen to her
if you want me to go home soon.

128
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,034
Okay?

129
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,873
Give her to me. Come here.

130
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:32,835
Let's go.

131
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,510
That little thing has quite a temper.

132
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,763
-I just can't be fond of her.
-It's Baek Eun-ha.

133
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,098
What?

134
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,770
She's not "that little thing."
Her name is Baek Eun-ha.

135
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,941
Gosh, I've never met such people before.

136
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,651
What? "Privacy with my family"?

137
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,279
Does she think
her family is so high and mighty?

138
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,371
-What are you looking at?
-What?

139
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,415
What are you staring at?

140
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,459
It's nothing.

141
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,505
I'm just worried about him. Let's go.

142
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,217
What will we do now?

143
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,677
About Park Gyeong-chun.

144
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,889
I heard he's in bad shape.

145
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,642
We can't predict
how this situation will unfold.

146
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,606
But we're not necessarily
at a disadvantage.

147
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,858
No.

148
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,654
Perhaps, this could benefit us.

149
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,951
He received surgery for a fractured skull,

150
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,829
but he's not doing well.

151
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,873
He regained consciousness,

152
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,918
but he's not responding
to any external stimuli.

153
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,003
Mr. Park Gyeong-chun?

154
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,798
Answer me, Mr. Park.

155
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,009
Why is he like this?

156
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,011
The surgery was a success,

157
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,180
and his arteries are very clean too.

158
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,854
-You should rest up too.
-I will.

159
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,107
Eun-ha, say bye to her.

160
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:22,820
Mom, when can we go home?

161
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,743
Your dad's going to be discharged soon.

162
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,622
-We'll get going.
-Mom.

163
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,876
Can you just stay?

164
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,674
I just want to spend more time with you.

165
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,682
He just needs to be discharged.

166
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,227
There's not going to be
any more bad news, okay?

167
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,858
Stop by in the evening.

168
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,694
I'll make your favorite,
braised short ribs with ripe kimchi.

169
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,529
Okay.

170
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,073
Mom.

171
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,242
See you later.

172
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,703
Okay, I'll see you later.

173
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,746
Okay.

174
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,459
Bye.

175
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,552
Hey, Ho-jun.

176
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,512
Don't worry about Ji-won.

177
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,765
I'll take care of her.

178
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,602
Did she not find it suspicious
that you were there?

179
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,521
Do Min-seok's workshop
still remains there.

180
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,857
I told her

181
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,778
I tagged along with the reporter
Kim Moo-jin out of curiosity.

182
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,156
How can you trust that reporter?

183
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,285
-I have something on him.
-And what is that?

184
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:56,997
That's something

185
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,084
you don't need to know.

186
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,796
Do you not trust us?

187
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,508
How much do you trust me?

188
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,679
Quit talking nonsense.

189
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,890
Our problem right now is Park Gyeong-chun.

190
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,561
So? Do you have a solution?

191
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,397
Tell me.

192
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,983
How will you stop him from talking?

193
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,652
-Calm down, will you?
-"Calm down"?

194
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:31,156
That bastard, Park Gyeong-chun,
is pretty much a time bomb.

195
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,330
Did you already forget

196
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,834
where that temper of yours
put us 15 years ago?

197
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,754
Have you already forgotten
why we're so afraid

198
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,173
of that worthless bastard?

199
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,850
This case

200
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,812
is too much for you. Go home.

201
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,193
I'm saying this for your sake.

202
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,448
I know.

203
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:18,996
I know very well how worthless I am.

204
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,846
-Ji-won.
-Hey.

205
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:39,433
It's really great. It is.
I'm so happy right now.

206
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,561
You look happier than me.

207
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:45,856
Do you know how worried I was?

208
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,776
I thought something would happen
to you as well.

209
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,430
Doctor.

210
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,476
Why isn't he waking up?

211
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,395
You raised his temperature,
so why isn't he waking up?

212
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,606
We're still giving him sedatives.

213
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,566
Can you check on him?

214
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,611
He's not moving at all.

215
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,240
He doesn't look like he's asleep.
He looks like a doll.

216
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,118
It's too strange. Please check on him.

217
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,036
That's what you said yesterday.

218
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,288
No, he's really strange today.

219
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:47,543
You shouldn't break down already.
It's only been five days.

220
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,129
He may have to stay here for a while.

221
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,715
You need to brace yourself
and stay strong.

222
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,676
Ji-won.

223
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,305
Let's go.

224
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,141
ILSIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

225
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,144
He said it's only been five days.

226
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,524
How can a day feel like forever?

227
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,698
You don't look too exhilarated.

228
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:22,536
I thought you'd be dancing with joy
once he woke up.

229
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,664
I did a while back.
Tell me about Park Gyeong-chun instead.

230
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,041
I'm going insane.

231
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,711
They'll decide whether to issue
a warrant tomorrow.

232
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,297
I think he's trying to avoid
getting apprehended.

233
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,631
What did his doctor say?

234
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:40,929
"I see no problems that
could've affected his cognitive ability."

235
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,306
That's what he said.

236
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,100
But it's not certain yet
because his cancer's weakened his body.

237
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,317
The police are asking us to cooperate.

238
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,405
They'll determine whether to issue
a warrant for Park Gyeong-chun tomorrow.

239
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,951
The doctor's opinion
won't be in his favor.

240
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,248
It's highly likely
that he'll get apprehended tomorrow.

241
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,542
That means--

242
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,212
We need to make our move tonight.

243
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,514
Do you want to do it?

244
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,853
His body is already addicted
to narcotic analgesics.

245
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,564
Medically speaking,

246
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:37,069
he could have a heart attack anytime.

247
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,740
On top of that, he doesn't have
any family who'd request an autopsy.

248
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,080
If you're up for it, I'll help you.

249
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,751
Can you not do it yourself?

250
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,851
I'll have to think about it.

251
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,687
Sure.

252
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,406
Tonight is our only chance.

253
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,367
Don't forget that.

254
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,418
The victim's testimony?

255
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:38,463
Yes. Do you think
your husband will agree to it?

256
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,385
If the victim testifies
about how cunning and brutal

257
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,846
Park Gyeong-chun is,
it'll put him at a disadvantage.

258
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,559
And your husband
was tortured by him as well.

259
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:54,938
Okay.

260
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,566
-You're incredible.
-Who is he?

261
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,694
-Are you really alive?
-What a pervert.

262
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,406
I thought you'd die for real this time.

263
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,617
You're really resilient.

264
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:11,288
According to Ji-won,
you haven't gone to the police yet.

265
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,124
I've been avoiding them saying I'm busy.

266
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,335
You and I haven't discussed it yet.

267
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,338
Well done.

268
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:23,508
I'm sorry, but can you not compliment me?
I don't want to feel like your henchman.

269
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,636
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

270
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,599
I got it.

271
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,727
So you and I-- Yes, a coincidence.

272
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,020
What do you take me for?

273
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,773
I said I got it, so why are you
telling me to repeat after you?

274
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,858
You-- Hey, I got to go.

275
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,032
Ma'am, let me do it.

276
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,828
No, let me. I'll do it.

277
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,458
Don't do this.

278
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,710
I really have no information for you.

279
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,670
Of course, you do.

280
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:05,300
Ms. Jang, you're the last person
who saw Ms. Jung alive.

281
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:09,388
You just need to tell me exactly what
you saw on that night 18 years ago.

282
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,680
I don't know.

283
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,975
How could I remember something
from 18 years ago?

284
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,728
Come on. You even reported it.

285
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,563
I was mistaken.

286
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,441
You heard about Park Gyeong-chun, right?

287
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,194
He's Ms. Jung's husband.

288
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,238
They could've saved her

289
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,408
if they investigated properly
when you reported it.

290
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:30,992
This is my daughter.

291
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:35,080
I just want to live a quiet life
taking care of her.

292
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,999
Ms. Jang, you must be mistaken.

293
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,710
I'm not trying to torment you.

294
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,380
I'm trying to find out how poor
the police investigation was.

295
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:47,259
Sir, don't come back here.
Do me a favor and let this go.

296
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:52,013
What if I testify
and that killer harms my girl?

297
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,183
Do Min-seok died years ago.

298
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,685
Not him.

299
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,188
What? What do you mean?

300
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,985
It's nothing. Move aside.

301
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,033
Are you sure about this?

302
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,036
Yes, I'll be fine.

303
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,581
Are you confident?

304
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,125
Do I need to be?

305
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,544
No.

306
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,964
It's just that it'll be hard
for you to recall that day.

307
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,683
Why are you so startled?

308
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,650
Look. You had something in your hair.

309
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:55,368
-Why are you tense?
-Am I?

310
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,168
Help!

311
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,214
Hee-seong!

312
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,052
Why are you giving me that look?

313
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,389
I keep thinking about…

314
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,851
how you were that night.

315
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,984
I've prepared a questionnaire for you.

316
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,403
If it's too much for you,
just let me know.

317
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,947
Okay. Thank you.

318
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,201
Detective Choi.

319
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,286
Hey.

320
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:42,541
Oh, me? I'm fine. You guys
must've been worried sick about me.

321
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,918
But I'm… I'm really fine.

322
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:48,588
So keep up what you've been doing
and don't visit me.

323
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,715
He's sulky.

324
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,843
It's been a while.

325
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:57,430
I heard you were injured,
but I couldn't go since I was recovering.

326
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,350
Gosh, you went through so much.

327
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,436
But judging by the state
Park Gyeong-chun is in,

328
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,689
your husband must be a good fighter.

329
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,275
Did you throw some good punches
back in the day?

330
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,360
He's a victim. Watch what you say.

331
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,572
-What is that?
-It's a questionnaire.

332
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,658
What kind of cop hands out questionnaires?

333
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,078
Shall we begin?

334
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,456
You're going to do it?

335
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,710
I'm so bored in here. Let's begin.

336
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,673
Mr. Baek.

337
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,259
Yes?

338
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:42,058
Why did Park Gyeong-chun torture you
instead of killing you right away?

339
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,440
Torture

340
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:53,194
is an extreme measure
to obtain a certain answer from someone.

341
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,949
This is what I was most curious about.

342
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,414
"What kind of question
did Park Gyeong-chun ask?"

343
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,957
What are you doing?

344
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,003
You're asking a victim a leading question.

345
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,673
Honey, don't try too hard to answer.

346
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,968
If you don't know
or can't remember, just say so.

347
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,638
-Answer simply.
-Ji-won.

348
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,683
If you're going to act like a cop,
sit next to me.

349
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,019
If you're going to help him testify,
sit next to him.

350
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,687
Don't interrupt us out of the blue.

351
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,941
He's right. You overreacted a bit.

352
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,027
You know how Detective Choi operates.

353
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,655
Hurry up and make a decision. Let's work.

354
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,325
I'm okay.

355
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,205
I'll just stay out of it.

356
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:13,191
While trying to persuade Park Gyeong-chun,
I mentioned that my wife was a detective.

357
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:18,154
Then he started venting his anger on me
asking why she failed to save his wife.

358
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,657
I fainted after getting stabbed
in the arm.

359
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:25,954
When I woke up,
the water was already up to my chest.

360
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,459
That's the weirdest part.

361
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,172
Why didn't he kill you
with the same method

362
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,883
he used to kill Nam Sun-gil?

363
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,053
Why did he invest time
and try to drown you?

364
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,306
It…

365
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,268
beats me.

366
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,731
I think I know.

367
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,609
Had we been five minutes late,

368
00:28:56,693 --> 00:29:00,447
no, maybe just a little late,
Mr. Baek would've died.

369
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,700
Then we would've been
racked with guilt forever.

370
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,035
Perhaps, that's what he wanted.

371
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,705
After all, he abhors the police.

372
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:12,959
Right, that makes sense.
You're incredible.

373
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,296
Hey, are you Park's attorney or something?

374
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:20,008
How would you know
what was going through his mind?

375
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,428
Exactly.

376
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,223
Park Gyeong-chun
is the only one who knows that.

377
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,769
It's only natural
I don't know why he did that.

378
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:35,523
Could you only ask me questions
that I can answer,

379
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,567
Detective Choi Jae-seop?

380
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,448
So you're saying

381
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:46,910
that you just happened
to become acquainted with Mr. Kim

382
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,453
and decided to tag along with him.

383
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:53,541
Then you happened to get into Park's taxi
and happened to be abducted. Am I right?

384
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,670
Was that a question?

385
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,381
A doubt, if you will.

386
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,180
Detective Choi.

387
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,475
Do you not like me?

388
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,936
Me? Why?

389
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,438
Don't you know
how much I cherish Detective Cha?

390
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,317
I know everything.

391
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,822
When Ji-won first introduced me to you,

392
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,950
you treated me like a brother,
and we drank together.

393
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:30,745
But behind my back,
you told her to break up with me.

394
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,665
You said I was despicable.

395
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:40,964
Did I ever do something wrong to you?

396
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:45,051
If you tell me,
I'd like to sincerely apologize.

397
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,558
I've realized something in life.

398
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,102
As you can see, I'm not that likable.

399
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,981
Despite that, if people try hard
to get on my good side,

400
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,566
there are only three reasons.

401
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,359
They've lied,

402
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,528
they plan to lie,

403
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,364
or they're lying at the moment.

404
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,870
So that means

405
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:16,374
someone who has a personal bias against me

406
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,169
is in charge of getting my testimony?

407
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,719
-Detective Im.
-Yes?

408
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:31,890
I think it'd be better if you took over.

409
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,561
Sure. Sir, I'll do it.

410
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,983
Fine. Speaking with victims
isn't really my thing.

411
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,904
Once that bastard,
Park Gyeong-chun, gets arrested,

412
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,823
I'll uncover everything
in that filthy mind of his.

413
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,597
Cha Ji-won
from Gangsu Police Station speaking.

414
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,350
First, I'd like to thank you

415
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,937
for catching the culprit.

416
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:23,316
You've set things right for Sun-gil.

417
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,069
I only did what was necessary.

418
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,906
I called because I thought

419
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:32,408
you should know about this.

420
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,037
What is this regarding?

421
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:41,584
I have something to report
about Do Hyeon-su.

422
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,924
I called because
I thought it could help you.

423
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,469
I think we should speak in person.

424
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,889
I'll be visiting my parents next week.

425
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,059
It'd be nice if we could meet before then.

426
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,272
I'll visit you
as soon as this case is closed.

427
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,150
And…

428
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,779
Detective Cha?

429
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,450
I'd appreciate it if you didn't share

430
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,203
that information with anyone else.

431
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,164
Of course. I won't.

432
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:24,293
I hope you'll get all the credit.

433
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,505
Thank you for understanding.

434
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,805
After the Hoesin-dong Murder Case

435
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:39,976
turned out to be another tragedy
caused by the Yeonju Serial Murder Case,

436
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:44,605
Do Min-seok, the cause of all this,
has become the center of attention.

437
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,567
This is the very workshop
where the heinous serial killer,

438
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,486
Do Min-seok, and his missing son,
Do Hyeon-su,

439
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,655
lived together.

440
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:57,368
This place still looks the same.

441
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,787
The walls are covered in cobwebs,

442
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,499
and his unsightly handicrafts
are scattered on the floor.

443
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,002
It's become a haunted house.

444
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,630
The basement of the storage room
beside this room

445
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,507
is where he confined his victims.

446
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,301
Let's check it out.

447
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:19,223
This is the basement
where Do Min-seok confined his victims.

448
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:30,443
It feels like a deep underground prison.

449
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,780
It's suffocating the moment you enter.

450
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,825
I see a large cage.

451
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:42,997
THE LARGE CAGE WHERE
HE CONFINED HIS VICTIMS

452
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,208
I'll go inside.

453
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:56,052
Despite being a male adult,
I feel helpless in here.

454
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,684
TRACES OF VICTIMS BEING TIED

455
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:07,271
I believe this cable tie
was used to bind his victims.

456
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,525
It's already been 18 years,

457
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:14,779
but the traces of this nightmare
still remain in this place.

458
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,414
Once that bastard,
Park Gyeong-chun, gets arrested,

459
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,292
I'll uncover everything
in that filthy mind of his.

460
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,336
Tonight is our only chance.

461
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:32,797
Don't forget that.

462
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,103
Everything went well.

463
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,652
What is it? Is something wrong?

464
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,280
No.

465
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,617
Ho-jun said you did well.

466
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,744
Good job.

467
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:21,429
No. You look worried.

468
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:26,684
What is it? Tell me.

469
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,980
I'm not worried.

470
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,110
Ji-won.

471
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:40,573
Why don't you go home and rest up?

472
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,868
You look exhausted.

473
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,039
How could I do that?

474
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,875
Ji-won.

475
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,878
How could I sleep comfortably at home?

476
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,839
What's wrong?

477
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,427
What's wrong?

478
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,766
You almost died in front of me.

479
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,644
It happened just ten days ago.

480
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,689
You've been in critical condition
for the past ten days.

481
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,400
Do you know how I felt?

482
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,737
Do you?

483
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,744
My legs gave out whenever I got a call
when I was not at the hospital.

484
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,747
"Who's looking for me?"

485
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,959
"Who's reaching out to me so urgently?"

486
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:38,714
Those ten seconds before checking
the caller were so suffocating.

487
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,009
But you want me to rest up at home?

488
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,930
Every time I went back to our empty house,

489
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:50,226
do you know how terrified I was
to think I could really end up

490
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,436
alone in that house?

491
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,733
You don't know what kind of hell
I was in for the ten days.

492
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,153
You'll never know.

493
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:05,992
But…

494
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:08,911
after all this time…

495
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,999
Who are you?

496
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,918
Who are you?

497
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,718
-I'm leaving.
-Ji-won.

498
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,680
Let's talk more.

499
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,808
About what?

500
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:35,604
Just anything. Anything will do.

501
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,150
Anything.

502
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:43,154
I'll stay silent and just listen.

503
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,488
Next time.

504
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,783
I suddenly feel so exhausted.

505
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,619
I want to sleep so badly.

506
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,147
Are you awake?

507
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,529
Do you recognize me?

508
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,370
It's me. Ji-won.

509
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:39,835
Hae-su.

510
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,465
What?

511
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:58,979
Hae-su.

512
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,608
DO HAE-SU

513
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,947
You should live…

514
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,825
a normal life.

515
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,664
And don't you ever…

516
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,918
look for me.

517
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,590
I…

518
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,386
I'm never…

519
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,806
going to live…

520
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,436
as Do Hyeon-su.

521
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,388
I'm sorry about this.

522
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,766
But we can't work
with reporters sneaking around like this.

523
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,809
You know that.

524
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,147
I understand.

525
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,276
-I'll quit.
-I'm really sorry.

526
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,154
Still, thank you.

527
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,447
For what?

528
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,201
For saying that you're sorry.

529
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,497
You're not scolding me
for not being honest about my family.

530
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,082
You're not upset or yelling at me

531
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,793
for almost ruining your career.

532
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,963
Who'd think that way?

533
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,302
Shouldn't you break up with me first?

534
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,720
KIM MOO-JIN

535
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:55,971
You're right.

536
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,058
You remind me of your father,
and it's creepy.

537
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,019
Many people

538
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,730
are angry at me.

539
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,902
I'm not some brazen man
who lacks common sense.

540
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,739
I just really need to go.

541
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,784
Can I use your bathroom for a minute?

542
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:17,785
This is…

543
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:22,081
related to human rights.

544
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:24,083
I'm not lying, ma'am.

545
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:27,169
God, I'm so sorry, but I have no choice.

546
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:31,257
Please, Mr. Kim!

547
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,468
This is an invasion of privacy.

548
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,845
This is too much!

549
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,266
Then is it not too much for you to hint

550
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,726
that Do Min-seok had an accomplice
and not explain?

551
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,230
I don't know about that. I know nothing.

552
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,983
Please muster up some courage
and tell the truth.

553
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,568
Truth, my foot!

554
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,862
Tell me.

555
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:58,200
If I agree to the interview,
will you protect my daughter and me?

556
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,369
Stop bringing up your daughter.

557
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,957
Who are you? Why are you pestering her?

558
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,751
-Go back inside.
-I'm not pestering her.

559
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,963
I'm a reporter seeking the truth.
I need to use your bathroom.

560
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,424
If you don't run as fast
as you can in three seconds,

561
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,883
I will call the cops.

562
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,677
Why the cops?

563
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,304
-One.
-It won't take long.

564
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,556
-Two.
-Just one minute will do.

565
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,891
I told you to run as fast as you can.

566
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:24,643
Three.

567
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,607
Let's go in.

568
00:43:56,717 --> 00:44:01,805
FATHER

569
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,146
I'll do it.

570
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:11,690
I must.

TESTIMONY

586
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,836
We lived in the same neighborhood
for almost ten years,

587
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,005
but I've never seen him cry or laugh.

588
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:01,008
He always spent time
with his father at the workshop.

589
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:05,095
Who knows what his father taught him?

590
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:08,390
He showed absolutely no emotions
even when he heard

591
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,851
that his mother's body had been found.

592
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,227
After their father died,

593
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,980
the village head was the only one
who took care of them.

594
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,982
But then, this happened.

595
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:19,735
I had told him numerous times
not to trust that kid.

Every day between 2:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m.,

601
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,904
we dress his wounds.

602
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:14,326
And two detectives are in charge
and keep an eye on him

603
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,912
taking turns at 9:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m.

604
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,499
So the detective on the night shift

605
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:23,418
doesn't know anything about the dressing.

606
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:36,139
-I'm here to dress his wounds.
-At this hour?

607
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:40,519
As an intern, I'm forced
to work late shifts just like you.

608
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,562
God, this is so exhausting.

609
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,107
You can go out and have some coffee.

610
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,110
Actually,

611
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:51,655
I've been craving a cigarette.
I'll come back after one.

612
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:52,698
Sure.

613
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,568
I've been waiting for you.

614
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:48,378
Why have you when you had no idea
what I'd do to you?

615
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:51,840
I knew you'd come to kill me.

616
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:56,178
What are you up to this time around?

617
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,598
Where's Mi-suk?

618
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,771
Do you really not know

619
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,440
where she's buried?

620
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,741
I'm just like everyone else.

621
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,161
I only found out

622
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,164
that my father was a serial killer
through the news.

623
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,959
Is that so hard to believe?

624
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,719
I thought you'd come clean…

625
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:44,142
when you kill me.

626
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,980
Whether you believe me or not,

627
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,317
I have no plans to spare you.

628
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:57,531
Because you tried to ruin my life,

629
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,534
and you're still capable of doing that.

630
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,371
Lying in bed
and staring at the ceiling all day

631
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,997
made me realize something.

632
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,251
That everything I know about you

633
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,087
is based on the rumors.

634
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:14,756
And that…

635
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:21,179
I could be wrong.

636
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,729
I've killed an innocent person

637
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,524
and brutally tortured you.

638
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,072
You don't need to hesitate.

639
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:54,648
I believe this cable tie
was used to bind his victims.

640
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,252
I have a question.

641
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:24,094
How did it feel to find out…

642
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,764
that your wife had died?

643
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,102
What?

644
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,731
How did you feel…

645
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,401
when your wife died?

646
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,946
That's… That's…

647
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,116
That's what you're curious about?

648
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,617
Why?

649
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,788
Why are you curious about that?

650
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:56,501
You almost died in front of me.

651
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:01,506
You don't know what kind of hell
I was in for those ten days.

652
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:04,759
You'll never know.

653
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,184
I want to know.

654
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:22,527
I wanted to die.

655
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,114
Then why didn't you?

656
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,742
Because there was something I had to do.

657
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,621
I wanted her…

658
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:40,503
to rest in a safer
and more comfortable place.

659
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,048
But she was already dead.

660
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:45,967
What's the point in doing that?

661
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:54,392
Because when people talk about her…

662
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,189
they'll know where she's buried.

663
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,245
Goodbye, then.

664
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,927
Thank you so much for dressing
Park Gyeong-chun's wounds for me.

665
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,554
His hands are cuffed. Why are you afraid?

666
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:35,683
Because it somehow feels
like he's staring at me.

667
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,686
What a scaredy-cat.

668
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:44,359
Excuse me. Do you dress
Park Gyeong-chun's wounds twice a day?

669
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:47,112
-Pardon?
-I'm the detective in charge.

670
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:52,742
-We only do it once a day.
-And you've already done it today?

671
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,786
Yes. I did it.

672
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,277
You asked me last time…

673
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,492
about that fish keychain.

674
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:43,376
Someone gave it
to my sister at the funeral.

675
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,212
And she gave it to me.

676
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,465
Why didn't you tell me this sooner?

677
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,511
Would you have believed me back then?

678
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:57,515
You would've kidnapped her as well
and drowned her.

679
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,229
Who could it have been?

680
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,025
They intentionally gave it to her.

681
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:09,486
But why?

682
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,990
So you're saying that--

683
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:17,827
Someone witnessed
Jung Mi-suk getting kidnapped,

684
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:21,372
and I proved my father's alibi
for the time of the kidnapping.

685
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:25,418
What if both of us told the truth?

686
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,379
So you're saying

687
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,257
that Do Min-seok really had an accomplice?

688
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:40,558
I heard you have two months left.

689
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,979
How about you quit
barking up the wrong tree this time around

690
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,649
and chase after the real culprit?

691
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,777
It's your choice.

692
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:55,782
Hey.

693
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:58,535
Take this out.

694
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,037
I refuse to die. I refuse.

695
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,665
Spare me.

696
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:08,294
It's closed. You won't die.

697
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:21,140
Why did you close it?

698
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:26,854
You didn't tell anyone about me.

699
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:29,941
You could have.

700
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,027
Right.

701
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,655
The police were curious…

702
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,325
about why you had tortured me.

703
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:45,582
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

704
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:01,347
I've never seen him cry or laugh.

705
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:04,100
He always spent time
with his father at the workshop.

706
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:05,685
He was certainly not normal.

707
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:08,813
I had told him numerous times
not to trust that kid.

708
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:19,198
-Mommy…
-Oh, dear.

709
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:22,744
Eun-ha, don't cry.

710
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:24,329
Don't cry.

711
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:27,081
I'll give you some food.

712
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,208
Give me a minute.

713
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:36,049
Mommy…

714
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:44,015
Eun-ha, come here.

715
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:47,226
I should hold you while standing up.

716
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,021
Come on.

717
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,150
-You don't need to come out. Sleep more.
-Mommy.

718
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:16,172
At 9:00 a.m. today, Park Gyeong-chun,
the suspect in the Hoesin-dong Murder Case

719
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:17,840
was brought to the prosecution.

720
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:21,386
During the investigation,
Park admitted to murdering Nam

721
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:23,930
as well as to the kidnapping, confining,

722
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:26,849
and attempted murder of Baek.

723
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:30,728
Park claimed to have planned his crime
after harboring a grudge

724
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:34,315
against the result
of the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

725
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:39,278
He is still demanding a reinvestigation.

726
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,447
Meanwhile,
the Yeonju Serial Murder Case is…

727
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:05,388
First, we'd like to thank you
for mustering up the courage to do this.

728
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:08,766
This is all because of you.

729
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:12,603
Pardon?

730
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:16,190
I've been just fine
leaving all that behind.

731
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,777
But after meeting you,

732
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,239
her face keeps popping up in my dreams.

733
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:25,783
Whose face?

734
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,412
Ms. Jung Mi-suk's.

735
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:33,791
She gazed at me so desperately.

736
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:37,295
I guess

737
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:40,423
she wants me to talk to you.

738
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:46,512
I'll make sure
you won't regret coming here.

739
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:51,601
All right, then. Let's go back to 2002.

740
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:53,978
You witnessed

741
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,314
Jung Mi-suk,

742
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:59,650
Do Min-seok's last victim,
getting kidnapped,

743
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,028
and reported it to the police.

744
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:06,908
But later on, you recanted your testimony.

745
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:09,410
Why?

746
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:32,183
Can you tell me what this is?

747
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:34,769
Back then,

748
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:37,939
I had an answering machine at home.

749
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:40,900
This is the recording.

750
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:49,075
Dad!

751
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,284
Eun-ha.

752
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,579
Goodness.

753
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:56,499
-Did you have fun today?
-Yes.

754
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:59,252
Good girl. Let's go.

755
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:06,050
-Dad, look at that cloud.
-Yes?

756
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:08,719
It looks like an egg tart.

757
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,264
That's fascinating.

758
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:16,060
It looks like Mom's face.

759
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:19,772
No, it looks like an egg tart.

760
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,315
Is that so?

761
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:33,327
I have something
to report about Do Hyeon-su.

762
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:36,998
SUNGIL CHINESE RESTAURANT

763
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:44,881
So…

764
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,968
-this is…
-It's Do Hyeon-su's bag.

765
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:51,846
I found it while cleaning the restaurant.

766
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,307
I took a look inside.

767
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:59,645
I believe my husband kept it
because he thought

768
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,856
Do Hyeon-su would come back for it.

769
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:11,032
He's been at large for 18 years.

770
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:13,784
Do you think this could help?

771
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,415
We will catch him.

772
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:34,430
Hey, lady. You better not be nosy.

773
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,683
You are not the only one who saw me.

774
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,936
I saw you as well.

775
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:43,689
You drive a small, red car.

776
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:47,735
I know where you work and where you live.

777
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:52,823
You should be careful since you have kids.

778
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,327
Have you heard

779
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:59,288
about the Gagyeong-ri Village Head
Murder Case?

780
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:02,917
Do you know why he was killed?

781
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:06,337
Because he was nosy.

782
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:11,092
That worthless bastard
didn't know his place.

783
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:15,972
To think that
such a heinous criminal is at large

784
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:18,265
gives me goosebumps.

785
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:21,644
No one witnessed it.

786
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:23,771
Pardon?

787
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:26,023
I looked into the case record,

788
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:32,238
and no one had witnessed Do Hyeon-su
actually committing such a heinous crime.

789
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:38,035
My husband told me
that he was different from normal people.

790
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:42,498
That he was capable of anything, and
that's why my husband was afraid of him.

791
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,086
Psychopaths

792
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:51,382
aren't capable of taking care
of beings that are weaker than them.

793
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:55,344
However, Do Hyeon-su
raised a dog for around ten years

794
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:57,930
and even the puppies.

795
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:00,725
That's a fact.

796
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:03,060
He's on the run
after he murdered a person.

797
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:05,646
He's a murderer. That's true.

798
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:09,108
You're right. That's also a fact.

799
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:13,112
But I want to uncover more.

800
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:16,991
One should only suffer
as much as one deserves,

801
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:20,536
whether it be legally…

802
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:24,123
or emotionally.

803
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:29,837
That's why I must know more.

804
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:32,423
I want…

805
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,677
to give him the punishment he deserves.

806
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:40,014
If you read about the things
he's done on the Internet--

807
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:41,932
This is my principle as a detective.

808
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:44,393
I…

809
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:47,855
only believe in what I see.

810
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:28,062
Do Hyeon-su lived as Baek Hee-seong
for at least 14 years.

811
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:31,023
And Baek Hee-seong's parents
have actively cooperated.

812
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:34,735
How do you think things would've
panned out if the police considered

813
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:38,572
the possibility that Do Min-seok
and his son might be accomplices

814
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:40,282
during the kidnapping of Jung Mi-suk?

815
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,701
You must trust me.

816
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:46,080
This is all because
you broke your promise.

817
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:48,707
How am I supposed to trust you now?

818
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:52,503
I'm going to catch Do Hyeon-su.

819
01:08:54,964 --> 01:09:00,010
