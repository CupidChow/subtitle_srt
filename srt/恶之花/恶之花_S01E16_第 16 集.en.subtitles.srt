1
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,793
Bride, please smile more naturally.

2
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:44,919
Okay.

3
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:50,175
The groom is really good at this.
You could be a model.

4
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,638
Do you want to take a break?

5
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,515
Yes, it's tiring.

6
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,895
I'm sorry, but can we take ten?

7
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,063
Sure.

8
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,402
Sit down.

9
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,785
Is this really your first photoshoot?

10
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,620
Why are you so good?

11
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,915
It's all about your stamina.

12
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,256
What is it?

13
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,550
Are you worried about something?

14
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,221
Are your parents really not coming?

15
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,642
No. They won't come.

16
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,602
You only get married once.

17
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,230
I don't want you to regret--

18
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,439
Then let's do it twice.

19
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,609
We can have another wedding.

20
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,737
Are you going to gloss it over again?

21
00:01:56,699 --> 00:02:00,745
Weddings are just a formality.

22
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,123
Don't take it to heart.

23
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,459
But you're going to feel sad
if your family doesn't come.

24
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,922
You're the only family I need.

25
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:13,967
It's true.

26
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,441
Have you been well?

27
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,821
We met for the last time two weeks ago

28
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,615
at Lawyer Song's office.

29
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,913
Time flies, doesn't it?

30
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,042
It's already been four months.

31
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,854
Im Ho-jun.

32
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,245
He's alive.

33
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:30,251
Breathe. He's breathing.

34
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,545
-Stay still.
-He's breathing.

35
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,755
I'll call an ambulance.

36
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:47,143
He's still unconscious, but both
his breathing and pulse are stable.

37
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,520
How's Baek Hee-seong?

38
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,234
He's dead.

39
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,945
How badly is he injured?

40
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,530
By the looks of it,
they think the bullet grazed him.

41
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,574
It didn't penetrate his head.

42
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,495
All right. I'll go to the hospital
once I settle everything here.

43
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,581
I know it's tough right now,
but hang in there.

44
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,694
The bullet grazed his head

45
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:41,197
and ripped his scalp.
And his skull is fractured.

46
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,199
It's a linear fracture.

47
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,827
Simply put,
there's a fracture in his skull.

48
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,162
It's not fatal, right?

49
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:52,458
No. And judging by the CT scans,
this is the only injury he has.

50
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,877
We've treated him for infections.

51
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,089
Then when will he regain consciousness?

52
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:02,552
As of now, he's unconscious
due to a concussion.

53
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,306
But he should wake up in a day or so.

54
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,984
My God.

55
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,195
The reporters are gathering outside.

56
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,947
How is he?

57
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,367
As long as there's no coagulation
in his brain, he'll be okay.

58
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,161
How's Ho-jun?

59
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,165
Captain is taking care of him.
He's not himself right now.

60
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,460
He'll be questioned for the entire month.

61
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,297
He did nothing wrong
while shooting, did he?

62
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,216
Captain will take care of that.
Just worry about yourself.

63
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,345
A tsunami will come to you
as soon as he wakes up.

64
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,347
You better brace yourself.

65
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,184
That's all right.

66
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,896
There's nothing
we can't overcome together.

67
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,898
Geez.

68
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,109
Back then, I had no idea

69
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:02,945
that I'd never

70
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,823
get to see him again.

71
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,580
Say something.

72
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,208
Anything is fine.

73
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,007
Do I…

74
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,470
make you feel very uncomfortable?

75
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,114
You don't have to be.

76
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,412
I hope you don't feel too uncomfortable.

77
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,166
Hee-seong, you and I…

78
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,505
can slowly get to know each other again.

79
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:05,842
It's Do Hyeon-su.

80
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:07,885
Sorry?

81
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:12,014
You called me Hee-seong again just now.

82
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,684
I'm sorry.

83
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,232
People tell me…

84
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:25,194
that I was in a coma
for a month before I woke up.

85
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,324
But I don't feel that way.

86
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:36,414
Come here! Come and hug me!

87
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,888
I broke your heart.

88
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,974
I hurt you.

89
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:08,196
I wish you could live
as me for just one day.

90
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,449
Then you'd know how much I love you.

91
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,996
Goodness, I didn't know
my husband was this handsome.

92
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:23,419
Call Detective Im and tell him that
you're dealing with a more urgent case.

93
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,047
Forget it. Stop that.

94
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,718
Eun-ha, I'm coming to get you.
Here I come.

95
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,445
When I woke up in the hospital,

96
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,617
I thought I was hospitalized
due to a car accident.

97
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,289
I really…

98
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,377
thought it was still 2005.

99
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,629
Hey, Mom.

100
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,800
He didn't injure his brain,
and his vitals are normal as well.

101
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,553
So I don't get why he's still in a coma.

102
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,846
Okay. I'll stop by later.

103
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,439
Honey.

104
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,115
CHA JI-WON
POLICE AGENCY

105
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,660
What's wrong?

106
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,843
Honey!

107
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,941
-It's Do Hyeon-su!
-It's Do Hyeon-su!

108
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,027
-Mr. Do!
-You're Mr. Do, right?

109
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,278
-Mr. Do!
-You're Mr. Do, right?

110
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,446
Have you fully recovered?

111
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,032
You're the one who helped end
the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

112
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,618
Not only had I skipped
15 years of my life…

113
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,745
-Please say a word or two!
-When did you start…

114
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,747
…but I'd also become very famous.

115
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:10,127
In 2005, Baek Man-u and Gong Mi-ja,
Baek Hee-seong's parents,

116
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,005
put Do Hyeon-su
up to living as Baek Hee-seong.

117
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,092
Through our investigation, we've found out

118
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:20,012
that Detective Cha Ji-won
had nothing to do with this.

119
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,932
After she found out
about it in May this year,

120
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,352
she convinced Do to help the police
with the investigation.

121
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,188
Thanks to his active cooperation,

122
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,691
we were able to swiftly
carry out the investigation.

123
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,319
As a result, we have
successfully uncovered the truth

124
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,780
regarding the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

125
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:42,993
Some people say that
I'm a hero who caught a serial killer.

126
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,163
And some people say…

127
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,338
that I'm a poor guy who's taken
the blame for my sister's crime

128
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,091
and lived in hiding.

129
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,510
And some say…

130
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,098
that I'm a psychopath

131
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,477
who hid my real identity
and deceived and used a woman

132
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,731
to my advantage.

133
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,321
But…

134
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,703
the only person
who should never forgive me…

135
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,167
doesn't resent me for it at all.

136
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,336
That's because…

137
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,840
you don't know how close we were.

138
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,508
What I'm trying to say is…

139
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,806
it's already too much
for me to accept everything…

140
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,101
that's been going on.

141
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,395
So…

142
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:59,028
I'm afraid I can't give you
the words you want to hear.

143
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,661
There's nothing I want to hear from you.

144
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,088
However,

145
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,549
I do have one question.

146
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,014
Sure, ask me.

147
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,099
Why…

148
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,644
are you…

149
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,315
still wearing that?

150
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,654
Sorry?

151
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,825
Never mind.

152
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,370
I apologize.

153
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,665
I know today's an important day
for you, Hee-seong…

154
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,294
I'm sorry.

155
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,589
It's okay.

156
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,477
I came here to give you my support.

157
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,316
But I think I've made you
even more uncomfortable.

158
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,488
I don't know…

159
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,368
if I'll do a good job.

160
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,621
Just do as you've practiced.

161
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:34,957
Okay.

162
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,963
Goodbye, then.

163
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,599
SUPREME COURT OF KOREA

164
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:11,577
WITNESS WAITING ROOM

165
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,162
All rise.

166
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,084
JURY BOX

167
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,805
The first trial for Ms. Do Hae-su,
who has been indicted for the murder

168
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,600
of the Gagyeong-ri village head
18 years ago, takes place today.

169
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,519
In this jury trial,

170
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,482
the prosecution will accuse her of murder
and the defendant will claim self-defense.

171
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,817
It's expected to be a neck and neck trial.

172
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,736
Also, the defendant's brother,

173
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,489
Do Hyeon-su,
who has been in the spotlight recently,

174
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,824
will appear as a witness for the defense.

175
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,410
This has sparked
more interest among the public.

176
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,453
JUDGE BENCH

177
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,627
"I swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

178
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,379
and nothing but the truth."

179
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,756
"If I commit perjury,

180
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,716
I swear to be punished."

181
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,843
WITNESS
DO HYEON-SU

182
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,558
Mr. Do, you were the first one to arrive
at the scene after the incident occurred.

183
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,102
Is this true?

184
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,481
Yes.

185
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,239
Did you do this?

186
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,032
I came here…

187
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:38,288
to tell him not to perform
exorcisms on you anymore.

188
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,458
But he suddenly…

189
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,128
He suddenly tried to…

190
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,300
I took the scissors from her.

191
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,765
Then I wiped her fingerprints
with my clothes.

192
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,226
Mr. Do fully knew that the village head

193
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,354
Kwon Seong-bok's violence

194
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,024
was the cause of the accident.
Is that true?

195
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,693
Yes.

196
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,654
Then why didn't you ask
the judicial system for help?

197
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,701
I never thought someone else

198
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,538
could help us at that time.

199
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,293
Since our father
turned out to be a serial killer,

200
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,378
I was sure

201
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,049
that we'd never win the case.

202
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,800
Had Mr. Kwon…

203
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,597
always terrified Ms. Do?

204
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,144
On the days when
I was dragged away by him,

205
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,024
she was unable to sleep all night

206
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,862
and often vomited anything she ate.

207
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,949
That'll be all.

208
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,622
Isn't Hyeon-su doing
much better than we expected?

209
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,167
I think he has almost
completely won over the jury.

210
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,377
The prosecution
may cross-examine the witness.

211
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,340
I hope he answers their questions well.

212
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,051
God, I'm dying to know.

213
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,595
How do you think the trial will pan out?

214
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,806
Since she used a weapon,

215
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,934
I doubt the judge will acknowledge it
as self-defense.

216
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,977
Her lawyer is planning to use

217
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,022
the public's sympathy for Do Hyeon-su

218
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,358
for a unanimous verdict from the jury.

219
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,609
In other words,

220
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,281
they have no decisive card they can play
to claim that it was self-defense.

221
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:40,202
Everyone at that village
is on the same side.

222
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,872
All their statements
were practically the same.

223
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:48,961
Hold on.

224
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,838
The same side?

225
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:56,343
WITNESS STATEMENT

226
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,847
You changed your identity
to live a more comfortable life

227
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,182
and even deceived
those around you for 15 years.

228
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:07,020
On top of that, you completely
deceived your own wife, a detective.

229
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,273
Is that true?

230
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:20,826
Is that true?

231
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,834
Yes.

232
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:30,878
JURY BOX

233
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:39,261
How were you able
to deceive everyone so perfectly?

234
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:46,810
People have testified that you
cannot feel emotions like most people do.

235
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,440
Does this mean
you're not capable of feeling guilt?

236
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,114
I love you.

237
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,492
I…

238
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:04,995
love you, Ji-won.

239
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,876
Do

240
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,419
you…

241
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,129
love her?

242
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,382
No.

243
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:22,054
I've never loved her.
Not even for a moment.

244
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,388
Witness?

245
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,935
Please answer me.

246
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,520
Are you unable to feel any guilt?

247
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,105
Objection, Your Honor.

248
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,107
That'll be all.

249
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:43,158
She pretty much informed the jury
that Hyeon-su is good at lying.

250
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,536
That way, all his previous
statements will seem fake.

251
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,752
The trial is adjourned

252
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,588
until 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

253
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,799
Thank you, everyone.

254
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,720
Why did you do that?

255
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,348
You knew she'd ask you that question.

256
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,766
You even rehearsed.

257
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,561
"Back then, there was
nothing else that I could do."

258
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,856
"I am filled with remorse
for what I've done."

259
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,441
How could you forget that?

260
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,411
What is it?

261
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,330
It was because of that woman.

262
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,543
The moment I met her eyes,

263
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,921
my mind went blank.

264
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,942
JAE-SEOP

265
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,696
Hey.

266
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,698
It just ended.

267
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,911
Things aren't looking up.
We have no witness to summon.

268
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:14,291
Would it hurt to be a bit more friendly
to Detective Cha? What a jerk.

269
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,086
I don't want to get her hopes up.

270
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,547
Hopes? What hopes?

271
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:25,552
I deceived and used her
for 14 years for my own sake.

272
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,972
I think she's refusing
to acknowledge the fact

273
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,767
that I'm that kind of asshole.

274
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,061
I should keep my distance from her.

275
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,480
You genuinely loved her.

276
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,403
How do you know that?

277
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,489
I could see it.

278
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,578
You read me wrong.

279
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,081
Had I really loved her,

280
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,501
how could I have married her
as someone else?

281
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,419
Forget it. Don't think too much.

282
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:03,382
Tell me. Is she on your mind
right now or not?

283
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,888
-She makes me feel uncomfortable.
-Hey, she's here.

284
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,233
So she is on your mind.

285
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,321
What?

286
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,949
Are you going to punch me or what?

287
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,700
Let's just go.

288
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,745
Hey, it's her.

289
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,915
Do you think I'm an idiot?

290
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,418
But…

291
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,424
Quit joking around about her.

292
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,472
Just thinking about her

293
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,434
makes my heart feel stuffy.

294
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,984
Mr. Do, we need to go somewhere.

295
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,908
We've found a witness
who could perhaps turn the tables.

296
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:16,288
I was looking through
the witness statements again

297
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,331
and found someone who could be helpful.

298
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,542
It's Yang Jin-tae,
the village head's nephew.

299
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:24,796
He said that his uncle had spent
Do Min-seok's money on the exorcisms.

300
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,715
Whenever the exorcisms were performed,

301
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,800
the money that was taken
from your father's account

302
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,011
and the money paid
to the exorcist weren't the same.

303
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:35,891
The money taken from his account
was three to five times more.

304
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,644
Through the exorcisms, the village head
wanted to take your father's money.

305
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:43,231
That's why he intentionally
made you the scapegoat.

306
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:47,277
Honey, do you know Yang Jin-tae,
the village head's nephew?

307
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:48,695
Jin…

308
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:56,286
I'm sorry. I was too busy talking.

309
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,043
Yang Jin-tae?

310
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,420
Yes, the college student.

311
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:08,340
He always came by during the breaks.

312
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,800
And he agreed to be our witness?

313
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,427
He hasn't agreed yet.

314
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,679
Detective Cha and Hyeon-su
went to persuade him.

315
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,140
-Just the two of them?
-Yes.

316
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,768
How are they doing with each other?

317
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:23,104
God, Detective Cha
is pretty much Mother Teresa.

318
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,524
If I were her,
I would've grabbed him by the collar,

319
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,652
asked how he could forget me,
and hurled him down.

320
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:33,823
She's trying to seduce
Hyeon-su again with endless patience.

321
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,494
I mean, she's waiting.

322
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,789
What about Hyeon-su?
Has he been opening his heart?

323
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,751
But more importantly,
don't you think he has changed

324
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,211
since he lost his memory?

325
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:49,089
I mean, he still has
that obnoxious side to him,

326
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,552
but it feels like he's blended
with someone else.

327
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,097
Sometimes, I think

328
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:02,769
it's not that he's changed.
Maybe that's his true self.

329
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:07,107
I thought this was a horror genre, but
you looked at it in a humanistic aspect.

330
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,859
I guess blood is
indeed thicker than water.

331
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,574
Is it not uncomfortable
to live with Hyeon-su?

332
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:19,536
He pretty much thinks he owns the house.
It's such an inconvenience.

333
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,162
I guess this is one downside.

334
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:26,042
Moo-jin, you don't have
to come here this often.

335
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:29,421
Why not? I like coming here.

336
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,591
I have the most fun
when I'm chatting with you.

337
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,760
I just feel a bit embarrassed.

338
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,512
About what?

339
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:41,725
-I'm in this uniform and--
-You look good in that.

340
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,310
What?

341
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,271
What I meant was,

342
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:49,733
you look good in that pastel color.

343
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,782
I enjoy chatting with you as well.

344
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:04,497
I hope Hyeon-su,
Ji-won, Eun-ha, you, and I

345
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:08,627
can eat together under the same roof soon.

346
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,151
We agreed to meet at his house.

347
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,533
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the beep.

348
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,118
His phone is off as well.

349
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,579
Did something happen to him?

350
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,581
He's just avoiding us.

351
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,833
He gave it some thought

352
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,711
and decided not to do it.

353
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,713
I'm sure that's not the case.

354
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:57,676
When we spoke on the phone earlier,
he was willing to talk about it.

355
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,225
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can testify for you.

356
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,018
I apologize.

357
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,561
He refused…

358
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,898
to testify.

359
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,526
Let's leave, then.

360
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,444
Let's wait.

361
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,700
He's bound to come home anyway.
Let's try to convince him.

362
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,589
It's raining.

363
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,461
Do you like the rain?

364
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:18,483
Ji-won only believes what she sees.

365
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,865
So I find it very easy to deal with her.

366
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:46,386
GRANDMA, MOM, EUN-HA

367
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,098
-Eun-ha.
-Yes?

368
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:54,394
Do you hate your dad?

369
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,229
No.

370
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,565
Then why isn't he in your drawing?

371
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,192
If I draw him,

372
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,028
Mom will cry.

373
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,115
I feel sorry

374
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,367
when she cries.

375
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,703
Goodness, you sweet thing.

376
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,498
You even worry about your mom.

377
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:19,043
Gosh, you're all grown up now.

378
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,172
I hate Dad.

379
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,217
He went on a trip by himself.

380
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,429
He should've taken Mom and me with him.

381
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:44,444
It stopped raining,
so you should get going.

382
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,615
Why don't you head back without me?
I'll wait for him by myself.

383
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,160
Detective?

384
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,203
Yes?

385
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,707
I'll wait for him by myself.
You should go.

386
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,000
Why

387
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,711
are you still wearing that?

388
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:03,922
Sorry?

389
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,590
That ring.

390
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,975
I've been going to the workshop lately
to brush up on my skills.

391
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,020
And I keep making mistakes
whenever I take this off.

392
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,401
I apologize.

393
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,071
I was being thoughtless.

394
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,281
I should've given this back to you.

395
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,578
Here.

396
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,625
Don't worry about me.
I can wear another ring

397
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,461
that weighs around the same as this one.

398
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,673
Take it.

399
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,191
Yang Jin-tae?

400
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,543
Did you do something wrong to me,

401
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:25,837
Mr. Yang?

402
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,673
I'm sorry, Hyeon-su.

403
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,343
Are you

404
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,595
Mr. Yang Jin-tae?

405
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,055
Yes.

406
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,978
Please testify for us,

407
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,855
Mr. Yang.

408
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,358
VOICE RECORDING

409
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,028
Do you mind if I record this?

410
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:51,571
No.

411
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,952
What were the village head
Kwon Seong-bok's intentions?

412
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,915
My uncle was determined to take as much
of their father's money as possible

413
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:07,545
before they found a temporary guardian
for Hae-su and Hyeon-su.

414
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,885
What did you do to me that made you

415
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,679
avoid me so much?

416
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,393
He offered to pay
for my college tuition if I helped him.

417
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,729
KWON SEONG-BOK'S INTENTIONS
YANG JIN-TAE'S ROLE

418
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,189
So I spread

419
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,317
a fake rumor about you.

420
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,528
What was it?

421
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,493
I killed a chicken, cut it open,
and left it on the streets.

422
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,578
The next day, people gathered around it.

423
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,414
I told them that it was Hyeon-su

424
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:48,211
and that he was possessed
by his father's evil spirit.

425
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,213
You made everyone terrified

426
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,466
and encouraged them
to carry out exorcisms on him.

427
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:56,803
That's right.

428
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,265
Please repeat what you just said

429
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,935
in court.

430
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,942
I'll make an anonymous report, but…

431
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,569
Hyeon-su.

432
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,239
I'm really sorry.

433
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,909
I know it's the right thing to do,
but I teach elementary kids.

434
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,829
If people find out about this,

435
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,207
my life will be ruined.

436
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,627
I really don't think I can't do it.

437
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,798
FAKE RUMOR

438
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:39,470
REFUSES TO TESTIFY IN COURT

439
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,435
Mr. Yang.

440
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,106
Follow your heart

441
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,317
and decide whether to testify in court.

442
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,736
I would like you

443
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:59,532
to make a decision for yourself,

444
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,200
not for anyone else.

445
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,496
That way, you won't resent yourself.

446
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,668
Also,

447
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,089
I am going

448
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,301
to forgive you here and now.

449
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,471
So…

450
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:28,477
you can stop feeling guilty about me now.

451
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:37,904
What you said back there

452
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,823
about forgiving him…

453
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,411
I'm sure that wasn't easy to say.

454
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,916
It was hard, wasn't it?

455
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,253
No, it was easy.

456
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,130
Sorry?

457
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,343
Because I lied, of course.

458
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,387
Forgiveness?

459
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,476
I really wanted to just
snap his neck if I could.

460
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,441
I'm sorry.

461
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:20,238
He looked like
he was suffering from a lot of guilt,

462
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,449
so I thought I'd win him over
if I nudged him a little.

463
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:38,381
See?

464
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,300
YANG JIN-TAE

465
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,847
Yes, Mr. Yang.

466
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,101
Hyeon-su, I'll testify.

467
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,062
It's the right thing to do.

468
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,773
Thank you.

469
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:59,735
My lawyer will call you tomorrow.

470
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,530
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

471
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,665
We should summon him to turn
the tables at the final trial, right?

472
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,881
Detective Cha,
you should see your face right now.

473
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:25,553
I can tell what you're thinking,
and it's a bit embarrassing.

474
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:28,889
What do you think

475
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,976
I'm thinking about right now?

476
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,189
"He's not the man I knew."

477
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,484
"He's not the man I was looking for."

478
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:45,573
Am I wrong?

479
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,959
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

480
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,464
Why are you being so mean?

481
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:02,631
I am…

482
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,344
capable of lying

483
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,972
without feeling any guilt
or being emotionally stirred.

484
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,685
I don't think you realize that.

485
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,649
Do you believe

486
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,987
you can tell if I'm lying
or telling the truth?

487
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,075
Hyeon-su. Do Hyeon-su.

488
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,504
Hyeon-su, you crazy bastard.

489
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,132
When I regained
consciousness at the hospital,

490
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,843
I didn't remember anything.

491
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:52,723
So it felt like
I had woken up after 15 years.

492
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,268
But I was wrong.

493
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,357
Habits from the past 15 years
that I don't remember

494
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:07,029
are deeply engraved in my body.

495
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:13,327
I can cook dishes
I've never seen or eaten.

496
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,830
When I'm working,

497
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:19,041
I become unbelievably dexterous.

498
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,420
And…

499
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,054
I can instinctively read
other people's emotions

500
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,766
and I know how to use it to my advantage

501
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,353
very well.

502
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,900
That's why…

503
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,531
I know exactly what you want to hear…

504
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,493
from me.

505
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,539
There's nothing I want to hear from you.

506
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,502
You're wrong. There is.

507
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,339
You long to hear those words

508
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,509
from me.

509
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:17,391
"I may have lost all memories of you,

510
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,396
but my feelings still remain."

511
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,279
Lies like this.

512
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,704
I never…

513
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:44,502
I never wanted to hear that from you.

514
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,434
How could you forget me?

515
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,647
How could you?

516
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,274
How could you?

517
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,778
We loved each other so much.

518
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,280
We went through a lot together.

519
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,575
So how am I…

520
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,955
the only one you can't remember?

521
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,751
Detective Cha.

522
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,589
Sometimes, I doubt myself.

523
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:39,139
I doubt if I even have
a genuine side to me.

524
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,477
I can't trust myself.

525
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,190
Never once in my lifetime…

526
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:53,529
have I shown unfaltering
emotions towards someone.

527
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,323
So…

528
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:04,665
how long do you think these feelings
I feel for you right now will last?

529
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,547
Why do you doubt yourself so much?

530
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,013
Do you know what you're doing?

531
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,057
You keep

532
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,853
searching for that man inside of me.

533
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,650
You become hopeful
whenever you find a similarity.

534
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:35,654
You become dispirited
when you find a difference.

535
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,783
But you know what?

536
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,872
I hate him.

537
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,876
I don't want to know about him.

538
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,139
It feels like…

539
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,853
we're wearing a pair of shackles…

540
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:12,191
and running around in circles.

541
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:18,447
You're chasing me from behind.

542
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,993
And I'm running away from you

543
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,373
because I don't want to show you my face.

544
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,380
In the end,

545
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:40,594
there is no way for us
to take a step forward.

546
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,915
BEHIND THE YEONJU SERIAL MURDER CASE

547
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:12,835
A LARGE SACK WAS RUSTLING IN THE CORNER

548
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:15,212
THOSE WITH EVIL INTENTIONS TEND
TO BLEND IN WITH THE CROWD

549
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:22,428
HE'S ONLY SAYING THIS BECAUSE
DO HYEON-SU CAUGHT THE KILLER

550
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,268
I PITY DO HYEON-SU

551
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,441
Hey, are you out of your mind?

552
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,735
What did I do?

553
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:39,778
Come here.

554
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,537
Do you know how aghast I was?

555
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:51,540
They're for you.

556
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:54,293
Just looking at them makes me nauseous.

557
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,879
Why do you keep buying food you don't eat?

558
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,926
I can't help but buy them
whenever I see them.

559
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,432
That's an illness, okay?

560
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:14,354
What? Did you cry?

561
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,943
No. Why would I?

562
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,281
What's going on?

563
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,285
Did Yang Jin-tae refuse to testify?

564
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,456
No, he's going to.

565
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,459
Seriously? Then it's all working out.

566
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,254
But why the long face?

567
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,217
Ms. Cha must've finally punched you.

568
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,014
I wish she did.

569
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:56,021
Once the trial is over,
we'll have to talk about our daughter.

570
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,025
To think that I'll be seeing her again…

571
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:02,945
makes me feel suffocated.

572
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,907
Are you going to meet with Eun-ha?

573
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:09,743
No.

574
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,163
I don't want her to see me.

575
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,417
What's the point?

576
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:19,753
I can't even remember her.

577
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,756
Then what's your plan?

578
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,763
Moo-jin.

579
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:37,145
If I tell her that I want to give Eun-ha

580
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,400
all my inheritance
that hasn't been disposed of yet

581
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,069
and…

582
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,659
settle everything,

583
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,581
do you think…

584
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,710
it'll break her heart?

585
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,049
YANG JIN-TAE'S RECORDING

586
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,593
KWON SEONG-BOK'S INTENTIONS
REFUSES TO TESTIFY IN COURT

587
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,723
I killed a chicken, cut it open,
and left it on the streets.

588
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,725
The next day, people gathered around it.

589
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,477
Mr. Yang.

590
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,979
Follow your heart

591
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,274
and decide whether to testify in court.

592
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,818
I would like you

593
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:12,449
to make a decision for yourself,
not for anyone else.

594
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,662
That way, you won't resent yourself.

595
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,298
Mom.

596
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:30,842
Yes?

597
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:32,928
Did you

598
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,639
and Dad

599
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,433
get a divorce?

600
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,061
What?

601
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:42,938
When I told everyone…

602
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,401
that my name was Cha Eun-ha now…

603
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,654
they said

604
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:54,032
it meant you two got a divorce.

605
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:56,868
That's not true.

606
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:59,621
Then why isn't Dad coming home?

607
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,376
Come here.

608
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,635
I want…

609
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,891
your dad to be happy.

610
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,310
What about you?

611
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:24,980
Me too.

612
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,152
Your dad…

613
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:35,198
has never lived
as his true self in his life.

614
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,245
So…

615
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,166
I want your dad…

616
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,421
to live freely for once.

617
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,311
I heard you were of great help.

618
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:06,646
Thank you.

619
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,691
I can't even dare

620
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,569
to tell you

621
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,489
that I'm grateful or sorry.

622
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,867
Because you made a huge sacrifice for me.

623
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,661
At that time,

624
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,831
I truly wanted to protect you and Eun-ha

625
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,251
at all costs.

626
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:34,466
Thanks to the sacrifice I made,
I have come to like myself a little.

627
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,722
I know Hyeon-su is

628
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,183
giving you a lot of pain.

629
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,731
I'm going to let him go.

630
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:54,277
I've finally realized that letting him go…

631
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,906
is the best thing to do

632
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,368
for both of us.

633
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,292
Since I met you,

634
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,003
I've come to believe something.

635
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,258
That the pain we're experiencing right now

636
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:21,471
is just a step we need to go through
to accept more things later on in life.

637
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:28,311
But still, I hope you feel less pain.

638
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:36,945
The jury has made a unanimous decision.

639
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,405
I will read it out loud.

640
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,783
"Taking into consideration
the circumstances

641
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,536
and the unusual upbringing
the defendant experienced,

642
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:48,957
the defendant's behavior can be considered
acceptable according to social norms."

643
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:53,003
"Therefore,
this is our unanimous decision."

644
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:56,673
"We acknowledge
defendant Do Hae-su's actions

645
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:59,259
as an act of self-defense."

646
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:03,305
Before giving out the ruling,
I would like you to know

647
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:06,600
that the judicial department's decision
isn't limited to that of the jury.

648
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,477
I will give out the ruling.

649
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:12,939
The judicial department's decision
was different from that of the jury.

650
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,983
The judicial department didn't acknowledge

651
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:17,652
defendant Do Hae-su's actions
as self-defense.

652
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:20,238
But due to the fact that
she was a minor at that time

653
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,407
and that the incident
occurred at nighttime,

654
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,327
they decided it could be exempted
as excessive self-defense

655
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,162
and declared her innocent.

656
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,166
You're so loud.

657
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,668
I'm sorry. God, I saw that coming.

658
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,170
I told you so.

659
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,633
Why did you come?

660
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,846
It must be true that you lost your memory.

661
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,141
If you remembered me,

662
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:51,061
you would've never come here.

663
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,566
I thought you would

664
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,070
know me better than anyone.

665
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,119
Did you

666
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,873
visit him too?

667
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:30,558
Mr. Baek Man-u?

668
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,360
Hee-seong.

669
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,327
What took you so long?

670
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,580
I've been waiting for a very long time.

671
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,582
Dad.

672
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,085
Have you been waiting for me?

673
00:54:58,336 --> 00:54:59,379
Yes.

674
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,840
Every single day.

675
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:05,468
I've missed you too.

676
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:07,804
Why are you so handsome?

677
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,100
Were you always this handsome?

678
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:27,699
I kept them for you.

679
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,702
Don't share them with anyone else.

680
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,580
You don't need to worry about him.

681
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,042
He's going further into the past…

682
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,463
as a way of escaping from reality.

683
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:49,721
So?

684
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,849
What did you want to ask me?

685
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:57,562
It's about Detective Cha.

686
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,858
What…

687
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:06,905
did she mean to me?

688
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:16,748
You really hated it
every time my husband and I met her.

689
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:20,418
At first,

690
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:24,297
I thought you were just
being careful not to get caught.

691
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,591
That's what I thought.

692
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,095
But later…

693
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,807
I realized…

694
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:40,522
that you…

695
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,692
cherished her very much.

696
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,033
You should leave. I'm getting tired.

697
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:56,246
We're done.

698
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,335
You're studying abroad?

699
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:50,842
I've never lived my own life.

700
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:55,847
But must you really
go so far away to do so?

701
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:59,767
Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, and Busan.

702
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,145
We live in a big country.

703
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:05,857
As a senior in high school,

704
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:09,444
I stumbled upon Antoni Gaudí's work on TV.

705
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,655
And my heart began to thump.

706
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,327
I was reminded of that day.

707
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,122
I want to start afresh there.

708
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,124
I'm happy for you.

709
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,921
I'm glad you finally found
something you want to do.

710
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,300
I support you.

711
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:38,056
I'm not sure
how important Gaudí is to you,

712
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,475
but I'll always support you.

713
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:42,685
Thanks.

714
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,897
Don't expect me
to wait for you, because I won't.

715
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,743
Right, I forgot about an interview I had.

716
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,038
I can't believe it's already this late.

717
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:05,375
I'll get going, then.

718
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,170
Hae-su, we should
meet up before you leave.

719
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,339
Have fun.

720
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,101
Hyeon-su.

721
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:24,936
Yes?

722
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,153
Okay.

723
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:08,313
Hey, you should console me
if you came out here, you bastard.

724
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:09,939
Damn it.

725
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:20,825
Damn it.

726
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:38,051
Should I wait for her?

727
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,474
Do what you want.

728
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:49,395
I shouldn't.

729
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,607
I'm going to forget everything.

730
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,611
I'm going to forget
every little thing about her.

731
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,785
How do you lose your memory?

732
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,080
You must have some tips.

733
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:13,670
In order to do that,
you need to crack your head open.

734
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,423
So? Should I help you do that?

735
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,618
Hey, Hae-su. I didn't expect
a call from you at this hour.

736
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:47,745
What?

737
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:52,333
Right. We promised to chat today.

738
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:55,962
I've been so busy lately,
so I forgot about it.

739
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,132
Are you sad to hear that?

740
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:02,510
Really?

741
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:08,057
It's still morning there, right?
What did you have for breakfast?

742
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:12,478
Gosh, isn't that too greasy?
Should I send over some kimchi?

743
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:15,106
Oh, they sell them there?

744
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,693
I was going to send you some
if you wanted.

745
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:25,908
Hyeon-su.

746
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,287
You and I

747
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:33,541
have lost our true selves
somewhere down the line.

748
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:37,754
I'm sure we'll often
feel lost and confused.

749
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:44,844
So we need a starting point
if we don't want to get lost.

750
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,397
You won't be here anymore.

751
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:00,276
So who will give me the answers?

752
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,948
You are the only one…

753
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:10,244
who knows the answers.

754
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:09,095
I'm really unlucky.
What kind of first date is this?

755
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:14,892
Are you sure

756
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,854
you aren't the only one

757
01:04:19,438 --> 01:04:21,065
who doesn't know that you like me?

758
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:04,984
REAL ESTATE AGENCY

759
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:10,740
We've found a perfect place
that fits what you wanted.

760
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:25,546
WHERE THE RISING STAR STAYS

761
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,802
Hello, you found it.

762
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,430
This is it. Let's go inside.

763
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:43,356
What do you think?
I was really surprised too.

764
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,944
From the neighborhood
to the interior, structure, and space,

765
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:50,947
everything perfectly matches
your requirements.

766
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,491
May I take a look around by myself?

767
01:05:55,993 --> 01:06:00,373
Take your time and give me a call later.
I'll tell the landlord that you're here.

768
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:01,916
Thank you.

769
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:37,410
WHERE THE RISING STAR STAYS

770
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:53,676
SHE ABHORS MOTHS

771
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:56,762
WHY DOES SHE ABHOR THEM
WHEN SHE LOVES BUTTERFLIES?

772
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,724
WHAT IF I TOLD HER THAT
TINKER BELL WAS A MOTH?

773
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:03,519
MOVIE POSTERS ON HER SOCIAL MEDIA
LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, TITANIC

774
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:10,526
SHE LIKES THE RAIN

775
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:12,653
She likes rain.

776
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:16,615
When it rains, her pitch goes up

777
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,368
and she laughs so easily.

778
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:23,706
Does she like how the cold rain feels?

779
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:29,086
Or is it because the sound of rain
muffles other noises?

780
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,550
You shouldn't read those.

781
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,063
I was cleaning out the place.

782
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:51,067
Feel free to take whatever you need.

783
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:54,195
They were yours anyway.

784
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:59,909
Those notebooks are yours too,

785
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:03,788
but they're all about me,
so I'm afraid I can't give them to you.

786
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:15,216
WHERE THE RISING STAR STAYS

787
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:16,342
Did I

788
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:18,677
name this workshop…

789
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:21,972
myself?

790
01:08:23,557 --> 01:08:24,475
Yes.

791
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:28,729
Do you know what it means?

792
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,483
You always refused to tell me.

793
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:38,531
Now that I think of it,

794
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:41,492
it'll remain a mystery forever.

795
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:46,330
In the Greek and Roman mythology,

796
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:50,751
there's a god of blacksmiths
named Hephaestus.

797
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:55,089
He had the ugliest face in Olympus.

798
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,551
And due to his horrible temper,

799
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:02,012
everyone hated him.

800
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:04,140
So

801
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:07,309
he always spent time in his workshop.

802
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:12,356
Even he

803
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:15,901
had a wife he loved very much.

804
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:21,740
In English, her name was Venus.

805
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,451
It's the morning star.

806
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:31,667
And the "rising star" is its nickname.

807
01:09:59,028 --> 01:09:59,987
I…

808
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:04,033
always thought about you

809
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:08,537
in this space where I spent
most of my time.

810
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:16,587
I requested to be transferred
to the TF team in Busan.

811
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:22,843
They're in need of more workers,
so it'll be decided soon.

812
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:24,428
So…

813
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:28,933
are you telling me…

814
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:32,186
that you'll be leaving?

815
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:40,277
I want to start over

816
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,905
in a new place.

817
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:49,620
I don't want
to run into you, even by chance.

818
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:09,473
How could you?

819
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:16,063
I've finally managed

820
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:19,149
to take one step towards you.

821
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:25,364
So how could you run away?

822
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,367
I got my hopes up and was dispirited.

823
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,288
And then, it happened again.

824
01:11:34,164 --> 01:11:35,833
I just can't do this anymore.

825
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:40,379
Could you please…

826
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:43,966
change your mind?

827
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:02,776
I will be really good to you.

828
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:06,905
I'll genuinely love you.

829
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:14,288
I'll love you even more from now on.

830
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:17,041
I will be really good to you.

831
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,589
Let's find that man…

832
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:27,134
you've been searching for.

833
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:29,762
I've become…

834
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,557
curious about him as well.

835
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:37,853
I want to know him.

836
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:48,614
What happened

837
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:50,949
to your hand?

838
01:12:53,994 --> 01:12:55,329
I keep getting injured

839
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:57,831
whenever I take off the ring.

840
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:03,754
I'm still not used to it.

841
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,919
Whenever I'm in front of you…

842
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:48,132
I can't help but tense up.

843
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,013
I'm also scared

844
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:57,933
that I'll make a mistake.

845
01:14:02,729 --> 01:14:03,814
I feel the same way.

846
01:15:21,558 --> 01:15:23,435
I'm going to pick up Eun-ha.

847
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:25,604
Would you like to come with me?

848
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:28,273
Do you think

849
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:30,442
she'll like me?

850
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:35,739
Why are you laughing?

851
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,492
Why are you laughing?

852
01:15:40,744 --> 01:15:43,497
Because you are.

853
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:07,896
Dad!

854
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:16,280
Dad.

855
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:32,421
Dad, I really missed you.

856
01:16:40,887 --> 01:16:43,640
Dad, did you bring me any gifts?

857
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:45,767
What?

858
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:52,399
I'm sorry. I forgot.

859
01:16:53,233 --> 01:16:57,029
It's okay. You are my gift.

860
01:16:57,738 --> 01:17:01,074
You're my favorite person
in this entire world.

861
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:06,997
Me…

862
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:10,667
Me too.

863
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:01,570
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING FLOWER OF EVIL

864
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:06,283
