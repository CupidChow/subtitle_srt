1
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:34,075
LATE SUMMER OF 1997

2
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,287
BAEK HEE-SEONG

3
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,313
I don't remember.

4
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,400
When I got my report card,

5
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,403
I just wanted to die.

6
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,406
I don't remember…

7
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,452
what happened afterward.

8
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,041
Did a dog

9
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,377
die because of me?

10
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,382
I feel horrible.

11
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:35,804
Hee-seong, can you wait in the lobby?

12
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:39,641
I need to talk to your mom. Okay?

13
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,071
It's

14
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,740
all my fault.

15
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,285
He isn't usually like that.

16
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,874
He acts strange every time
he receives his report card.

17
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,022
Hyeon-su.

18
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,192
Do Hyeon-su.

19
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,820
Do you want to draw with me?

20
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,488
Here.

21
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,754
It's you, isn't it?

22
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:57,468
The kid who dropped a brick
from the rooftop.

23
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,266
Do you know why you did such a thing?

24
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,686
Yes.

25
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,940
It's adolescent depression
due to academic stress.

26
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,782
You were just curious, weren't you?

27
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,330
Just like throwing a stone
into a calm pond,

28
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,750
you threw a stone into your quiet life.

29
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,003
You were curious

30
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,381
how the world would ripple around you.

31
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,011
Isn't that it?

32
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,265
Why would I do that?

33
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,812
Because you don't know how to have fun.

34
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,571
Because you've never met anyone like you.

35
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,288
You must've been

36
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,333
very lonely all this time.

37
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,326
It's Do Hyeon-su.

38
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,288
Do Hyeon-su is here.

39
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,054
What brings you here?
You didn't even call.

40
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,141
I have something to tell you and Mr. Baek.

41
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,316
I'm feeling so tired right now.
Why don't you come some other day?

42
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,818
I know everything.

43
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,573
Know everything? What do you mean?

44
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,034
Everything that's happened in this house.

45
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,328
What?

46
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:32,040
Do you really want us
to go back like this?

47
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,670
What are you waiting for?

48
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,339
Have a seat.

49
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,480
You canceled our dinner appointment
for your business trip.

50
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,775
What brings you here without calling?

51
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,195
And you even brought your wife.

52
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,866
You had plans for dinner with me
tonight anyway,

53
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,160
so I thought you'd be home.

54
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,996
So what…

55
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,542
and how much do you know?

56
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,627
Then what

57
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,130
and how much are you hiding?

58
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,634
So are you saying…

59
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,847
you know everything?

60
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,182
About your husband.

61
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,896
You came here after finding out the whole
thing. What's that supposed to mean?

62
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,316
Does that mean you accept everything?

63
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,030
First,

64
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,993
I'd like you to know that I'm going
to stand by his side no matter what.

65
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,956
Fine.

66
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,210
I guess the four of us will

67
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,755
have a lot to talk about tonight.

68
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,718
It's not just four of us.

69
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,597
What?

70
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,976
There's one more person in this house.

71
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,939
Where is he now?

72
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,310
2001 ILSIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
3RD OVERSEAS MEDICAL VOLUNTEERING IN KENYA

73
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,741
He wasn't

74
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,537
on good terms with us.

75
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,288
That day,

76
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,543
we started a quarrel
because of the car accident.

77
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,967
And there was an unexpected accident.

78
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,471
We're already past the stage
where his consciousness matters.

79
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,269
Every time he fell
into critical condition,

80
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,231
we drugged him just to keep him alive.

81
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,650
So his kidneys are failing.

82
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,697
And now he's currently suffering
from multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

83
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,866
That means

84
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,787
it's not surprising even if
his heart stops in ten minutes.

85
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,458
We just shared

86
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,087
all our secrets with you.

87
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,507
I promise you right here.

88
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,427
I'll let your husband

89
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,638
live as Baek Hee-seong
for the rest of his life.

90
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,765
So

91
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,269
you don't need to worry about it anymore.

92
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,606
No.

93
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,317
You're mistaken.

94
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,193
Mistaken?

95
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:15,323
Ji-won just wanted to check the truth

96
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,700
with her own eyes. That's all.

97
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,745
We're not here

98
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,373
to exact a promise from you.

99
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,043
It's time.

100
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:29,879
Time for what?

101
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,799
To reveal the identity…

102
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,053
of the accomplice.

103
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,871
Hide over there.

104
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,367
Now tell me.

105
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,912
Like you asked,

106
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,790
we all are sitting here.

107
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,211
Is it that

108
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,173
you think I know

109
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,885
who the accomplice is?

110
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,639
It's ten now.

111
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,226
If I left as planned,

112
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,938
I would've arrived at the vacation home
in Gapyeong by now.

113
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:15,985
And?

114
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,406
The only people
who know about that are Ji-won, me,

115
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,701
and you, Mr. Baek.

116
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,789
What are you trying to say?

117
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,502
You know what I'm saying.

118
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,548
This is your chance.

119
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,718
You must succeed.

120
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,931
At 10:00 p.m. today.

121
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,394
-351 Gyeongjinsan-gil…
-If Yeom Sang-cheol shows up there,

122
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,772
it means you are

123
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,567
the one who gave him the information.

124
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,945
Just so you know, the police are

125
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,615
staking out the vacation home right now.

126
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,816
Yeom Sang-cheol!

127
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,112
Drop your weapons
and put your hands above your head.

128
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,250
The day I made a deal
with Yeom Sang-cheol,

129
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,627
someone called and offered him

130
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,172
twice the money I gave him
in return for getting rid of me.

131
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:05,636
The only person who knew that I was
making a deal with him that night,

132
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:10,182
and the exact amount of money
I paid Yeom Sang-cheol,

133
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,142
is you, who gave me

134
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,436
the money.

135
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:20,693
You wanted me to kill Park Gyeong-chun

136
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,779
and leave on my own.

137
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,366
You were afraid

138
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,912
your true identity
might be revealed, not mine.

139
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,207
Because

140
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,377
you are

141
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,006
the accomplice
in the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

142
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,759
What are you talking about?

143
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,220
Sit down.

144
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,056
If you use violence
against him in any way,

145
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,976
I will perform my duties
as a police officer.

146
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,060
You.

147
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,815
Are you here
with the same idea as his in mind?

148
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,944
As soon as we find evidence that
you're associated with Yeom Sang-cheol,

149
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,280
-I'll ask you to come with me.
-What…

150
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,875
DETECTIVE CHOI JAE-SEOP

151
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,597
Yes, Detective Choi.

152
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,391
I think you made a wrong guess.

153
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,353
I'm the janitor of this building.

154
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,064
Director Baek's son is coming tonight,

155
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,067
so Director Baek asked me
to make him comfortable.

156
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,693
And I brought the shears

157
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,821
to trim some branches while I was here.

158
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,745
I see.

159
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,539
Okay.

160
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,883
I can't believe

161
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,428
what's happening here now.

162
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:18,352
How could you suspect me
as a serial killer?

163
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,401
What did Detective Choi say?

164
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,655
That Director Baek sent a janitor there

165
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,449
to take care of me for the night.

166
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,965
I guess I underestimated you.

167
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,513
It's not me.

168
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,396
Hyeon-su, it's not me.

169
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,941
There's no possible suspect

170
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,527
other than you.

171
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,072
What should I do to prove
that I'm not the accomplice?

172
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,118
Ji-won.

173
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,540
You're a cop,
but how could you do this to me?

174
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,209
With no hard evidence,

175
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:28,297
you can't threaten someone like this
using your position as a cop.

176
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:35,179
You've already concluded
that I'm the culprit.

177
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,766
And now you're trying
to make sure it looks that way.

178
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,437
No.

179
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,482
All the things happening now

180
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,651
say that you're the culprit.

181
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,321
I'm sure of it.

182
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,407
It's me.

183
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,836
The person you're looking for is me.

184
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,270
From now on…

185
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,941
you'll be playing

186
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,694
into my hands…

187
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,199
Do Hyeon-su.

188
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:46,250
I'm the one who leaked our secret.

189
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:51,213
What do you mean? You leaked our secret?

190
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,789
It rained earlier today,
so I guess the circuit breaker's tripped.

191
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,209
I'll go check.

192
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,106
This is your chance.

193
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,943
At 10:00 p.m. today, my vacation home.

194
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,407
It's me, Baek Hee-seong.

195
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,702
Cut the greetings.

196
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,496
Just answer my questions honestly.

197
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,582
Did you or did you not

198
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,585
leak our information

199
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,004
to Do Hyeon-su?

200
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,173
You think I'm insane? Why would I…

201
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,802
Wait.

202
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,388
Did you?

203
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,601
I didn't say it straight out.

204
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,438
I just said that someone
put out a contract on him.

205
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:34,858
Mr. Yeom.

206
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:40,614
You don't need to do anything from now on.

207
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,659
Stay out of this.

208
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,203
What did you just say?

209
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,330
I don't need you anymore.

210
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,876
What are you doing?

211
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,298
Do Hyeon-su set a trap.

212
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,842
He wants to kill two birds with one stone.

213
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,388
-A trap?
-Think about it.

214
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,141
Who created the perfect opportunity

215
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,685
to kill Do Hyeon-su?

216
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,729
And who is playing

217
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,940
into whose hands now?

218
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,942
Isn't that obvious?

219
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,031
The moment Yeom Sang-cheol
shows up at the vacation home,

220
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,450
they'll confirm you're involved.

221
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,370
They want to make sure of that.

222
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:34,167
Then we can just tell Yeom Sang-cheol
not to go to the vacation home.

223
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,670
Everything will be fine then, right?

224
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:42,092
I don't think that will stop
Do Hyeon-su from suspecting me.

225
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:45,929
Hang on.

226
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,225
It means they don't have any evidence yet.

227
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,774
We should get ready to greet our guests.

228
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,902
What are you talking about?

229
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,073
Since they have no evidence,
they'll try to corner Dad

230
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,491
and get his confession.

231
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,620
If this is the game
Do Hyeon-su is playing,

232
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,789
we should

233
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,417
get him a gift too.

234
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,276
I'D LIKE TO QUIT. WIRE MY SEVERANCE PAY
AND THE NDA FEE.

235
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:49,242
You said the caregiver is Deaf,
so she can't talk.

236
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,995
But the culprit spoke
to Yeom Sang-cheol on the phone.

237
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,623
It's far-fetched to say

238
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,751
that she was associated
with Do Min-seok or Yeom Sang-cheol.

239
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,088
What I'm trying to say

240
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,965
is that the secret was already out.

241
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,386
There might be someone else
who made a mistake as I did.

242
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,138
Like the reporter.

243
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,600
He knows your secret too.

244
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,685
-And your sister.
-Mother.

245
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,942
You're trying to cover up
for your husband now.

246
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,194
Am I wrong?

247
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:27,531
I'm not. I swear that's not true.

248
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,449
Yes, you are.

249
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,494
You know something.

250
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,415
What is it?

251
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,253
Do you not trust me?

252
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,802
Why should I trust you?

253
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,519
Right.

254
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:01,398
You have no reason to trust me.

255
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,403
I'll trip the circuit breaker.

256
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:11,700
Once the power goes out, tell them
you'll go check the circuit breaker

257
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,035
and buy some time, Dad.

258
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,540
In the meantime, you will
take out some candles, Mom.

259
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,839
I guess it will take a while.

260
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,508
I should light some candles.

261
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,604
Something's strange.

262
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:43,732
What do you mean?

263
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,069
Something doesn't feel right,

264
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,156
but I don't know what it is.

265
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,543
Are you all right?

266
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,463
I'm fine.

267
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:19,809
Hyeon-su.

268
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:26,525
I've always been thinking of you
as my family.

269
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,319
I mean it.

270
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,918
Regardless of how you've thought of me,

271
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,546
I've never wondered…

272
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:53,385
how you really feel about me.
Not even once.

273
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,797
Aren't you going to go check on your son?

274
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,341
What? Why?

275
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,969
All the medical devices need electricity.

276
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,598
I guess he's in danger now.

277
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,102
Well, the thing is…

278
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,021
We have batteries, so he's fine.

279
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,108
And they easily last for six hours.

280
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,362
What are you doing? Let's have a seat.

281
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,906
We should continue our conversation.

282
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,526
I'm sorry

283
00:28:56,609 --> 00:29:00,155
that I've been feeling the same way
ever since I first saw you

284
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,865
in fourth grade.

285
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:09,330
I can't believe he's kept this
all these years like a fool.

286
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,410
I think it'd be better for you
to stay out of this now.

287
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,082
I don't want you to make more enemies.

288
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,086
Whether Director Baek Man-u
is the accomplice or not,

289
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:41,297
he'll hold grudges against you
because of what happened today.

290
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,800
Let the police take care of it.

291
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,430
I need to meet the caregiver.

292
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,392
Did you not hear what I just said?

293
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,061
Mother is right about that.

294
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,398
How much the caregiver knows

295
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,608
and who else knows the secret.

296
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,443
I must find it out.

297
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:06,114
Having yourself directly involved
in this isn't a good idea.

298
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,075
I want to get away

299
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,245
from this situation as soon as possible.

300
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,586
He's a serial killer
who enjoys killing people.

301
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,380
Someone like that

302
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,049
is still around me.

303
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,761
I'm afraid

304
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,431
he might

305
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,517
harm you and Eun-ha.

306
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:37,937
Just the thought of it…

307
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,067
scares me to death.

308
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:02,128
Do you know the detection rate
of our station for murder this year?

309
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,591
It's 120 percent.

310
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,597
We even caught the criminals
we missed last year.

311
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,852
We catch every single criminal
who committed murder.

312
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,024
Once we catch Yeom Sang-cheol,
everything will work out.

313
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,861
Yeom Sang-cheol himself
is our witness and evidence.

314
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,241
Serial killers are human beings like us.

315
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,370
Don't be afraid.

316
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,247
Once we catch him,

317
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,376
you'll see what a pathetic loser he is.

318
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,630
We are stronger than him, okay?

319
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,849
It's weird.

320
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:02,397
Whatever you say, it sounds convincing.

321
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,782
MOTHER

322
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:13,825
It's Eun-ha.

323
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,454
When are you coming?

324
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,665
We will be there soon.

325
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:21,791
Should I count to ten?

326
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,753
Just wait ten minutes.

327
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,173
Then you can't say you're coming soon.

328
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,092
You're still far away.

329
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,095
No, we're not. We're almost there.

330
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,973
Just hurry and come faster.

331
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,988
GREEN HEART ASYLUM

332
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,531
"Stay out of this?"

333
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,534
You must've trifled with me.

334
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:04,292
GREEN HEART ASYLUM

335
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,209
You can discharge her tonight, can't you?

336
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,880
She has no family, so it won't be hard.

337
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,509
You little…

338
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,804
What about all the money
you've gotten from me?

339
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,681
That's for keeping an eye on her.

340
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,683
Damn it.

341
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,192
This is a luxury watch.

342
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,321
So who on earth is she?

343
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,532
She's my insurance.

344
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,252
It's been a while,

345
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,921
Ms. Jung Mi-suk.

346
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,764
Where is Jung Mi-suk?

347
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,475
Thanks to her husband
who reported her missing,

348
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,271
we could trace her whereabouts up until
May 11, 2002, the day she went missing.

349
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:51,190
The body of the last victim,
Jung Mi-suk, was never found.

350
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,276
JUNG MI-SUK, 27 YEARS OLD
MISSING: MAY 12, 2002

351
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,072
Why is my name

352
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,367
Jung Mi-suk?

353
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,117
Hello?

354
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,870
Is this Mr. Baek Hee-seong speaking?

355
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,124
Yes. Who is this?

356
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,462
And your wife is Cha Ji-won.

357
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,715
She's a detective
from Gangsu Police Station.

358
00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,675
Is that right?

359
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:01,928
Your daughter is

360
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,472
Baek Eun-ha.

361
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,933
She goes to Tiny Bird Kindergarten.

362
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,393
Correct?

363
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,856
Who are you?

364
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,275
I'm a fan.

365
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,528
I really love

366
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,948
your artwork.

367
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,035
How… My family…

368
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,043
How did you find out about my family?

369
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,505
A fan should know that much.

370
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,467
You sound quite sensitive.

371
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,424
PAYPHONE AT MAKMUN THREE-WAY INTERSECTION

372
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,468
PAYPHONE AT MAKMUN THREE-WAY INTERSECTION

373
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,184
I'm sorry for calling you
at this late hour.

374
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:17,605
I'd like to check
the dashcam footage from your car.

375
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,482
I'm on vacation right now.

376
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:22,568
I'll call you back
once I go back to Seoul.

377
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,840
Hide-and-seek.

378
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,260
I can see you,

379
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,347
but you can't see me.

380
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,086
What's that?

381
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,221
Is this Mr. Baek Hee-seong speaking?

382
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,725
Have you heard about the Gagyeong-ri
Village Head Murder Case?

383
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,395
And your wife is Cha Ji-won.

384
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,106
She's a detective
from Gangsu Police Station.

385
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,108
Is that right?

386
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,194
Do you know why he was killed?

387
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,947
Because he was nosy.

388
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,033
Honey.

389
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,495
Yes?

390
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,581
What are you doing?
You're spilling it all over.

391
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:02,626
I'm sorry.

392
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,962
What were you thinking so hard about?

393
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,424
Don't come close.
It might get on your clothes.

394
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:13,053
Dad! I want to wear this today.

395
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,306
Okay. One moment, Eun-ha.

396
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,436
Let me see.

397
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,230
-Do you want to wear this?
-Yes.

398
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,901
-Where do you want it?
-Over here.

399
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,614
You look pretty.

400
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,242
Dad. Where did you go last night?

401
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,036
What?

402
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,830
When I woke up and went to the bathroom,

403
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:43,125
I saw you heading out.

404
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,253
Did you go somewhere last night?

405
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,547
Where?

406
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,759
Well, it's…

407
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,721
Your phone is ringing. Answer it first.

408
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,306
Okay.

409
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,935
Yes, Captain.

410
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,521
What?

411
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,818
-I need to go.
-Okay.

412
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,153
Have a good day, Mom.

413
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,907
But that's not our jurisdiction.

414
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,077
Okay. I'll be right there.

415
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,333
Eun-ha, look at me.

416
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,964
Have you ever talked
to a stranger recently?

417
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,507
No.

418
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,009
But you didn't think.

419
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:38,681
No.

420
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,935
What did I tell you
about not going with a stranger?

421
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,105
I should never go with a stranger.

422
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:49,567
Grown-ups never ask kids for help.

423
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,487
Dad, Mom, and Grandma
never ask someone else

424
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,615
to pick me up for them.

425
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,495
That's my girl.

426
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,457
Dad, my stomach just rumbled again.
Did you hear that?

427
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,750
What?

428
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,794
Let me hear that.

429
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:15,175
-Do you want egg soup?
-Sure.

430
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,885
-I was picking up litter.
-I see.

431
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:19,179
I saw a scarf, so I tried to pick it up.

432
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:22,266
But it wasn't coming off. So…

433
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,642
And you found a body in there.

434
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,769
-Yes.
-Okay. Thank you.

435
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:26,979
-You're here.
-Jae-seop.

436
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,399
I'm sorry about last night.

437
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,570
Let's talk about it later. Let's go.

438
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,740
-Did you hear about the body?
-Yes.

439
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,578
I'm Woo Hwan-su, the director
of Case in All Aspects.

440
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,372
I'm a big fan of your show.

441
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,791
-All right. Please have a seat.
-Sure.

442
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,795
Let me cut to the chase.

443
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,214
I'd like you to be our panelist.

444
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,509
Why me?

445
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,095
That's because
of the live streaming you did.

446
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,973
Mr. Kim, you were really cool.

447
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:05,976
You think so?

448
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,853
And the exclusive
about the accomplice's voice.

449
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,855
You even reported
the human trafficking case.

450
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:14,151
How can you always be
one step ahead of the police?

451
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:19,239
I've been working hard, so I've been
lucky to meet many good informants.

452
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:23,243
A fortune-teller told me
that I'm blessed with good people.

453
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,624
A body's been found
in the woods in Makmun-dong.

454
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,502
I guess you should go there, Mr. Kim.

455
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,337
Me?

456
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,797
Why does Moo-jin have to go?

457
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,549
The victim doesn't
have the left thumbnail.

458
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,724
Her left thumbnail is missing.

459
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,768
How do we interpret this?

460
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:52,106
If he did this right after Yeom Sang-cheol
fled, it means he wants to provoke us.

461
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:56,568
One thing I can say for sure is that
it creates confusion in our investigation.

462
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,155
-Have you identified the victim?
-Not yet.

463
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:03,409
No bag, purse, or phone
have been found around here.

464
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,577
She must've been brought here
after she was killed.

465
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:10,791
What's that thing?

466
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:20,759
What do you mean?
It might not be Baek Man-u?

467
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,596
While you were meeting
with Baek Man-u last night,

468
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:29,059
someone was watching me secretly.

469
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,991
Did you call the police?

470
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:48,495
I did, but nothing happened yet,
so there's nothing they can do.

471
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,417
Actually,

472
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,587
I got a strange phone call last night.

473
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,630
A strange phone call?

474
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,591
Yes.

475
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:05,596
I'm sure it wasn't Baek Man-u.

476
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,055
But…

477
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,517
the caller's voice

478
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:14,313
reminds me of the accomplice's voice
that Moo-jin revealed.

479
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,236
Have you heard?

480
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:23,447
Heard what?

481
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,366
The body that found in the woods
this morning…

482
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,914
The left thumbnail is missing.

483
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:57,773
I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYONE.
THERE'S NO ONE TO TELL ANYWAY.

484
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,316
YOU CAN'T TREAT ME LIKE THIS

485
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:00,776
DON'T TOUCH ME EVER AGAIN

486
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,488
IF YOU DO THIS AGAIN,
I'LL TELL THE MADAM AND DIRECTOR

487
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:07,407
These are all the messages
found in the notepad.

488
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,286
It seems like the victim's last
conversation with the criminal.

489
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,788
Are you sure it's the victim's?

490
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,749
Only the victim's fingerprints
were found on it.

491
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:19,711
If it's a conversation between the culprit
and the victim who can't speak,

492
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,839
it means they knew each other.

493
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,131
NOTEPAD FOUND

494
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,802
What do you think
"the madam and director" mean?

495
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,515
Yes, sir.

496
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,727
Okay. Hang on. The body's been identified.

497
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,357
Makmun 2-dong, Makmun-gu, Seoul.

498
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,569
Unit 303, Rose Villa. Park Sun-yeong.

499
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:47,447
What? Okay.

500
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:52,119
They found fingerprints
on the tape around the victim.

501
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,746
On the tape used in the crime?

502
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:58,083
-Then we can be 99.9 percent sure.
-I know.

503
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,295
Did they carry out
fingerprint identification yet?

504
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,713
AFIS is working on it now.

505
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:05,841
As soon as the results are in,
they will identify the culprit.

506
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:09,261
Detective Cha and Detective Im,
you should wait for the results there.

507
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,096
Get moving as soon as the results are in.

508
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,432
Detective Choi,
go to Park Sun-yeong's house.

509
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,558
Yes, sir.

510
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,356
IF YOU DO THIS AGAIN,
I'LL TELL THE MADAM AND DIRECTOR

511
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:27,154
A DEAD BODY FOUND IN MAKMUN-DONG

512
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,868
A DEAD BODY WAS FOUND
IN THE WOODS IN MAKMUN-DONG

513
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,583
Mr. Baek.

514
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:46,715
This is the list of the volunteers
you asked for. From 1999 to 2002.

515
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,009
Okay. Thank you.

516
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:59,144
An unregistered fingerprint?

517
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,980
Yes. This isn't even a partial print.

518
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:04,816
It's a clear print
with all the distinctive features,

519
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,944
but the system can't detect it,
which means

520
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:08,904
it isn't in the database.

521
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:13,617
So are you saying the culprit
doesn't have an ID card?

522
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,745
Yes. It's either a minor
under the age of 17

523
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:22,459
or someone with no resident
registration number and no fixed abode.

524
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:27,673
I guess that's why the killer
didn't try to get rid of his fingerprints.

525
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:32,052
I knew it. I thought things
were going too smoothly.

526
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:41,979
Jae-seop.

527
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:45,607
Do you really not know
anything about Park Sun-yeong?

528
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:47,734
Why?

529
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,029
Park Sun-yeong worked as a housekeeper.

530
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,074
Aren't you going to ask where she worked?

531
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,205
By any chance,

532
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:01,999
was it…

533
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:06,128
Yes. Ilsin University Hospital's
Director Baek Man-u's house.

534
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:07,754
Your in-laws' house.

535
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:15,846
Dad. Where did you go last night?

536
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,349
I need to meet the caregiver.

537
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:27,816
I'll call you back later.

538
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,111
Ho-jun, give me the car key.

539
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,612
What? Why?

540
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,115
There's something
I need to check urgently.

541
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,928
The one who called you last night
is Do Min-seok's accomplice?

542
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,306
Are you sure?

543
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,975
I'm pretty sure.

544
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,187
But why did he call you?

545
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:09,399
He gave me Jung Mi-suk's fish keychain.

546
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,445
I sense that he's obsessed with me.

547
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:18,825
But why do you think he's back

548
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:20,827
after 18 years?

549
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:24,122
Serial killers can't stop killing
by themselves.

550
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:29,419
Maybe something happened, and
he couldn't commit murder for 18 years.

551
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,088
For example,

552
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:34,716
he might have been in prison.
Like the culprit of the Hwaseong case.

553
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:40,806
You should look into it.

554
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:45,769
Those who were sent to prison in 2002
and have been recently released.

555
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,145
Okay.

556
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:50,732
And Hae-su,

557
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,360
stay with Moo-jin for the time being

558
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,196
until we can be sure you're safe.

559
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,370
Since you saw the culprit's face,

560
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:05,747
you might be his next target.

561
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:11,878
Moo-jin,

562
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,005
promise me.

563
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,968
That you will never leave her alone.

564
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:22,430
Okay. I promise.

565
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:30,939
I'm going to meet Yeom Sang-cheol.

566
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:33,984
What?

567
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:38,488
I will use him to get to the accomplice.

568
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,419
Come on.

569
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:10,437
Come on in and have a seat.

570
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:27,746
Can I really meet my family here?

571
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:31,958
Do you really remember nothing?

572
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:35,462
Absolutely nothing?

573
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,048
I just…

574
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:44,429
remember walking endlessly.

575
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,312
I didn't even know why I was walking.

576
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,941
I just kept walking.

577
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,112
After that,

578
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:06,618
I was sent from place to place
and ended up in the asylum.

579
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:12,415
Damn. Your life's been tough, hasn't it?

580
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:17,045
Thank you

581
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:20,548
for finding my family.

582
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,133
Don't thank me.

583
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:24,594
I'm doing this for money.

584
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,056
Jung Mi-suk, you are

585
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:31,142
very important…

586
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,689
to all of us.

587
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,640
FINGERPRINT LIFTING CARD

588
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,120
MOM

589
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,211
Mom, it's me.

590
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:27,842
Hee-seong can't pick up
Eun-ha from kindergarten today.

591
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,264
Please pick her up for us.

592
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,241
The body was found.

593
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:57,122
The police will call us soon.

594
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,000
You'll do a good job,

595
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:03,878
just like you have, Mom.

596
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:48,298
Mom, you're never weak.

597
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,342
You

598
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,012
gave birth to me,

599
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,556
killed me…

600
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,393
and brought me back to life.

601
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,690
To me, you're

602
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,109
like a god.

603
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:46,439
No.

604
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,484
Why would you meet Yeom Sang-cheol?

605
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:50,985
He wants to kill you.

606
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,320
I know.

607
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,031
So he won't ignore my call.

608
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,909
He has to kill me to get paid.

609
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,245
Don't you think it's too dangerous?

610
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:03,206
Once I lure him out,

611
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,917
I can get help from the police.

612
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,130
Yeom Sang-cheol?

613
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:55,633
I'm…

614
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,803
Jung Mi-suk.

615
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,183
Are you my family?

616
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,895
What? Who is this again?

617
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,648
Jung Mi-suk?

618
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:12,400
Yes.

619
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,946
Mr. Yeom went to the restroom.

620
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,699
Where are you now?

621
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:28,082
I see a lot of trees.

622
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:34,839
Hello…

623
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,811
The phone is turned off.
You will be directed to voicemail.

624
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:59,906
WHERE THE RISING STAR STAYS

625
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:05,411
Hey.

626
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,544
Where did you go last night?

627
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:15,880
What?

628
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,509
Did you go to Makmun-dong?

629
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:25,848
How

630
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,351
did you know that?

631
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,860
A dead body was found in the woods
in Makmun-dong this morning.

632
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,863
The victim is Park Sun-yeong.

633
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:44,909
She was Deaf,
and she worked as a housekeeper.

634
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:48,329
She took care of a patient in a coma.

635
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,627
The person Park Sun-yeong worked for…

636
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,215
was Director Baek Man-u.

637
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:06,389
On the tape that was used
to tie up Park Sun-yeong…

638
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,603
we found the culprit's fingerprints.

639
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,067
And the fingerprints…

640
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:25,700
turned out to be yours.

641
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:37,962
What time did Park Sun-yeong
leave last night?

642
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:43,801
At around 7:30.

643
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:49,474
She said she wasn't feeling well,
so I called a cab for her.

644
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,826
The CCTV camera in the alley

645
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:12,413
must catch Park Sun-yeong
leaving our house.

646
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:15,792
Take a cab in front of our house

647
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,753
and get out in front of her place.

648
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:21,214
Easy, right?

649
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:27,678
I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYONE.
THERE'S NO ONE TO TELL ANYWAY.

650
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,681
This is the last conversation
Park Sun-yeong had.

651
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:33,100
We believe she was talking to the culprit.

652
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:43,903
I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYONE.
THERE'S NO ONE TO TELL ANYWAY.

653
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,909
IF YOU DO THIS AGAIN,
I'LL TELL THE MADAM AND DIRECTOR

654
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:52,787
It says "the madam and director."

655
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:55,456
The madam refers to you, doesn't it?

656
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,001
Yes.

657
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,671
It looks like you and the culprit
know each other.

658
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,465
Do you have any idea who it is?

659
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,685
Ms. Gong?

660
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:22,817
Yes.

661
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:25,736
I do.

662
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:28,698
There's only one person.

663
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:32,910
Ho-jun, are you with Ji-won now?

664
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:34,537
When she got a call from you,

665
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:37,957
she turned pale and left
saying she needed to check something.

666
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:42,211
If you hear from Ji-won,
let me know right away.

667
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:43,921
Did something happen to her?

668
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,048
You know what it is, don't you?

669
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:52,972
Jae-seop, what are you
and Detective Cha hiding from me?

670
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,225
I can't turn a blind eye anymore.

671
01:04:57,768 --> 01:05:00,855
Jae-seop! Tell me what it is.

672
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,988
Listen, Captain.

673
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:14,368
I'm going to tell you something
that's hard to believe.

674
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:28,633
Do you…

675
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:32,511
seriously expect me to believe that?

676
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,016
How…

677
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:44,023
How could Detective Cha's husband
possibly be Do Hyeon-su?

678
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:52,740
It wasn't me.

679
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,492
Go to the police station.

680
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:56,535
It wasn't me.

681
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,371
Go to the police station

682
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,082
and give your statement there.

683
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:02,583
I…

684
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:06,587
Our team will try our best
to clear your name.

685
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:15,972
Now you're

686
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:19,934
identified as a murder suspect.

687
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,230
So I have to arrest you right now.

688
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,944
I have to put handcuffs on you.

689
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,282
Cooperate with me.

690
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:46,377
Please.

691
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,391
I really

692
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,311
loved your mom.

693
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:57,073
And I believed your mom loved me back.

694
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:03,537
But what your mom loved
was just the illusion of me.

695
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:06,791
She didn't accept my true self.

696
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:12,713
And she eventually
abandoned you guys and me.

697
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:18,761
Love is

698
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:21,555
a very sly feeling.

699
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:24,141
It's really cunning.

700
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:28,270
It gives you an illusion
that it can solve everything,

701
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,774
then leaves you
an acute sense of betrayal in the end.

702
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:37,488
Hyeon-su, keep this in mind.

703
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:44,620
In life, if you feel the urge
to trust someone,

704
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:49,208
that means you're becoming weak.

705
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:52,211
It is no more or less than that.

706
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:06,475
Honey.

707
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:20,322
Tell me.

708
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,326
Do you believe me?

709
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:28,330
What?

710
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:29,957
Or

711
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:33,294
somewhere in the back of your mind

712
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,715
do you think I might've killed someone?

713
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:46,348
Even you don't believe me.

714
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:51,312
So who else in this world will believe me?

715
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,989
-Jae-seop.
-Where are you?

716
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:05,659
I'm at my husband's workshop.

717
01:10:07,494 --> 01:10:08,954
I'm with my husband now.

718
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:14,126
I'll take him to the police--

719
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,065
What

720
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:38,776
are you doing now?

721
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:42,947
From this moment on…

722
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:46,951
I won't trust anyone.

723
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,930
WHERE THE RISING STAR STAYS

724
01:11:18,148 --> 01:11:20,693
Check the CCTV footage.

725
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:25,447
It's over there.

726
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:36,083
Hang on.

727
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,685
Move to the monitor.

728
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:20,502
Pull out all the video cables
connected to the recorder.

729
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:22,463
There are four of them.

730
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:01,710
HIDE-AND-SEEK
I CAN SEE YOU, BUT YOU CAN'T SEE ME

731
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:25,984
But the most important fact is that
our fellow detective is held hostage.

732
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:29,238
No matter how much Do Hyeon-su
claims his innocence,

733
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:32,449
it's true that he's wanted for murder.

734
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,118
He's already guilty.

735
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:38,372
Do you think things will go as we planned?

736
01:13:38,455 --> 01:13:40,624
We will meet again soon,

737
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:43,710
so don't talk like this is
our last goodbye. Instead, wish me luck.

738
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:45,963
I didn't want to do this either.

739
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:48,590
But you're too unpredictable.

740
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,759
You're like an uncontrollable variable.

741
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:55,305
