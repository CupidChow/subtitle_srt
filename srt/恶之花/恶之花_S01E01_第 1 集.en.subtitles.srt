1
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,434
Do you want me to tell you

2
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,062
what kind of person I am?

3
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,067
I'll love you even more from now on.

4
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,904
I will be really good to you.

5
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,159
Then everything will change at some point.

6
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,039
Like magic.

7
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,835
WHERE THE RISING STAR STAYS

8
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,855
Oh, no. It's already four.

9
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,191
We have no time for this. We're late.

10
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,943
You silly thing.

11
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,070
What if a customer comes in?

12
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,698
You're the one who got me
in the mood with the music.

13
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,201
Honey, clear things up here and then go up

14
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,204
and put Eun-ha in her best outfit.
Something with an obvious brand logo.

15
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,831
I have to pick up the dry cleaning.

16
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,959
We're just having a family dinner.
What's all the fuss?

17
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,382
-What?
-I hope you're okay with it.

18
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:41,346
I'm fine. I'm just worried
you might feel uncomfortable.

19
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,806
We should try to meet them
like this more often.

20
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,350
They're my in-laws after all.

21
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,728
And they are Eun-ha's grandparents.

22
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,272
I'm afraid of Grandma.

23
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,150
Why would you be afraid of your grandma?

24
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,486
I know you're scared of her too.

25
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,489
That's not true.

26
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,346
You haven't even taught her
how to greet elders?

27
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,350
That's because she remembers
being turned away last year.

28
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,852
You're the ones who insisted
on showing up uninvited.

29
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,356
Did you arrive here all right?
It wasn't hard finding this place?

30
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,440
It was fine.

31
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,905
Eun-ha, remember what we practiced?
How about we try it now?

32
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,491
Go ahead and try.

33
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:51,457
Grandma and Grandpa.

34
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,710
I love you.

35
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,722
Let's go inside. My legs are tired.

36
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,189
Grandma hates me.

37
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,066
No, it's okay.

38
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,236
If you keep trying,
it'll work at some point.

39
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,404
It's all right.

40
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,200
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

41
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:29,829
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

42
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:34,208
-Happy birthday, my dear dad
-Happy birthday, my dear husband

43
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,712
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

44
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,175
Blow them out.

45
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,974
-Eun-ha?
-Happy birthday, Dad.

46
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,769
My gift for you is me, Baek Eun-ha.

47
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:56,230
Really? What a pretty gift.

48
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,150
And this is my gift for you.

49
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,402
You didn't have to do this.

50
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,454
I love it. Thank you.

51
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,289
I had your initials engraved on it.

52
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,212
Thank you.

53
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:25,927
-Mom, I need to pee.
-Okay. Let's go to the restroom, Eun-ha.

54
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,644
Did you call us here to piss us off?

55
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,898
Why did you even come?

56
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,234
You could've come up with an excuse.

57
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,611
Am I not allowed to celebrate
my son's birthday?

58
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,200
Do you feel like
your life is all yours now?

59
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,952
Of course not.

60
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,580
It's never been mine.

61
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,084
I don't really know what it feels like.

62
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,169
Are you being sarcastic right now?

63
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,089
If it weren't for me…

64
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,011
That's enough.

65
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,682
We're all in the same boat.

66
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:16,602
Don't get on each other's nerves
unless you want the boat to sink.

67
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:24,735
-Let's go sit.
-Okay.

68
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,156
Hee-seong, I need to…

69
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,032
Okay. Do you want me to drive you there?

70
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,368
No, it's okay. I can take a cab.

71
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:37,373
Mother and Father, I'm sorry.
Something came up at work.

72
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,461
Are you getting back at me now
because I sent you away last year?

73
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,129
No, Mother.

74
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:47,300
I really wanted to treat you
to a nice dinner tonight, but…

75
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,343
It's cold. Put this on.

76
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,889
I'm okay, but they seem upset again.
This is bad.

77
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,682
It's okay.

78
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,685
I should get going, then.

79
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,499
I guess she's dumber than I thought.

80
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,294
Your wife, I mean.

81
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:27,840
She means she didn't know
you'd have such a successful marriage.

82
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,887
Ji-won and I are made

83
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:34,847
for each other.

84
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,183
What?

85
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,188
GANGSU POLICE STATION

86
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,616
A guy with a nasty past
like yourself, and a cop like her

87
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,076
are made for each other?

88
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,171
You're funny.

89
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,051
You do sound
like a normal human being now.

90
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,971
Will you be honest?

91
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,392
This is very important to us.

92
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,271
Now that you have a kid with her,

93
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:28,067
do you have some special feelings
for her or something?

94
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:34,156
Ji-won only believes what she sees.

95
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,537
And I show her only what she wants to see.

96
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:44,458
So I find it very easy to deal with her.

97
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,628
I mean,

98
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,258
you don't need to worry about me.

99
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,710
At around 3:00 p.m. today,
in an apartment in Seokin-dong,

100
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,796
a boy was found unconscious

101
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,299
with a serious head injury
in the stairwell.

102
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,802
His name is Kim In-seo,
and he's 12 years old.

103
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,722
In-seo.

104
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,642
In-seo. Are you all right?

105
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,354
The boy stayed quiet
for a while after his surgery.

106
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,147
And the first thing he said was…

107
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,321
Dad.

108
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,908
It was Dad.

109
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,953
He tried to kill me.

110
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,043
"Dad. It was Dad."

111
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,962
According to the boy's statement…

112
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,610
Go down.

113
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,322
Dad, I'm so tired.

114
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,616
-Can I stop for today?
-Go down.

115
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,826
I'm exhausted.

116
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,125
Look at your fat belly.

117
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,961
Aren't you disgusted by yourself?

118
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,879
I'm sorry.

119
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,090
-Kim In-seo.
-Yes?

120
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,099
Every time I look at you, I get so angry.

121
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,060
I can't believe you're my son.

122
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,841
It's a lie. He lied.

123
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,635
In-seo is lying.

124
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,764
So, Mr. Kim Sang-jin,

125
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,267
are you saying a 12-year-old boy is lying

126
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,644
to put his dad in jail
for attempted murder?

127
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,396
Is that what you're saying?

128
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,857
"Attempted murder"?

129
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,528
A boy was severely injured
on a steep staircase

130
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,905
with no cameras around,

131
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,532
his dad who'd been there
with him disappeared,

132
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,285
and the boy spotted his dad
as the culprit.

133
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:12,500
Don't you think that's reasonable
for us to suspect you of it?

134
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,084
All right. Hang in there.

135
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,587
It's true that I made him
go up the stairs.

136
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,506
But it was nothing like what In-seo said.

137
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,175
All right. You can do this, In-seo.
We're almost there.

138
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,093
There you go.

139
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:29,892
Hey, Eun-seok.

140
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,395
Now? Okay. I'll be right there.

141
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,274
In-seo, you should go home first.
I'll get home before dinner.

142
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:38,818
Make sure to stretch.

143
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,114
That's it.

144
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,369
My friend was in the neighborhood,
so he asked me to come out.

145
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,954
While we were drinking together,

146
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,498
I got a call from my wife.

147
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,251
Detective.

148
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,170
What kind of parent would do that?

149
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,258
He's my precious son.

150
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,887
It's just horrible.

151
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,975
You know that doesn't make sense.

152
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,398
What are you doing?

153
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,941
You had soju, beer, and ribs

154
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,360
with your friend?

155
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,657
Yes.

156
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,597
Do you really think
he did such a thing to his own son?

157
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,893
He seems like a decent guy.

158
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,438
More than 80 percent of child abuse cases
are committed by the parents.

159
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,566
What about you, Ji-won?
What do you think of this case?

160
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,361
I think Kim Sang-jin is falsely accused.

161
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:08,365
Everyone in the interrogation room says
they're innocent. That's disappointing.

162
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,034
That's not it. Look at his shoes.

163
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,953
His shoes? What about his shoes?

164
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,915
Considering his clothes,
I don't think they are his slippers.

165
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,917
I guess they are from the restaurant.

166
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:22,630
He heard about his son at the restaurant
and came running hurriedly.

167
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,341
And only one of his socks is dirty.

168
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,764
He had to run in the slippers which
weren't his size, so it must've come off.

169
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,185
I think that could be circumstantial
evidence that he's innocent.

170
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,896
You're really good.

171
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,857
That's your problem.

172
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,568
-What do you mean?
-You have blind faith in evidence.

173
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,987
You should look at the person
before looking at the evidence.

174
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,573
-Be honest. You didn't see the slippers.
-Quiet.

175
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:53,994
Then do you think Kim Sang-jin
really tried to kill his own son?

176
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,704
Listen to me.

177
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:01,251
The second I got in there
and saw Kim Sang-jin's eyes…

178
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,673
I got a hunch.

179
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,426
I sensed that he's a bad guy.

180
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,220
See? I got goosebumps.

181
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,513
You know what that means.

182
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,223
-You know it, right?
-I do.

183
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,600
-What do you think, Ho-jun?
-Me?

184
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,394
Is it me or Ji-won? Pick one.

185
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,520
Gosh.

186
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,772
I wasn't going to say this,

187
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,441
but Ho-jun once told me
that I'm his role model.

188
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,570
Hey, Im Ho-jun! You told me
I was your role model the other day.

189
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,947
What?

190
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,325
Well, I mean…

191
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,412
You both are my role models.

192
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,914
She and I are completely different.

193
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,250
We've been summoned.

194
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,585
Where are you going? I'm not done.

195
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,264
Well, just so you know,

196
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,851
if you buy more coffees, they pack them up
nicely so you can carry them around.

197
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,270
-I know that.
-So you know it.

198
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,482
He always buys only one coffee
for himself when he knows that.

199
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,276
-Detective Cha Ji-won.
-Yes?

200
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,195
Please question people
around Kim Sang-jin.

201
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,782
And check the CCTV footage
near the crime scene.

202
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,325
Okay. I will.

203
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,370
Detective Choi, about Kim Sang-jin…

204
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:22,541
I'll beat him up if I have to
and make him come clean.

205
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,626
Find out where he was
at the time of the incident.

206
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,545
In a legal manner, of course.

207
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,676
You can count on me, sir.

208
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,638
Then we'll go meet
Kim Sang-jin's wife first.

209
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,017
Pardon?

210
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,644
I didn't understand the question.

211
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,773
I'm sorry,

212
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,151
but can you repeat the question?

213
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,945
Have you ever seen your husband

214
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:56,241
treat your son in a way that was
oppressive or authoritative?

215
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,118
He is quite strict.

216
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,581
He hates it
when things don't go as planned.

217
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,626
So he's obsessive about plans.

218
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,880
Have you ever felt that he lacks empathy?

219
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,467
Sorry? What do you mean?

220
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,137
I can't wait to see the headline
of your article, Reporter Kim Moo-jin.

221
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:24,353
"I hate my obese child. A father who made
his son climb the stairs of death."

222
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,354
Doesn't it sound good?

223
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,482
Mr. Kim, you know you seem
too excited about this, right?

224
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,734
You're in a hospital.
Can't you hold it back?

225
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,821
To be honest with you,
I love cases like this.

226
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,867
Actually, I have enjoyed
the articles you've been posting online.

227
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,160
Which one's your favorite?

228
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,123
The one about
the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

229
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,376
I didn't even know something
like that happened in Korea.

230
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,421
It was horrible. The whole town was…

231
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,424
-What?
-Nothing.

232
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,802
So what does the father do?

233
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,846
-Who?
-The stairs of death.

234
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,432
-He's a lawyer.
-Another elite?

235
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,228
That's very nice. It's perfect.

236
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,815
Everything's perfect
except that my pen doesn't work.

237
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,483
Mr. Kim, you can use mine.

238
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,193
What is this?

239
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,487
Detective Cha's husband
made the pens for our team.

240
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,823
-This is pretty.
-He's a metal craftsman.

241
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,659
A metal craftsman?

242
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,830
That's an interesting job.

243
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:29,918
Did your son ever complain
or feel uncomfortable around his dad?

244
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,967
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

245
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,012
Oh, I'm sorry.

246
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:43,473
I know it's hard,
but your statement is very important.

247
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:49,855
Detective, my son In-seo
isn't someone who lies about such a thing.

248
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,190
He's such a good boy.

249
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,735
Then what about your husband?

250
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,863
Do you think he's someone
who would hurt his own son?

251
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,616
No. How could you say that?

252
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,161
Detective, there's nothing wrong
with our family.

253
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,288
There's never been
anything wrong until now!

254
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,754
I just don't know.

255
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,508
I have no idea why such a thing happened.

256
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,344
Why…

257
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,515
I'm just asking this question
out of formality.

258
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,894
Did you take out
any insurance policies on your son?

259
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,106
Yes. What about it?

260
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:37,110
See? I told you so.
It's about the insurance money.

261
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:41,156
No, it's not. The insurance
they took out has a clause

262
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,493
that states a child under 15
cannot receive death benefits.

263
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,163
And they are quite well off,
so it can't be a motive anyway.

264
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,416
Murder doesn't require a grand motive.

265
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,711
There was a man who killed seven people

266
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,172
and buried them
in a nearby hill for no reason.

267
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:02,052
Even his wife who allegedly ran away
a long time ago was found in the hill.

268
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,929
As a skeleton.

269
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,597
Who are you talking about?

270
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,350
I heard your husband is a metal craftsman.

271
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,560
-Right.
-Gosh.

272
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,313
The murderer was a metal craftsman too.

273
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,150
I think I've heard this story before.

274
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,821
If I tell you more about it,
can I get this fancy pen for free?

275
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:26,952
If I give you this for free, will you say
good things about it on your social media?

276
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,287
Of course.

277
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,373
All right, then. Please make it look good.

278
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,625
WHERE THE RISING STAR STAYS

279
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,460
This is really strange.

280
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,256
Why are you using honorifics
towards Mr. Kim when he doesn't?

281
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,258
Because he's a year older than me.

282
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:44,636
That's not true. He was born in 1985.
He's a year younger than you.

283
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,138
Don't they have ketchup here?

284
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,765
What? You were born in 1985?

285
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,394
Why didn't you tell me that sooner?

286
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,816
Do you know what's
the strangest thing about this case?

287
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,028
The victim's mother,
who is also the suspect's wife.

288
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:02,821
Why?

289
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:06,408
Her son came back from death's door
and pointed out his dad as the culprit.

290
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,411
But she says there's nothing
wrong with her family.

291
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,330
That's all she keeps saying.

292
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:16,251
There must've been signs
before things ever got this far.

293
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,879
How could she be so clueless?

294
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,382
Is she avoiding the truth
or covering something up?

295
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,260
Anyway, something's strange.

296
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,514
Are you really going out again
after changing? It's late.

297
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,849
I always do this.

298
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,687
Oh, right. Were Mother and Father upset?

299
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,481
Don't worry about it.

300
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,984
I don't understand
why they hate me so much.

301
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,570
I'm not usually someone
who gets on people's bad side.

302
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:47,908
I have a good personality, I look nice.
I even gave birth to their grandchild.

303
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,035
And I'm a civil servant.
It's a stable job.

304
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,204
What do you think it is
that they don't like about me?

305
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,332
There you go
bragging about yourself again.

306
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,588
You must be upset.

307
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,800
You're growing apart
from your parents because of me.

308
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,887
Why would you say that?

309
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,974
If I had known, I wouldn't have
come on to you back then.

310
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,984
Call Detective Im and tell him that
you're dealing with a more urgent case.

311
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,321
Forget it. Stop that.

312
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,490
Why? Stay a little more with me.

313
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,493
GANGSU POLICE STATION

314
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,555
Ho-jun, look at this.

315
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,932
He was wearing dress shoes at this moment.

316
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,601
He definitely put on the slippers
at the restaurant.

317
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,151
He doesn't seem like someone
who's running away.

318
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,987
He seems rather excited.

319
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,781
Don't you think so?

320
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,911
Gosh, he must be cold.

321
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,121
Are you wasting your time?

322
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,331
I'm investigating.

323
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,917
An investigation
based on an incorrect assumption?

324
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,879
That's the definition of wasting time.
Write that down.

325
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,214
Last time, you told me I'd find something

326
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,092
if I tried to gather
every single piece of evidence.

327
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,970
I'll take care of everything by tomorrow.

328
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,763
So I just feel bad for you.

329
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,016
Did you find something?

330
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,645
Keep wasting your time, then.

331
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,358
Hang on. I should go to a bathhouse.

332
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,904
I'm sure something's going on.

333
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,574
Watch your step.

334
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,454
-Eun-ha, have a great day.
-Hello.

335
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,915
Hello, Mr. Baek.

336
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,334
Here. I made some extra
while cooking breakfast today.

337
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,629
-Please, enjoy it with the other teachers.
-Thank you so much.

338
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:09,966
My gosh.

339
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,344
I heard the teachers often skip breakfast.

340
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,807
Eun-ha, your mom must be really happy.

341
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:18,975
Why?

342
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:23,688
Because your dad is kind
and cooks well. And he's good-looking.

343
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,440
You want me to leave, right?

344
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,108
And he's witty.

345
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,486
-I'll get going, then.
-Okay.

346
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,279
Eun-ha, I'll see you later.

347
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,114
Bye, Dad.

348
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,616
Bye.

349
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,742
Let's go.

350
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,421
Mom, it's me. I'll drop by for a moment.

351
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:52,425
YEONJU SERIAL MURDER CASE

352
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,553
DO MIN-SEOK AND HIS SON

353
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:04,521
REPORTER KIM MOO-JIN

354
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,859
I REMEMBER THIS CASE

355
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,611
I WAS SO SCARED THAT I COULDN'T SLEEP

356
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,115
IS PSYCHOPATHY REALLY GENETIC?

357
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,960
Kim Moo-jin speaking. I'm already here.

358
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,339
Gosh, a group of customers?

359
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,552
Thank you for your understanding.

360
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,345
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

361
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,348
Mr. Nam Sun-gil. Are you sure

362
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,350
it was Do Hyeon-su?

363
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,983
Mr. Kim, Do Hyeon-su is not

364
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,612
someone I can forget
just because I want to.

365
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:56,990
I see.

366
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:05,123
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

367
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,210
Darn it.

368
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,442
DO HAE-SU

369
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,919
CHEONGGYECHEON, NAM SUN-GIL
5 P.M.

370
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,549
Call her.

371
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,013
Are you trying to teach me or what?

372
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,016
I'm just making a suggestion.

373
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,936
So? Do you want me

374
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,439
to call your wife and make a fuss?

375
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,817
You keep giving her hope.

376
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,404
Ji-won thinks things will get better
if she tries harder.

377
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:21,616
Make sure she doesn't
expect anything from you.

378
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,287
So you're telling me not to show up
in front of your family again?

379
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,207
That would be safer.

380
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,717
I have my right.

381
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,262
I have a right over your life.

382
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,728
Mom.

383
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,773
My life is yours.

384
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,026
As long as I live as Baek Hee-seong.

385
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,781
You know Ji-won.

386
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,200
You better stay away from her.

387
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,579
You can't fool her.
You're not as good as I am.

388
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,379
You're going to call her, right?

389
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,097
-Ji-won. Ji-won!
-What?

390
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,974
Wake up. And Take a look at this.

391
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,102
Look what I found.

392
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,065
This is from the approximate time
of the incident.

393
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:40,069
In-seo was found on the stairs
between the fifth and sixth floors.

394
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,407
And this boy got on the elevator
on the sixth floor.

395
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,993
He saw something, didn't he?

396
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,548
Excuse me.

397
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,551
I'm here to meet Dr. Bae Eun-seok.

398
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,512
There she is.

399
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,810
PEDIATRIC OBESITY CLINIC

400
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,774
He talked about you like you were a guy.

401
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,611
Sang-jin and I are close,
so he treats me like a guy.

402
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,154
We were in the same university club.

403
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,867
When you met Mr. Kim Sang-jin yesterday,
was there anything different about him?

404
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,537
Not really. He seemed
pretty much the same.

405
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,121
He was quite humorous.

406
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:36,793
I mean, before he got a call
and heard In-seo got hurt.

407
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:42,298
That's strange. Why did you
not go to the hospital with him?

408
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:45,468
It's not like you two
have anything to hide.

409
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,971
And his son used to be a patient here.

410
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,600
Actually, I drank too much last night.

411
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,894
I really couldn't go with him.

412
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,358
What are you doing?

413
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,235
I guess you're right.

414
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,195
You still reek of alcohol.

415
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,157
My patients are waiting.

416
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:12,161
Then please call me
if you remember anything else.

417
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:15,540
Hang on. Where's my business card?

418
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:25,008
Gosh, darn it.

419
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:30,722
There are some around you.
Could you pick them up for me?

420
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,059
Sure.

421
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,776
-Here.
-Gosh.

422
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,904
Thank you.

423
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,158
We can't unlock the passcode these days.

424
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,119
Just try.
All I need to check is the photo album.

425
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,662
It's not like it used to be.

426
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,372
You…

427
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,255
Wait. It has an SD card in it.

428
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,482
I knew it.

429
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,568
He reeked of women's perfume.

430
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,907
So the perfume belonged
to his so-called "friend."

431
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,717
MULTIVITAMIN

432
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,483
A cockroach?

433
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,694
I take the vitamins every day.

434
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,279
But there was a cockroach in there.

435
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,911
It can't go in there
unless someone put it in on purpose.

436
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,873
But what are you doing here?

437
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,962
Please take a look at this.
Do you recognize this boy?

438
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,550
He lives on the 12th floor.
Apartment 1201.

439
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,552
His name is…

440
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,724
What was his name?

441
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,309
Why can't I remember?

442
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:46,649
Oh, right. It is Ji-hun. Yoon Ji-hun.

443
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:51,362
Detective, my husband

444
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,614
is fine, right?

445
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,742
Of course, he is.

446
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,911
Is he getting meals on time?

447
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:03,124
What about you? Did you eat anything?

448
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,711
In-seo and my husband
get along really well.

449
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,671
They even go hiking together.

450
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,757
-It's been seven years.
-Please excuse me.

451
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:19,724
I confirmed Kim Sang-jin's affair.
Tell his wife and secure her testimony.

452
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,937
Is something wrong?

453
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,314
No. Nothing.

454
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:31,861
I can't live
without In-seo and my husband.

455
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,907
Please make sure no one gets hurt.

456
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,909
I'm begging you.

457
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,865
WHERE THE RISING STAR STAYS

458
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:22,912
Excuse me.

459
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,917
Please feel free to look around.

460
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,589
Do you repair silver items as well?

461
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,510
Someone recommended this place.
Is Mr. Baek Hee-seong here?

462
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,684
Who recommended this place?

463
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,199
Are you…

464
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,327
I'm sorry, but I'm closing early today.

465
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,245
Do Hyeon-su.

466
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,464
You're Do Hyeon-su, right?

467
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,344
Do you not remember me?

468
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,430
I'm Kim Moo-jin.

469
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,748
It's really you, Do Hyeon-su.

470
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:51,876
So?

471
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,252
What?

472
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,254
So what are you going to do?

473
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,176
Well, I'm not trying to do anything.
I was just startled.

474
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,930
I'm here to meet Mr. Baek Hee-seong.

475
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,265
Detective Cha Ji-won's husband.

476
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,726
Is Mr. Baek Hee-seong here?

477
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,320
-Do you know her?
-What?

478
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,323
Do you and Detective Cha Ji-won
know each other?

479
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,911
Well, yes. We do.

480
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,087
Do you want some tea?

481
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:37,713
What?

482
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,132
I have some nice tea.

483
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,649
Why did you not tell
Ms. Ko Hye-yeong about it?

484
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,818
You felt bad for her, didn't you?

485
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,696
It's not that I couldn't tell her.

486
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,866
I just don't think Detective Choi
found the phone by chance.

487
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,619
I didn't tell her because
the evidence might not be admissible.

488
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:13,082
If she found out about his affair, she
might have given important statements.

489
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,126
Think about it more rationally.

490
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,045
His affair has nothing
to do with this case.

491
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,220
Kim Sang-jin recently consulted
a fellow lawyer

492
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,222
about divorce and child support.

493
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,725
He seemed quite distressed
about child support.

494
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,561
Are you still wasting your time?

495
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:37,440
The wife said Kim Sang-jin
went hiking with his son often.

496
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,692
For seven years. They got along well.

497
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:44,655
Do you know what kind of lunatic
is the biggest headache?

498
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,617
A patient one.

499
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:58,210
Gosh, Do Hyeon-su.

500
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,839
Thanks.

501
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,592
I almost didn't recognize you.

502
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,760
But you did.

503
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,597
I did.

504
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:13,851
We grew up
in the same neighborhood after all.

505
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,394
Anyway, you've changed a lot.

506
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,610
Isn't it hot today?

507
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,695
I'm sweating.

508
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,030
Is it?

509
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:29,909
I'm fine.

510
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,248
Am I the only one who's hot?

511
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:41,504
You're feeling hot because
you're holding something back.

512
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,756
-What?
-It's okay.

513
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:48,219
I know there's something
you wanted to ask the second you saw me.

514
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:56,102
No, there isn't.

515
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,812
Gosh, what's…

516
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,486
I should get going. I have an appointment.

517
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,196
Don't you want to know?

518
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,075
I bet you're curious.

519
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,745
You're a reporter.

520
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,209
Ask me.

521
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:37,476
Actually, I don't believe
anything that's not confirmed.

522
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:42,857
So the rumors about you
are still like a novel to me.

523
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,031
Really?

524
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:57,746
Hyeon-su, I'm not sure if you know this.

525
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,374
But 18 years ago…

526
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,670
I mean, the day you disappeared,

527
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,507
there was a murder.

528
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,595
The village head…

529
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,056
died.

530
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:32,948
So?

531
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:39,955
Does it have anything

532
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,208
to do with you?

533
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:04,271
Yesterday, I lost Ddol.

534
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,568
Ddol. Come here, Ddol!

535
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,237
Ddol!

536
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:21,997
Ddol bit In-seo before.

537
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:26,710
So In-seo is afraid of Ddol.

538
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,759
You should've told me about it.

539
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:38,514
In-seo's mom said if it happens again,

540
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,433
she will have Ddol put down.

541
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,602
So I couldn't tell you.

542
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:49,149
In-seo's mom is very meticulous and rigid.

543
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:53,153
I guess that's why my son was afraid.

544
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,827
What? Ddol?

545
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,249
So are you saying a dog is the culprit?

546
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:08,919
Aren't you relieved
that his dad didn't do it?

547
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:14,550
The boy who witnessed the scene
even remembered what In-seo was wearing.

548
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,970
His testimony is detailed,
so it's highly credible.

549
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:23,767
Then why did In-seo tell such a lie?

550
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:27,771
People around him say that he's been
stressed out about losing weight.

551
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,481
We should transfer the case to juvie unit.

552
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,318
Gosh, I had some feelings about this case.

553
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:36,989
Jae-seop, there's a saying I like.
Do you want to hear it?

554
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,532
Don't do it.

555
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,993
An investigation based
on an incorrect assumption.

556
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:44,538
-That's the definition of wasting time.
-The definition of wasting time.

557
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,417
Darn it.

558
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,631
-What's wrong?
-It's my wisdom tooth.

559
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,090
Oh, no.

560
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:03,182
You may go home now.

561
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,477
We have a witness.

562
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,322
What's the point in denying it?

563
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:23,243
Everyone thinks I killed him anyway.

564
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,080
You, the village people,

565
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,123
and the police.

566
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,586
Then why was the murder weapon
in your backpack?

567
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,090
Why are you still wanted?

568
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:40,010
If you're innocent, you should
cooperate with the police investigation

569
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,553
and clear your name.

570
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,229
How did you know I'm still wanted?

571
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,231
Did you look into it?

572
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,608
Why?

573
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,403
Well, it's just…

574
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:03,659
I heard it from somewhere.
You know, since I'm a reporter…

575
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,954
I should really get going.
Thank you for the tea.

576
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:07,871
So?

577
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,126
Will you go straight to the police station

578
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:15,087
and say you met Do Hyeon-su,
who killed the village head

579
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,630
in Gagyeong-ri 18 years ago?

580
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,217
Is that your plan?

581
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,262
What are you talking about?

582
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:26,181
I'm not interested in others' affairs.

583
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:36,525
Let's talk about you, not me.

584
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,068
What about me?

585
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:40,654
Are you married?

586
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:47,327
Eating and drinking alone is the trend
these days. And I'm quite trendy.

587
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,496
I should go now.

588
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,623
You write for a weekly newspaper, right?

589
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:55,502
I'm no big deal, really.
I'll see you around, then.

590
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:56,962
Then…

591
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,550
you must work flexible hours.

592
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,190
Which one has no side effects?

593
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:19,151
There's no such thing.
Even vitamins have side effects.

594
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,571
That's 3,000 won.

595
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:24,448
MULTIVITAMIN

596
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,492
Let's see.

597
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,618
-Here.
-Thank you.

598
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,454
-Let's go, Ji-won.
-Okay.

599
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,458
Just pull it out.

600
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,502
I can't just pull out a healthy tooth.

601
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,587
It's mine even if it hurts.
I won't pull it out.

602
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:41,715
What?

603
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,261
What's the matter?

604
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:50,265
This is what Ms. Ko Hye-yeong takes.

605
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,850
I know. What about it?

606
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,812
Do you remember what color
the pills she spilled on the floor were?

607
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,649
They were white.

608
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,662
JAE-SEOP

609
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,455
There's nothing wrong with our family.

610
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,207
There's never been
anything wrong until now!

611
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:24,383
In-seo's mom is very meticulous and rigid.

612
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:25,926
His name is…

613
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:32,808
What was his name? Why can't I remember?

614
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,776
Will you step outside?

615
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,863
Why? I want to stay.

616
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,072
Please.

617
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,617
Okay.

618
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,213
Is there anything else to investigate?

619
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:12,973
It's you, right? The one who put
a cockroach in the pill bottle.

620
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,310
So that your mom couldn't take the pills.

621
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:24,735
I know you have a reason for lying.

622
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:32,367
In-seo, you should let your mom

623
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,787
make a choice of her own.

624
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,920
I want Mom…

625
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,089
Go on.

626
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,717
…to wait outside.

627
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:06,443
I don't want Mom to hear what I say.

628
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,533
-Dad is a good person.
-Done.

629
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:15,619
To me at least.

630
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,454
In-seo.

631
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:21,583
-Hello.
-You're here.

632
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:22,626
How are you?

633
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:26,755
Dad, I need tissues.

634
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,006
Take it.

635
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,012
-Did you bring it?
-Yes.

636
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,600
Are you sure it's not dangerous?

637
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,978
It just blocks nerve impulses temporarily.

638
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,230
She will be fine
once she quits taking them.

639
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,108
She's a completely different person now.

640
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:49,569
She's slow, dull, and blank all day.

641
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:51,905
One day…

642
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,408
Honey.

643
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:56,952
What is this?

644
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,830
I think it's a lipstick stain.

645
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,873
…I got caught.

646
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,875
So I just made something up.

647
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:05,627
It's paint.

648
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,546
Paint?

649
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:11,717
I went to this cafe that had recently been
renovated. And I got paint on my shirt.

650
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,978
You're right. It's paint.

651
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,524
What's wrong with me?

652
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,737
Just make sure she signs
the divorce papers now.

653
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:34,239
Why is it so hard to get a divorce?

654
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,907
Then while having an affair…

655
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:40,495
Did you think it would be easy
to keep your money and get custody?

656
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:42,998
Stop it.

657
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,877
I couldn't tell Mom.

658
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:51,006
I thought I should tell her
over and over again.

659
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,634
But I couldn't bring myself to say it.

660
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,055
I thought if I made Dad

661
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:00,891
a bad person…

662
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:03,894
Mom

663
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,606
would be less sad.

664
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:10,734
I'm sorry.

665
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,207
What are they talking about?

666
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,919
She's forcing a minor to give

667
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:31,505
a statement without a parent present.

668
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,258
I'll be sure to file a complaint.

669
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,940
So is it child abuse or what?

670
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,235
Did you get the answer you wanted?

671
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,906
Since you're a lawyer,
you must know well what crime it is

672
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:01,076
to make someone take a drug
without their consent.

673
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,578
Mr. Kim Sang-jin.

674
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,706
You're under arrest for causing
Ms. Ko Hye-yeong bodily harm.

675
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,751
You have the right to remain silent

676
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,129
and the right to an attorney.

677
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:33,150
Hey, you don't have to do this.
I don't need a gift.

678
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,568
It's okay.

679
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,571
I'm asking you not to tell anyone
that you saw me here.

680
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:38,989
It's a bribe.

681
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,159
Hey, I can keep a secret.

682
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,161
You don't have to worry.

683
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:51,668
Moo-jin, please come here and write your
address. I'll send it by parcel service.

684
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:57,716
Okay.

685
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:12,564
So where's Mr. Baek Hee-seong?

686
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,692
I heard he's the owner here.

687
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:17,319
WHERE THE RISING STAR STAYS

688
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,054
Did she really not know?

689
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,181
What do you mean?

690
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:48,308
I mean Ms. Ko Hye-yeong.

691
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:52,062
Do you think she really didn't know
about what Kim Sang-jin did?

692
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,688
If she'd known,

693
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:56,858
she wouldn't have taken
the pills he gave her every day.

694
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,280
Here's what I think.

695
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:13,458
There's some truth
that can destroy my life immediately.

696
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,170
And I know the truth eventually

697
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,673
will be revealed someday.

698
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:23,301
If I could put off that moment
by just one day…

699
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,139
I'd take the pill too.

700
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,850
What? Are you crazy?

701
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,143
Me too.

702
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:35,063
I eat everything my wife puts in my mouth.

703
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:37,941
And if she gave me some poison one day,

704
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:41,111
I'd just eat it and die.
I wouldn't spit it out to check.

705
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:43,738
What? What's wrong with the married ones?

706
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,365
I don't want to get married anymore.

707
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,117
So I was right after all.

708
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,494
What are you talking about?

709
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:52,706
I was right. Kim Sang-jin was the bad guy.

710
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:56,626
No. It wasn't him who injured In-seo.

711
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:00,171
Stop being so stubborn.
You're such a poor judge of character.

712
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,382
Ho-jun, you tell me.

713
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,467
What? Tell you what?

714
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:07,053
Who was right? Me or Ji-won?

715
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:10,348
Gosh. As I was saying, you both…

716
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,560
Just pick one.
Don't you dare try to get away with this.

717
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:14,686
So I think…

718
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,981
Your phone is ringing.

719
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,316
MOTHER

720
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,444
Okay.

721
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:24,654
Tell me. Sit down.

722
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:30,452
-Hello, Mother.
-I don't like you.

723
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,873
-Pardon?
-Are you in your right mind?

724
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:37,334
Do you think you deserve Hee-seong?

725
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:40,003
He's the son
of a university hospital director.

726
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,465
I'll do better, Mother.

727
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:45,884
They say daughters take after their moms.

728
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,428
Your mom made her husband die.

729
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,434
Mother, that's a little…

730
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,561
You haven't changed at all, have you?

731
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,356
You used your pregnancy to marry my son.

732
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:02,025
And now you're using your kid
to force your way through.

733
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:04,611
Do you think you can
take my money like that?

734
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,075
Listen carefully. You disgust me.

735
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,495
Let's consider each other dead.

736
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,288
Keep that in mind.

737
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:20,377
-Mother.
-What? Does it upset you?

738
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:26,800
That's not it. About what you just said.

739
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:30,345
I don't want Hee-seong to know about it.

740
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:35,642
He doesn't show it, but he's heartbroken

741
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:38,770
that we don't get along.

742
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:06,232
-It's a flower.
-It's pretty, isn't it?

743
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,443
All right. Try it now.

744
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:19,913
Shall we add it now?

745
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:23,291
All right. Let's add this. What else?

746
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,086
Dad, my nose is bleeding.

747
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:29,756
What's this? Are you all right?

748
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,466
I got you!

749
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:36,387
-Eun-ha. Look at this.
-Eun-ha!

750
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:40,141
-Mom!
-My girl.

751
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,392
You're here.

752
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,354
Eun-ha, your mom is tired.

753
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,898
No, I'm not. I'm feeling great.

754
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,191
Come here, honey.

755
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,695
-It's been a long day, hasn't it?
-Come here. I need to be recharged.

756
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,573
Gosh, you did great today.

757
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,037
Eun-ha, laugh again for me.
I love hearing you laugh.

758
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,997
I can laugh if something is funny.

759
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:06,334
-Shall I make you laugh, then?
-Dad, help!

760
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:08,002
Let's make your mom laugh too.

761
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:09,712
Eun-ha, help!

762
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,257
Eun-ha, let's run away from her.

763
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,425
Eun-ha, I'm coming to get you.

764
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,344
-Here I come.
-Dad, run!

765
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:18,513
She's going to catch us.

766
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:21,474
Come here. I got you!

767
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,291
WHERE THE RISING STAR STAYS

768
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:06,329
Why are her thumbnails missing?

769
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:09,832
This is so similar to the Yeonju
Serial Murder Case that happened in 2002.

770
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:14,170
You mean the case
Reporter Kim Moo-jin told us about?

771
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,798
If it hurts a lot,

772
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:19,842
don't hold it in. Tell me.

773
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:22,887
It'll be more fun for me that way.

774
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,347
Where's your mom?

775
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,849
Mom went to clean up
your workshop for you.

776
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:35,108
