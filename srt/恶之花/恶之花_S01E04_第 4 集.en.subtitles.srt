1
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,452
It's so cold!

2
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,422
What's so funny?

3
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,925
My dress is new, and so are my shoes.

4
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,179
It took an hour to style my hair this way.

5
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:59,350
I'm really unlucky.
What kind of first date is this?

6
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,227
Date?

7
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,355
Two people who like each other
are hanging out. That's a date.

8
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,275
I don't have any interest in you.

9
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,571
Then why are you hanging out with me
on your precious weekend?

10
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,240
That's because…

11
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:20,246
you won't bother me for a while
if I let you hang out with me.

12
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,753
You've hurt my feelings.

13
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,091
Let's go.

14
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,512
The owner
of the chicken restaurant told me

15
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,681
that you always stare at me
whenever I pass by.

16
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:42,352
Seon-u, a fifth-grader,
asked me while buying a Popsicle

17
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,937
whether you and I were dating.

18
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,482
Are you sure

19
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,151
you aren't the only one

20
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,612
who doesn't know that you like me?

21
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,329
Gosh, this is so suffocating.

22
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:04,624
Play rock-paper-scissors, and the loser
stands in the rain for 30 seconds.

23
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,501
No.

24
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,753
I don't play such useless games.

25
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,214
Ready-or-not, rock-paper-scissors.

26
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,591
You lost!

27
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,553
Come on, go stand in the rain.

28
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:41,763
Hee-seong.

29
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,557
What's wrong?

30
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,774
Do you realize how weird you are?

31
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,236
Why do you like me? Why?

32
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,197
I don't understand.

33
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,407
How could you like me?

34
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,956
Never mind.
There's no point in talking to you.

35
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,667
I'm leaving.

36
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,642
Why did you have to insist
on getting married and cause all this?

37
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:31,562
How many times did I tell you
to go live abroad?

38
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,523
You want to get married?

39
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,275
You want to live a normal life?

40
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,777
If you want to die, do it alone.

41
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,405
If the world finds out about us…

42
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,285
Just thinking about it gives me chills.

43
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:50,999
If that ever happens,
I'll kill myself in front of you.

44
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,387
Calm down.

45
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,056
Nothing has happened.

46
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:08,975
Drink this.

47
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,777
His name is Nam Sun-gil,
and we knew each other.

48
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,321
And I had some history with him.

49
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,575
I think that's complicated some things.

50
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,802
I'm sorry for hitting you.

51
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,679
Did that hurt?

52
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,015
I'm okay.

53
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,438
I can't seem to fix
this bad habit of mine.

54
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,194
If I ever get worked up again,
tie my hands first.

55
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,950
Your wife doesn't know anything, does she?

56
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,163
She's in charge of this case.

57
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:18,211
What? Didn't I tell you?

58
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,631
I warned you that she'd be the end of us!

59
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:33,017
If need be, I can cope
with the situation faster this way.

60
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,144
I never liked her.

61
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,980
You better watch out. She's two-faced.

62
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,025
How could you marry someone like her?

63
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,992
The killer was caught on CCTV,
and his blood was found at the scene.

64
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,787
The case will be solved.

65
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,623
You know

66
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,002
that chasing after Do Hyeon-su
won't lead them to Baek Hee-seong.

67
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:05,758
That is, as long as you continue
to be on my side, Mother.

68
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,351
Leave.

69
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,772
Okay.

70
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,110
The house is too big.

71
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,281
It's too big for just your dad and me.

72
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,287
Come have dinner
every now and then if you want.

73
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,376
It's not just you two.

74
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,756
Goodbye.

75
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,449
-It's time to feed your son.
-Let me do it.

76
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,364
13TH ELEMENTARY MATH CONTEST

21ST CHILDREN'S MATH COMPETITION

AWARDS
BAEK HEE-SEONG

79
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,814
Hee-seong.

80
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:12,278
Here is Do Min-seok's family certificate
and Do Hyeon-su's relation certificate.

81
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,281
Do Min-seok had a daughter.

82
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,576
-Yes, she's older than Do Hyeon-su.
-She's the same age as you.

83
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,286
Ji-won, you should meet with her.

84
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,747
I've already met with the victim's family.

85
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,916
I'll leave the suspect's family to you.

86
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,670
I'm truly jealous of how soft you look.

87
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,798
People feel uncomfortable around me
because of my charismatic looks.

88
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,051
Simply put, they dislike you.

89
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,887
-Don't move.
-Enough with the chit-chat.

90
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,557
Find Do Hae-su's number and address first.

91
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,808
Yes, sir.

92
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,553
How is it?
You're not in pain anymore, are you?

93
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,641
It doesn't sting anymore.

94
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,645
But it smells a bit off.

95
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,190
It's slightly pungent.
It's not a problem, right?

96
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,194
That's the smell of liquid latex.
It's hardly harmful.

97
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,779
All good, then.

98
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,532
Ms. Do.

99
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,503
I want him

100
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,714
to look like he just died.

101
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,091
Can he look fresher?

102
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,013
Have you ever seen
an actual murdered body?

103
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,515
What?

104
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,560
Nan-hui, the blood.

105
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,186
Here.

106
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,907
Ms. Do, you've got a call.

107
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,710
-Hello?
-Is this Ms. Do Hae-su?

108
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,504
I'm Detective Cha Ji-won
from Gangsu Police Station.

109
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,234
Ms. Do Hae-su?

110
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,492
I'm Detective Cha Ji-won,
the one who called.

111
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,620
How did you know it was me?

112
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,623
Do I take after Do Min-seok?

113
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,127
No, I just took a guess.

114
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,380
You came here quickly.

115
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,550
Your workplace was quite nearby.

116
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,095
-Here's my card.
-I don't know.

117
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,639
CHA JI-WON
GANGSU POLICE STATION

118
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,350
-Pardon?
-I don't know anything.

119
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,813
I haven't seen Hyeon-su
ever since he disappeared in 2002.

120
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:37,733
This is what I've been telling
all the detectives for the past 18 years.

121
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,945
May I leave now?

122
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,491
That wasn't my question.

123
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,082
We've found out that about
900 million won of Do Min-seok's assets

124
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,334
hasn't been registered
on any certificate of inheritance.

125
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,670
A house in Paju,
a workshop in Gagyeong-ri,

126
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,129
and a villa in Taean.

127
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,925
Why did you leave the buildings there
when you'd sold the land?

128
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:10,015
It feels like you left them
for your brother to take shelter there.

129
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,027
Do detectives nowadays
use their imagination to investigate?

130
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,450
I sold the land to compensate
the bereaved families.

131
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,037
Other than that, I'm not interested
in any of that monster's money.

132
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,333
I haven't seen our Hyeon-su in 18 years.

133
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,086
How many times do I have to tell you?

134
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,380
"Our Hyeon-su"?

135
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,303
The police and the media
have been pestering you for 18 years,

136
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,180
so you must resent your brother a lot.

137
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,559
But you look…

138
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,817
sad.

139
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,155
I've been gone for too long.

140
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,199
And it doesn't seem like
I can help you anyway.

141
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,928
BAEK HEE-SEONG

142
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,600
Where did the real Baek Hee-seong go?

143
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:38,604
BAEK HEE-SEONG'S CONCERT TICKETS SOLD OUT

144

ILSIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL DIRECTOR EXPANDS
MEDICAL CARE TO LOW-INCOME FAMILIES

147
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,749
His father is a hospital director?

148
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,876
YOUR SON IS THE GIFTED MATH PRODIGY,
BAEK HEE-SEONG

149
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,962
"Gifted math prodigy, Baek Hee-seong"?

150
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,385
The son of a serial killer
disguised himself really well.

151
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,763
-What are you up to?
-My God.

152
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,807
You startled me.

153
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,433
It's your fault for not noticing me.

154
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,728
Bosses that watch over their employee's
shoulders are the worst, you know.

155
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,690
But a good employee isn't afraid
to show what's on their monitor.

156
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,651
I picked these up for you.

157
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,904
This is the father's case.
This is the son's case.

158
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,074
It wasn't easy to get them.

159
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,744
I expect a scoop.

160
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,964
BAEK HEE-SEONG

161
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,980
How's the police investigation going?

162
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,452
-Honey, here.
-What?

163
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,295
Can you try it on?

164
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,424
-Why?
-Hurry up.

165
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,509
Okay.

166
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,650
What is this about?

167
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,361
The Chinese restaurant case.

168
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,156
You came home looking like this.

169
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,534
So?

170
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,411
This is a common raincoat.

171
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:05,501
Do you think I went out late at night
and killed someone?

172
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,669
Don't be absurd.

173
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,382
I couldn't recognize you at first,
and it startled me.

174
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,845
So how did Nam Sun-gil
recognize the murderer at once?

175
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,307
The killer was even wearing a mask.

176
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,561
Maybe he mistook the killer
for someone else.

177
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,357
No. It has to be Do Hyeon-su.

178
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,151
Why?

179
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,279
That way, I can get a special promotion.

180
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,740
I'll be solving
a long-term cold case as well.

181
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,952
Go to bed first. I have a lot to work on.

182
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,585
GAGYEONG-RI VILLAGE HEAD MURDER

183
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,265
YEONJU SERIAL MURDER CASE

184
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,315
I'm going to sleep here tonight.
I don't want to sleep alone.

185
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,776
Do as you please.

186
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,113
YEONJU SERIAL MURDER CASE

187
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,573
Did they really not know?

188
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,660
What do you mean?

189
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:26,415
Did they really not know
that their father was a serial killer?

190
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,420
Do Hyeon-su's antisocial personality was
probably greatly affected by his father.

191
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,342
Anyway, this is a good case.

192
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,679
What do you mean?

193
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:45,434
This case will help find the genetic cause
of antisocial personality disorder.

194
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,563
So? Do you think
you'll catch the killer soon?

195
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:53,275
We already have his DNA,
so we just need to find out how he looks.

196
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,860
But it's not easy.

197
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,864
As an alternative,
we'll draw a facial composite.

198
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,742
We've found someone
who can confirm his face.

199
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,037
And who is that?

200
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,373
The owner of the Chinese restaurant
where he used to work.

201
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:14,254
Where in the world
did he go after he left there?

202
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,717
How could he just vanish into thin air?

203
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:26,808
Honey, you should take a rest for a bit.

204
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,978
I can't. I won't be able to get back up.

205
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,066
Stop staring at the documents
and stare at my face instead.

206
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,111
-Come here.
-Gosh.

207
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,617
Goodness.

208
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,246
I didn't know my husband
was this handsome.

209
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,499
What? Have you forgotten how I looked?

210
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,753
Of course not.
I can even recognize your shadow.

211
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:03,637
Goodness, look at the dark circles
under your eyes.

212
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,015
This won't do. I should tuck you in.

213
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,643
I shouldn't sleep.

214
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,938
I really shouldn't.

215
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,733
Then should I nap for just five minutes?

216
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,368
-Ji-won.
-Yes?

217
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,372
For the facial composite,

218
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,417
Mr. Kim will be there too, right?

219
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,462
Oh, right. I forgot about him.

220
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,758
I should cross-check
with the restaurant owner.

221
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:48,557
By the way, did I mention that
Mr. Kim knew Do Hyeon-su?

222
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,226
Yes.

223
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,938
When you were changing,
you said they went to the same school.

224
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,692
I can't believe I even told you that.

225
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:04,448
You shouldn't tell anyone
about the things I tell you.

226
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,910
Of course not.

227
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,382
GAGYEONG-RI VILLAGE HEAD MURDER CASE

228
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:26,219
Six bodies were found buried
in that tiny, rural village.

229
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:30,432
And the victims' thumbnails and photos
were found in Do Min-seok's workshop.

230
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,517
It was truly a shock.

231
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,021
It's been 18 years
since the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

232
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,231
The killer's son was
in high school back then.

233
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,150
-Why has his name come up again?
-What is that?

234
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,444
A horrendous murder occurred

235
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,696
early this morning
at a Chinese restaurant in Seoul,

236
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,367
And the police believe
that it was Do Min-seok's son's doing.

237
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,703
Oh, dear. They say the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

238
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,997
-Goodness.
-This is Do Hyeon-su's photo.

239
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,665
But isn't the photo too old?

240
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,834
The police can't confirm
his current appearance,

241
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,795
and this has hindered the investigation.

242
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,672
So they're desperately waiting
for citizens' help.

243
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,979
That's wrong.

244
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,149
He was more manly. More robust.

245
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,068
Right?

246
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,028
Well… Right.

247
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,781
But in high school,

248
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,659
he grew about 20cm taller.

249
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,037
That's when
his appearance changed drastically.

250
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,583
Interfere with the facial composite.
I have something else to do.

251
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,713
He has a scar
on the left side of his forehead.

252
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:47,175
It's about 3cm long
and not very noticeable.

253
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:51,346
-He does?
-I guess you don't remember.

254
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,599
When you become old like me,
you remember less and less.

255
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,601
Are you sure?

256
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,855
Things like a scar
make quite a difference.

257
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,357
It's so vivid in my mind.

258
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,026
While I was
giving Hyeon-su a ride in a tractor,

259
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,945
I made a sharp turn, and he fell.

260
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:11,116
That's when he hit his forehead
and got about seven stitches.

261
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,619
Please add a scar over here.

262
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,879
Your eyes play a big role in looking sad.

263
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,215
Let's take a look at a sad expression.

264
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,802
The ends of your lips
should face downward.

265
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,139
Your eyes should be out of focus.

266
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,228
I know it's really hard for you.
Thank you so much for agreeing

267
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,314
to be interviewed.

268
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,445
I've covered many cases as a reporter.

269
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,157
But this one in particular
breaks my heart.

270
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,993
I heard that the last person
my husband looked for

271
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,912
was you.

272
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,167
If only I had picked up my phone then…

273
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,255
I'm truly sorry.

274
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,258
No. It wasn't your fault.

275
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,844
Don't blame yourself.

276
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,606
I feel responsible.

277
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:29,194
Thank you for thinking that way.

278
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,617
Speaking of which…

279
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:41,665
your husband was attacked
at around 3:00 a.m.

280
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,878
Why do you think he remained
at the restaurant until that hour?

281
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,049
Had it been around two months?

282
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:58,139
Once a week, he'd stay up late,
coming up with a new menu.

283
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,726
The killer must've known that.

284
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,146
Who could it have been?

285
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,150
Other than me, I'm not sure.

286
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,486
You must find out.

287
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,156
I'm certain
there was someone else who knew.

288
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,339
I'm sure it's somewhere in here.

289
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,341
This isn't it.

290
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,761
Not this one either.

291
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,144
Here it is.

292
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,615
Yes, it's him. I'm sure of it.

293
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:02,954
Pardon? You have a photo
of Do Hyeon-su from five years ago?

294
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,877
Ma'am, hold on.

295
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,754
Could you elaborate on that?

296
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:15,216
My daughter, who lives in Seoul,
gave me a tour of the city that day.

297
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,637
So we went
from place to place taking photos.

298
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,099
And that's when Do Hyeon-su
was caught on my camera.

299
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,768
Are you positive that it's him?

300
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:28,855
My neighbor and I had different opinions.

301
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,400
But if you ask me,
I'm pretty sure it's him.

302
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:36,488
I've watched him grow up
ever since he was an infant.

303
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,573
There's someone here who can confirm it,

304
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,950
so I'd like you to send us the photo.

305
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,787
Of course, I will.

306
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,247
Goodness,

307
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,958
he looks exactly like his dad
when he was young.

308
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:53,421
Can you take a photo
with your phone and send it right now?

309
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,715
That's not right.

310
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,926
No, he looks totally different.

311
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,805
Take a look.
You think this looks like him?

312
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,307
Well…

313
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:08,895
I can't say it looks exactly like him.

314
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:12,273
But I can say it could be
Do Hyeon-su's half-brother.

315
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:16,152
Mr. Kim, are you sure
you even remember how he looked?

316
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,821
Of course.

317
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,116
I vividly remember his face
as if I met him yesterday.

318
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,204
Didn't you say
your memory was failing you?

319
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,124
Since he's young, he must be right.

320
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,837
Let's start with this
and touch it up as we go.

321
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,342
FORENSIC SCIENCE

322
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,552
Yes, Captain Lee.

323
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,389
Pardon? Okay, I'm on my way.

324
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,185
Thank you for today. You may leave now.

325
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,604
Are we done with that?

326
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,565
Yes. There's no need for one anymore.

327
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,078
I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help.

328
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:11,666
It doesn't matter how trivial it may be.
Call me if you remember anything.

329
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,501
I will.

330
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,087
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

331
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,843
The taxi.

332
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,137
Sir, the taxi.

333
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,681
Sorry?

334
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:31,311
Homi Village, Gagyeong-ri,
Namchon-myeon, Yeonju.

335
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,229
Ms. Oh Bok-ja, right?

336
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:37,192
I'll go to the post office
and send it by express delivery.

337
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,903
You don't have to come all the way here.

338
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,571
This is quite urgent.

339
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:45,575
You must not show that photo
to anyone until we get there.

340
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,453
Don't you worry about that.

341
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,746
Thank you.

342
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,875
I'll go with Detective Im.

343
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,592
Is something bothering you?

344
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,260
Pardon?

345
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,723
Your face is telling me
that something's not right.

346
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,354
It doesn't feel like
we're chasing Do Hyeon-su.

347
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,649
Rather, it feels like
he's dragging us around.

348
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,612
Is that guy not picking up his tumbler?

349
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:33,373
Sir, why aren't you picking up
your tumbler?

350
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,583
We'll discard it at the end of the day.

351
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:39,170
Goodness, I'm sorry, sir.
I've been busy working.

352
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,173
I'll make sure to drop by today.

353
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,176
Okay. Please keep it safe for me.

354
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,721
Okay. Thank you. Goodbye.

355
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:54,894
GANGSU POLICE STATION

356
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:55,979
Detective Choi,

357
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:59,023
did you check the dashcam footage
from the cars near New Sun Villa?

358
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,276
The ones I received this morning
were of no use.

359
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,361
I need to go out and search for more.

360
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,948
Smile, will you?

361
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:10,827
Everything will go smoothly
once we get our hands on his photo.

362
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,042
Do Hyeon-su.

363
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,296
Your phone.

364
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,385
Give me your phone.
Let me just make one call.

365
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,804
Mine's out of battery.

366
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,764
My wife is waiting, you know?

367
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,279
Do Hyeon-su.

368
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,365
Why are you so old-fashioned?

369
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:56,205
Here. This is a 256mb MP3 player.
You can keep it.

370
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,083
Throw away that piece of junk already.

371
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,586
I can't listen to this tape with that.

372
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,677
Do Hyeon-su?

373
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,015
You're him, aren't you?

374
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:21,105
Did you just say "Do Hyeon-su," sir?

375
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,442
Something doesn't feel right today.

376
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,486
Maybe it's because I didn't go with them.

377
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,072
They're just picking up a photo.
Nothing will happen.

378
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,844
Every time my husband
came home late, he'd take a taxi.

379
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,305
And it was the same one every time.

380
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,061
I'm glad you called.
You need to look into something.

381
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,981
-It's Igang Taxi Service.
-Hey, now is not the time.

382
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,650
I have good news and bad news.
What do you want to hear first?

383
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,319
Bad news? What is it?

384
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,155
You know Ms. Oh Bok-ja, right?

385
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,574
She has a photo of you
from five years ago.

386
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,204
Do you want to know what's worse?

387
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,290
What? What is it?

388
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:25,336
The police are on their way
to get that photo. Detective Cha is on it.

389
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,631
-What?
-Your wife is going to catch you.

390
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,935
Then what's the good news?

391
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,605
That I'm on your side.

392
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,441
Where are you right now?

393
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:50,945
How did the sketch go?

394
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,489
They remembered him differently,
so it didn't work out well.

395
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,159
We'll know once we get the photo.
Let's go.

396
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:03,833
GANGSU POLICE STATION

397
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,602
-Step on it.
-Hey.

398
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,856
Will we be able to get there
before they do?

399
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,400
-Yes, for sure.
-How so?

400
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,528
Because they'll follow traffic laws.

401
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,997
UNPROTECTED LEFT TURN

402
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,212
I can't believe we're visiting
the crime scene of a serial murderer.

403
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:50,880
Me neither.

404
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:55,176
Seven bodies were buried
in that tiny village.

405
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,512
How did none of the villagers know that?

406
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,263
They only found six bodies.

407
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:03,101
Right. The seventh victim's body
has yet to be found.

408
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:06,229
Maybe he found
a different place to bury it.

409
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,647
Where could that be?

410
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,566
They should at least find the body.

411
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,819
But why did Do Min-seok commit suicide?

412
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:16,864
If he hadn't, his crimes
wouldn't have been revealed.

413
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:22,453
This case came to light while the police
were investigating his suicide.

414
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:26,666
Beats me. It's impossible for humans
to understand a monster.

415
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,877
Did he even commit suicide?

416
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:34,298
Have you come up with a conspiracy theory?

417
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,302
Only the victims' right fingernails
were found at his workshop.

418
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,805
Where did the left fingernails go?

419
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,183
Did he split them with someone else?

420
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:47,895
For example…

421
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,149
with his son.

422
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,536
You're approaching a speed trap.

423
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,538
Please drive within the speed limit.

424
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,501
It'll be awesome
if we catch the killer first.

425
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:15,131
Both the police and the media
are only after Do Hyeon-su.

426
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,884
If a weekly reporter like me
ends up catching the culprit

427
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,594
and writes up an article about it…

428
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,679
Doesn't it sound amazing?

429
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,559
You're not listening, are you?

430
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,603
Why do you have my sister's necklace?

431
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,854
What?

432
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,858
My sister's necklace.

433
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,070
Oh, that?

434
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,073
I just…

435
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,826
It just happened to…

436
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,413
Hey, why is that hers?

437
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,624
I bought it for her, so it's mine.

438
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,001
She gave it back
when we broke up. So what?

439
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,296
I found it in one of my drawers.

440
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,466
I was going to fix it and sell it.
You got a problem?

441
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,719
-I threw it away.
-What?

442
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,848
-You have no right to--
-It's too cheap to sell anyway.

443
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,284
Hyeon-su.

444
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,287
By the way,

445
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:32,208
how did Do Hyeon-su
turn into Baek Hee-seong?

446
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,713
Is this an interview?

447
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,926
Forget about everyone else.
How did you fool your wife?

448
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,932
-Hey, Moo-jin.
-Yes? I'm listening.

449
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:49,934
I won't judge.

450
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,021
Ji-won doesn't know anything about me.

451
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,357
About my past

452
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,943
or how I'm not normal.

453
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,864
Do you really have no feelings for her?

454
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:08,452
They say couples develop a stronger bond
once they have a baby together.

455
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,125
Ji-won is someone that I absolutely need.

456
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,130
Because my father…

457
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,634
is afraid of her.

458
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,471
He can't get close to me

459
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,558
if she's nearby.

460
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,353
What are you on about?

461
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,440
You're scaring me.

462
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,860
I'll promise you one thing.

463
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,574
What? Hold on.

464
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,035
Why was that in my pocket?

465
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:54,040
Wait a minute. What are you doing?
Let me. Hold on.

466
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,750
You can't just delete all of them.

467
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,045
I have so many important interviews
in there. Don't erase them.

468
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,172
Damn it.

469
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:10,014
If you tell her what you know…

470
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,268
I may actually kill you.

471
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:23,652
Gosh, stop joking around.
That wasn't even funny.

472
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,405
I meant it.

473
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,816
GAGYEONG-RI

474
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:16,497
Now, there are more vacant houses
than occupied ones.

475
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,659
Come here! I said, come here!

476
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,870
Move!

477
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,581
Come here!

478
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,672
DO HYEON-SU

479
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:25,065
You're approaching your destination.
Turn right after 300m.

480
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,442
Here. Get ready.

481
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,852
OH BOK-JA

482
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:11,946
All right. We'll follow our plan.
You remember everything, right?

483
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,785
This is my last time explaining,
so listen up.

484
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,537
Okay.

485
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:23,666
First, I'll distract her.

486
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,167
-Ms. Oh!
-My goodness.

487
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,545
-Ms. Oh! It's been ages!
-Goodness.

488
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,421
-Here.
-Goodness, it's okay.

489
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:33,050
I'll tell her that I'm covering the case
and ask to see your photo.

490
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:36,136
Goodness. So this is it.

491
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,304
After that,

492
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,474
I'll text you the location of the photo.

493
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,017
IN THE DRAWER UNDERNEATH THE FLOWERS

494
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:45,437
Then I'll lure her out of the house
under the pretense

495
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,731
of welcoming the detectives from Seoul.

496
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,526
We should wait outside
since they're coming from Seoul.

497
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,653
Of course, we should.

498
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,951
In the meantime, you'll steal the photo.

499
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,830
No, you'll go fetch it in peace.

500
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,586
I'll prevent them from going inside.

501
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,046
While I buy some time,

502
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,299
you can…

503
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,262
get out of there easily.

504
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,183
Then we'll rendezvous as planned.

505
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,479
So? Simple, right?

506
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,358
What if she doesn't show you the photo?

507
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,945
What if you can't lure her out?

508
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,407
What if the detectives come in?

509
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:45,623
Do you have another idea?
If not, be quiet.

510
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,562
Hide in there.

511
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,119
Ma'am.

512
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,247
Ms. Oh.

513
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,211
It's me, Moo-jin. I'm a reporter in Seoul.

514
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,462
Kim Moo-jin.

515
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,340
Are you not in?

516
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,053
Ms. Oh.

517
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,599
Watch out…

518
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,893
-What?
-Watch out…

519
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:51,855
-You need to pee?
-Watch your back.

520
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,253
What's taking him so long?

521
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,980
Who are you?

522
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:18,233
-Do Hyeon-su.
-I don't know you.

523
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,611
Why are you doing this to me?

524
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:23,614
You may not know me,
but I'm sure you know Jung Mi-suk.

525
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:25,699
What?

526
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,118
Where is Jung Mi-suk?

527
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,164
-Jung Mi-suk?
-The police will be here soon.

528
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:35,083
We don't have time to waste.

529
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,546
Both you and I aren't fond of the police.

530
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,844
Doesn't that car look familiar?

531
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:49,723
-I think it's Mr. Kim's.
-How did he know about this place?

532
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:55,562
Let's meet without the police
getting involved. What do you say?

533
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:59,316
There's a nice bed and breakfast
near the fishing area.

534
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,235
I'll pick you up tonight in a taxi.

535
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,112
I've been looking forward
to our first date.

536
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,699
We should give each other
some time to get dolled up.

537
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,326
Don't you agree?

538
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,081
What do you want?

539
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,333
Ms. Oh Bok-ja, are you in?

540
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:20,420
Ms. Oh.

541
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,138
Do Hyeon-su!

542
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:08,176
-Mr. Kim!
-Detective Im.

543
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,846
-Sir.
-She's in there.

544
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:01,683
Let go!

545
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,921
Let go!

546
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,465
I said, let go!

547
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,928
Let go! I said, let go!

548
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:43,975
Let go!

549
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,394
Let go!

550
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,399
Do Hyeon-su! Stop right there!

551
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,485
Uncuff me!

552
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,423
Hello? Hey, where are you?

553
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,634
I almost died in there.

554
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,470
What happened?

555
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,973
Jung Mi-suk. Find out who she is.

556
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,808
He mentioned her name.

557
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,185
Jung Mi-suk?

558
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:30,188
That name rings a bell.

559
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,857
He asked me where she was.

560
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,317
She and I must have a connection.

561
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,905
Hello?

562
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,408
What a bastard.

563
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,119
Jung Mi-suk?

564
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,997
Jung Mi-suk…

565
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,538
Are you serious?
Do you know how worried sick I was?

566
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,540
Just uncuff me. I'm so humiliated.

567
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,084
Are you hurt?

568
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,045
No, I'm fine.

569
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:39,841
Look at the mess around you.
Are you sure you're not injured?

570
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:41,885
You didn't break any bones?

571
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:43,970
I'm fine.

572
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,641
-Just uncuff me.
-Geez.

573
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,977
Right. Is Ms. Oh okay?

574
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,230
Yes. She's just a bit shook up.

575
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,149
-She's not injured.
-Damn it.

576
00:53:56,775 --> 00:54:00,153
But the photo was stolen.

577
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,114
I should've caught him.

578
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,409
How did he know about the photo?

579
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,246
Who the hell is Do Hyeon-su?

580
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,665
It wasn't Do Hyeon-su.

581
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:13,792
What?

582
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,506
Which one's Do Hyeon-su?

583
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,510
I said, which one is he?

584
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:25,303
He didn't know how he looked?

585
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:28,515
One thing is certain.
The culprit is after Do Hyeon-su.

586
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,518
And in the most extreme way possible.

587
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,646
I don't think the culprit behind this…

588
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,231
It's not Do Hyeon-su.

589
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,840
There's a nice bed and breakfast
near the fishing area.

590
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,883
I'll pick you up tonight in a taxi.

591
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,390
Come on in.

592
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,645
-Let me know if you need anything.
-Okay.

593
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:16,688
Rest up, then.

594
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,485
GAGYEONG-RI VILLAGE HALL

595
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:06,571
Thank you so much for gathering here
at this late hour.

596
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:09,657
-It's fine.
-Of course, we should.

597
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,910
After what happened to Bok-ja?

598
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:14,829
Gosh, it's so terrifying.
How can we live here?

599
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,457
Is Do Hyeon-su really back?

600
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,877
See? I told you.

601
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,089
He's been possessed by a ghost
just like his father was.

602
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,548
What ghost?

603
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,717
We should've performed
more exorcisms back then.

604
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,677
-Ghost, my foot.
-You're right.

605
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:33,223
What kind of grudge
does he have against this village?

606
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,518
The person we're looking for
isn't Do Hyeon-su.

607
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:37,894
-What do you mean?
-What?

608
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:40,772
We're actually looking for someone
who's determined to find him.

609
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,441
Did anyone visit this village

610
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,652
and inquire
about Do Hyeon-su's whereabouts?

611
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:46,778
-Gosh.
-There were too many.

612
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:51,032
Everyone from the city looked for him.

613
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:53,952
-Right.
-What kinds of people?

614
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:56,704
-There were some TV producers.
-Right.

615
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,415
-Reporters.
-Right.

616
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,375
And writers as well.

617
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,961
-There were also your kind of people.
-Police.

618
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:05,839
-I mean, there were police officers too.
-Right.

619
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,841
Please think hard.

620
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:11,594
The culprit we're after
has deep resentment towards Do Hyeon-su.

621
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,513
How would we know something you don't?

622
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:16,975
That… That man.

623
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:19,102
-Who?
-Who are you talking about?

624
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,979
-That man!
-Who?

625
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:24,315
-That taxi driver.
-Goodness.

626
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,859
Taxi driver?

627
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,697
I found him.

628
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:34,951
Detective Oh worked hard to get
the dashcam footage, and it paid off.

629
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:37,328
I caught you.

630
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:42,792
What? No one got out.

631
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:46,546
He said he dropped him off
around New Sun Villa.

632
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:51,634
IM HO-JUN

633
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,430
-Yes?
-Sir.

634
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:58,475
It wasn't Do Hyeon-su. We were wrong.

635
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,894
What? What do you mean?

636
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:02,937
So…

637
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,273
-Is that Captain Lee?
-Yes.

638
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:12,322
Captain Lee, one of Do Min-seok's victims
hasn't been found yet.

639
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:15,158
Please look into her husband.

640
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,869
-I believe he's a taxi driver.
-A taxi driver?

641
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:21,080
IM HO-JUN

642
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:22,582
Elaborate.

643
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:27,629
They had found six out of
the seven victims and closed the case.

644
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:31,299
But the victim's husband didn't give up
and visited the village regularly.

645
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:34,344
He dug up all the areas
where the other bodies were found.

646
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:37,222
Mi-suk, I'll find you soon.

647
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:40,058
Please just wait a little while.

648
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:41,935
-Don't do that!
-Goodness!

649
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:44,521
-What are you doing right now?
-Let go!

650
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,193
-He looked very unstable.
-I need to find her!

651
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:54,197
He believed that Do Hyeon-su
was an accomplice and obsessed over him.

652
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,659
He believes Do Hyeon-su
knows where his wife is buried.

653
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:00,036
And Captain Lee.

654
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:05,291
I have no idea how he knew
about the photo Ms. Oh had.

655
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:10,004
I'm afraid our information
has been leaking.

656
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:30,733
And Nam Sun-gil feared Do Hyeon-su
until the moment he got killed.

657
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:34,070
But what's this photo of Do Hyeon-su?

658
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:37,240
This is his middle school
graduation photo.

659
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:41,953
In 2002, when Do Hyeon-su was 18,
he murdered the village head and fled.

660
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:43,955
And he set his house on fire.

661
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:50,295
VACANT

662
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,574
EXCLUSIVE: CHINESE RESTAURANT
OWNER NAM DIES…

663
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,622
MISSING PERSON

664
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,127
JUNG MI-SUK
27, FEMALE

665
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,597
VICTIM IDENTIFICATION REPORT

666
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,559
VICTIM IDENTIFICATION REPORT
JUNG MI-SUK

667
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,228
HUSBAND: PARK GYEONG-CHUN

668
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,897
OCCUPATION: TAXI DRIVER

669
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,065
Taxi driver.

670
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:13,795
So Do Hyeon-su was an accomplice
in the serial killing?

671
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:15,380
With his father, at that?

672
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:18,883
Mi-suk and I each had this made
as a couple item.

673
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:21,427
At Do Min-seok's workshop,

674
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,847
they found her phone but not this.

675
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:27,725
But according to what you said,

676
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,355
Do Hyeon-su had this.

677
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,317
-Leave this to the police--
-The police…

678
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,404
are not willing to catch Do Hyeon-su.

679
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:48,121
Unless he commits a heinous crime
that becomes the center of attention.

680
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,789
Wake up, will you?

681
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:53,167
To be blunt, what's the point
of digging up a rotten body?

682
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:55,086
What difference will it make?

683
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:58,548
Anyway, I truly appreciate
your help today.

684
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:02,552
-What did I help you with?
-You told me about Do Hyeon-su.

685
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:07,932
And I think it'll help me greatly.

686
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:29,078
MOTHER

687
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:46,929
Eun-ha, why are you crying?

688
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:50,683
All right. Dad's on the phone,
so stop crying now.

689
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:56,689
Why did you leave me while I was asleep?

690
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:04,405
Come pick up your daddy's girl!

691
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,741
Eun-ha.

692
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:11,078
Something came up, so I had no choice.

693
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,582
Will you be here soon?

694
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,418
Yes, I will.

695
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:20,171
Is Mom coming with you?

696
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,804
Dad, hurry up.

697
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:30,598
I miss you.

698
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,479
Okay, I'll be there as soon as I can.

699
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:39,941
Eun-ha.

700
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:41,818
I'll see you soon.

701
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:25,736
Ma'am.

702
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:28,281
Please take a look at this.

703
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,878
We found this in the warehouse back there.

704
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:44,255
We were wondering if it was yours.

705
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:04,108
GAGYEONG HAEOREUM BED AND BREAKFAST

706
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:25,212
And this is my gift for you.

707
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:28,966
I love it. Thank you.

708
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:31,427
I had your initials engraved on it.

709
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:13,010
I think my husband is the one
who was abducted.

710
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:16,055
You saw how Park Gyeong-chun
murdered Nam Sun-gil.

711
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:18,516
Jae-seop, what am I supposed to do?

712
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:20,434
Park Gyeong-chun
is still near the village.

713
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:22,937
Take the road along the reservoir.
You can catch up with him.

714
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:27,692
Killing me won't fill the holes
in your imagination.

715
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:30,611
I can't prove something I don't know.

716
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,573
Where is Jung Mi-suk?

717
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:36,534
Help!

718
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:43,249
