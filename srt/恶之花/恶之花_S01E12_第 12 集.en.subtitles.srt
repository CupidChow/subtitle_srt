1
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,619
I'M GOING TO BED FIRST
TAKE YOUR MEDICATION

2
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,620
Hee-seong.

3
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,374
Mom.

4
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,837
Why are you home?

5
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,132
What are you doing?

6
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,054
It wasn't my fault.

7
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,349
He suddenly jumped in front of my car.

8
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,436
And Dad wouldn't pick up his phone.

9
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,397
So?

10
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,608
You're

11
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,653
going to bury him…

12
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,323
here?

13
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,534
Then what should I do?

14
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,331
What?

15
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:34,797
Mom.

16
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,887
Did you go through my room?

17
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,695
Let's talk later.

18
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,533
Go inside first. It's pouring.

19
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,592
Hee-seong, I'm scared.

20
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,095
I'm terrified.

21
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,768
I can't handle this.

22
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,617
You shouldn't

23
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,787
have been home.

24
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,517
Everyone has a secret.

25
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,274
And

26
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,445
there are also those who know
about others' secrets…

27
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,367
and those who want to know about them.

28
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,373
One.

29
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,459
Two.

30
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,136
Do I need to count you too?

31
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,649
Ma'am.

32
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:44,654
Can you really not read lips?

33
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,998
If you keep looking away
while I'm talking,

34
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,377
it's going to upset me.

35
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:16,978
Have you ever told anyone else

36
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:18,980
about our family?

37
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:40,168
I've never told anyone.
There's no one to tell anyway.

38
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,466
Can I trust you?

39
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,275
It was in Hee-seong car.

40
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:35,056
INCOMING CALL

41
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,228
Hello?

42
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,397
Have you gone insane? Where's the money?

43
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,233
Who is this?

44
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,654
You're not Baek Hee-seong.

45
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,782
Hee-seong can't answer the phone
right now.

46
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,203
I'm his father. Who is this?

47
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,458
Your son owes me some money.

48
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,586
And

49
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,631
I met him once to give him the money.

50
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,508
What was the money for?

51
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,221
Hee-seong hired him to find someone.

52
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,307
Don't tell me it's Do Hae-su.

53
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,226
Perhaps.

54
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,526
And does that man, Yeom Sang-cheol,
know about Hee-seong's condition?

55
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,736
No.

56
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,531
I told him he was studying abroad.

57
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:34,991
So?

58
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,327
Did you tell him to get rid of Hyeon-su?

59
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,748
Have you gone insane?

60
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,208
That bastard

61
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,295
Hyeon-su has been poking around.

62
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,549
He'll bring us all down if we do nothing.
What do you want me to do?

63
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,217
Still, how could you?

64
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,761
There is no middle ground.

65
00:09:56,804 --> 00:10:00,099
Either he lives or we do.

66
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,226
It's one or the other.

67
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,316
WHERE THE RISING STAR STAYS

68
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,045
Are you alone?

69
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,546
Why?

70
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,591
Do you think you can
take me down if I'm alone?

71
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:35,760
What?

72
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,888
I'll be escorting the famous Do Hyeon-su.

73
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,932
Maybe I should've brought
the special forces with me.

74
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:42,892
Jae-seop.

75
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,357
Give me a cup of coffee, will you?

76
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,392
Mr. Do Hyeon-su, our informant.

77
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,897
First of all, I'd like to say thank you

78
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,150
for tipping us off.

79
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,070
I know it wasn't easy.

80
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:40,491
Thanks to you, we brought down
Yeom Sang-cheol and his entire gang.

81
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,996
Did he give you the information
on Do Min-seok's accomplice?

82
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,667
No.

83
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:54,672
Yeom Sang-cheol found out that
I was bugging him, so things went awry.

84
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,552
You'll have to question him yourself.

85
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,441
Now, I'll ask
the wanted criminal Do Hyeon-su

86
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,528
a question as a detective.

87
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,324
Do Hyeon-su.

88
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,705
Why did you kill Kwon Seong-bok,
the Gagyeong-ri village head,

89
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,541
in 2002?

90
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,672
Are you sure?

91
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,760
Are you sure Detective Cha
found out about everything?

92
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,767
Detective Cha.

93
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,772
He's left.

94
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,273
Sorry?

95
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,651
Do Hyeon-su has left.

96
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,538
DETECTIVE CHA JI-WON

97
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,082
What are you going to say to her?

98
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,918
-Give that back.
-No.

99
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,381
Where are you going?

100
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,051
-What are you planning to do?
-I'm going to turn myself in.

101
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,513
You must've had a motive for your murder.

102
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,015
What was it?

103
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,351
-There wasn't--
-He didn't do it.

104
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:34,939
What?

105
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,358
You didn't get your story straight?

106
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,493
I had no motive.

107
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,123
On August 30, 2002, at 7:00 a.m.,

108
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,835
Kwon Seong-bok,
Gagyeong-ri's village head,

109
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,711
was found in his own farming storage.

110
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:02,174
He was fatally wounded
when his carotid was sliced by a weapon.

111
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,719
Then he bled to death.
And there were signs of struggle.

112
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:11,976
A button from Sesin High School's
male uniform was found around him.

113
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,646
Move. I said, move.

114
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,526
Let's think about this first.
Okay, Hae-su?

115
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,781
I'm just trying to pay for what I did,
so who are you to stop me?

116
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,367
This is between Hyeon-su and his wife.

117
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,244
Doing this won't solve anything.

118
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:31,954
If you're doing this

119
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,457
because you feel guilty
about killing that man,

120
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,418
then I won't stop you.

121
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,588
Guilty?

122
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,716
Why would I be?

123
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,594
You have no idea what he did to Hyeon-su.

124
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,222
Come here! I said, come here!

125
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,141
-Move!
-Stop!

126
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,058
Come here!

127
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,936
He forced Hyeon-su to receive
an exorcism every three days.

128
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,772
He claimed that our father's evil spirit
possessed my brother.

129
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,692
He gathered all the furious neighbors.

130
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,361
Then he encouraged them to vent at him.

131
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,031
Hyeon-su was only 18!

132
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,076
In the end,

133
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:16,415
Hyeon-su himself believed
that he was possessed by an evil spirit.

134
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,337
Hyeon-su, what's wrong?

135
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,884
Hyeon-su.

136
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,386
-Hae-su.
-Yes?

137
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,222
I can see our father.

138
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,350
What?

139
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,939
He's standing over there
and talking to me.

140
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,697
Hyeon-su.

141
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:52,159
You're wrong. There's no one there.

142
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,162
The village head was right.

143
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,835
I'm going to turn out like my father.

144
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,548
Moo-jin.

145
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,927
You were just like the others.

146
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,471
You were no different.

147
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:17,101
You turned your back on him
just like the others.

148
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,939
Everyone in the village
that Do Min-seok had destroyed

149
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,276
did Hyeon-su wrong. Everyone.

150
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,280
You're right.

151
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:32,950
You are.

152
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,285
Everyone turned into monsters,

153
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,747
except for Hyeon-su.

154
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,711
Do Hyeon-su, the key suspect,

155
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,796
fled on the night of the murder.

156
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,591
He set his house on fire
to get rid of all traces of himself

157
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,760
including fingerprints and photos

158
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,888
when he was only 18.

159
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,559
But

160
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:03,731
why did he leave the murder weapon
near a brook where it was easy to find?

161
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,652
On top of that, he left it
inside his backpack with his textbook

162
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,487
that had his name on it.

163
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,574
As if he wanted everyone to know.

164
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:25,419
I also found something interesting
in the witness statements.

165
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,632
Everyone said he was capable
of committing the murder.

166
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,259
But one person

167
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,179
said otherwise.

168
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,764
And it was…

169
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,515
I killed him.

170
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,315
I…

171
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,193
killed him.

172
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,717
Thank you for the coffee,

173
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,513
Mr. Baek Hee-seong.

174
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,691
This is for the coffee.

175
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,504
Jae-seop!

176
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,095
You're just leaving like this?

177
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,556
Why? Are you going to feed me breakfast?

178
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,475
What does this mean?

179
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,645
Why are you leaving

180
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,981
without arresting him?

181
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,527
I'm not a fool.

182
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,907
You keep insisting that he's innocent,
yet you let him say he's guilty.

183
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,535
I think I know why.

184
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,206
This is a tragedy about a brother
and sister who were shunned

185
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,375
by the entire world overnight.

186
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,379
Like you,
I don't want to meddle in it either.

187
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,631
That's all.

188
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,219
Bye.

189
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,462
What will happen to us?

190
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,385
I can't figure out what his intentions are
or what he's scheming.

191
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,847
I had no clue.

192
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,768
You're wrong.

193
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,188
Then?

194
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,649
He is…

195
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,861
no longer interested in Do Hyeon-su.

196
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,948
Why not?

197
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,033
Because…

198
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,328
Do Hyeon-su isn't a bad person.

199
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,464
Dad!

200
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,218
Dad.

201
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:06,473
I've really, really, really missed you.

202
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,897
Is this a reunion
between North and South Korea?

203
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,536
Is something going on?

204
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,913
No, not at all.

205
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,421
Goodness,
I've never seen him cry like that.

206
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,976
-Hi, Eun-ha.
-Hello.

207
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,185
-Hello.
-Hello.

208
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:54,938
Eun-ha.

209
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:59,109
Listen to your teacher
and have a great day.

210
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:03,739
You better not cry again
because you miss me, okay?

211
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,198
You're an adult.

212
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,784
Okay.

213
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,959
Let's go inside.

214
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,087
-Eun-ha.
-Yes?

215
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,631
I…

216
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:23,884
love you

217
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:25,969
so much.

218
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:30,057
Me too. Dad, I love you.

219
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,438
I gave this some thought.

220
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:41,151
Resigning right now
would only burden our team.

221
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,447
Once the team finds
a replacement for me, I'll resign then.

222
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,159
I know it'll be really tough for you,

223
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,328
but please understand.

224
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,331
There are three important factors.

225
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,376
Number one. Your life depends on this.

226
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,503
Take your time and think it through.

227
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:03,507
Number two. Think harder.

228
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,759
And number three,

229
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:10,430
we have so much work piled up,
so hurry over and work your ass off.

230
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:33,120
What was going through your mind
in front of the supermarket earlier?

231
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,582
I thought about the day

232
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,752
I first embraced Eun-ha
after she was born.

233
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,840
I remember that day too.

234
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,427
You were so nervous since it was
your first time holding a baby.

235
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,847
Since you entered my life,

236
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,100
every single moment
has been a first for me.

237
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,153
GANGSU POLICE STATION

238
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,032
-Will you be okay?
-Of course.

239
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,577
See you later.

240
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,035
Good morning.

241
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:56,912
"Good morning"?

242
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,872
Are you serious?

243
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,874
Are you teasing me right now?

244
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,627
Sir, she hasn't been informed
of the situation yet.

245
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,670
Her kid fell ill yesterday,

246
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,256
so I told her to go home
right after the raid.

247
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,385
Yeom Sang-cheol fled from the ER
while he was being taken to the station.

248
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,303
What?

249
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,638
What are you doing? Sit down.

250
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,145
Good work.

251
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,649
We're almost done. Hang in there.

252
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,276
-Yes, sir.
-Is your kid all right?

253
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,695
Which one is it? The oldest or youngest?

254
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,490
Stop acting like you know, sir.

255
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:34,699
She has one child.

256
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,537
I knew. I did know that.

257
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,917
-How old was your son again?
-It's a daughter.

258
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,087
All right, let's have one each.

259
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,340
It was intense yesterday,
so let's take care of our health today.

260
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,384
Have one each. Here.

261
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:57,180
Can't you just give us two each?

262
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,932
Gosh, you're so stingy.

263
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:03,061
Right, you should have two.
You look much older than the rest.

264
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,815
Jeez.

265
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,526
-Where were we again?
-The dedicated team.

266
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:12,988
The dedicated team will carry out
a comprehensive investigation

267
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,281
on human trafficking.

268
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:17,909
We'll only focus on apprehending
Yeom and Do Min-seok's accomplice.

269
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,744
Arresting Yeom is more urgent.

270
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,039
He always carries around
this burner phone.

271
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:26,376
His men testified that he trafficked
his victims only through that phone.

272
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,586
BAEK HEE-SEONG

273
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,509
Hello?

274
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,678
I'm in front of your station.

275
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,723
I'd like to talk to you
without Ji-won's knowing.

276
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:46,479
GANGSU POLICE STATION

277
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:52,777
Think carefully.

278
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,447
Who did you tell your secret?

279
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,326
Who do you think sold you out to me?

280
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,202
Who would that be?

281
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:12,047
If you came here
to say thank you, forget it.

282
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,258
I lied to you back there.

283
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,637
I didn't want Ji-won to know.

284
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,181
Lied about what?

285
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,393
I lied about how things went awry
after Yeom Sang-cheol found out

286
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,354
that I was bugging him.

287
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,649
He got a call in the middle of our deal.

288
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,194
Someone tipped him off

289
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,239
that I was working with the police.

290
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,450
"Someone"?

291
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,244
That person had been waiting
for me to meet with Yeom.

292
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,872
They wanted me dead.

293
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:47,707
So who's that person?

294
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,794
Let's move first.

295
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:55,590
The shocking truth about the Yeonju
Serial Murder Case has been revealed.

296
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,760
During the raid
on a human trafficking ring last night,

297
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,429
the police arrested five gang members.

298
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:05,725
Since 2002, the ring has been hunting for
victims through their employment agency.

299
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,436
The victims have been trafficked
throughout the country

300
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,647
for prostitution and forced labor.

301
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,109
Also, it's alleged that the serial killer
Do Min-seok was also their client.

302
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,486
This news has shocked everyone.

303
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:21,616
Meanwhile, Yeom Sang-cheol, the leader,
fled while he was escorted by the police.

304
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,661
This is a photo of Yeom Sang-cheol
who is wanted.

305
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:25,912
WANTED

306
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,340
Mom.

307
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,969
The world has changed a lot.

308
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,763
You need to exercise.

309
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,778
I missed three World Cups.

310
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,572
That's…

311
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,616
not important.

312
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:09,622
I even went all the way
to Gwanghwamun to cheer once.

313
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,546
You should come with me next time.

314
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,840
I'll take you.

315
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,469
Okay.

316
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,390
If I'm still alive, that is.

317
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,272
Dad failed.

318
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,901
It's only a matter of time…

319
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,031
before Do Hyeon-su finds out.

320
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,461
I'll try to visit Hyeon-su,

321
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,130
so don't worry too much, okay?

322
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:05,136
And quit talking
about turning yourself in.

323
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,264
I get a mini heart attack
every time you say that.

324
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,686
I put you on the spot back there.

325
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,104
I apologize.

326
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,942
No, you didn't. It's just that

327
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,528
I like you.

328
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,364
I want you to care about me

329
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:27,450
about an eighth
of how much you care about Hyeon-su.

330
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,871
There's a taxi.

331
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:41,589
Don't skip your meals.
Call me if you don't want to eat alone.

332
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,882
Okay.

333
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,969
Text me when you get home.
I'm going to buy a phone right now.

334
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,222
Let me go home. Close the door.

335
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,140
Okay.

336
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,562
Sir, please go to Cheonil-dong.
Please drop her off safely.

337
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,158
Sir, don't go to Cheonil-dong.

338
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,455
Please go to Gangsu Police Station.

339
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:23,673
So you think Yeom is up to something
other than fleeing?

340
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,594
The person who put him up to killing me
promised to pay him.

341
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,099
It seems like you have an idea
who that person might be.

342
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,812
Among those who knew
that I was dealing with Yeom,

343
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,814
there's one person who wants me dead

344
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,943
and is rich enough
to convince Yeom with money.

345
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,946
I'll give you ten times this money.

346
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,741
Leave without anyone knowing.

347
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,034
There's only one person.

348
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:58,333
But then again, this is only a guess.
I need to confirm it.

349
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,584
Confirm?

350
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,669
If I'm right,

351
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,798
we'll be able to catch Yeom
as soon as I confirm this.

352
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,802
I'm going to offer them myself
the golden opportunity

353
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:11,971
to kill me.

354
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,268
Of course,

355
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:21,856
I can't pull off this plan
without your help.

356
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,098
REPORTER KIM

357
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,650
-Hey, Moo-jin.
-I bought a phone.

358
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,528
You're the first person
I called with this.

359
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,114
I just wanted you to know that.

360
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,242
-Thank you.
-Moo-jin.

361
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,244
Yes?

362
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,413
You're the only friend Hyeon-su has.

363
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,666
What are you talking about?

364
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:26,212
I came to see Detective Cha.
I'm going to turn myself in.

365
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,630
What?

366
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,842
-I'm sorry.
-Hae-su. Do Hae-su!

367
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,767
This is Na Jin-hui, Yeom's girlfriend.

368
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,353
Isn't she our best bet?

369
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:46,691
-Shouldn't we start a stakeout?
-Their relationship is out in the open.

370
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,527
It wouldn't be effective
to post all of our men there.

371
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,903
Where is Detective Choi?

372
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,489
He went to the Jaerim Control Center.

373
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,496
Detective Cha, she was looking for you.

374
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:18,681
I'm here to keep my promise

375
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:22,393
to tell you everything
when the time is right.

376
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,608
-I am--
-Ms. Do Hae-su.

377
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,154
It slipped my mind.

378
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,699
"Ms. Do Hae-su"?

379
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,869
I think she's Do Hyeon-su's older sister.

380
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,913
I had some questions,

381
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,916
so I asked her to stop by
when she had time.

382
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,879
Ho-jun, where is it?

383
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,215
Where's what?

384
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,925
The list of Yeom's victims.

385
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:56,928
Here you go.

386
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,432
Will you come outside with me?

387
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:19,700
I…

388
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,411
heard…

389
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:27,166
that you found out everything
about Hyeon-su.

390
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:32,964
Hyeon-su…

391
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:38,302
He had to live as Baek Hee-seong

392
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,680
because of me.

393
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,267
The one responsible
for the Gagyeong-ri village head's death…

394
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,187
is me.

395
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,692
He took the blame for me.

396
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:57,530
He's not a dangerous person
like you believe him to be.

397
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,698
Ms. Do.

398
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,121
Do Hyeon-su…

399
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:09,709
is no longer a boy
you have to take care of.

400
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,421
He's the father of my child.

401
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,673
He's my family.

402
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,050
He's my husband.

403
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,221
Now,

404
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,392
he has a wife who will stay by his side…

405
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,896
no matter what.

406
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,237
He said you were kindhearted.

407
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,866
Whenever something bad happened,

408
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:45,077
he said he was always
the first one to be suspected.

409
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,833
Then you'd go around
trying to clear his name.

410
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,713
He said he didn't care much,

411
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,091
but you would get upset, cry and scream.

412
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,095
Since you were kindhearted,

413
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,682
he said you wouldn't have been able
to endure all the hate

414
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,851
and that was why he did it.

415
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,814
Because it didn't affect him.

416
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:24,659
Turning yourself in may take his name
off the wanted criminal list.

417
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:31,374
But I know
that he'll feel indebted to you forever.

418
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,668
And I don't want that.

419
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,087
So

420
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,215
just accept his decision.

421
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,468
And…

422
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,056
you should live
feeling indebted to him instead.

423
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,190
I'm just awful, aren't I?

424
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,993
Officially, this is what happened today.

425
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,954
I wondered if Do Min-seok
was guilty of more crimes.

426
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,791
So I asked you in to see if you recognized

427
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,918
any of Yeom's victims.

428
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,671
And you said

429
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,757
you couldn't recognize anyone.

430
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,262
Okay, then.

431
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,265
Goodbye.

432
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,440
Thank you.

433
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,324
For seeing him for who he truly is.

434
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,705
I will repay you at all costs.

435
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,459
I promise to repay you

436
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,253
before I die.

437
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,176
Ji-won…

438
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,637
is probably barely hanging on…

439
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,642
and carrying all the burden
I've put on her shoulders.

440
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,027
I'm scared…

441
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,198
that one day everything will…

442
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,327
just fall apart

443
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:34,872
all at once.

444
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,212
So I'm asking you again.

445
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,756
-About us meeting today--
-I get it.

446
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,175
How many times do I have to tell you?

447
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,261
Please.

448
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,267
How could I nonchalantly
tell her that someone's trying

449
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,977
to kill her husband?

450
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,358
Thank you.

451
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,278
Once we're done with this task,

452
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:08,781
I'll tell her myself.

453
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,785
Anyway, are you
really not going to tell me

454
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,037
who wants you dead?

455
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,754
I still need

456
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,465
to be careful for now.

457
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,468
ILSIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
DIRECTOR

458
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,972
What? You want money?

459
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,474
I'll be doing you a favor in return.

460
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,059
I will get rid of Do Hyeon-su.

461
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:40,271
I will kill him at all costs,
and you have my word!

462
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,607
You failed to do so on your own turf.

463
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,736
And yet, you believe you can kill him
while running away as a fugitive?

464
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:49,613
That's why…

465
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:55,119
you should just lure him
somewhere perfect to kill him.

466
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:59,290
Lie low for the time being.
Don't make any rash moves.

467
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:04,962
HEE-SEONG

468
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,591
Hey, Hyeon-su.

469
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,801
How did it go yesterday?

470
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,722
You don't have to worry. I'm fine.

471
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:20,102
Okay. That's a relief. It really is.

472
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,898
Are you free tomorrow evening?

473
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:28,444
I should tell you
about everything that went down.

474
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,988
Okay, that sounds good.

475
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:36,577
I'll go over to your house by 8:00 p.m.
It'd be nice to see Mother too.

476
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,454
All right.

477
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,540
Hey, Hyeon-su.

478
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,627
Why haven't you been answering my calls?

479
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,545
I've been busy.

480
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,339
Hae-su went to see your wife.

481
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,551
She went there right now
to turn herself in.

482
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:57,890
You should call her.
She'll listen to you, right?

483
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,392
Leave.

484
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,728
What?

485
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,689
Leave. You're distracting me.

486
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,985
It's your sister I'm talking about.
Are you going to just sit still and watch?

487
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,706
Go see her.

488
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:30,297
She'll be fine. Nothing probably happened.

489
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,691
You really don't care about me, do you?

490
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,361
You never thought
about how I'd feel, did you?

491
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,366
I don't know why you think
you can interrogate me like this.

492
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,294
Why are you looking at me like that?

493
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,297
We liked each other for a bit
when we were young.

494
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,466
Aren't you the weird one for still feeling
the same way after 20 years?

495
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:25,894
What are you doing?

496
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:31,734
Isn't this…

497
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,448
Why do you have this?

498
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:38,991
Next time,

499
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,744
throw it somewhere I can't find.

500
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,456
I'm sorry

501
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:49,376
that I've been feeling the same way
ever since I first saw you

502
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,420
in fourth grade.

503
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:58,177
I'll try not to like you.

504
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:34,922
Having trouble sleeping?

505
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:39,635
I'm sorry.

506
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,513
I must've woken you up.

507
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,352
Why are you out here instead of sleeping?

508
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,359
Just because.

509
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,158
Just…

510
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,037
seeing myself lying in bed with you

511
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,374
felt so strange.

512
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,378
So I couldn't sleep.

513
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,314
I was meaning to ask you something,

514
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,861
but I couldn't bring myself to.

515
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,030
What is it?

516
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,284
How was…

517
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:48,537
your day?

518
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:00,841
It was…

519
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,011
quite all right.

520
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:27,409
To our house?

521
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,870
Do Hyeon-su is coming here?

522
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:33,499
He's going to tell me
about everything that has happened.

523
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,254
But why is he coming here?

524
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,381
He doesn't

525
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,260
like to be seen in public.

526
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:48,388
It's nothing unusual.

527
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,599
So Hee-seong,

528
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,185
be careful tonight.

529
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,606
He mustn't know
that you've regained consciousness.

530
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,737
Then what about Do Hae-su?

531
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,992
That's something I can take care of.

532
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,912
Yeom Sang-cheol is the issue.

533
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,792
He should neither get apprehended

534
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:20,087
nor be allowed to do as he pleases.

535
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:25,133
But we need him
in order to get rid of Hyeon-su.

536
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,762
Don't do anything.

537
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,181
I'll take care of it.

538
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,685
More importantly…

539
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,900
They're materials
on overseas language training.

540
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,194
Take your time and read them.

541
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,703
ENGLISH LANGUAGE TRAINING IN BRITAIN

542
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,428
What is it?

543
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,180
Dad.

544
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,851
Ears that can hear are important,

545
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,147
but eyes that can see
are just as important.

546
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,565
What do you mean?

547
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,193
It's nothing.

548
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:31,992
I don't know anything.

549
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,370
Mr. Yeom is the only one
who manages the client list.

550
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,872
I really don't know.

551
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,041
I understand.

552
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:44,129
But if he doesn't get caught,
it'll only work against you.

553
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,592
Frankly speaking,
we're not interested in you.

554
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,846
We just need to connect
Yeom Sang-cheol to the Yeonju case.

555
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:58,435
Are there any places
where he could be hiding?

556
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,563
Perhaps, somewhere we don't know.

557
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,281
He received a call

558
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:14,368
while making a deal with Do Hyeon-su.

559
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:18,413
And the caller wanted Do Hyeon-su dead.

560
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:23,377
In return, they offered to pay him.

561
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:35,973
Calm down.

562
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,600
Let's talk somewhere quiet.

563
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,436
Someone wants my husband dead,

564
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,772
so how do you expect me to calm down?

565
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,857
I know. I already knew.

566
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:49,361
You already knew?

567
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,447
Let's go somewhere else first.

568
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:56,994
How could you not tell me
about something this important?

569
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,496
Your husband made me promise
not to tell you.

570
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,792
He said you wouldn't be able to handle it.

571
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:07,421
He was scared
you'd break down because of him.

572
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,184
Come on in.

573
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,817
A medical volunteer team?

574
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,737
He was wearing a bracelet
for Ilsin University Hospital's team.

575
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:36,825
So I asked Director Baek for documents
on the volunteer team during that time.

576
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:40,370
I thought looking at some photos
could help me remember better.

577
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,374
When you met with Director Baek,

578
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,169
did you feel anything strange?

579
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:53,133
Well… I already saw
his photo online before we met.

580
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,178
I'm sure he looked much younger

581
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,182
and slimmer about 20 years ago than now.

582
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,149
Do they look alike?

583
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,863
I'm not sure. My memory is foggy.

584
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:19,201
I'll try hypnotherapy again tomorrow.

585
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,370
There's no use.

586
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,916
Your memory is probably already tainted

587
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,544
because I pegged him as the culprit.

588
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,339
I wasn't

589
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,133
of much help, was I?

590
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,304
It's okay.

591
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,014
I was going

592
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,600
to confirm it myself today.

593
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:45,102
Confirm it?

594
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:47,562
How?

595
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,659
Shouldn't we ask
Do Hyeon-su for help again?

596
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:08,917
There's a chance we may succeed,
so we should at least try it out.

597
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:12,462
Let's end the meeting here.
Good work, everyone.

598
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:22,931
Hey.

599
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,935
It's raining. Should I go pick you up?

600
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,459
You were an angel.

601
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,172
And I tainted you.

602
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,644
I have something to tell you.

603
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,201
I'd like to quit.

604
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:28,121
Thank you for treating me
so kindly all these years.

605
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,833
I'd appreciate it
if you could wire my severance pay

606
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:34,544
and the NDA fee by the end of next week.

607
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,506
-Please stay healthy.
-"NDA fee"?

608
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,260
I know more

609
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,972
than you think I do.

610
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,408
Hi.

611
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,787
Hold on.

612
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,211
-Let's go for a walk.
-Let's go on a date.

613
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,257
We read each other's mind.

614
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:22,926
Let's go.

615
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,561
That was also a lie.

616
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,024
My favorite movie.

617
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,278
-Life Is Beautiful?
-Yes.

618
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,406
I just wanted to impress you.

619
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:51,246
I also lied about
not being able to eat raw foods.

620
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:55,250
You said it was because you once had

621
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,711
an upset stomach after eating raw fish.

622
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,214
Actually,

623
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:07,595
it's because my father
used to smell like that when I was young.

624
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,559
And…

625
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:19,357
Enough with your confessions.

626
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,112
Let's talk about something else.

627
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,199
Let's talk about ordinary things.

628
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:30,702
Such as?

629
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,131
Things like this.

630
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:00,857
Are you okay?

631
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:03,902
Yes, I am.

632
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:07,864
Are you really…

633
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:10,825
okay?

634
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,536
I am.

635
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,039
I'm fine, so why do you keep asking?

636
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,715
To be honest, I'm not okay at all.

637
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,220
I'm terrified that something
might happen again.

638
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,476
I feel so sorry for my colleagues
because I'm lying to them.

639
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,605
And I wanted to blame
your sister for what she did,

640
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,316
but I didn't because I knew it was wrong.

641
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,903
Why do you have to live in hiding forever?

642
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,239
It's so unfair.

643
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,549
Do you know what the saddest part is?

644
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:14,431
That you kept another secret from me.

645
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:23,773
What

646
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,693
do you know?

647
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,321
What is it that you know?

648
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,074
You stabbed your own son.

649
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:37,912
And in order to cover it up,
you made someone else live as him.

650
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:42,667
It was the man your son hit with his car.

651
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,591
Sun-yeong.

652
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,887
-Don't do this.
-Goodbye.

653
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:02,103
Sun-yeong, I thought we were family.

654
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,898
I considered you as one.

655
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,401
No. You're not going anywhere.

656
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,613
We got along so well.

657
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,908
I even hired a divorce attorney for you.

658
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,577
You said you were eternally grateful.

659
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,455
So how could you do this?

660
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:22,123
How could you?

661
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,482
Mom.

662
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,622
What did you just do?

663
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:10,171
You're all crazy.

664
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:14,842
If you don't pay me,
I will expose everything.

665
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,136
You have until next week.

666
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,048
I knew you weren't reliable…

667
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:58,845
Ms. Park Sun-yeong.

668
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,343
MY HUSBAND

669
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:28,059
Honey. Please come home right now.

670
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:31,270
I really don't know what to do.

671
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,598
Dad.

672
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,769
Mom cut her forehead.

673
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:15,356
She should get it stitched up right now.

674
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:17,775
Okay.

675
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:31,831
I couldn't think
of any other way to protect you.

676
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:31,182
Why?

677
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:33,851
Why did you do it?

678
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,273
Why?

679
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,029
Because she knew too much.

680
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:52,829
What were you thinking?

681
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:55,248
What are you going to do now?

682
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,836
You promised me.

683
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:03,798
You said you'd do as I said
if you could be Baek Hee-seong again.

684
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:05,967
Do you

685
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:09,011
really want all of us dead?

686
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:11,639
Is that it?

687
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,020
You said you wanted
to live right for once.

688
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:21,774
You said you wanted
to live an ordinary life!

689
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,319
Let's take care of this.

690
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:37,331
Are you all right?

691
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:40,877
She threatened us first.

692
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:46,465
She had something on us
and was going to tie us down forever.

693
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,470
She stabbed me in the back first.

694
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:57,685
If it wasn't for Hee-seong, I could've…

695
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:02,940
Really… At that moment,

696
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,444
I despised her so much
that I wanted to kill her.

697
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:09,822
I will

698
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:12,575
fix Hee-seong.

699
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,662
I promise

700
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:19,540
to fix him.

701
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:22,627
But first…

702
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:26,631
let's cover this up.

703
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:36,349
How could we

704
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:39,268
possibly cover this up?

705
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:42,855
I have…

706
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:49,236
an idea.

707
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:01,707
Yes, Hee-seong.

708
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,752
I'm sorry,

709
01:06:04,835 --> 01:06:07,421
but I don't think I can make it tonight.

710
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:09,882
An urgent business trip came up.

711
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,592
Really?

712
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:15,346
That can't be helped, then.
We'll have dinner next time.

713
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:17,390
I have a favor to ask.

714
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:19,308
What is it?

715
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:23,396
I'm going to Gapyeong
and will be spending the night there.

716
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:27,316
I was wondering if I could stay
at your vacation home.

717
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,318
Sure.

718
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:32,488
Of course, you can. It's our family's.

719
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,450
What time will you arrive there?

720
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,538
I'll tell the keeper
to get the place ready.

721
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,542
I think it'll be around 10:00 p.m.

722
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:47,128
All right. 10:00 p.m.

723
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:49,088
I got it.

724
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:11,318
This is your chance.

725
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,612
You must succeed.

726
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:17,324
At 10:00 p.m. today.

727
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:21,287
351 Gyeongjinsan-gil, Gapyeong.

728
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:23,581
That's my vacation home.

729
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:26,042
BAEK HEE-SEONG

730
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:27,668
It'll be at 10:00 p.m. today.

731
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:31,380
351 Gyeongjinsan-gil, Gapyeong.

732
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:34,050
It's Baek Man-u's vacation home.

733
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,722
This is what I'm planning to do.

734
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:44,852
Are you saying that Father…

735
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:49,273
I mean, Director Baek
is trying to kill you?

736
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:52,610
I'm sure of it.

737
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:57,198
So if Yeom Sang-cheol receives
this information from him,

738
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:00,785
then he will definitely
show up tonight, right?

739
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:07,458
Detective Choi and the local police
will stake out the vacation home.

740
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:09,877
If they catch Yeom there,

741
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,005
we'll be able to confirm
Director Baek is behind it.

742
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:23,015
I'm going to go to his house
in Hanjeong-dong and pressure him…

743
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:26,185
so that he'll confess…

744
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:29,230
everything himself.

745
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:33,234
Ji-won.

746
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:36,612
If the police arrest Director Baek…

747
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,491
my true identity will

748
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:43,244
be revealed to the world.

749
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:47,373
I've been prepared for this.
I'm not afraid.

750
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:53,712
I'll get going now.

751
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,301
Honey.

752
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,101
You didn't forget
that I'm a detective, did you?

753
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,106
I have the right to arrest people
on the spot.

754
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:54,250
It's Do Hyeon-su.

755
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:57,294
He's here.

756
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:00,774
So what and how much do you know?

757
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:03,694
Then what and how much are you hiding?

758
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:08,574
If this is the game Do Hyeon-su is
playing, we should get him a gift too.

759
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:11,118
How did you find out about my family?
Who are you?

760
01:12:12,202 --> 01:12:14,830
-Why would you meet Yeom Sang-cheol?
-He has to kill me to get paid.

761
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:16,415
So he won't ignore my call.

762
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:19,668
So are you saying the culprit doesn't have
an ID card? How do we interpret this?

763
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:24,006
If he did this right after Yeom Sang-cheol
fled, it means he wants to provoke us.

764
01:12:24,089 --> 01:12:26,091
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

765
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:31,055
