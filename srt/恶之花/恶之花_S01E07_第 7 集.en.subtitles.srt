1
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:36,202
SUMMER OF 2005

2
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,547
What's wrong?

3
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,722
Catch him. Go catch him!

4
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,774
Why did you do that?

5
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,194
Did you have to live like that?

6
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,572
You had no choice.
That's what it is, right?

7
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,744
Just give me one thing.
I don't want anything else.

8
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,333
A reason to forgive you.

9
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,221
What's wrong?

10
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,145
I had a dream.

11
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,272
What dream?

12
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,733
Just a dream.

13
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,904
But why are you up so early?

14
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,823
You're the one who woke up late.

15
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,783
What time is it?

16
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,952
It's 8:55 a.m.

17
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,038
What?

18
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,750
-Eun-ha should--
-I'll take her.

19
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,170
What made you oversleep, by the way?

20
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,799
Ever since I came back home,
I've been so sleepy.

21
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,262
I guess I'm finally feeling relaxed.

22
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,931
You've been through a lot.

23
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,477
But it feels like nothing happened.

24
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,105
Since nothing has changed.

25
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:09,494
Oh, right. I got you a little something.
I forgot to give you yesterday.

26
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,955
To celebrate you getting out
of the hospital.

27
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,333
What is this?

28
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,544
I couldn't find your watch.

29
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,963
I asked forensics,
but they didn't find it.

30
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,384
This isn't as nice as what you had before,

31
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,469
but I hope you like it.

32
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,223
I love it.

33
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,018
Make sure not to lose this one.

34
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,481
Now there's something
that's changed. Right?

35
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,661
Wait. Drink this before you leave.

36
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,832
Hold on. Here.

37
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,377
-Eun-ha, sit here and drink it.
-Okay.

38
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,589
-Is it good?
-It's delicious.

39
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,096
Oh, right. About the lock
to the basement of my workshop.

40
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,889
It was broken.

41
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,601
I broke it.

42
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,688
Didn't I tell you?

43
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,190
No, you didn't.

44
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,235
You know my friend, Seon-mi.

45
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,612
She was looking to buy a baby walker.

46
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,739
So I thought of giving her
what Eun-ha used to use.

47
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,616
But you were in the hospital,

48
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,161
and I didn't know where the key was.

49
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,665
I see.

50
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,127
Wasn't the basement dirty?

51
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,256
You'd cleaned it up already.

52
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,720
-Eun-ha, are you done?
-Yes.

53
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,639
Let's go. I'll see you later.

54
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,560
-Eun-ha, see you.
-Bye.

55
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,618
I need my husband's
family relation certificate.

56
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,660
Do you need one copy?

57
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,165
I got a tip-off saying
there was an accomplice

58
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,083
in the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

59
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:26,631
Today, I'm going to reveal
the accomplice's voice.

60
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,174
-Gosh.
-Wow.

61
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,594
It got 1.5 million views in a few hours.
Can you believe it?

62
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,306
And there are
over 2,000 articles about it.

63
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,682
My gosh.

64
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,019
What did I tell you?
I said it would be huge.

65
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:45,024
Gosh, my phone has been
ringing off the hook since the morning.

66
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,150
Hello?

67
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,236
Hello, Kim Moo-jin speaking.

68
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,657
Oh, hello. Thank you.

69
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,824
FAMILY RELATION CERTIFICATE

70
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,701
FATHER: BAEK MAN-U
MOTHER: GONG MI-JA

71
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,997
Do Hyeon-su has lived as Baek Hee-seong
for at least 14 years.

72
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,584
And Baek Hee-seong's parents
have actively cooperated.

73
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,254
Why?

74
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:11,217
Gosh, is this the voice
of Do Min-seok, the serial killer?

75
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,429
No. It's Do Min-seok's accomplice's voice.

76
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,391
His accomplice? Was there an accomplice?

77
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:21,185
Yes. But they didn't even know
there was an accomplice until now.

78
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,062
Isn't it shocking?

79
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,313
Let's hear it again.

80
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,525
REPORTER KIM MOO-JIN REVEALS
THE ACCOMPLICE'S VOICE

81
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,864
Hey, lady. You better not be nosy.

82
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,076
You are not the only one who saw me.

83
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,828
I saw you as well.

84
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,747
You drive a small, red car.

85
00:09:55,303 --> 00:10:00,725
MAY 12 2002, 2:30 A.M.

86
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:05,771
Excuse me.

87
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:17,199
I'm sorry. It's 100 percent my fault.

88
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,872
So the witness doesn't remember
the culprit's face at all?

89
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,707
It was late at night,

90
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,752
and he was wearing a hat over his face.

91
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,754
So she couldn't see his face clearly.

92
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,798
I think it's just a little scratch.

93
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:37,219
I'd really appreciate it
if you agreed to settle.

94
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,556
The witness was driving
under the influence at that time.

95
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,643
So she didn't want
to call the insurance company.

96
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,645
And he used the accident

97
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,772
as an excuse to get the witness's number.

98
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,776
JANG YEONG-HUI

99
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,594
"Honey, why did you drink so much
when you can't hold your liquor?"

100
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:23,391
The culprit said this
and took the woman back into his car.

101
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,897
And was she the victim, Jung Mi-suk?

102
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,357
That's right.

103
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,321
GYEONGGI 58 GA 3194

104
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:42,034
The witness went straight to the police
station and reported it to the police.

105
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,203
The police ran the license plate number

106
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:47,873
and investigated Do Min-seok,
but he had an airtight alibi.

107
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:52,378
That's when Do Hyeon-su,
Do Min-seok's son, appeared.

108
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,591
He stated that he watched a movie with
his father at the time of the incident

109
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,511
and submitted two movie tickets
as evidence.

110
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:04,974
Meanwhile, the witness' statement
was discredited because she was drunk.

111
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,393
So ironically, he was acquitted,

112
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,396
and the witness' driver's license
was revoked.

113
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,899
But in only two weeks,
things suddenly turned around.

114
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:18,195
That's right.
Do Min-seok committed suicide.

115
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,322
And during the investigation,

116
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:24,201
the police found the thumbnails
and belongings of the victims

117
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,913
including Jung Mi-suk
at Do Min-seok's workshop.

118
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,292
That's how the Yeonju Serial Murder Case

119
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,127
was revealed to the world.

120
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,338
And the case was disposed
as no right of arraignment.

121
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,259
And right after that, Do Hyeon-su
killed the village head

122
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,261
and ran away under cover of night.

123
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:46,223
How do you think things would've
panned out if the police considered

124
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:50,269
the possibility that Do Min-seok
and his son might be accomplices

125
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,896
during the kidnapping of Jung Mi-suk?

126
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,981
What's more disappointing is

127
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,525
that the police went to meet the witness

128
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:01,030
only after Do Hyeon-su was identified
as a suspect in a murder case.

129
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,282
But, by then…

130
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,743
She was being threatened
by the accomplice.

131
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,244
Exactly.

132
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,456
The witness recanted
all the statements she had given.

133
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,083
It put the police in an awkward position,

134
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:17,296
so they decided to cover it up
instead of admitting to their negligence.

135
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,634
Then let's listen to
the culprit's voice again.

136
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,886
Please listen carefully.

137
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:29,099
Hey, lady. You better not be nosy.

138
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,353
You are not the only one who saw me.

139
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,814
I saw you as well.

140
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,317
You drive a small, red car.

141
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,196
I know where you work and where you live.

142
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,617
You should be careful since you have kids.

143
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:52,164
Have you heard about the Gagyeong-ri
Village Head Murder Case?

144
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,085
Do you know why he was killed?

145
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,214
Because he was nosy.

146
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,593
That worthless bastard
didn't know his place.

147
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,558
It's obvious. The son was
the accomplice, don't you think so?

148
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,853
That's it for today. Thank you, Mr. Kim.

149
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,656
I'm sorry.

150
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,518
I changed the lock.

151
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,021
I want to leave it unlocked,
but I'm worried about Eun-ha.

152
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,189
The stairs are too steep.

153
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,692
The Yeonju Serial Murder Case…

154
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,695
The reporter, Kim Moo-jin
made an exclusive report.

155
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,573
And the case was disposed
as no right of arraignment.

156
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:11,535
And right after that, Do Hyeon-su
killed the village head

157
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,162
and ran away under cover of night.

158
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,291
How do you think things would've
panned out if the police considered…

159
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,335
I guess he's a successful reporter.

160
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,128
He's on TV.

161
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,839
He says there was an accomplice
in the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

162
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,882
What's more…

163
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,717
Did you hear the voice?

164
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,970
It's going viral online.

165
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,931
…identified as a suspect in a murder.

166
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,724
The accomplice's voice?

167
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:37,019
-She was threatened by the accomplice.
-Do you want to hear it?

168
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,982
No. It will only creep me out.

169
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,776
It put the police in an awkward position.

170
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,403
-Can I change the channel?
-So they decided to cover it up

171
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,238
instead of admitting to their negligence.

172
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,621
-Honey.
-Yes?

173
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,957
What are you doing tomorrow?

174
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,251
It's always the same for me.

175
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,296
Then free up some time
for me in the afternoon.

176
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,884
For what? a date?

177
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,803
Something like that.

178
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,554
I'd love that.

179
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,725
I'm going to lay down now, then.

180
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,810
Okay.

181
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,881
Hey, lady. You better not be nosy.

182
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,926
You are not the only one who saw me.

183
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,262
I saw you as well.

184
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,098
-Kim Moo-jin!
-Kim Moo-jin!

185
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,560
-Kim Moo-jin!
-Kim Moo-jin!

186
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,021
KIM MOO-JIN
PROFILE

187
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,982
-Kim Moo-jin!
-Attention, please.

188
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,817
I have an important announcement.

189
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,487
The number of Kim Moo-jin's
followers on social media

190
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,406
is over 200,000.

191
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:17,828
-It's 200,000!
-Hey, Moo-jin!

192
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,496
BAEK HEE-SEONG

193
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,499
-It's 200,000!
-Hang on.

194
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,252
Hang on a second.

195
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,589
What? What do you want?

196
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,843
Your exclusive implied that
Do Hyeon-su was the accomplice.

197
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,097
It's a reasonable doubt.
What are you going to do?

198
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,308
Change the direction.

199
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,478
If the statements of Do Hyeon-su
and the witness are all true,

200
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,812
there might be a third party--

201
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,356
Who are you to push me around?

202
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,235
Do you think
I'm your servant or something?

203
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,239
Why do you keep ordering me around?

204
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,826
Pull yourself together and listen.

205
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,708
I listened to the accomplice's voice
over and over again.

206
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:08,295
-And there's something that bothers me.
-You listen to me.

207
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,215
You mark what I say.

208
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,133
Go ahead.

209
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,639
From now on,
this case isn't about your life.

210
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,933
It's about mine.

211
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,560
I'll help you.

212
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,563
Don't be ridiculous.

213
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,691
You know what?

214
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,152
You're the prime suspect.

215
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,371
Hey, Moo-jin.

216
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:44,957
You

217
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,334
must trust me.

218
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:48,919
Why?

219
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,339
Because you have me by the balls?

220
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,384
Or what? Are you going to
lock me up in your basement

221
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,010
and threaten me again?

222
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,013
Hey, do whatever you want.

223
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:04,601
Just bring it on.
Let's see who will be knocked down first.

224
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,941
I don't trust you.

225
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,580
GANGSU POLICE STATION

226
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,165
As you might know,

227
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,626
the HQ was considering a reinvestigation
because of the Park Gyeong-chun case.

228
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,337
And they will probably rush even more
because of the recording.

229
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,131
Which team should take it?

230
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,593
Team One and Two are busy
with the voice phishing

231
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,178
and arson cases already.

232
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,391
U-cheol, what is your team
working on right now?

233
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,729
These are the pictures for the lettuce
theft case in Bangjeong-dong.

234
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:52,649
And these are the ones for the pepper
theft case which happened this week.

235
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,862
Judging by the similarity between
the cases, it seems to be…

236
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,031
the same thief…

237
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,499
Chief.

238
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,126
Hello, Chief.

239
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,130
You little…

240
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,884
Won't you investigate
the lettuce theft case?

241
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,385
It's been 15 days already.

242
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:24,097
Ho-jun, here's what I think.

243
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:25,515
Yes.

244
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:32,397
Gosh, I seriously don't care
about it at all. What do I do?

245
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,857
What?

246
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:38,779
-Right.
-What? Do you have any idea?

247
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,906
Let's have lettuce wraps for lunch.

248
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,200
My mouth is watering.

249
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,244
Ji-won. Why don't we have…

250
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,496
Where is she?

251
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,249
COUNSELING OFFICE
DEEP SPRING CHILDREN CLINIC

252
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:54,795
This is the counseling center.
We found the material you asked for.

253
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,673
DO HYEON-SU

254
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:08,141
PATIENT: DO HYEON-SU
DEPRESSION AND AGGRESSION

255
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,605
Hyeon-su.

256
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,860
Did you really throw
your neighbor's dog into the well?

257
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,537
Yes.

258
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,808
What do you think trust is?

259
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,396
Trust is about keeping a promise.

260
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,608
Even if a promise seems
inefficient and unreasonable,

261
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:02,321
you just keep it, no matter what.
That's what trust is about.

262
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,538
I took care of the problem
without killing Park Gyeong-chun,

263
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,915
so I thought you'd be glad.

264
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,710
But…

265
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,629
you're mad at me.

266
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:20,630
That's…

267
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,468
a different issue.

268
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,773
Hey, lady. You better not be nosy.

269
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,361
You are not the only one who saw me.

270
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,156
I saw you as well.

271
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,784
You drive a small, red car.

272
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,118
I know where you work--

273
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,163
Is this you?

274
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,583
Tell me. Is it you?

275
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,591
No.

276
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:05,884
Well,

277
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,054
I don't believe you.

278
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,727
This is all because
you broke your promise.

279
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,855
How am I supposed to trust you now?

280
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,276
I don't trust you.

281
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,240
Hyeon-su.

282
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,118
I want to trust you.

283
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,840
I really thought you'd be glad

284
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,926
that I didn't kill Park Gyeong-chun.

285
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,345
Speaking of which,

286
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:55,392
I'd like you to make a promise once again.

287
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,814
If you

288
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:05,318
come close to getting
your true identity exposed again,

289
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,113
you will have to leave.

290
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,325
To where no one can find you.

291
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,996
For everyone's sake.

292
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,624
If you do that for us,

293
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,961
I'll take care of your wife and kid
for the rest of my life.

294
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,798
I just want to avoid the worst.

295
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,177
I bet you know what the worst is.

296
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,557
I understand.

297
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:38,935
Okay.

298
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,813
I believe you.

299
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,746
Hey, wake up.

300
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,957
You don't have time for this.

301
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,085
Get lost. I have 200,000 followers.

302
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,254
How dare you!

303
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,340
Hey, you're getting another exclusive.

304
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,175
She only wants to talk to you.

305
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:13,011
Gosh, who is it now?

306
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,554
Hey! My gosh.

307
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,184
Hey, look over there.

308
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,691
She's Do Hae-su.

309
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,531
What an unexpected piece of good luck.

310
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,698
Hush!

311
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,494
Why?

312
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,333
Ms. Kang. How do I look now?

313
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,545
You're a mess.

314
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,719
Ms. Kang. I'm really sorry,

315
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,681
but please get me a new shirt
and wet wipes.

316
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,140
What are you talking about?

317
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:07,023
The thing is, there's something
between Do Hae-su and me.

318
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,191
What is it?

319
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,236
-First…
-First?

320
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,406
She's my first love.

321
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,660
Really?

322
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,079
I can't meet her looking like this.

323
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,415
Hey, how long has it been?

324
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,250
It's been 17 years.

325
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,669
My goodness.

326
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:33,425
Hey. Gosh, this isn't just right.

327
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,551
I can't let you do this.

328
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,637
Please help me, Ms. Kang.

329
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,600
It's okay. Tell me.

330
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,941
What I wanted to get rid of
was Kim, the dog's owner.

331
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,901
He's rude and mean.

332
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,696
But I couldn't kill a person.

333
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,282
It'd be harder
to get rid of a person's body.

334
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:02,871
Hyeon-su.

335
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,046
Take a look at this drawing.

336
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,051
How do you think this girl is feeling?

337
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,511
Why do you think she's crying?

338
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,141
I don't know.

339
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,231
How old was he back then?

340
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,650
He was 13.

341
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,986
So would you say

342
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,864
Do Hyeon-su was born

343
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,159
with antisocial personality disorder?

344
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,164
Would you like to watch this video too?

345
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,087
Go ahead and draw.

346
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,887
Do you see the cassette player
in the video?

347
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,264
Yes.

348
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,477
-Hyeon-su.
-Let go of me!

349
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,146
-Calm down, Hyeon-su.
-Ma'am.

350
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,190
-Let go of me!
-Ma'am, help.

351
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,526
He was usually quiet and gentle,

352
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:18,405
but he lost his reason whenever
the cassette player was involved.

353
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,367
What on earth is that?

354
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,619
The thing is, no one knows.

355
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,413
Even his family.

356
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:03,366
Hey, Ji-won. You know what? The stolen
lettuce leaves were found in the trash.

357
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,409
Ho-jun, later.

358
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,287
But…

359
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:16,671
Mr. Lee, why do you think the culprit
threw away the lettuce they stole?

360
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,089
I have a meeting to attend.

361
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,092
It's about the reinvestigation
of the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

362
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,260
Is our station on the case?

363
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,095
Later.

364
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,181
Wait…

365
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,934
Why is everyone saying that?

366
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,209
This is Cha Ji-won.

367
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,752
Hello, Detective.

368
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,213
When you gave me Do Hyeon-su's bag…

369
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,590
I can't hear you well.

370
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,133
When you gave me the bag,

371
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:07,514
you said Nam Sun-gil thought
Do Hyeon-su would come back for the bag.

372
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:09,933
Why is that?

373
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,685
The cassette player in the bag.

374
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:16,231
He said Do Hyeon-su
had an obsession with it.

375
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,485
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.

376
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,697
I'm at a temple for a spiritual ritual

377
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,658
-for Sun-gil, so…
-Hello?

378
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,159
Ms. Lee Gang-ok.

379
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,009
So you've been in Seoul all along?

380
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:49,097
It's strange that
we never ran across each other.

381
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,598
Because there are 10 million people.

382
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,684
You're right.

383
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,728
Seoul is such a big city.

384
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:57,730
I'm so proud.

385
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,407
By the way, you've changed a lot.

386
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,285
-Have I?
-Yes.

387
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,788
You used to be always
surrounded by friends.

388
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,332
Even fallen leaves
on the streets made you laugh.

389
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:21,462
How should I put it?
You were like a popular idol artist.

390
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,886
How would I live like an idol artist
when my father killed seven people?

391
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,640
You're right.

392
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,809
That's just…

393
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:37,937
Oh, right.

394
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,899
Is your work going well?
I heard you do prosthetic makeup.

395
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:44,235
I don't know much about it,
but it sounds fun.

396
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,071
I got fired.

397
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,616
I see.

398
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:54,871
Moo-jin. Shall we go now?

399
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,041
Already? Are you busy?

400
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,250
That's not it.

401
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,588
Do you see the guy
who's reading a book behind me?

402
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,007
Don't look straight at him.

403
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,017
I see him. Who is he?

404
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,771
He's a reporter. He thinks
I'm harboring Hyeon-su.

405
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,522
I've been seeing him quite often.

406
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,191
Hey, it's stalking.

407
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,527
I don't want to give him
anything newsworthy. Let's just go.

408
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,613
But we shouldn't let this slide.

409
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:33,493
I want to be alone with you.
I have something important to tell you.

410
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,121
Alone with me?

411
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,417
Have you heard

412
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,170
about the Gagyeong-ri Village Head
Murder Case?

413
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,632
Do you know why he was killed?

414
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,302
Because he was nosy.

415
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,306
That worthless bastard
didn't know his place.

416
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,269
Do you know why he got killed?

417
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,898
Because he was nosy.

418
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:05,566
That worthless--

419
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,282
Do you know why he got killed?

420
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,203
Because he was nosy.

421
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:21,666
That worthless bastard
didn't know his place.

422
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,255
Do you remember this?

423
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:33,011
This is what Do Hyeon-su
used to carry around.

424
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,137
Yes.

425
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,849
I heard Do Hyeon-su was
quite obsessed with this.

426
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,685
And there's a recording tape in this.

427
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,021
Do you know what it is about?

428
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,694
Hyeon-su.

429
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,656
What are you doing out here in the rain?
Come in and have a drink.

430
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,330
What is it that you listen to every day?

431
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:05,877
Let me listen to it too.

432
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,089
Hey! Let go of it.

433
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,841
You let go first.

434
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,931
You crazy bastard.

435
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:23,770
If you touch it again,
I'll really break your arm.

436
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,231
I wanted to fire him,

437
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,151
but he was good at his job
when he only got paid 300,000 won…

438
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:37,075
Anyway, whenever he was listening to this,

439
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:42,622
he had a strange look on the face
as if he was possessed by something.

440
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:46,459
He lost his reason whenever
the cassette player was involved.

441
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,505
Sir.

442
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,550
Actually, I'm here to ask you a favor.

443
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,054
MIJA PHARMACY

444
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,055
Hello…

445
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:03,184
-Eun-ha, be nice to your grandma.
-Okay.

446
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,230
What do you think you're doing now?

447
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:10,525
I have some work to do,
so I'd like you to look after her.

448
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,276
I don't want to.

449
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,488
And have dinner with her.
I'll pick her up at eight.

450
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,365
All right, then.

451
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,452
I'm glad that we're sharing the childcare.

452
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,539
Wait.

453
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,085
What? How rude she is.

454
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,965
What should I do with you?

455
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:38,886
Grandma said blood is thicker than water,

456
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,472
so you will get attached to me.

457
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,141
What?

458
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,310
I'll study by myself while you work.

459
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,994
MATHEMATICS, GRADE 3

460
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,079
What is this?

461
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,292
This isn't for your age. It's too soon.

462
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,835
But I can solve those.

463
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,295
Did your mom make you do it?

464
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:16,424
Does she punish you
when you don't? Does she hit you?

465
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,509
No, I just do it because I want.

466
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,514
You're not supposed to do this.
It makes you crazy.

467
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,726
You and your mom will go insane
because of this.

468
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:33,024
Grandma, you're scaring me.
I want to go home.

469
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:36,194
Don't cry. I'm doing this for you.

470
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,160
Please stop crying.

471
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:48,289
What do you want me to do?

472
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,335
I want… I want a tart.

473
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,212
What?

474
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:57,965
I want an egg tart.

475
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,222
Do you know why he was killed?

476
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,767
Because he was nosy.

477
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:12,730
That worthless bastard
didn't know his place.

478
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,255
Do you know why he got killed?

479
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,340
THE CULPRIT'S VOICE
AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT

480
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,050
Because he was nosy.

481
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,763
That worthless bastard
didn't know his place.

482
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:53,729
Hey.

483
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,858
Have a seat. We need to talk.

484
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,540
Sit.

485
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:15,918
Okay.

486
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,053
What is that bag?

487
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:28,973
Do Hyeon-su's bag.

488
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,270
Nam Sun-gil had it before he died.

489
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,564
Luckily, it fell into my hands.

490
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,987
But what does it have to do with you?

491
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,823
I'm going to catch Do Hyeon-su.

492
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:54,957
By yourself?

493
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,835
Yes. The case
isn't under our jurisdiction.

494
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:06,469
How are you going to catch him
only with this bag?

495
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,014
That's why I need your help.

496
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,287
Take a look at it.

497
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,101
I can be like you.

498
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:01,232
I can deceive you
without batting an eyelid.

499
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,529
I bet Do Hyeon-su is still metal crafting.

500
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,448
When he worked at the Chinese restaurant,

501
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:12,243
he said he'd save up enough money
to open his own workshop.

502
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,913
He made stuff from time to time
so he wouldn't lose his touch.

503
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:20,000
Even people who didn't know much about
metal crafting could tell he was good.

504
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,629
If you ask the association for help,

505
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:27,133
we might be able to find craftsmen who
made products that look like the drawings.

506
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,018
That's impossible.

507
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:43,149
Without checking his actual artworks,
you can't find him

508
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,942
only with some drawings.

509
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:50,406
We don't even know if he makes
big products or small ones.

510
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,408
And we don't know
anything about his habits.

511
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,120
We can't even tell
what kind of material he uses.

512
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,208
So I was wondering

513
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,044
if you could go to Do Min-seok's
workshop with me.

514
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,219
What?

515
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,139
Do Hyeon-su would spend many days
stuck in the workshop.

516
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,557
He even skipped his school.

517
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,810
I saw the news the other day.

518
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,271
There were a lot of artworks
all over his workshop.

519
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,322
You freed up your afternoon, right?

520
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,324
Yes.

521
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,952
Let's just think it's a date.

522
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,413
Sure.

523
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,042
I'll go get the car.
Get ready and come out.

524
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,249
Hurry and finish it. I should get back
to the pharmacy soon.

525
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,125
Okay.

526
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,469
No. Take your time.
You might have an upset stomach.

527
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,221
Okay.

528
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:44,144
Well, about what I did with your workbook…

529
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:48,691
I won't tell Dad.
I don't want Dad to scold you.

530
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,485
Why would he scold me?

531
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,063
Why are you trying so hard?

532
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:29,607
What?

533
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,109
To catch Do Hyeon-su.

534
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,571
Everyone is talking about him.

535
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,948
They think he's the accomplice
in the Yeonju Serial Murder.

536
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,869
If I catch him,
I'll get a special promotion,

537
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,413
and my career will be smooth sailing.

538
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:49,543
That's surprising. I thought
you weren't interested in success.

539
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,089
Who wouldn't be interested in success?

540
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,258
I should grab an opportunity when I can.

541
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,229
This is it. Come in.

542
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:14,818
Wear these.

543
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,196
Come in.

544
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:21,742
I couldn't think of anywhere but my place.

545
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,160
Where we could talk alone.

546
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,288
-I see. It's okay.
-Good.

547
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:30,668
Here. Have a seat here.

548
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,671
Make yourself comfortable.

549
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,304
Are you hungry? It's almost dinner time.

550
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,598
-I'm not hungry.
-It won't take long.

551
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:45,683
What about pasta?

552
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,268
-Moo-jin, I'm not hungry.
-I have some wine.

553
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:53,691
You see, my uncle runs
a big winery in Argentina.

554
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:57,569
So he sends me some wine once in a while.

555
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,197
Argentine wines have

556
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:05,327
the appropriate level
of bitterness and sweetness.

557
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,079
So you're doing well.

558
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,125
-I'm glad.
-I should buy my uncle dinner sometime.

559
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:17,881
Drink this while you wait.

560
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,300
Okay. Thank you.

561
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:23,262
I'll make you dinner quickly.
Would you like some music?

562
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,200
To tell you the truth…

563
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:48,996
every once in a while…

564
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,249
No, I thought of you quite often.

565
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:59,840
I mean, I think you're the biggest victim.

566
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,719
Because of your dad and Do Hyeon-su…

567
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,765
You're just an ordinary person.

568
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,726
I have no prejudice against you.

569
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,104
And about what I said when we broke up,

570
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,355
I didn't mean it.

571
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,705
The voice isn't Hyeon-su's.

572
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,959
-What?
-The accomplice's voice.

573
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,045
It's not Hyeon-su's.

574
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,312
Do you still want to cover up for him?

575
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,235
Do you think
he'll be grateful to you if you do this?

576
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,612
No.

577
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,948
Your brother

578
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:09,451
doesn't even care about you.
He's living well by himself.

579
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,622
Hyeon-su wouldn't have said such a thing.

580
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,333
Say what?

581
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:26,844
Because…

582
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,810
I killed him.

583
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:38,856
What?

584
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,109
The real culprit who killed
the village head in Gagyeong-ri…

585
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,115
is me.

586
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,332
PRIVATE PROPERTY
AUTHORIZED PERSONS ONLY

587
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:41,209
I feel like once we go in there,

588
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,004
we won't be able to come back out.

589
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:08,904
Hurry and follow me.

590
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,614
Hurry.

591
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,992
My gosh. Stand here.

592
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,334
Once you become this tall,
I'll find Mom for you.

593
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,710
Take a look.

594
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:28,966
What should you do to be this tall?
You should eat a lot.

595
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:32,552
If you don't eat well because Mom's away,
you won't grow tall.

596
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,762
Right?

597
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:35,722
Do you understand?

598
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:40,143
Hae-su, why are you mad at me?

599
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,271
I'm not mad. I'm worried about you.

600
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,857
Do Hyeon-su. Hyeon-su!

601
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:04,042
Whatever Dad tells you, just say yes.

602
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:07,045
Unless you want to transcribe a book
in the basement.

603
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,257
Okay? Let's go.

604
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,395
What are you doing?

605
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,065
Coming.

606
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,070
It's locked. We can't…

607
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,332
It's here.

608
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,697
Do you think Do Hyeon-su made this?

609
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,576
Is this enough to tell his signature?

610
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:09,960
This is too rough.

611
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,589
It seems pretty exquisite to me.

612
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:16,466
This is a wax carving.

613
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,802
The metal wasn't carved directly.

614
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:22,472
I mean, you carve wax
which is a lot softer than metal

615
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,142
to make a plaster mold and cast this.

616
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,855
Do you see the fine lines here?

617
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,273
They're from a file.

618
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:33,942
And you can see it's asymmetrical here.

619
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,988
That's because he was bad at filing.

620
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,574
He just made this to show off.

621
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:45,036
Right. This might be his signature.

622
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,247
Lame filing.

623
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:50,709
It has no commercial value.

624
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:56,256
He was quite young back then.
He might have improved a lot.

625
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:58,675
I don't know.

626
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,803
No one can be sure about that.

627
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,311
This is disappointing.

628
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,564
We came all the way here for nothing.

629
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,198
Actually, there's another place
I want to check out.

630
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,953
The crime scene.

631
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:30,707
The basement.

632
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,714
For what?

633
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,760
If you are not comfortable with it,
you can stay in the car. I'll go alone.

634
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,261
No.

635
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,266
Let's go.

636
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,589
It's the smell of blood.

637
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:05,093
It doesn't go away unless
it's cleaned with hydrogen peroxide.

638
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,198
How does this voice sound to you?

639
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,533
To me, it sounds really sad.

640
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,912
I think she was crying.

641
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:25,340
What is this?

642
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,385
It's from Do Hyeon-su's bag.

643
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,933
Why are you playing it now?

644
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,519
It's a trigger for Do Hyeon-su.

645
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,689
Do Hyeon-su was usually gentle and quiet,

646
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:45,485
but he suddenly became violent
whenever he listened to this tape.

647
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:50,115
But no one knows
where Do Hyeon-su got this from

648
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:53,576
or what this recording is about.

649
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:59,165
This must have been recorded at a place

650
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,877
where the unspeakable thing happened.

651
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,134
I believe this is the place.

652
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:14,013
You think so?

653
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:30,029
When did Do Min-seok
start murdering people?

654
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,032
I can't even imagine it.

655
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,911
Who knows?

656
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,623
Do Min-seok could've made his young son

657
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:44,252
deliver food and water
to the victims who were locked in here.

658
00:57:56,973 --> 00:58:00,602
I want to get out of here, Ji-won.

659
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:05,857
Do Hyeon-su might have recalled
what he did listening to this voice.

660
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,358
Vividly.

661
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,156
It would've been a sweet moment for him.

662
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,868
And he lost his reason
when he was interrupted.

663
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:19,829
Let's get out of here.

664
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:25,460
Why isn't he coming?
He should be here by now.

665
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,508
Is someone else coming?

666
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,343
Yes.

667
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,513
The owner of the Chinese restaurant
that Do Hyeon-su worked at.

668
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:42,352
He has some artwork
that Do Hyeon-su made at his house.

669
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,480
Thankfully, he promised me
to bring them here.

670
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,984
I want you to take a look at them.

671
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:54,155
They were made three years later
than the ones you saw earlier,

672
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,784
so they must be a lot closer
to Do Hyeon-su's current artwork.

673
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,623
Okay.

674
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,629
I guess he's here.

675
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:15,843
Are you here?

676
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,930
Yes, Detective.

677
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:23,851
I'll be there in about five minutes.
I'm almost there.

678
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:26,020
You'll see my car at the entrance.

679
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:27,105
Okay.

680
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:37,991
Do Hyeon-su, show me your real self.

681
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,496
Make a choice.

682
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:50,044
Our future depends on your choice now.

683
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,088
What's wrong?

684
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,547
I can't breathe.

685
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,384
I can't breathe.

686
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,556
Let's get out of here.

687
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,476
-Please.
-Let's go.

688
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:39,445
Let's go to the hospital.

689
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:43,658
I'm okay. Let's just go home.

690
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:48,663
I think it was because of the smell
in the basement.

691
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:52,458
It made me nauseous,
but I tried to bear it.

692
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:00,383
Was I being too harsh?

693
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:05,805
No. He's deceived me
for the past 14 years.

694
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:08,891
I should never waver.

695
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,395
By the way…

696
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:16,315
what about the man you were expecting?

697
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,444
THE LATE NAM SUN-GIL

698
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,129
Sir.

699
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:41,758
What brings you here?

700
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:46,679
I came to pray
for the repose of Sun-gil's soul.

701
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:50,767
Where's Detective Cha?

702
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,811
Why would she be here?

703
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:57,398
What? We're supposed to meet here.

704
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:06,741
Mr. No. My husband isn't feeling well,
so I'm on my way back to Seoul.

705
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:09,535
Oh, dear. I hope it's not serious.

706
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,163
I'm driving now,
so I'll call you back later.

707
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,297
Ji-won, don't do that.

708
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:23,800
Do what?

709
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:25,718
Do Hyeon-su.

710
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,138
Why not?

711
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:32,350
I don't like it.

712
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:35,186
He might be a serial killer.

713
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:37,522
It's too dangerous.

714
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,609
That's why I want to catch him.

715
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,570
I can't let someone dangerous
like him live a free life.

716
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:11,264
If you

717
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:16,394
come close to getting
your true identity exposed again,

718
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:18,479
you will have to leave.

719
01:04:19,438 --> 01:04:21,607
To where no one can find you.

720
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:25,194
For everyone's sake.

721
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:22,335
I know you were hurt too.

722
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:25,171
You really liked my family.

723
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:29,008
You trusted and respected my dad.

724
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:32,595
You were Hyeon-su's only friend at school.

725
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:33,512
And I have…

726
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:42,104
never had anyone who liked me
for no reason like you did.

727
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,024
Stop it.

728
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:50,821
You were only 18.
You must've been confused and hurt.

729
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,575
But no one cared about you.

730
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:57,370
No one apologized to you.

731
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,708
It's too late, but I want to apologize.

732
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:05,086
I'm sorry.

733
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:09,298
But…

734
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:14,178
Hyeon-su isn't the person
you should be mad at.

735
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:18,015
Hyeon-su didn't do
anything wrong. I did it.

736
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,643
I killed him.

737
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:23,521
Isn't this an exclusive?

738
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,108
What?

739
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:28,401
So…

740
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:31,404
I'm begging you.

741
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:35,408
Please stop giving Hyeon-su
a hard time, you jerk.

742
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:56,887
Who is this?

743
01:06:58,305 --> 01:06:59,348
Hey.

744
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:04,353
What's going on?
Why are you here at this hour?

745
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:08,107
You told me not to call.
So I came instead.

746
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:14,947
Ji-won is driving me crazy.

747
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:17,199
What are you talking about?

748
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:21,078
Find my sister for me. I need to meet her.

749
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:24,915
Your sister? Do Hae-su?

750
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:35,509
I'm sorry about the other day.

751
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:38,679
I'm sorry I used
your weakness to threaten you.

752
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:52,276
-What's gotten into you?
-So it's a deal, right?

753
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:55,488
-Now you should help me.
-Hey, you…

754
01:07:58,115 --> 01:07:59,241
I…

755
01:08:00,117 --> 01:08:02,369
have to catch that bastard.

756
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:30,231
We modified the model
that doesn't come with the GPS.

757
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:32,608
You can download an app
for location tracking.

758
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:38,322
I hope you like it.

759
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:42,034
I love it.

760
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:24,243
All the victims disappeared suddenly.

761
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:26,787
-But no one looked for them.
-Except for Jung Mi-suk.

762
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,080
Do Min-seok lent his vehicle,

763
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,457
and his accomplice approached the victim.

764
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:33,210
Jung Mi-suk packed up and left
after fighting with her husband,

765
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:36,172
so why did Park Gyeong-chun
report her missing?

766
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:37,923
He approached me on purpose.

767
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,801
I'm sure we'll be able to find
the accomplice among them.

768
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:42,845
You seem very motivated.

769
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:45,014
I really want to solve this case.

770
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:48,225
Let's part ways
as Baek Hee-seong and Cha Ji-won

771
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:50,227
pretending not to know anything.

772
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:55,608
