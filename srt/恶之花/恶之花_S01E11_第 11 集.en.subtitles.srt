1
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,487
COME SEE YOUR BABY

2
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,491
Eun-ha.

3
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,619
We're your mom and dad.

4
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:39,748
BAEK HEE-SEONG, CHA JI-WON

5
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:40,749
Eun-ha.

6
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,889
Why are you crying?

7
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,559
No reason. She's just so beautiful.

8
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,645
I'm grateful that she was born.

9
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,023
And I feel sorry.

10
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,193
I don't know. It's hard to explain.

11
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,739
How are you feeling?

12
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,993
I'm worried.

13
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,079
About what?

14
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,247
What if

15
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,334
she doesn't like me?

16
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,004
What are you talking about?
You're her dad.

17
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,844
She's crying.

18
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,266
Why is she crying all of a sudden?

19
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,229
I bet she feels the same way we do.

20
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,900
She's excited, afraid, and scared.

21
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,986
She has a lot to say,

22
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,948
but she can't put it into words.

23
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,453
Eun-ha, stop crying.

24
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,339
GREEN SILICONE BRACELET

25
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,261
2019 ILSIN HOSPITAL 21ST OPENING CEREMONY
FOR INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL VOLUNTEERING

26
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,808
I WAS SELECTED

27
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,935
ILSIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

28
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,648
"Bracelets for Ilsin University Hospital
International Medical Volunteers."

29
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,901
Ilsin University Hospital?

30
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,241
WITH DIRECTOR BAEK MAN-U

31
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,744
Director Baek Man-u?

32
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,959
Let go, and we'll talk.

33
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,962
Jae-seop, let go of her.
What are you doing?

34
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,422
You knew, didn't you?

35
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,383
You knew everything.

36
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,595
And all this time…

37
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,474
you've been manipulating us.

38
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:45,934
You have…

39
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,896
deceived us.

40
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,324
Jae-seop, are you
out of your mind? Let go of her.

41
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,494
Let go of her arm!

42
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,376
Are you all right?

43
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,004
Detective Choi,
why on earth are you being like this?

44
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,302
It's my fault. Detective Choi
didn't do anything wrong.

45
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,639
Jae-seop.

46
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,141
Follow me.

47
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,147
What's going on, Detective Cha?

48
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,150
I need to talk to him in private.

49
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,838
How did you find out?

50
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,180
I want to explain,
but I don't know where to start.

51
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,390
Don't.

52
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,647
I don't want to hear
your excuse or explanation.

53
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,400
Just answer my questions.

54
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,069
When did you find out?

55
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,950
While working
on the Park Gyeong-chun case.

56
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,829
I see. That's what I thought.

57
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,793
Does Do Hyeon-su know that you know?

58
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,714
No.

59
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,396
Let's do this.

60
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,274
You didn't know anything.

61
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,320
The evidence I have is enough

62
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:05,031
to prove that Baek Hee-seong
is Do Hyeon-su.

63
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,869
I won't involve you in this.

64
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,663
You're Do Hyeon-su's biggest victim.

65
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,542
Things have gotten this far
while you were caught in a dilemma.

66
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,252
Right?

67
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,798
Cha Ji-won!

68
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,093
What you're feeling right now isn't real.

69
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,472
You can't deal with the shock,
so you're trying to defend yourself

70
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,100
by bonding with the criminal.
You know that.

71
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,394
No, that's not it.

72
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,854
That's not the truth. I'm certain.

73
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,148
Then what happened
to the real Baek Hee-seong?

74
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,609
Do you know that too?

75
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,739
Do you think the person
whose identity was stolen

76
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,908
ten years ago is still alive?

77
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,540
Baek Hee-seong's parents
have been helping him.

78
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,334
The parents let him
use their son's identity.

79
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,461
He would

80
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,382
never harm other people.

81
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,716
Do you have proof?

82
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,803
Besides your belief, is there any proof?

83
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,934
Please let it go this once.

84
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,855
Please let this slide. I'm begging you.

85
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,023
You…

86
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,443
Are you serious?

87
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,238
I'll prove his innocence at all costs.

88
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:31,451
If he gets caught,
he will be a monkey in a zoo.

89
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:37,039
The son of a serial killer.
A psychopath with a wife who's a cop.

90
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,293
It's obvious how people will look at him.

91
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,380
Everyone will mock him
and throw stones at him for a laugh.

92
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,134
You know no one cares
about the boring truth.

93
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:51,596
How can I let that happen?
I can't watch him suffer all that.

94
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,943
You might resent me right now,

95
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,863
but you will eventually thank me.

96
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,740
Jae-seop, please.

97
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,241
Tonight,

98
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,702
I will raid Yeom Sang-cheol and his gang

99
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,748
and arrest Do Hyeon-su tomorrow morning.

100
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,878
I can't let you keep doing this, so…

101
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,090
You stay out of this.

102
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,552
Until everything is settled…

103
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,598
keep your eyes closed.

104
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,396
Jae-seop. No…

105
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,484
Jae-seop…

106
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,079
Once I hand over the money,
the second rendezvous will begin.

107
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,916
At the second rendezvous,
we'll trade people.

108
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,922
The police must catch them in the act.

109
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,510
If I fail

110
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,806
to give the police the second location,

111
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,935
you will have to do it for me.

112
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,312
What should I do?

113
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,616
What is this?

114
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,332
A radio receiver.

115
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,921
I hid a wiretapping device
in the bag of money.

116
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,382
Of course, it's not visible.

117
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,177
But what if they use a detector?

118
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,389
They told you not to bring
any communications equipment.

119
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,835
You're here.

120
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,394
It's all clear, sir.

121
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,772
Sit.

122
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,326
But what if they use a detector?

123
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,204
It's simple.

124
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,083
I'll turn on

125
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,336
the switch later on.

126
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,236
It smells so good.

127
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,531
Hey, count the money.

128
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,699
Yes, sir.

129
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,138
So where should I go to get the thing?

130
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,349
What's the rush?
Let me finish counting the money first.

131
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,024
HAE-SU

132
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,614
Yes, Hae-su.

133
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,741
How is it going?

134
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,245
Things are going well for now.
What's the matter?

135
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,040
I think I figured something out.

136
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,126
What?

137
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,712
I'll tell you the details later.

138
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,672
But before that, Moo-jin,

139
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,008
I need to ask you a favor.

140
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:43,137
As soon as the informant finds out
the location of the rendezvous,

141
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,638
he will let us know.

142
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,101
Yeom Sang-cheol and Sung Jae-gu
won't be at the scene.

143
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,271
Lee Tae-seop, Jin Chang-jin,

144
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,690
Oh Gwang-sik, and Park Jang-su

145
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,902
are expected to take care
of the transaction.

146
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,988
Make sure you memorize
their faces and names.

147
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,917
We're doing this
without Detective Cha today.

148
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,251
What?

149
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,922
What the hell's going on?

150
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:26,847
The thing is,
her daughter is hospitalized.

151
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:27,765
Eun-ha?

152
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,684
Yes. I guess she's very sick.

153
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:34,480
But she couldn't even go to the hospital
since we're on emergency duty.

154
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,191
So I told her to go to the hospital.

155
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,111
I just heard Eun-ha is fine.

156
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,280
You don't have to worry.

157
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,992
-You…
-She's sleeping at my mom's place now.

158
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,161
Thank you for your concern.

159
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,039
Ji-won.

160
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,708
I don't think you should be here now.

161
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,419
Just do as I say.

162
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,798
I won't stay out of this case
no matter what.

163
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,508
Why not?

164
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,218
Because this is my work.

165
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,284
37 JAERIM-RO 57-GIL

166
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,036
Memorize it.

167
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:38,544
37 Jaerim-ro 57-gil.

168
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,422
Once you get there, the thing
will be waiting for you. Just take it.

169
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:45,843
37 Jaerim-ro 57-gil.

170
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,180
According to the informant,
the three kidnapped victims…

171
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,725
I got a call from the informant.

172
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,441
Cha Ji-won speaking.

173
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:07,072
Hello, this is Do Hyeon-su.

174
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,198
Okay. Go ahead.

175
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,076
37 Jaerim-ro 57-gil.

176
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,329
This is where Yeom Sang-cheol's
gang members are waiting

177
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,539
with the kidnapped victims.

178
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,043
We got the address of the place
for the transaction.

179
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,545
It's 37 Jaerim-ro 57-gil, Jaerim-gu.

180
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,173
I'll text you the address.

181
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,175
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

182
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,343
Let's move.

183
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,515
You stay here.

184
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:39,021
Come up with an excuse to take yourself
off the case. It's only right.

185
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,190
You now know better than anyone

186
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,901
that I want to solve this case
more than anyone else.

187
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,402
That's the problem.

188
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,988
Your emotion is involved in this.

189
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,240
When he even asked for backup,

190
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,910
do you want me to wait
in the office doing nothing?

191
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,371
If you were me,
would you be able to do that?

192
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,334
Our goal tonight is

193
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,087
to arrest every member
of Yeom Sang-cheol's gang.

194
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,300
And Do Hyeon-su will only contact me.

195
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,099
Do you still think you don't need me?

196
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,769
Answer me.

197
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,188
I'll do as you say.

198
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,943
37 JAERIM-RO 57-GIL

199
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,703
The information about the accomplice?

200
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,913
I have it ready, of course.

201
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,962
The picture, name, and even address.

202
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,985
BAEK

203
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:11,739
Time.

204
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,165
Hello, sir. It's been a long time.

205
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:25,002
This is no time for you to answer
my call with such a bright voice.

206
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,463
I don't know what you're talking about.

207
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,547
Let me cut to the chase.

208
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:33,427
I'll tell you two reasons you must
get rid of the guy in front of you.

209
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,305
First.

210
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:41,143
Do Hyeon-su is in league with the cops.

211
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,978
I see.

212
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,606
Second.

213
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,860
You will get twice the money
Do Hyeon-su just gave you.

214
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:52,905
Twice?

215
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,618
Oh, dear.

216
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:02,372
I was about to make a huge mistake without
knowing that you can see through me.

217
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:07,753
That bastard is living
with a fake identity.

218
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:13,050
He can work with the cops, but he can
never have direct contact with them.

219
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,386
He wouldn't have gone there with the cops.

220
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,263
I see.

221
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,308
Thank you so much for your call, sir.

222
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,268
All right. Good night.

223
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:38,492
Hey, take out all the money
from the safe and put it in the bag.

224
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,952
We need to leave this place.

225
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,537
Yes, sir.

226
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,835
Let me know what's going on here.

227
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,181
Let me ask you a question.

228
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,726
Do you prefer mountains or seas?

229
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,110
Where do you want to be buried,
you damn stool pigeon?!

230
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,671
I can't sleep.

231
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,048
I'm scared.

232
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,926
What are you scared of?

233
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,138
Do Hyeon-su.

234
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,476
He will never give up my identity.

235
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,896
I'm sure he'll kill me.

236
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,773
That's not going to happen.

237
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,403
I won't let it happen.

238
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,581
Who is this?

239
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,834
Who is it at this hour?

240
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,629
I don't know. I don't know her.

241
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,715
Who is this?

242
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,469
I'm sorry for visiting so late at night.

243
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,890
My name is Do Hae-su.

244
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,897
I mean, Hyeon-su…

245
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,276
Do Hyeon-su is my younger brother.

246
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,245
There's something
I'd like to discuss with you,

247
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,789
so I asked around for your address.

248
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,333
I apologize for being rude.

249
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,400
37 JAERIM-RO 57-GIL,
SITE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING

250
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,985
Did you check the goods?

251
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,069
Yes.

252
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,287
Damn, who the hell are they?

253
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,248
We're from the Violent Crimes Unit.

254
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,125
We got a tip-off on human trafficking.

255
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,711
-Run!
-Catch them.

256
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,797
-Run.
-Stop right there.

257
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,638
You bastard.

258
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,144
Stop right there.

259
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,819
Damn it.

260
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,530
Don't come any closer. I'll kill you.

261
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:04,740
Step back.

262
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,411
Who are you? Do you have a death wish?

263
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,335
Let go of me!

264
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,791
Stop, you bastard.

265
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,342
You son of a bitch!

266
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:12,391
Why did you not put on protective gear
before coming to the scene? Why?

267
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:18,063
Come on, I already knew
this scumbag had a knife hidden.

268
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,773
What if he stabbed you?

269
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:24,361
You were lucky with the Park Gyeong-chun
case, but you almost died today.

270
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,862
Don't you think about your family?

271
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:30,951
Don't you dare butt in like that again.
It really freaked me out for a moment.

272
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,413
I won't have the chance anyway.

273
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,167
Yes.

274
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,378
We caught Lee Tae-seop.

275
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,881
I think things are settled there too.

276
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,342
Let's go. We can talk on the way.

277
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,427
Jae-seop.

278
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,723
I still have something to do.

279
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,449
Let me ask you one thing.

280
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,076
What do you gain by working with the cops?

281
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,207
Who said that I'm working with the cops?

282
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,542
Why are you acting so stupid?

283
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,586
The cops won't help you.

284
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,088
Who said that?

285
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,675
Think carefully.

286
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,594
Who did you tell your secret?

287
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,933
Who do you think sold you out to me?

288
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,309
Who would that be?

289
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,855
The cops? Your friend? Or your lover?

290
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:25,732
Curious, right?

291
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,776
That's too bad.

292
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,279
You will have to get out of here
if you want to find out.

293
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,614
But you won't.

294
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,701
At least, not alive.

295
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,453
Tie him up.

296
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,474
What's that? Go check.

297
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,401
Who the hell are you?

298
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,237
I was just checking this. It works fine.

299
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,040
Hey. You big ape.

300
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:34,301
Hey, Hyeon-su! Do Hyeon-su!
Hurry and get out.

301
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:37,262
Hey, I'm out of bullets.
Hyeon-su, get out!

302
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,312
So you're a police informant,

303
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,273
but is that moron your only savior now?

304
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,817
If I were you,

305
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,446
I would take my money
and leave this place right now.

306
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,615
Why?

307
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,409
Because you're done for.

308
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,789
If someone's done for here,
it must be you.

309
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,207
Before me.

310
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:05,850
Thank you.

311
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,442
I didn't hear your brother
was in touch with you.

312
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,863
I hadn't met him once for 18 years.

313
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,532
I recently met him again.

314
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:25,286
This isn't something my wife and I
should be happy about, though.

315
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:32,419
The fact that Hyeon-su told
someone else about our relationship

316
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,213
makes us quite uncomfortable.

317
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,300
I'm sorry.

318
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,512
Ms. Do Hae-su?

319
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,597
Yes.

320
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:48,476
What did you hear from Hyeon-su?

321
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,602
About us?

322
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:58,027
I heard your son is unconscious.

323
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:04,284
So you let him use your son's identity.

324
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:09,080
You knew about his past and background,
but you still took pity on him.

325
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,540
That's what I heard.

326
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,046
Did he not say anything else?

327
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,340
He said you are good people.

328
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,595
Let's just cut to the chase.

329
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,222
Pardon?

330
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,016
The reason

331
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,479
that you came to meet us so urgently.

332
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,314
Oh,

333
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,566
sure.

334
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,993
Please take a look at this.

335
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,872
This is

336
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,710
the bracelet for our international
medical volunteers.

337
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,086
What about this?

338
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:02,050
I'd like you to get me the names
and pictures of the volunteers

339
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,093
from 1999 to 2002.

340
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,892
As I understand it, you two are also

341
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:14,354
anxious about the reinvestigation
of the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

342
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:17,649
Why? Why do you think
we're anxious about that?

343
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:19,984
Pardon?

344
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,695
That's…

345
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,365
Yes, we are anxious.

346
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,410
We're worried if Hyeon-su
might be involved in the case.

347
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,872
I feel nervous whenever I watch the news.

348
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,625
But Hyeon-su isn't the accomplice.

349
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,294
He has nothing to do
with our father's crime.

350
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,171
I know. I really do.

351
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,259
We believe Hyeon-su.

352
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,427
By the way,

353
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:51,391
what does the case
have to do with this bracelet?

354
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,188
On June 10, 2002,

355
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,191
a man came to my father's funeral.

356
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,152
And he was wearing this bracelet.

357
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:10,243
I recently found out
that the guy was my father's accomplice.

358
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,876
If I get to see his face again,

359
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,839
I might recognize him.

360
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,794
Darn.

361
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,110
Everyone. This is Kim Moo-jin
from The Hanjoogan.

362
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,199
No, this isn't an ASMR video.

363
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,078
I'm now

364
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:39,207
working undercover to report
a human trafficking case.

365
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:44,462
But I'm in big trouble right now.

366
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,052
WHAT? IS HE WORKING UNDERCOVER?

367
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,762
IS HE AT A SITE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING?

368
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,055
BE CAREFUL, MR. KIM

369
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:59,811
If something happens to me,

370
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,397
please call the police.

371
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:08,569
I'm in the underground parking lot
of Hakjin Building in Jaerim-dong.

372
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,800
Everyone, I may die here,

373
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,677
but journalism will never die!

374
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,844
You just stabbed me in the back,
so I can't let you die an easy death.

375
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,557
You son of a bitch!
This is all your fault.

376
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:24,854
I want you to meet
a painful, brutal death.

377
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,565
I'm going to let that happen.

378
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,735
Before I die,

379
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:35,490
at least let me know
who stabbed me in the back.

380
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,952
Wouldn't that bring me more pain?

381
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,542
Don't you dare get cute with me.

382
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:52,924
I've figured out
what you and your gang are up to.

383
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,109
You messed with something
you should never mess with.

384
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,236
Blame yourself.

385
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,843
Who are you?

386
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,178
Are you all right, honey?

387
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,832
-Hey, move along.
-Damn it.

388
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:57,006
Gosh, go easy on me. It hurts.

389
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,927
Are you all right?
We will take you home soon.

390
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,055
Wait.

391
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,433
In-seo, what happened?

392
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:12,021
Am I going back home now?

393
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,233
-Of course.
-Then I'm fine.

394
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,527
I'm fine as long as I can go home.

395
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,822
-Please take good care of him.
-Okay.

396
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,074
All right.

397
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,044
Where's Detective Cha?

398
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:41,008
She got a call
that Eun-ha was running a fever again.

399
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,010
So I told her to go check on her.

400
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,098
I should be understanding, right?

401
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,601
Sure. Her kid is sick.

402
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,437
I know you're lying,

403
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,565
but I'm sure there's a good reason for it.

404
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,660
I still have something to do.

405
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,664
I just want to go check

406
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,250
if he's safe now.

407
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:26,012
I'm going to arrest Do Hyeon-su tomorrow
morning no matter what. As a cop.

408
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,057
Tomorrow morning.

409
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,062
Do whatever you want tonight.

410
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,565
I won't care.

411
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,490
Ji-won.

412
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,954
Did you

413
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,207
know everything?

414
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,338
Hands over your head.

415
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,599
Ji-won. Ji-won!

416
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,315
-Come here!
-Stop it!

417
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,484
Stop it!

418
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,029
Die!

419
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,339
Die!

420
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,327
Stop it. I said stop!

421
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,207
You have no time for this.

422
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,293
A search warrant
for Yeom Sang-cheol's house, office,

423
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,462
and store must've been issued by now.

424
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:26,507
I'm saying the police will be here soon.

425
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,592
Get up.

426
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,429
Hurry and stand up. Now.

427
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:35,683
You can't go home.

428
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:40,521
Detective Choi has proof
that you're Do Hyeon-su.

429
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,314
He's going to arrest you tomorrow.

430
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,360
Go now.

431
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,739
Run as far as you can tonight.

432
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,245
Don't you get it?

433
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,456
Go! Just leave!

434
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:05,087
Hide somewhere even I can't find

435
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,006
and don't you ever come back to me.

436
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,510
What are you waiting for?

437
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,721
Aren't you good
at running away and hiding?

438
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,182
Will you

439
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,894
spend your whole life
in prison for your sister?

440
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,732
Go. Leave!

441
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,529
Go!

442
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,935
Let go!

443
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,460
Oh, well… Detective Cha.

444
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,171
I'm just here to cover a case.

445
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,720
This is Detective Cha Ji-won
from Gangsu Police Station.

446
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,221
I need backup.

447
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,651
So I don't need a reason
to fall out of love.

448
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,362
I don't love you.

449
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,115
I don't love you anymore.

450
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,415
I wish

451
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:50,085
you could live as me just for one day.

452
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:54,381
Then you'd know…

453
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,968
how much I love you.

454
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,975
Once I'm done with this case,

455
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:10,022
I'd like to live a quiet life
raising her in the countryside.

456
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:12,316
What do you

457
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,235
think about that idea?

458
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:45,265
JI-WON

459
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,484
MY HUSBAND

460
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,713
MY HUSBAND

461
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,179
MY HUSBAND

462
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:36,692
Ji-won. Please.

463
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:41,947
Please answer the phone.

464
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:44,783
MY HUSBAND

465
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,587
How could we…

466
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,092
I just can't do this.

467
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,237
Why are you doing this to me?

468
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,156
Why?

469
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:10,536
You can't live as Baek Hee-seong anymore.

470
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,205
They found out everything.

471
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,251
You have to run away.

472
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,295
I said I'd help you run away.

473
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,886
What more do you want from me?

474
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,431
What more do you want me to do?

475
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,563
Why did you…

476
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,818
You found out everything.

477
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,447
Why are you still helping me
knowing all that?

478
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,578
I don't understand.

479
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,289
Do you really not know?

480
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,961
Even after I found out who you really are,

481
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,256
I've tried so hard to protect you.

482
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,093
Do you really not know why?

483
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:28,196
I'm sorry.

484
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,911
I'm so sorry, Ji-won.

485
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,752
It's all my fault.

486
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:46,173
I… I broke your heart.

487
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,551
I hurt you.

488
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,394
Why did you do that…

489
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:03,106
when you knew everything?

490
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,778
I just had to.

491
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,532
I just had to.

492
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:42,771
I want to go home, Ji-won.

493
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,363
Okay. Let's go home.

494
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,241
Let's go to our place.

495
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:57,911
Whatever happens,

496
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,165
let's start over there.

497
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,678
I'll appreciate your help.

498
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:20,642
I'll look into it, but don't get
your hopes up too much.

499
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,853
It was 20 years ago.

500
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,565
So I'm not sure if we still have the list

501
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,734
of all the volunteers during those years.

502
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:32,654
The documents I gave you have
the essays written by the volunteers.

503
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,740
They had to submit
a lot of documents back then.

504
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:38,577
I will read them thoroughly.

505
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,581
I'm so relieved that you can help me.

506
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,541
Thank you so much.

507
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,293
Don't mention it.

508
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:50,714
Hyeon-su and we are

509
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:53,425
bound up with each other.

510
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:57,345
I'll get going, then.

511
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,648
Wait, Ms. Do Hae-su.

512
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,400
Yes?

513
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:15,280
About the accomplice you met.

514
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,659
Did he have any distinctive features?

515
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:28,418
I mean… I just thought
that kind of information

516
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,212
might help

517
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:33,840
my husband find the volunteer.

518
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:36,551
I see.

519
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:42,682
I don't think he had
any recognizable facial feature.

520
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,938
But the fingernails on his left hand
were exceptionally short.

521
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,899
As if he had a habit
of biting his left fingernails.

522
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,226
Hey, lady.

523
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:28,812
You better not be nosy.

524
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,357
You are not the only one who saw me.

525
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,860
I saw you as well.

526
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,154
You drive a small, red car.

527
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,408
I know where you work and where you live.

528
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,361
-It's all done. Now you may pay the bills.
-Okay.

529
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:21,281
Cardiac arrest. Please keep this open.

530
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,408
My goodness.

531
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,163
Get me an Ambu bag.

532
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,458
Hey, get up. Let's go.

533
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,546
Just hurry and move.

534
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:43,511
Gosh, come on and help me up.

535
00:56:55,787 --> 00:57:00,291
So it means I still have one more chance.

536
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:01,918
Right?

537
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:14,264
What are you going to do?

538
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,141
Calm down.

539
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,853
Nothing happened yet.

540
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,898
Even if you don't give her the list,

541
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,775
she'll eventually find it.

542
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:27,944
I said calm down.

543
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:38,955
There's no evidence that the man
Do Hae-su saw at the funeral is

544
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,331
Do Min-seok's accomplice.

545
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,084
That's just Do Hae-su's claim.

546
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:47,213
What if Hyeon-su finds out?
Do you think he'll do nothing about it?

547
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,424
Will he leave Hee-seong alone?

548
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,054
I already

549
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,516
took care of Do Hyeon-su.

550
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,146
What do you mean?

551
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,526
Stop biting your nails.

552
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:13,823
I told you to stop.

553
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:20,246
How many times
have I told you to break the habit?

554
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:28,087
What on earth is your problem?

555
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,883
How could you hit him?

556
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:34,469
Don't hit him! Don't!

557
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:37,597
Do you still not know
that you can't stop it by hitting him?

558
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,515
Mom.

559
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:46,481
Why did Do Hyeon-su,
of all people, have to be…

560
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:50,693
the person hit by my car that night?

561
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,746
Yes. I'm on my way.

562
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:04,374
Do you want me to take care of it?

563
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,168
No, it's okay.

564
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,880
Thank you for your offer, though.

565
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:15,677
It's tough,
but I have to deal with it myself.

566
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:19,013
Okay. Do as you wish.

567
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,390
By the way,

568
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,434
how…

569
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,854
did he look?

570
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,066
He didn't seem to remember you.

571
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:32,819
That's a relief.

572
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:44,414
Do Min-seok is not letting me go

573
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,749
even after death.

574
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,086
He's even using his son…

575
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,923
to kill me.

576
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:57,385
He is more than capable of doing that.

577
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:04,183
All I did was do as Do Min-seok said.

578
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,520
He threatened

579
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:11,608
to kill you two unless I did as told.

580
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:16,404
I was really scared.

581
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:22,243
I really didn't want to do it.

582
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:25,830
I'm telling the truth. Please believe me.

583
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,260
Dad.

584
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:44,349
Mom.

585
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:54,859
Will you protect me?

586
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,654
There you are.

587
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,908
Hyeon-su, listen carefully.

588
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:48,329
If you get lost here, you might die.

589
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:53,000
There's a cliff over the hill.

590
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,297
That's my earliest memory.

591
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,387
I was ten then.

592
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:08,725
I don't have any memory from before that.

593
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:14,021
Do you not even remember
why you were wandering in the woods?

594
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,276
No.

595
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,572
It felt like

596
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,826
I was lost in a deep, dark maze.

597
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,162
And

598
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:32,498
I was relieved that my dad saved me.

599
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:35,835
That's all I remember.

600
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:40,465
Why are you still wearing this?

601
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,887
Wherever I go,

602
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:48,181
you know where I am.

603
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:50,641
That makes me feel good.

604
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,480
You're really strange.

605
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,316
When

606
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:01,027
did you start tailing me?

607
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,701
When you met your sister
in the deserted building,

608
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,578
I was there too.

609
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,582
And you told her there…

610
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:19,003
that you'd never loved me
even for a second.

611
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,134
After I heard that,

612
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:29,096
I don't even remember how I got home.

613
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,273
Why are you crying again?

614
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:41,275
I don't know.

615
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:43,569
I do.

616
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:48,658
Because you love me.

617
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,790
No. I…

618
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,876
I'm not capable of it.

619
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:03,047
You always wanted me to feel happy.

620
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:07,051
Because I had to deceive you.

621
01:04:11,138 --> 01:04:13,224
Back when I studied for the exam,

622
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:16,018
whenever I stayed
at the library till late at night,

623
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,980
you waited for me
in front of the building.

624
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:21,816
That's when

625
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:25,486
I realized that you really

626
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:27,738
cared for me.

627
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:32,785
When my dad suddenly passed away,

628
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:36,581
I felt like my world was falling apart.

629
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:41,669
I was nervous and upset back then.

630
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:45,214
I just cried over nothing.

631
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,427
But you never urged me

632
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:53,431
to get over it or give me advice
like everyone else did.

633
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:58,394
You learned how to cook and cooked for me.

634
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:01,522
They were all good.

635
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:07,695
That's how I got over it.

636
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:16,537
You love me.

637
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,541
I can feel it.

638
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,596
I…

639
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,016
love you.

640
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:53,908
I…

641
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,661
love you, Ji-won.

642
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,003
A lot of people will

643
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:10,883
start to judge you and define
who you are from tomorrow.

644
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:15,179
It's okay.

645
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:17,807
Now,

646
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:21,018
I don't care about any of that.

647
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:24,230
No matter what happens, don't forget

648
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,400
that you're a man with a warm heart.

649
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:33,531
You are

650
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,034
even stranger than I am.

651
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:46,544
So what happened next?

652
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:53,259
I started delivery work
at the Chinese restaurant.

653
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:57,930
Then, I met this guy from
the shoe repair shop named Nam-su.

654
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,557
When do I appear in this story?

655
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:01,684
Be patient.

656
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:06,188
Before I meet you,

657
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:10,276
I have to escape
from the jaws of death twice.

658
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,074
You had to go through

659
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:20,745
a lot of bumpy roads to get to me.

660
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,126
Ji-won. You're…

661
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:31,589
the hardest part to explain in my life.

662
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:35,593
It's surreal.

663
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:38,554
It's unbelievable.

664
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:10,002
WHERE THE RISING STAR STAYS

665
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:18,677
Why did you not answer my calls?

666
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,680
You have to tell me
what happened last night.

667
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:26,268
You know I can't call Hyeon-su myself.
Why did you not even text me?

668
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:27,895
My phone is broken.

669
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,481
What happened to your face?

670
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:33,776
You noticed that quickly.
Let's talk inside.

671
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:40,658
What about Hyeon-su? Is he all right?

672
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:44,745
I don't know.

673
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:47,665
You don't know? How could you not know?

674
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:52,753
Detective Cha found out everything.

675
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:55,256
What?

676
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:58,300
I don't know anything anymore.

677
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:01,137
What happened to Hyeon-su,

678
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:03,514
or what will happen to him.

679
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:14,859
Okay.

680
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,027
Jae-seop.

681
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:19,780
Let me ask you a favor.

682
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:23,617
Please don't cuff him.

683
01:09:25,744 --> 01:09:28,414
And take him as quietly as possible.

684
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:34,128
I'll take him out in 30 minutes.

685
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:37,506
Okay. Thank you.

686
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:55,733
Detective Choi

687
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:58,652
is here.

688
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:10,206
WHERE THE RISING STAR STAYS

689
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,189
Do Hyeon-su.

690
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,734
Why did you kill Kwon Seong-bok,
the Gagyeong-ri village head, in 2002?

691
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:25,030
Mom. Hee-seong can't pick up
Eun-ha from kindergarten today.

692
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:28,409
And I wanted to blame your sister
for what she did,

693
01:11:28,492 --> 01:11:31,662
but I didn't because
I knew it was wrong. It's so unfair.

694
01:11:31,745 --> 01:11:33,664
I'm here to keep my promise

695
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:36,834
to tell you everything
when the time is right.

696
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:39,503
The body that was found
in the woods this morning…

697
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:41,422
The left thumbnail is missing.

698
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:45,426
What do you know?

699
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:47,761
What is it that you know?

700
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:50,806
Our team will try our best
to clear your name.

701
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:05,821
