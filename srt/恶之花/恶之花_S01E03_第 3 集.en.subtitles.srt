1
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,367
SUMMER 2007

2
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,350
Hee-seong.

3
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,645
I'm back again.

4
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,568
It seemed like you like this beer,
so I brought some without telling my mom.

5
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,074
Where did you learn that stuff?

6
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,993
You said you don't go to college.

7
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,038
Is there an academy
where they teach the stuff?

8
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:37,222
-What are you doing?
-Can I upload this on my social media?

9
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,266
I'll say "A handsome guy
in my neighborhood."

10
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,353
Do I sound like I'm okay with that?

11
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,366
Delete it right now.

12
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,870
Okay. I'll delete it.

13
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,873
I'm deleting it now.

14
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,000
I didn't know you hated
being photographed.

15
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,044
Who are you?

16
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,089
-What?
-Why are you checking my background?

17
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,384
Am I?

18
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,014
You keep prying into my affairs
as if it's no big deal.

19
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,432
Do you think I don't know that?

20
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,853
You asked about my blood type,
zodiac sign, birthday,

21
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,147
and foods I like and I don't.

22
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,692
You even asked the guy next door
for my phone number.

23
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,069
Why?

24
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:37,740
Did someone tell you
to dig up information about me?

25
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,928
I like you.

26
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,337
Hee-seong.

27
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:40,136
Just tell me whether you like me or not.
Or at least if you need time to think.

28
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,015
-You…
-I'm Cha Ji-won.

29
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,478
Don't ever come back here again.

30
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,648
-What?
-Get out right now.

31
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,072
What? Do you want me to drag you out?

32
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,668
Why are you up so early?

33
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,549
Where did you go at this hour?
It's raining outside.

34
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,468
I couldn't sleep,
so I went to work at my workshop.

35
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,012
Then I noticed we were out of beer.

36
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,766
You were saying the other day
you need to watch your diet.

37
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,644
Oh, this…

38
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,479
What?

39
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,734
When I first told you I liked you,

40
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,196
you were furious at me. Do you remember?

41
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,325
"Do you want me to drag you out?"

42
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,287
Why would you bring that up?

43
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,124
Why did you hate me so much back then?

44
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,420
I didn't hate you.

45
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,551
I just felt awkward.
It had never happened to me before.

46
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,388
Gosh, my husband is so naive.

47
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,600
This is why I can't tell you
about my past.

48
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,851
Your past?

49
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,062
What about it?

50
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,646
You'll be shocked.

51
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,775
-Is it that bad?
-I'm a woman with a complicated past.

52
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,236
-Gosh. So I've been fooled?
-Right.

53
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,364
Just tell me. You made me so curious.

54
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,721
Do you like it?

55
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,228
Answer me. Do you like it or not?

56
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,443
I don't care about the taste.
I'm just eating to stay alive.

57
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,572
Eat a lot. I bet you like it.

58
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,118
I went to your neighborhood to buy this.

59
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,915
It means, when they do an autopsy on you,

60
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,585
this gimbap will be the last food

61
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,712
you ate before your death.

62
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,719
Gosh, Hyeon-su.

63
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,849
Damn it.

64
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,231
Hey, what is this?

65
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:25,653
Are you really going to kill me?

66
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,448
Hey, is it that easy
for you to kill someone?

67
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,659
Of course not.

68
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,328
How much do you weigh?

69
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,414
About 70kg?

70
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,458
Or 75kg?

71
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,670
When you're unconscious
after taking these sleeping pills,

72
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,881
do you think it will be easy
to carry you to my car?

73
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,134
Don't do that. Stop it.

74
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,261
Hyeon-su.

75
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:54,307
Hyeon-su, please. Hyeon-su.

76
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:05,610
Help! Is anyone there? Please help me!

77
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,404
There's someone in the basement!

78
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:14,327
I've been kidnapped and confined in here!
I'll be murdered!

79
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,209
Detective Cha!

80
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,003
I'm locked up in here.

81
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,256
Murderer Do Hyeon-su is here.

82
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,886
Do Hyeon-su is right in here.

83
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,263
Hyeon-su is here.

84
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,099
Darn, this is crazy.

85
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,230
Come on, Hyeon-su.

86
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,649
Just spare me.

87
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,235
I'll do everything you say.

88
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,530
So please let me live.

89
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,240
Please spare me.

90
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,992
Can you answer my questions honestly?

91
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,286
Yes. Of course.

92
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,880
In 2011, you posted this online.

93
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:08,798
What?

94
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,050
You were logged in, so I saw it.

95
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,056
Read it.

96
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,893
Read it aloud.

97
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:31,153
"I'm a high school girl who dreams
of becoming a screenwriter."

98
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,741
"The main character once helped
someone commit a crime

99
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,743
without knowing it was a crime."

100
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:43,499
"And he's seeking a job
at a news media company now."

101
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,337
"What kinds of disadvantages
will he face when his past is revealed?"

102
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,508
Keep reading.

103
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,305
Read.

104
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,727
"What if…

105
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,357
someone died because of him?"

106
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:15,906
Is this your story?

107
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,452
No.

108
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,417
"There's a video of that day."

109
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,546
"He just did as he was told
without knowing what it was."

110
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,591
"He really didn't know."

111
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,096
Did you really not know?

112
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:43,809
No. I had no idea. I'm serious.

113
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,479
So it means there's a video

114
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,315
that shows you assisting murder.

115
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,691
What?

116
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,031
Hyeon-su.

117
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,700
I won't tell anyone.

118
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,914
I'll forget that I ever met you.

119
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,042
Okay? I won't even come near you.

120
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,379
I promise.

121
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,589
I swear on my mom.

122
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:15,800
So…

123
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,846
Please let me go.

124
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,321
I don't want your promise.

125
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,615
I want a guarantee.

126
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,285
I don't believe what people say.

127
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,455
Do you understand?

128
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,517
SUNGIL CHINESE RESTAURANT

129
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,396
-What happened?
-My gosh.

130
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,314
It was a murder.

131
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,316
-I'm scared.
-A murder? Who was killed?

132
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,402
Mr. Nam, the owner
of the Chinese restaurant.

133
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,739
-Excuse me.
-Excuse us.

134
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,807
YEONJU SERIAL MURDER CASE

135
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,479
I can't believe this.

136
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,608
What about his nails?
Did you see his thumbnails?

137
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,945
Both are missing.

138
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:47,910
What's this?

139
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,287
Why is it Do Min-seok again?

140
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,791
Is it another disguise like what Park did?

141
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,337
Why aren't you guys saying anything?

142
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,172
This is different
from Park Seo-yeong case.

143
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,131
Like how?

144
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,927
The brand and pattern of the rope
Do Min-seok used

145
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,973
on the victim back in 2002
weren't disclosed to the press. But…

146
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,396
The culprit used the exact same items

147
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,690
that Do Min-seok did.

148
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,859
Park Seo-yeong's murder was accidental.

149
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,028
On the other hand,
as the CCTV footage shows,

150
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,072
this one was pre-planned.

151
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,701
And he tried to show
how similar he is to Do Min-seok

152
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,620
and how different from Park Seo-yeong.

153
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,123
He's really dangerous.

154
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,668
Just so you know,
Do Min-seok killed seven people.

155
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,296
So

156
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,633
are you saying this could be
a serial murder case?

157
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,016
Should we transfer it
to the Criminal Investigation Division?

158
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,145
Section Chief Yoon, what do you think?

159
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,315
It's too good to give away.
He makes headlines all the time.

160
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,067
And we can't be sure
it's a serial murder case yet.

161
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,531
U-cheol, can you handle the case?

162
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:15,581
What if it turns into a serial murder case
while we're working on it?

163
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,542
I think we can catch him.

164
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,839
He's quite reckless
when selecting his victims.

165
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,551
The victim Nam Sun-gil
has a job and a family.

166
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,971
He's a robust middle-aged man
with daily routines.

167
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,975
He'd be a risky victim for the culprit.

168
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,772
I'm sure he has a weak spot
that we can dig into.

169
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,988
What's the victim's family status?

170
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,032
Please hang on a second.

171
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,825
Let me see.

172
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,535
-Ho-jun.
-Yes?

173
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,206
If this turns into serial murder,
our boss might lose his job.

174
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,207
Let's do things right.

175
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,918
-He must be really anxious now.
-Okay.

176
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,420
Nam Sun-gil grew up in an orphanage.

177
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,590
He has no immediate family
except for his wife.

178
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,676
She's six months pregnant.

179
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,929
She fainted from shock,
so she's now resting in a hospital.

180
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,098
Did you identify
the last person he spoke to?

181
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,808
Detective Oh is looking into it.

182
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,147
We found out whom
Nam Sun-gil last spoke with.

183
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,775
He's Kim Moo-jin, a reporter
for a weekly magazine.

184
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,360
The reporter, Kim Moo-jin?

185
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,904
Do you know him?

186
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:33,492
Yes. I met him last Sunday night.
He was working on the Kim Sang-jin case.

187
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,829
And Kim Moo-jin can't be reached now.
His phone is turned off.

188
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,332
The last call he made
was at around 5:00 p.m. yesterday.

189
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,335
And he called Nam Sun-gil, the victim.

190
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,218
What are you waiting for?

191
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,847
Detective Choi, go to the control center
and check the culprit's escape route.

192
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,100
And you two figure out Kim Moo-jin's
whereabouts as soon as possible.

193
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,601
-Hurry.
-Yes, sir.

194
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,317
REPORTER OF THE MONTH AWARD

195
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,032
There's a laptop
on the desk in the living room.

196
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,833
The password is mj0905.

197
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,380
There's a program called "S-Folder."

198
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,467
Run it.

199
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,428
The password is the same as the laptop's.

200
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,725
There's a folder called "HS."

201
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,103
If you unlock it,

202
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,688
a new folder will appear on the desktop.

203
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,484
Now you can

204
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,363
ruin my life whenever you want.

205
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,043
2002 SEJIN HIGH SCHOOL DRAWING CONTEST

206
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,044
My gosh.

207
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:53,340
Hey. Stop filming it and come sit down.

208
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,093
Why aren't you drawing?
You should come and draw too.

209
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,011
Come here.

210
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,014
Darn it.

211
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,433
-This isn't fun.
-What are we doing here?

212
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,274
Mr. Kim didn't come to work for two days.

213
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,067
Why didn't you notify the police?

214
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,320
All employees come to the office
on Mondays for the editorial meeting.

215
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,657
Then they work flexible hours
before the deadline on Thursdays.

216
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,077
Reporters usually don't keep
their phones turned off.

217
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,956
Moo-jin does. He'd turn off his phone
and go on a trip.

218
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,167
Excuse me.

219
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,004
I think he might be locked up somewhere.

220
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,505
Locked up?

221
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,757
I mean, in the bathroom.

222
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,679
He was once locked up in the bathroom
because the door was broken.

223
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,640
He would've died
if his mom didn't visit his house.

224
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,068
Why do you keep filming me?

225
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,040
Gosh, what's this?

226
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,298
Ta-da. This is it.

227
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,258
What is this?

228
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,636
My dad built it for me so I can work here.

229
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,599
Isn't this great?

230
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,439
Kim Moo-jin, will you sit still?

231
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,693
You said you'd be my model.

232
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,904
He fooled me.

233
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,856
Mr. Kim Moo-jin.

234
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,526
Are you in there?

235
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,486
Mr. Kim.

236
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:21,780
BREAKFAST DELIVERY

237
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,454
There are two.

238
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,957
It's either he hasn't come home
since Monday afternoon

239
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,292
or he hasn't come out.

240
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,628
-Break the door down.
-Okay.

241
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,719
-Make sure to look thoroughly.
-Okay.

242
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,556
Mr. Kim.

243
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,311
Mr. Kim Moo-jin.

244
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,195
-He's not here.
-No one's here.

245
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,448
He's not in there.

246
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,199
Where on earth did he go?

247
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,994
-Let's pull out then.
-Okay.

248
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,332
REPORTER KIM MOO-JIN

249
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,127
The phone is turned off.

250
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,253
It's turned off.

251
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,589
Shall we list him as a missing person?

252
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,648
What's wrong?

253
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:44,237
No one would leave a new shirt
with a tag on it under a chair's wheels.

254
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,114
That's true, but…

255
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,199
Touch this.

256
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,705
-It's warm.
-Someone was here up until now.

257
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,957
They may still be here.

258
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,543
In the wardrobe, under the bed,
or between the furniture.

259
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,836
Let's check one more time.

260
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,486
Ji-won, you have a call.

261
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,125
Hello, Hee-seong.

262
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:28,420
Hey, do you know a reporter
named Kim Moo-jin?

263
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,422
The reporter, Kim Moo-jin?

264
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:35,010
Yes. He kept saying
that he and you know each other.

265
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:39,264
-Do you know him?
-Is he at your workshop now?

266
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,267
What is he…

267
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,769
Honey. Can you put him on the phone?

268
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,563
Oh, well…

269
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,150
He left his phone in his car,
so he went out to get it.

270
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,777
Should I tell him to call you
when he comes back?

271
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,947
No, tell him to come to my office.

272
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,699
Okay.

273
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,744
It's urgent, so tell him to hurry.

274
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:01,828
I will.

275
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,960
There's a thief. A thief!

276
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,088
Hang on. I hear something.

277
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,551
-Ji-won.
-Yes?

278
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,970
I think I'm running a fever.

279
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:22,641
What? Honey, make sure to get some rest.

280
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,560
-Should I ask Mom to make some porridge?
-No.

281
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,896
I'll just take pills and get some sleep.

282
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,399
Even if I don't answer your call,
don't worry.

283
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,317
Okay.

284
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,611
Ji-won, let's go.

285
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:35,737
Okay.

286
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,870
-Why? What's wrong?
-There's a thief up there.

287
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,165
There's no one.

288
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,833
I'm sure I saw someone.

289
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,452
Detective Choi, please look at this.

290
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,289
This is an alley
right next to the crime scene.

291
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,208
And it was right after the incident.

292
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,005
I have you now.

293
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:51,062
WHERE THE RISING STAR STAYS

294
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,413
Let go!

295
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,629
Get off me, you monster!

296
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,480
I need to go home.

297
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,899
-What?
-My husband is sick.

298
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,484
I should go check in on him.

299
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,611
Gosh, he's not a little kid.

300
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,572
If he's sick, he will take pills
or go to a doctor.

301
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,116
It won't take long. Just pull over there.

302
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,410
Is this Mr. Park Gyeong-chun speaking?

303
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:33,331
Hello, this is Detective Choi Jae-seop
from Gangsu Police Station.

304
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,416
At around 3:30 a.m. today,

305
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,336
you picked up a man in a raincoat
in Hoesin-dong, right?

306
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,464
You're a very important witness.

307
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,050
Sure. Thank you.

308
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,678
Please give me a call when you get here.

309
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,388
I'm back.

310
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,392
Where's the reporter, Mr. Kim?

311
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:55,270
Why are you asking me?
You went to look for him.

312
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,438
He didn't come here?

313
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,112
-Hello.
-Hello.

314
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,989
The workshop is closed again.

315
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:09,409
Is your husband okay? The workshop
has been closed quite often.

316
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,871
-Often?
-Yes.

317
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,414
-I'll come next time.
-Okay.

318
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:22,755
WHERE THE RISING STAR STAYS

319
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,270
What happened to your face?

320
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,606
Something happened.
It's no big deal, though.

321
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,401
-What happened?
-Detective Cha.

322
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,988
We're supposed to meet at your office.
What? Are you here to pick me up?

323
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,469
Hey.

324
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,181
Do you think you can get away with this?

325
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,850
How dare you deceive me?

326
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,603
Just kill me. Go ahead and kill me.

327
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,146
Kill me if you dare.

328
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,107
I'm a reporter.

329
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,944
My death will make even bigger news
than some village head.

330
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,537
I can't kill you.

331
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,249
The police are looking for you.

332
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,052
The police?

333
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:52,720
Why?

334
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,847
I don't know the details.

335
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,892
So you have to

336
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,603
go to the police station now.

337
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:05,942
Tidy up your hair
and wipe the blood off your wrists.

338
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,702
My gosh. So are you saying

339
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:20,415
that the tables have turned? Is that it?

340
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,335
Hey. Why would I do as you say?

341
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,296
Perhaps you forgot,

342
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,217
but you just tried to kill me.
You fucking psychopath.

343
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,851
First off, I'd like to hear

344
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:43,271
a polite and sincere apology.

345
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,072
We have no time.

346
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,998
If I head to the police station now,

347
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,585
I'll probably tell them the whole thing
to put you behind bars.

348
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,384
About the camcorder.

349
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,598
It was interesting.

350
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,190
What?

351
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,491
I'm sure it's here somewhere.

352
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,119
But it's not in his laptop.

353
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,578
This is so cool.

354
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,958
Kim Moo-jin, we have to hurry
and leave. We have no time.

355
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,629
If Dad finds out, he will kill me.

356
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,173
Hae-su, you look pretty on camera.

357
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:38,094
Hey, do you have a death wish?
I told you not to talk to her like that.

358
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:41,973
My future brother-in-law,
don't be so stiff.

359
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:45,184
-Shut it. Let's just go check it.
-I don't like him.

360
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,396
-There's no such thing as a ghost.
-I'm sure I heard something.

361
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,731
Just tell Moo-jin to go down by himself.

362
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,025
You're scared, aren't you?

363
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,444
Hey, you guys wait here.

364
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,488
I'll go interview the ghost.

365
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,282
Be careful.

366
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,536
All right. Reporter
Kim Moo-jin is coming in.

367
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,745
Follow me.

368
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,503
Gosh, what's this?

369
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,260
What? It's so spooky.

370
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,666
Did you watch it?

371
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,794
I'll keep the tape.

372
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,548
If the video is revealed,

373
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,468
you can't continue your career.

374
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,720
I mean,

375
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,515
you can't even live in Korea.

376
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,272
If you had made
a different choice back then,

377
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,152
the serial murder would've ended
then and there.

378
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,989
How many more people got killed?

379
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,207
I guess you watch the video often.

380
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:34,710
What?

381
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,633
Do you reminisce about the moment

382
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,594
and feel thrilled?

383
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,600
I'm not a monster like you.

384
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,394
So?

385
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,314
Will you do as I say?

386
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,068
Or should we destroy each other's lives?

387
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,917
What do you want me to do?

388
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,422
First off,

389
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,217
I'd like to hear a polite

390
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,304
and sincere apology.

391
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,321
Don't worry. I'm fine.

392
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:47,908
Mr. Kim.

393
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,496
I said, there was a reason for that.

394
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,665
Well, Mr. Baek will
explain the whole thing.

395
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:58,044
Kim Moo-jin, you're under arrest
without a warrant for assault

396
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,503
in accordance with Article 206.

397
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,172
Please talk to her, Mr. Baek.

398
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,423
Ji-won.

399
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,925
We've already made up.

400
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:08,387
And I'm the one who started it.
It's my fault.

401
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,724
I did something to upset him.

402
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,559
That's ridiculous.

403
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,728
You shouldn't be so nice to everyone.

404
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,273
He kept asking me for free stuff
in return for writing an article.

405
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,399
So I got mad.

406
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,277
I didn't know he and you knew each other.

407
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,530
I told him to leave
and pushed his shoulders.

408
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,199
It was my fault.

409
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,414
You just thought I was a scumbag, right?

410
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,583
Gosh, I've got so much to say,

411
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,710
but I don't know what to say.

412
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,382
I apologize again. I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.

413
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,968
I was being rude.

414
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,263
If I knew you two were acquainted,

415
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,182
I would've offered you some stuff.

416
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:56,394
My gosh. It's really…

417
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,437
It's just…

418
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,941
Mr. Kim, he apologized first
when he's the one beaten up.

419
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,859
Aren't you going to apologize?

420
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,408
I'm sorry.

421
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,745
Honey, does it hurt a lot?

422
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,747
Let me see your mouth. Open it.

423
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:17,748
Okay.

424
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,544
Detective Cha, why did you want to see me?

425
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:24,630
Ma'am?

426
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,590
You know Nam Sun-gil.

427
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,093
From Sungil Chinese Restaurant?

428
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,263
He got murdered early this morning.

429
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:44,150
Mr. Kim, this is Nam Sun-gil.

430
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,154
I forgot to tell you something earlier.

431
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,823
You'll be intrigued as well.

432
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,118
This is something I heard recently.

433
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,289
I heard that Do Hyeon-su
was in on it with his dad.

434
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,458
I mean, the serial killing.

435
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,210
Shocking, right?

436
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,173
That was exactly why I overreacted.

437
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:10,885
GIMBAP

438
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,641
Feel free to call me anytime
if you're interested…

439
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,105
Sir.

440
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,484
It's… It's Do Hyeon-su.

441
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,195
Do… Do Hyeon-su is here!

442
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,323
What did I tell you?
I said he'd take revenge on me!

443
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,205
The victim knew the killer.

444
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,665
He said Do Hyeon-su.

445
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:45,669
Who is Do Hyeon-su?
You seem to know who he is.

446
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,380
What? This is turning out
to be easier than we thought.

447
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,633
We just need to catch
the guy named Do Hyeon-su.

448
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,593
And Mr. Kim knows Do Hyeon-su.

449
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,011
Mr. Kim.

450
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:59,183
-What?
-Who's Do Hyeon-su?

451
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,687
Oh, well…

452
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,315
Right.

453
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:10,361
Have you heard of the name, Do Min-seok?

454
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:13,531
The killer of the Yeonju Serial Murder
Case? That Do Min-seok?

455
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,740
Yes.

456
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:19,245
Do Hyeon-su is a son of the serial killer
Do Min-seok.

457
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,750
I wrote an article about the two.

458
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:29,046
I used to live in the same neighborhood
as Do Min-seok.

459
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:31,715
Didn't it say that Do Hyeon-su killed

460
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:35,135
the village head and fled
three months after his father's death?

461
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,304
In Do Hyeon-su's backpack…

462
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,765
-Detective Kang. Did you find anything?
-Yes.

463
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,143
They found the weapon
used to kill the village head.

464
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,438
As far as I know,
he's still wanted because of the case.

465
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,691
That was 18 years ago,
but he's still at large?

466
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,402
Is this a long-term cold case?

467
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:55,072
So what's his connection with Nam Sun-gil?

468
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,035
After Nam Sun-gil read my article,

469
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,745
he called me for a tip-off.

470
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:05,207
From the fall of 2002,
for about three years,

471
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,252
they worked together at a Chinese
restaurant as deliverymen.

472
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,756
That's all I know.

473
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,174
I'm serious.

474
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:18,596
So what does it mean that Do Hyeon-su
did the killing with his father?

475
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,642
I think it's just a false rumor.

476
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,229
After Do Min-seok committed suicide,

477
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,440
there was this rumor
going around the town.

478
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,483
Why did such a rumor go around?

479
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:33,569
Well…

480
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,865
Because Do Hyeon-su was a little strange.

481
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,451
We didn't know the proper term back then,

482
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,786
so we just said he was possessed.

483
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:43,996
What term?

484
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,709
Antisocial personality disorder.

485
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,794
Why? What did he do?

486
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:56,050
Do Hyeon-su retaliated
against whoever got on his nerves.

487
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,969
Back then, I thought
he'd get better as he grew older.

488
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,639
But he hasn't changed… Anyway.

489
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,975
"Back then"? You sound
as if you still see him.

490
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,519
No. I just mean,

491
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,898
I didn't know I'd meet him again
because of a murder case like this.

492
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,984
I mean, I didn't know
I'd hear about him again.

493
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:23,827
Hello?

494
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,080
Okay.

495
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,917
Nam Sun-gil's wife,
Ms. Lee Gang-ok woke up.

496
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,508
You must be devastated,
but I need to ask you something.

497
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,679
Is there anyone who might
hold a grudge against your husband?

498
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:45,849
Do Hyeon-su.

499
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:47,935
What?

500
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:51,188
He got a threatening call every morning.

501
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:52,773
You…

502
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,526
You're Do Hyeon-su, aren't you?

503
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,862
I'm sure he said Do Hyeon-su.

504
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,787
Do you remember the customer
in a raincoat from early this morning?

505
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,874
He said he'd be right back,

506
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,877
so he asked me to wait there
for about 30 minutes.

507
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,087
So I waited.

508
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:19,383
And he did come back
about 30 minutes later.

509
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,885
So where did he get off?

510
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,262
It was

511
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,390
a residential area in Oseon-dong.

512
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,393
Oseon-dong? If it's Oseon-dong…

513
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,646
Near New Sun Villa?

514
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,940
How did you know?

515
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,608
That's where there are no CCTV cameras.

516
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:40,529
Oh, I see.

517
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,699
-Impressive.
-It's nothing.

518
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,953
Mr. Park Gyeong-chun, do you live alone?

519
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,581
How did you know that?

520
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:54,877
From the tumbler. You got it for free
when you bought single-serving beef soup.

521
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,755
I caught a glimpse of it on a shopping
channel, and I remember it.

522
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:58,964
My goodness.

523
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,926
Gosh, you're unbelievable. How did you…

524
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,178
Stop that.

525
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,640
Is there anything else you remember?

526
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:12,186
Like the way he spoke or his tattoos.

527
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,522
Some kind of smell or his job.

528
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,732
His job?

529
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:20,027
Would this help?

530
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,449
What do you do for a living?

531
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,582
He said he does the same thing
as his father does.

532
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,130
Dad.

533
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:42,841
Yes?

534
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,468
Did you just think of egg tarts?

535
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,970
No. Why?

536
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,639
Then why were you smiling?

537
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,560
Was I smiling?

538
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,895
Yes.

539
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,942
I guess that's because I liked the tea.

540
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,571
You did a good job.

541
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,329
I'll keep the tape.

542
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:13,372
Damn it.

543
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,084
This is nuts.

544
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,215
Gosh, my whole body aches.

545
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,012
There's no place like home.

546
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,727
I'm sure Do Hyeon-su
met Nam Sun-gil yesterday.

547
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,775
That can't be right. He isn't that bad.

548
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,197
I should call the police.

549
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,745
Forget it. I'll be locked up again.

550
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:57,082
Just don't do that. Gosh.

551
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,752
But he went instead of me.

552
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,088
What if I get blamed for that?

553
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:07,509
CHA JI-WON

554
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,974
MS. KANG

555
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,727
THE HANJOOGAN

556
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,565
Drink it. That's the finest Luwak.

557
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:24,026
You know, the coffee from cat feces.

558
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,404
The cats frolicking in the open field

559
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,198
ate the beans whenever they wanted,
and defecated whenever they wanted.

560
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,117
It's all natural. Drink it.

561
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,918
Why are you being like this?

562
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,337
You know why. Because I adore you.

563
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,796
What?

564
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,591
I know you'll break a scoop soon.

565
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:50,177
Who will? Me?

566
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,347
Don't you dare play innocent.
I know it, you punk.

567
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:56,767
I have my eyes and ears everywhere.

568
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:05,984
Today at 3:00 a.m., an armed assailant
entered the victim's Chinese restaurant.

569
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,527
Even before the victim resisted--

570
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,280
The murder case in Hoesin-dong

571
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,659
and the serial murder case in Yeonju
from 18 years ago.

572
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,119
You knew they were connected, didn't you?

573
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,623
There's something, right?
Is it something big?

574
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,125
-Gosh, this is--
-Do you want a team?

575
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,252
-Ms. Kang.
-Why?

576
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,254
Do you still need to work it alone?

577
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,924
I just got involved in this by chance,

578
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,425
so I have no plan…

579
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:34,638
Wait. Was it 3:00 a.m.?

580
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:45,190
Today at 3:00 a.m., an armed assailant
entered the victim's Chinese restaurant.

581
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:46,274
Hyeon-su.

582
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,277
I won't tell anyone.

583
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,364
I promise.

584
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,039
I don't want your promise.
I want a guarantee.

585
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,249
Do you understand?

586
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,844
It wasn't him.

587
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,137
What?

588
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,265
-Ms. Kang.
-Yes?

589
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,975
I think…

590
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,228
I have a scoop.

591
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:32,237
REFRESHING RICE SOUP
MADE WITH DRIED POLLACK

592
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,244
-Do you want to try it?
-Yes.

593
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,081
Here.

594
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,879
-It's so refreshing.
-I used dried pollack for the broth.

595
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:51,923
What are you doing?

596
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,134
-What?
-Are you hungry?

597
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:59,473
No. This looks just like what my husband
made. I thought it was strange.

598
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,767
Most dishes look pretty much the same.

599
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:06,772
I'm sorry for making you wait.
Please have a seat here.

600
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:15,113
Sun-gil and Hyeon-su worked here
for about three years.

601
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:18,950
Do you have the account number
you wired Do Hyeon-su's salary to?

602
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,411
We're urgently looking for him right now.

603
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:26,917
Actually, Hyeon-su didn't have any ID,

604
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,251
so I paid him in cash.

605
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,712
Did you pay him properly?

606
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,881
Of course, I did.

607
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,967
Sun-gil even saved up ten million won.

608
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,886
You should go ask him.

609
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:40,680
Ten million won?
What are you talking about?

610
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,767
Sun-gil wanted to learn to cook,

611
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,019
so I sold my recipe for ten million won

612
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,396
and helped him open a restaurant.

613
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,441
What about Do Hyeon-su?
What happened to him?

614
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:56,113
That ungrateful punk. He just
disappeared without saying goodbye.

615
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:00,909
I always thought he was a little inhumane.

616
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,871
One day, I fell down in the hall,
and he laughed watching it.

617
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,666
So I asked why he was laughing,

618
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,711
and he said the noise I made
falling down sounded funny.

619
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,089
Because Do Hyeon-su was a little strange.

620
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,758
We didn't know the proper term back then,

621
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,344
so we just said he was possessed.

622
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:20,512
What term?

623
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,515
Antisocial personality disorder.

624
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,226
That crazy brat.

625
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:30,939
I still can't forget his face.

626
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,595
-What the hell are you doing?
-I need your money.

627
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:03,889
You bastard.

628
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,364
Hyeon-su.

629
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,658
Hyeon-su.

630
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:27,454
I must've lost my mind for a moment.

631
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,914
Please spare me.

632
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,458
I'll kill you.

633
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:35,086
You're not capable of killing a person.

634
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,130
You can't do this, Hyeon-su.

635
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,425
You still don't know me, do you?

636
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,183
Kill him.

637
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,425
Hyeon-su.

638
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,598
Kill him.

639
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,611
Dad.

640
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:28,867
Are you upset because I spilled juice?

641
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:34,456
No, Daddy is not upset.

642
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,884
Eun-ha, will you go
watch TV in the living room?

643
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:48,094
-I need to take this call.
-Okay.

644
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,523
-What?
-I'm important to you.

645
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:01,858
I'm your alibi.

646
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:03,193
What are you talking about?

647
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:06,237
Right. You wouldn't kill someone
making a fuss like that.

648
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,907
I've been there. That's not what you do.

649
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:13,161
So you haven't learned your lesson yet.
What's with the jibber-jabber?

650
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:15,580
Let's meet. We need to talk in person.

651
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:18,833
I told you not to come near me ever again.

652
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,836
Nam Sun-gil, whom you met yesterday,
died. Don't you feel anything?

653
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,505
Of course, I do.

654
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:26,174
Someone who was bothering me got killed.

655
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:28,176
I feel like celebrating with champagne.

656
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,677
Do you really not know anything?

657
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,306
If you get on my nerves again,

658
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,767
I'll come to see you, okay?

659
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:01,709
Hey, this is a murder case.

660
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,169
She's here. Watch your mouth.

661
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:05,547
Who are you, mister?

662
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,133
Hi, I'm your dad's friend.

663
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:10,969
We don't have time for this.

664
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,639
Watch.

665
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:19,144
Today at 3:00 a.m., an armed assailant
entered the victim's Chinese restaurant.

666
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:23,481
Even before the victim resisted,
he was assaulted brutally.

667
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:27,193
The police have identified Do,
who used to work with the victim,

668
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,528
as a suspect…

669
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,906
Who do you think the Do is?

670
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,786
Before Nam Sun-gil was killed,
he spotted you…

671
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,788
I mean, Do Hyeon-su as the criminal.

672
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,291
What's Do Hyeon-su?

673
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:46,880
-Well…
-Outside.

674
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:54,012
Darn it.

675
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,264
What's going on?

676
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,477
Who killed the village head 18 years ago?

677
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:04,397
I said it was me. Why are you asking that?

678
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:06,149
What about Nam Sun-gil?

679
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:08,693
It wasn't me.

680
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,615
Sure. You can murder,
but you can never lie.

681
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:14,949
What an honest bastard.

682
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,123
What are you trying to pull now?

683
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,626
Get off me.

684
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:26,377
I can't tell you if you don't let go.

685
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,263
Do you want to explain in the basement?

686
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,934
Nam Sun-gil was being
threatened by Do Hyeon-su.

687
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,102
Was it you? Did you threaten him?

688
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,437
Why would I?

689
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,066
I hadn't even thought of him
until I met you.

690
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:52,737
The killer knows Do Hyeon-su well enough
to make Sun-gil mistake him.

691
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,822
And Do Hyeon-su must know
the killer as well.

692
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:58,701
Who would it be? Who would
hold a grudge against you?

693
00:58:58,785 --> 00:58:59,911
Think about it.

694
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:03,623
I don't know.

695
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:07,544
You do. There must be
someone in your memory.

696
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,506
Look.

697
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:15,260
"Yeonju Serial Murder Case" is the most
searched word online now.

698
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,805
Then "Do Min-seok's Son"
and "Chinese Restaurant Murder Case."

699
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,431
Look. This is crazy.

700
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:23,059
1. YEONJU SERIAL MURDER CASE
2. DO MIN-SEOK'S SON

701
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,317
You seem to find this interesting.

702
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:32,819
Hyeon-su.

703
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:35,446
I mean, Mr. Baek Hee-seong.

704
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:39,367
We can figure out the truth
of this case before anyone else does.

705
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:40,952
This is huge.

706
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:44,080
Is it? Fine.

707
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:46,082
But for whom?

708
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:47,917
What?

709
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:52,005
Well, that's for both of us.

710
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,799
We should share information.

711
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:57,510
You can clear your name,
and I can write an exclusive.

712
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,138
It's good for both of us.
One hand washes the other.

713
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:06,352
In Seoul, a man in his 40s
who had a pregnant wife got killed

714
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:10,106
in the same way as the victims of
a serial murder case from 18 years ago.

715
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,567
This must be resolved.

716
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:16,821
Once the police get stuck into the case,
it won't be hard for them to find you.

717
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,667
Who on earth was it?

718
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,299
EXCLUSIVE: CHINESE RESTAURANT
OWNER IN HIS FORTIES…

719
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,130
Make sure not to skip meals.

720
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,132
-Okay. Thank you.
-Bye.

721
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:20,677
The police are trying their best.

722
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,096
Meanwhile, Do is the main suspect

723
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:27,016
in the Gagyeong-ri village head's
murder case from 18 years ago.

724
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,228
It has shocked people
that he's still at large.

725
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:34,148
When Do Hyeon-su disappeared in 2005,

726
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,859
Nam Sun-gil suddenly showed up
with ten million won.

727
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:40,488
And Nam Sun-gil feared Do Hyeon-su
until the moment he got killed.

728
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:42,949
I believe they had resentment
against each other

729
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,659
that involved a money issue.

730
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:47,829
But what's this photo of Do Hyeon-su?

731
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,622
This is his middle school
graduation photo.

732
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:55,002
In 2002, when Do Hyeon-su was 18,
he murdered the village head and fled.

733
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,546
And he set his house on fire.

734
01:01:57,171 --> 01:02:00,174
I think he tried
to get rid of all traces of himself.

735
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:03,302
He was quite unsociable,
so he had no friends.

736
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:07,056
No one investigating the case
could find a single photo of him.

737
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,809
We'll have to make a composite sketch

738
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:12,270
with the help of No Man-sik,
who saw him most recently.

739
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:13,771
He's like a ghost.

740
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:19,652
He didn't have his ID issued. So he has
no record of credit cards, cell phones,

741
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,613
or bank transactions made under his name.

742
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:24,449
How on earth is he living?

743
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:25,783
What about his family?

744
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:42,884
Let me do it.

745
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,473
Why are they talking about you on TV?

746
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:51,017
What kind of trouble
have you been causing?

747
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:54,395
I'm looking into it now.

748
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:56,272
You're supposed to keep a low profile.

749
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:58,649
How could you get yourself
involved in a murder case?

750
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,026
Are you out of your mind?

751
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,360
I have nothing to do with it.

752
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:05,031
If I'd known you were so careless,

753
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,909
I would never have made you
live as Baek Hee-seong.

754
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,490
Hee-seong.

755
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,472
BAEK HEE-SEONG

756
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:12,598
APPLICATION FOR ID CARD

757
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,186
BAEK HEE-SEONG, DO HYEON-SU

758
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:55,600
Didn't I tell you? I warned you.

759
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:57,810
The killer was caught on CCTV

760
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,395
and his blood was found at the scene.

761
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:00,605
The case will be solved.

762
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:03,566
Chasing after Do Hyeon-su won't
lead them to Baek Hee-seong.

763
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:05,735
Do Min-seok had a daughter.

764
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:08,237
I haven't seen our Hyeon-su in 18 years.

765
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,697
How many times do I have to tell you?

766
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,909
You know Ms. Oh Bok-ja? She has a photo
of you from five years ago.

767
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:15,620
The police are on their way
to get that photo.

768
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:16,954
Detective Cha is on it.

769
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:18,623
Your wife is coming to catch you.

770
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,627
Do Hyeon-su!

771
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:28,883
