"A police officer
may not use any weapons…"

6
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:51,718
Can you show me your ID?

7
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,976
BAEK HEE-SEONG

8
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,227
Born in 1982?

9
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,398
You look very young.

10
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,319
Are you new here?

11
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,155
How did you know?

12
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,035
I've never seen you around here.

13
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,085
This neighborhood is a good place
for me to start afresh.

14
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,586
It's quiet.

15
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:51,694
This time, let's take a look
at a happy face.

16
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,030
You shouldn't exaggerate it.

17
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,698
Can you see what's different?

18
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,661
First, wrinkles form around your eyes.

19
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:05,333
Second, your cheeks rise.

20
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:06,751
Third,

21
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:11,005
the wrinkles around your eyes move.

22
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,179
What do you think?
You look quite happy, don't you?

23
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,315
My goodness.

24
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,199
Why are you up so early?

25
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,784
Honey, I had a dream.

26
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,703
Was it nice?

27
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,539
I dreamed of when we first met.

28
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,711
Is this nurungji soup? It looks so good.

29
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,880
-Do you want to try?
-Yes.

30
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,009
Here.

31
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,722
It's so refreshing.

32
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,391
I used dried pollack for the broth.

33
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,893
I see.

34
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,854
-I'm all done.
-Do you need any help?

35
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,024
Can you get some sliced radish kimchi
from the fridge?

36
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,192
Sure.

37
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,364
Is this it?

38
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,701
This is not it either. Is it this one?

39
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,748
This is young radish kimchi.

40
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:12,460
Leave it. I'll do it.
Can you wake up Eun-ha and get her washed?

41
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,295
Sure.

42
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,595
-Mom.
-Yes?

43
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,223
Who's taller? Su-yeong or me?

44
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,600
Which one was Su-yeong again?

45
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,436
There's no point in talking with you.

46
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,605
Let's dry your hair now.

47
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,233
It's so hot when you do it.

48
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,944
I'm going to ask Dad to do it.

49
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,696
He's good.

50
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,823
I can be good at it, too.

51
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,701
You're not good at anything.

52
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,247
Of course, I am.
I'm good at so many things.

53
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,501
-Dad. Dry my hair, please.
-Where's Mom?

54
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,629
She told me to keep it secret.

55
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,758
Come on, we promised not to keep
any secrets from each other.

56
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,343
Oh, you're right.

57
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,179
Where's your mom?

58
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,392
Mom went to clean up
your workshop for you.

59
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,394
What?

60
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,652
WHERE THE RISING STAR STAYS

61
00:05:58,816 --> 00:05:59,817
Ji-won.

62
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,655
Did you break a teacup?

63
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,866
Didn't you cherish this one?

64
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,873
Yes. I was a bit careless.

65
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,834
-Give it to me. You'll hurt yourself.
-Goodness.

66
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,337
Let's go eat. The food will get cold.

67
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,882
-Whom did you drink with?
-Just a customer.

68
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,763
I doubt that.

69
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,391
I bet you were happy to see them.

70
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,645
-Why do you say that?
-That's what you do.

71
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,939
You serve cold drinks
if you want to make it brief

72
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,649
and hot drinks if you want to chat.

73
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,485
Oh, do I do that?

74
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,196
I know you better than you do.

75
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,574
Whom did you drink tea
and chat with for so long?

76
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,994
There aren't many people
you're close with.

77
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,414
It was just a friend.

78
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,875
What friend? Did they come to our wedding?

79
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,962
No, he was an old friend
from middle school.

80
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,047
We met by coincidence.

81
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,924
Seriously?

82
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,261
But didn't you say you didn't have
any friends back then?

83
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,681
I didn't, but it was nice
to see him again.

84
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,474
See?

85
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,602
That's exactly why I told you
to attend those reunions.

86
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,772
Right. I came down here
to wipe down the furniture.

87
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,110
I'm famished. Let's eat first, okay?

88
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,671
What's with that gaze?

89
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,133
You must still love me so dearly.

90
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,472
Isn't the weather amazing today?

91
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,725
Look at you changing the subject.

92
00:07:56,225 --> 00:08:00,021
You've changed a lot, Baek Hee-seong.
You weren't like this.

93
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,267
Ma'am, it's me.

94
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,395
Ma'am.

95
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,565
She didn't even lock the door.

96
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,504
Oh, my God!

97
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,952
What is all this?

98
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,581
FORENSIC SCIENCE

99
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,709
Why are her thumbnails missing?

100
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,670
This is horrendous.

101
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,507
-The Yeonju Serial Murder Case.
-What?

102
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:56,262
Look. Both her thumbnails are missing.

103
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,682
This is so similar to the Yeonju
Serial Murder Case that happened in 2002.

104
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,436
All seven victims were missing
their thumbnails.

105
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,023
You mean the case
Reporter Kim Moo-jin told us about?

106
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,609
-Yes.
-Why don't I know about this?

107
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,777
The killer committed suicide
before we could catch him

108
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,446
and the case was closed.

109
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,156
Then there was the World Cup.

110
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,410
So this killer copied a murder case
from 18 years ago?

111
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,662
But why?

112
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,040
-Well…
-Mom!

113
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,959
Let me go. Mom!

114
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,546
Let me go, you bastards!
Let go! Why would my mom die?

115
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,465
Move aside! Let go, you assholes!

116
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,550
Mom! I'm here!

117
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,094
Mom! Why would you die?

118
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,764
Mom… Mom!

119
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:44,310
WHERE THE RISING STAR STAYS

120
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,624
Hyeon-su, what are you doing?

121
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,043
Why are you doing this to me?

122
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:56,173
You do know that this is a crime, right?

123
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,218
Do you remember?

124
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,346
Eighteen years ago,

125
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,182
it was the other way round.

126
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,559
Hold him down!

127
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,810
DO HYEON-SU

128
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,312
-Let me go!
-Push him.

129
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,315
-Hey, hold him down.
-I am.

130
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,776
-Let me go!
-Shut up!

SUMMER 2002

132
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,326
Hyeon-su.

133
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,621
Did you think you'd get away with this?

134
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,416
I should've snapped your neck.

135
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,752
Lower your eyes!

136
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,632
Don't hold back.

137
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,553
Because next time,
I really will crush your skull.

138
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,349
Be honest. You've seen it, haven't you?

139
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,853
You've seen your dad kill someone, right?

140
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,398
Did you really not know?

141
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,901
Or are you pretending not to know?

142
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,237
If not, then are the rumors true?

143
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,866
Were you in on it?

144
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,744
You're afraid of me,

145
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,330
aren't you?

146
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,258
The village head said

147
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,470
it's all thanks to your dad
that you're so weird.

148
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,431
He said you'll end up like your dad
if we let you be.

149
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,392
What do you think?

150
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:33,854
Hyeon-su.

151
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,273
If it hurts, don't hold it in. Tell me.

152
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,443
It'll be more fun for me that way.

153
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,196
Kim Moo-jin.

154
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,490
Remember this.

155
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,576
You're next.

156
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,414
Throw it.

157
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,669
And now, after 18 years,

158
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,796
it's your turn.

159
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:00,965
Hyeon-su.

160
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,443
If it hurts a lot,

161
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,363
don't hold it in. Tell me.

162
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,533
Hyeon-su.

163
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,955
It'll be more fun for me that way.

164
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,256
We were kids.

165
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,261
We're all like that when we're young.

166
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,557
It wasn't just me.

167
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,648
I'm just joking.

168
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,110
If I really wanted to kill you,

169
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,195
I would've put some vinyl on the floor.

170
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,280
Hyeon-su.

171
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,825
What do you want from me?

172
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,162
If it's money, I can get it for you. Okay?

173
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,750
I'm…

174
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,795
really scared and tired.

175
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,132
I can't feel anything in my arms or legs.

176
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,805
Moo-jin.

177
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,769
I'm just like my dad.

178
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,647
What?

179
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,399
You can try to get sympathy from me,

180
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,277
but I don't feel anything.

181
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,202
So don't cry.

182
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,705
It'll only make me
want to find some vinyl.

183
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,133
My phone.

184
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,888
Don't make me say things twice
from now on.

185
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,183
What's the passcode?

186
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,730
There's fuchsia-colored discoloration
on her back.

187
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,608
It means she was lying still
for eight to nine hours.

188
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,736
I see no ligature marks.

189
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,280
That rope was just for show.

190
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,493
She was stabbed and slashed
in eight different places.

191
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,455
I believe she bled out
due to the multiple stab wounds.

192
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,418
I see no traces of bleeding here.

193
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,546
Her ankle was fractured after she died.

194
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,049
So the killer broke it after she died?

195
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,259
That's right.

196
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,513
I believe her thumbnails were removed
after she died as well.

197
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:58,726
Why do you think
the killer only took her thumbnails?

198
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,895
If they were afraid of leaving
their DNA or other traces,

199
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,356
they would've had to remove
the other fingernails as well.

200
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,526
This is similar to that case from before.

201
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,361
What was it called again?

202
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,781
-The Yeonju Serial Murder Case?
-Yes.

203
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,035
The killer's name was

204
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,620
Do Min-seok.

205
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,206
He collected his victim's fingernails.

206
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,500
As souvenirs, if you will.

207
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,422
What is this?

208
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,883
This isn't blood.

209
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,427
Give me the kit, please.

210
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,477
A copycat of the serial killings?

211
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,687
That doesn't exist in Korea.

212
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,649
The MO is exactly the same
as that of the Yeonju case.

213
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,318
That's just the killer's disguise.

214
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,362
This was nothing but manslaughter
by someone who knew her.

215
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,909
Based on the food left in her stomach,

216
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:00,829
the killer and she were eating apples
when she was killed.

217
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,707
But you know what?
We found the peels at the crime scene,

218
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,876
but the knife just disappeared.

219
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,212
I'm positive
that knife was the murder weapon.

220
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,716
While eating some apples,
they got into an argument.

221
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,886
The killer became enraged and…
That's what happened.

222
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,847
If this was premeditated, the killer
would've brought the weapon.

223
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,349
Exactly.

224
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,684
What about the CCTV cameras?

225
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,853
There's one in front of the house,
but it's broken.

226
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,396
Any financial issues?

227
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,650
She's lent around 20 million won in total.

228
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:33,112
She ran a gimbap store,
and lent money to those at the market.

229
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,571
And they paid back daily.

230
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,198
She was quite well off.

231
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,659
According to the social worker
who found her body,

232
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,577
she even donated
to the Gangsu Community Center.

233
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,954
And a lot, at that.

234
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,622
How much?

235
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,500
It was about 370 million won.

236
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,211
She donated a large sum.

237
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:53,257
That's why we've been giving her
special attention.

238
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,343
I can't believe this.

239
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:05,435
Could you elaborate
on the "special attention" part?

240
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,021
You can take it literally.

241
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,150
She was quite old and lived alone,

242
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,403
so we made sure
to regularly check in on her.

243
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,697
She owned a shopping quarter.

244
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,075
I believe she had
over a billion won under her name.

245
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,536
-Did she have family?
-One son.

246
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,413
GIMBAP

247
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,382
Damn it.

248
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,268
Detective Cha, why are you so quiet?

249
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,771
Why Do Min-seok?

250
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,649
What do you mean?

251
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:56,528
Unlike other serial killers,
the media never covered him.

252
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,406
It hadn't even gone cold
like the Hwaseong case,

253
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,866
so it wasn't famous either.

254
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:02,951
So why him?

255
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,330
Is that important right now?

256
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,208
The reporter, Kim Moo-jin.

257
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,255
It's because of the article he wrote.

258
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:22,221
Ms. Kang, I'm afraid I won't be
showing up for work today.

259
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,891
What do you mean? Don't talk
like you came to work every day.

260
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,061
I'll make sure to come tomorrow.

261
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,896
Don't be ridiculous.

262
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,732
You know I hate it when
you're sitting around doing nothing.

263
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,567
Just make sure you meet your deadline.

264
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,822
-Ms. Kang, listen. I'm locked--
-I'm busy. Bye.

265
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,290
Since it's a weekly newspaper,
Friday must be your deadline.

266
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,086
That means I have at least three days
until someone reports you missing.

267
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,381
Hyeon-su, hear me out first. Please?

268
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,967
-I'm listening.
-Okay.

269
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,639
This is the basement
of Mr. Baek Hee-seong's workshop, right?

270
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,810
-Go on.
-And you must work here.

271
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,603
Right.

272
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:16,024
Yesterday…
I was supposed to meet him here.

273
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,528
Why? Because I was
introduced to him by his wife.

274
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,406
And his wife…

275
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,617
is a detective.

276
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,911
In the Violent Crimes Unit, at that.

277
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,083
Do you still not get it?

278
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,086
It's only a matter of time
until you get caught.

279
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,474
Moo-jin.

280
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,561
Do you still not know

281
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,605
why you're locked in here?

282
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,152
I've been wanted for the past 18 years,

283
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,113
so how do you think I'm still at large?

284
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,375
Don't tell me…

285
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,838
you're Baek Hee-seong.

286
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,010
You're Detective Cha Ji-won's husband?

287
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,265
Why?

288
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,270
Yesterday, you told me
you had nothing to do

289
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,897
with the village head's murder.

290
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,108
Do you want to know the truth?

291
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,196
You won't be able to un-hear it.

292
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,281
What?

293
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,746
No. I don't think I want to know.

294
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,164
Moo-jin.

295
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,542
You see…

296
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,005
I know who killed our village head.

297
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,217
I'm not interested in finding out.

298
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,513
Aren't you curious?

299
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,933
Don't do this.

300
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,980
It was…

301
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,733
No. I won't hear it. Don't tell me.

302
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,236
I don't want to hear it.

303
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,162
You're right.

304
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,873
It was me.

305
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,754
DO HYEON-SU

306
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:56,351
Hyeon-su, don't do this.

307
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,395
Don't.

308
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,605
Give that

309
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:02,357
to me.

310
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,318
Hae-su.

311
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,363
You shouldn't do this.

312
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,615
This doesn't feel too bad.

313
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:43,023
YEONJU SERIAL MURDER CASE

314
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,991
YEONJU POLICE STATION

315
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,787
I found it. Look, Ji-won.

316
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:02,167
Mr. Kim's been writing this special series

317
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,170
on Korea's most wicked criminals.

318
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,214
The most recent article
was about Do Min-seok.

319
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,883
So you think the killer read this

320
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,468
and decided to copy him?

321
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,719
Listen to this.

322
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,848
"Do Min-seok's victims
had some similarities."

323
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,601
"They all had a noose around their necks

324
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,187
and permanent physical injuries
to one of their ankles."

325
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,272
"However, the most shocking discovery

326
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,275
was that all of their thumbnails
had been removed."

327
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,695
So? It's similar
to Jung Mun-ok's case, right?

328
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,075
However, if you fact-check the article,

329
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,826
the story changes completely.

330
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,871
First, it wasn't a noose
around the victims' necks.

331
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,751
It was a leash for large dogs
made by the brand Hound Dog.

332
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,462
He only chose ones with specific patterns.

333
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,173
But since the police didn't mention
the brand or the patterns,

334
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,591
the killer probably didn't know.

335
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,552
But if this was a copycat,

336
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:57,472
they would've known
that Do Min Seok used a dog leash.

337
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,977
The article said that the victims' ankles
were permanently damaged.

338
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,730
But in fact, they weren't fractured.
Their Achilles tendons were torn.

339
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:10,360
Simply put, the killer doesn't know much
about Do Min-seok.

340
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,240
Maybe it's not a copycat.
Maybe it's a disguise.

341
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:19,077
Then Detective Choi was right.

342
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,413
The killer definitely had a motive.

343
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:24,833
That's why they wanted to cover it up,
am I right?

344
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,668
But why Do Min-seok?

345
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,379
Because…

346
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:32,215
the article about Do Min-seok

347
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,884
was most recently released to the public.

348
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,639
KINDERGARTEN DIRECTOR

349
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,394
Hello, ma'am.

350
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:48,189
Ms. Cha, we have a problem.
You should come right away.

351
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,598
POWER OFF

352
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,334
YOU HAVE 2 MISSED CALLS

353
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,503
JI-WON
EUN-HA'S KINDERGARTEN

354
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,138
Hey!

355
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,183
Where is my mom's ledger?

356
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,518
What?

357
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,853
Come on. I need some cash right now.

358
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,438
I don't know.

359
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,232
How would I know that?

360
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,733
Then who would?

361
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,111
I know my mom told you everything.

362
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,822
You should wake up.

363
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,408
Do you know how worried she was about you?

364
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,120
Hey, stop messing with me
and give me the ledger.

365
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,663
It's mine now anyway.

366
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:30,500
Mr. An Jong-gu,
your mother passed away today.

367
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,252
Act like a decent human being.

368
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:33,670
What?

369
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,549
-You little…
-Hey, what are you doing?

370
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,260
It's still broad daylight.

371
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,596
Gambling?

372
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,348
Yes.

373
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:49,561
Ms. Jung was very worried
about his gambling addiction.

374
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,524
By the way, what brings you here?

375
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:57,861
Oh, I was wondering
if she had any enemies.

376
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,529
I thought you'd know.

377
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,408
I heard a serial killer did this.

378
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,619
-Is that not true?
-The killer was trying to deceive us.

379
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,246
By making it look like that.

380
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,789
But it was quite lousy.

381
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:12,417
The killer stabbed her many times.

382
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,587
Amateurs usually have a hard time
landing critical blows,

383
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,547
so they end up stabbing around--

384
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,715
Please stop.

385
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,093
It's too hard to listen to.

386
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,096
I'm sorry.

387
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,728
Detective.

388
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,315
I don't know if this could be helpful.

389
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,944
But last night, Ms. Jung called me

390
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,946
and asked about her will.

391
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,448
Her will?

392
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,994
She'd written one and wanted
to know how to get it notarized.

393
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:53,792
I told her I'd come over today
and explain. Then we hung up.

394
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,836
A will?

395
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,231
Kids can get into fights and get hurt.

396
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,901
Su-yeong, apologize to Eun-ha.

397
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,862
Eun-ha, forgive her and make up. Okay?

398
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,698
No. Su-yeong isn't going to apologize.

399
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,325
Sorry?

400
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:31,454
But Su-yeong gave her a bloody nose.

401
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,582
Eun-ha touched her belongings first.

402
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,918
I'll pay for the hospital fee.

403
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,671
But I don't think
we can apologize for this.

404
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,340
I just

405
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:46,052
hugged the doll one time
because it's pretty.

406
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:51,933
Ma'am, this is a fight between children.
Let's not make this more than it is.

407
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,228
I think it's best that they make up.

408
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,855
Ms. Cha.

409
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:01,234
You need to teach your kid
not to steal while they're still young.

410
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,736
Ma'am, that's a bit harsh.

411
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,072
There's even an old proverb.

412
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,241
-One who steals an egg--
-Will steal an ox.

413
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,118
What did you just say?

414
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,709
TINY BIRD KINDERGARTEN

415
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,509
I heard from one of the teachers outside.

416
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,348
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

417
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,058
This won't happen again.

418
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,269
Sorry?

419
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,771
Well, okay.

420
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,400
Eun-ha.

421
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,862
Apologize to Su-yeong.

422
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,992
-Honey.
-Baek Eun-ha.

423
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:52,911
Now.

424
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:59,167
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

425
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,631
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

426
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,677
Ma'am, I was wrong.

427
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,607
Don't you care about Eun-ha's feelings?

428
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,109
How could you apologize back there?

429
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,070
Are we pushovers or what?

430
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,614
It's true that she touched her doll first.

431
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:32,367
That doesn't give her the right
to punch Eun-ha in the face.

432
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,243
Can you honestly understand that?

433
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,746
It's impossible to understand everyone.

434
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,581
We should focus on fixing the problem.

435
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,792
"Fixing"?
Is this your definition of "fixing"?

436
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:44,754
What are you going to do with Eun-ha?
She hasn't said a word this entire time.

437
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:48,091
You're like her hero.
Imagine how hurt she must be.

438
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,019
Ji-won.

439
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,983
-Did I make a big mistake?
-Whatever. I'm so upset.

440
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,986
I'm sorry for making you feel that way.

441
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:12,740
This is my first time being a dad,
so it's not easy either.

442
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,037
All right, then. From now on,

443
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:22,333
I'll ask you what I should do in advance
and do as you say.

444
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,501
As if you would.

445
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,795
Just make Eun-ha feel better.

446
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:29,465
Don't worry about that.
Leave that up to me.

447
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,135
Don't smile. You're annoying me.

448
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,851
Detective Cha
from Gangsu Station speaking.

449
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:43,354
We received the analysis result
of the substance on her thumb.

450
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,772
It's lipstick.

451
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,607
Lipstick?

452
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,903
But she wasn't wearing any makeup.

453
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,077
Why aren't you eating?

454
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,248
This is an egg tart, your favorite.

455
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,334
I like you more than egg tarts.

456
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:09,547
But you like Su-yeong more than me.

457
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,716
Come on, that's not true.

458
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,885
You sided with her.

459
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,847
I'm on your side.

460
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,267
That's why I've made you into a good girl.

461
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,020
Your reputation has gotten better.

462
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,855
What is that?

463
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:32,445
It means you won't be suspected
when something bad happens.

464
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,198
If you have a bad reputation,

465
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,991
people will suspect you first.

466
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:43,247
As of today, Su-yeong's family
will have a bad reputation.

467
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,249
I don't care.

468
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,544
I was the only one who apologized
and got a bloody nose.

469
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,879
This is unfair.

470
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,340
Don't feel that way.

471
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,968
A while ago, I saw Su-yeong crying

472
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:59,263
on her way home because she lost her doll.

473
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,556
Really?

474
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,743
She didn't take care
of her belongings well.

475
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,747
You shouldn't be like her, okay?

476
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,750
Okay.

477
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,838
All right. Let's eat now.

478
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,600
-It's good.
-Is it?

479
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,813
Then should we have one more?

480
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,523
Yes.

481
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:55,194
Dad, you're my favorite person
in the whole wide world.

482
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:56,779
Me too.

483
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:11,085
"If I die, please donate all my assets
to Gangsu Community Center

484
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:14,881
in return for holding
my memorial service."

485
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,465
"Signed by Jung Mun-ok."

486
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,386
Is… Is this real?

487
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,514
We found it in a box hidden in the closet.

488
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,975
-Her ledger was in there as well.
-Damn it.

489
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,144
This doesn't make any sense!

490
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,646
Hold on.

491
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:35,359
I'm positive that that bitch
convinced her to write this.

492
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,819
That little bitch…

493
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:41,365
Last night at around 10:30 p.m.,
you were at Ms. Jung's place, right?

494
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,660
Someone testified
that they heard you arguing.

495
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,290
Are you suspecting me?

496
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:55,713
When you found out that your mother
was going to donate all of her assets,

497
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,383
you must've been furious.

498
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,265
Do you have proof?

499
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,230
Do you have proof
that it was me who killed her?

500
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,690
When did you leave her home last night?

501
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,570
What time?

502
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:21,656
Damn it.

503
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,784
What do you take me for?

504
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,622
Listen, if you want me here
at the station again,

505
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:30,998
go get a warrant first.

506
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:32,750
Okay?

507
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,963
This is bullshit.

508
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,593
I didn't know you were this slow-witted.

509
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,262
Look who's talking.

510
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,934
This is Jung Mun-ok's will.

511
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:53,729
She wants to donate all of her assets
to the community center.

512
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,106
She wrote this yesterday.

513
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:58,484
She wrote it on the day she was murdered,
yet it isn't important?

514
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,611
Jae-seop, hear me out.

515
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,946
Why Do Min-seok?

516
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:06,325
That's just a disguise to hide
their real motive for murder.

517
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,328
No. The killer had to remove
Ms. Jung's thumbnails

518
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,789
because there was something left
underneath them.

519
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,041
It was the killer's lipstick.

520
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,960
Lipstick is full of one's DNA.

521
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,837
There was lipstick on the fingers too,

522
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,964
so why did the killer
leave out the fingers?

523
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,508
They must've missed them.

524
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:29,682
It wasn't visible
because the blood hadn't oxidized yet.

525
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,518
Lipstick can get smeared
on fingers all the time.

526
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,894
Forget about that.

527
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,319
Focus on this. Who do you think
would've gone mad after reading this?

528
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,528
It's obvious, isn't it?

529
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,698
Then the killer could've disguised it
as theft by stealing some items.

530
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:48,159
So why did they make a big deal
and mimic Do Min-seok?

531
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,744
That damn Do Min-seok!

532
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:52,913
It's okay.

533
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,334
Come here. What's your take on this?

534
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,501
Me?

535
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:58,919
Yes, you tell us.

536
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,630
Should we focus on the lipstick
or the will?

537
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,216
Well…

538
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,011
I need to think this over.

539
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,304
You punk.

540
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:12,266
Ji-won, quit being stubborn.
An Jong-gu is the killer.

541
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,727
We need to find evidence
against him as soon as possible.

542
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,812
We need to look into her female friends

543
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,023
and find out who that lipstick belongs to.

544
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,400
What has gotten into you?

545
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,903
This is the perfect motive for murder!

546
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,112
Please!

547
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,700
JUNG MUN-OK

548
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,330
What? What is it?

549
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,876
Jae-seop, this thumbprint…

550
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,545
Could it be…

551
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,342
JUNG MUN-OK

552
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:50,513
JUNG MUN-OK

553
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,864
Ms. Jung probably
couldn't find her ink pad

554
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,450
and had to borrow the killer's lipstick
to stamp this.

555
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:15,204
The killer could've wiped off
most of the lipstick on her thumb,

556
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:19,041
but it would've been difficult
to dig underneath the thumbnail.

557
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:24,755
The killer was bothered by this and
ended up removing the thumbnails entirely.

558
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,884
Then they disguised it
as Do Min-seok's copycat crime.

559
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,929
With whom do you think
she wrote that will?

560
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,432
Park Seo-yeong.

561
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,559
The social worker?

562
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:40,688
I started focusing more on those around
the victim, so she told me about the will.

563
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,773
She turned my attention to An Jong-gu.

564
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:46,235
But last night, Ms. Jung called me

565
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,571
and asked about her will.

566
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:52,283
Once the will's analysis report comes out,
let's investigate her first.

567
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,367
But…

568
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,455
why did she kill her?

569
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,168
What was her motive?

570
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,513
What's the result?

571
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,599
It is lipstick.

572
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:19,977
Hello, Mother.

573
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,063
I have something to finish
by the end of the day.

574
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,440
I'm sorry I keep doing this.

575
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,233
Okay.

576
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:30,279
I'm truly thankful
for your help every time.

577
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,492
You always treat my daughter so well,

578
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,535
so I ought to do the same for you.

579
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,831
It's like I'm returning the favor,
so don't feel too bad, okay?

580
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,168
Oh, right.
I fed her egg tarts a while ago,

581
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,629
so she doesn't need more snacks.
I'll see you later.

582
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,130
All right.

583
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,330
CHEONGGYECHEON
NAM SUN-GIL, 5 P.M.

584
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,028
Hyeon-su, give me some water.

585
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,115
I'm parched.

586
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,993
I think I may really die. Please.

587
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,120
Give me some water.

588
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,834
Explain this.

589
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,169
Why are you meeting Nam Sun-gil?

590
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,298
Oh, this?

591
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,550
It's nothing.

592
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,645
I remember now.

593
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:33,360
He wanted to give me some tip-off,
so I agreed to meet with him.

594
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:34,862
About what?

595
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,158
About what?

596
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:41,702
Give me some water first.

597
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,706
I scratched your back,
so you should do the same for me.

598
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,166
Isn't that fair?

599
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,222
Now, tell me. About what?

600
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,228
About you.

601
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,068
Why did he reach out to you, though?

602
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,405
-Because I wrote an article.
-About what?

603
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:25,079
It's just one of those obvious articles
about you and your father.

604
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,039
When was the appointment?

605
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:30,626
Today.

606
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,427
Hyeon-su.

607
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,430
If I don't show up,

608
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,974
won't you be in a pickle?

609
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,484
GANGSU COMMUNITY CENTER

610
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,376
Ms. Park.

611
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,713
I'm Detective Cha
from Gangsu Police Station.

612
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,093
Do you need more help from me?

613
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:25,931
We've found female DNA on Ms. Jung's will,
and we suspect that it is the killer's.

614
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,976
We're carrying out mouth swabs

615
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,145
on women who were around her.

616
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:35,065
After we compare your DNA,
it will be discarded immediately.

617
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,110
Will you cooperate?

618
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:44,950
No, thank you.

619
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,996
If you refuse to cooperate,

620
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,749
it could work against you
in the court of law.

621
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:55,836
Do you have proof
that I killed that old hag?

622
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,214
No, not yet.

623
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:03,510
BUILDING 3

624
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,304
There's something strange
about her clothes.

625
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,348
-Can we see her leaving?
-Okay.

626
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,233
She's wearing a different one.

627
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,569
No, she's wearing it inside out.

628
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,160
You're right.

629
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,579
The victim's blood got on her clothes.

630
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,918
This means she went home
right after she killed her.

631
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,044
Then…

632
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:42,549
that bag must contain the murder weapon
and the victim's thumbnails.

633
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,784
NAM SUN-GIL

634
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,413
REPORTER KIM MOO-JIN

635
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,666
Hello, sir.

636
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:17,793
Are you here?

637
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:23,257
I don't think I can meet you today
because of a case I'm covering. I'm sorry.

638
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,761
I see. It can't be helped, then.

639
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:31,598
Would you mind being interviewed
through the phone?

640
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,309
Not at all. That's fine.

641
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:39,439
What information did you want to give me
regarding Do Hyeon-su?

642
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,774
One minute.

643
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:48,156
I heard he disappeared from his village
in the summer of 2002.

644
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,826
From the fall of 2002
to the summer of 2005,

645
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,996
he and I lived together
while doing a delivery job.

646
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:55,873
And?

647
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,041
He didn't have an ID card back then,

648
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,586
but I just thought
he must've had his reasons.

649
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:04,590
I had no idea he was a murderer.
If I'd known, I'd have called the police.

650
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:09,511
I had no idea his father
was a serial killer either.

651
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,931
He was Do Min-seok's son? No wonder.

652
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,142
"No wonder"?

653
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,978
He was a bit eccentric.
He didn't seem normal.

654
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:21,023
We once watched a movie together.

655
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:25,527
Afterwards, he asked me
which parts were funny and sad.

656
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,988
So you knew him for three years?

657
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,741
Is that all?

658
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,326
Sorry?

659
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:37,247
Okay. Thank you. I'll be hanging up now.

660
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,416
No, sir. Don't hang up.

661
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,377
I…

662
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,464
I'm being threatened by him.

663
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,469
-What?
-It's driving me insane.

664
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:53,388
Please save me. Please.

665
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:01,980
-None?
-No.

666
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:05,692
After coming back home,
she never went out again.

667
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:09,029
Shouldn't we search her house
before she gets rid of evidence?

668
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:12,074
I'm sure she knew there were CCTV cameras.

669
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,660
She wouldn't have left
the evidence in her house.

670
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,664
I'm certain she left home.

671
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,461
I saw a shooting star last night.

672
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,591
I think that was her way
of saying goodbye.

673
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:42,622
Please move aside
and let me get back to work.

674
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:48,128
Honestly, I'm surprised
that you don't look fazed.

675
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,213
That's because I did nothing wrong.

676
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,137
Yes?

677
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,640
It's me.

678
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,226
I found it.

679
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,145
All right.

680
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:08,231
Ms. Park Seo-yeong.

681
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:11,193
From this moment on,
you're a murder suspect.

682
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:15,322
I'm arresting you without a warrant
on charges of Jung Mun-ok's murder.

683
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,324
Can I put on some makeup first?

684
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,077
Pardon?

685
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,287
I usually put makeup on.

686
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,956
But today, I didn't put it on to look sad.

687
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:30,462
I read that your appearance
could affect your sentence.

688
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,593
All right, then.

689
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,768
Why did you kill her?

690
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:53,068
Because there were too many stairs.

691
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,513
JUNG MUN-OK

692
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,276
I hate things that are complicated.

693
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:37,028
So whether it be notarizing
or hiring a lawyer,

694
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,073
I'll leave everything to you, Seo-yeong.

695
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:42,450
Okay.

696
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,787
I have nothing more to wish for.

697
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,957
I just need you to come here every day

698
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:54,087
and chat with me
like a daughter or a granddaughter.

699
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,672
That's all that I want.

700
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,759
Every day?

701
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:05,265
Seo-yeong, can you scratch my back?

702
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,852
I don't know anyone else
who does it as well as you do.

703
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:18,528
We treat our big-time sponsors like kings.

704
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:20,739
The thought

705
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:26,077
of climbing up and down those stairs
every day made my blood boil.

706
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,664
I'm always grateful to you.

707
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,792
It's my pleasure.

708
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,929
This is the police station.

709
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,182
There's a dead body!

710
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,810
Please help me!

711
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,191
Gosh.

712
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,361
Don't look at me so despicably.

713
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,113
You've hurt my feelings.

714
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:07,535
How could you kill someone
for such a reason?

715
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,957
I heard three percent
of the population are like me.

716
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:19,673
Who knows? Maybe there's someone
like me around you as well.

717
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:25,512
It's been a month.

718
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:29,808
Someone has been calling me
from a pay phone every day at 4:00 a.m.

719
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:33,478
Did that man claim
that he was Do Hyeon-su?

720
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,105
Who are you?

721
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,359
Answer me!

722
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,028
Are you happy?

723
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,199
Do Hyeon-su?

724
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:51,371
I've been waiting for the happiest moment
in your life to come.

725
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,414
You…

726
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,375
You're Do Hyeon-su, aren't you?

727
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,044
Now, I'm going to do what I can do.

728
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,839
He's the only one who'd do
something like that to me.

729
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:02,966
Why do you say that?

730
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:08,179
I was young

731
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,682
and blinded by money.

732
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,601
I did something
I shouldn't have done to him.

733
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,565
Are you sure you lost it around here?

734
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:20,608
Yes, I am.

735
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:24,029
I'm sure I had my wallet on my way up.

736
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,286
It's not here. I can't find it.

737
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:35,248
If it's urgent, I'll lend you some money.
Let's go down for now.

738
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,482
What the hell are you doing?

739
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,318
I need your money.

740
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:06,488
I want to live a decent life for once.

741
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,702
He's going to take revenge on me
at all costs.

742
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,206
You should suspect someone else.

743
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,209
Do Hyeon-su is dead.

744
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,088
Are… Are you sure?

745
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:26,091
Yes, so you should

746
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,427
erase him from your memory.

747
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,308
That's truly a relief.

748
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,812
It's a relief?

749
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:42,899
He was a murderer at large anyway.

750
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,110
He shouldn't live anyway.

751
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,654
Some people are better off dead.
Don't you agree?

752
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:49,656
You're right.

753
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:54,369
Some people are indeed better off dead.

754
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,226
What a shame.

755
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,020
I really hate those eyes of yours.

756
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,527
I surrender.

757
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,071
Please arrest me.

758
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,926
It's all right. Everything's fine.

759
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,812
You're a cop! You can't do this!

760
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,355
Who'd believe that you killed her

761
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:07,150
simply because you didn't want
to climb up those stairs?

762
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,110
So what?

763
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:12,447
A police officer could kill a suspect
during a fight.

764
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,908
-Don't you think so?
-Have you gone insane?

765
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:18,077
Does deceiving and harming
those weaker than you

766
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,330
make you feel superior to them?

767
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:23,166
I already turned myself in.
I'm going to report this!

768
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:26,628
I'll witness with my very own eyes
and remember

769
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:29,380
how pitiful and pathetic
your last moments are.

770
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,512
Carotid, 12 seconds.

771
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,264
Subclavian artery, 3.5 seconds.

772
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,475
Anyway, you'll die in less than a minute.

773
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:42,602
Pick. Which one will it be?

774
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,568
Spare me.

775
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:57,617
Spare me, please.

776
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,747
Spare me, please.

777
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:11,297
That was a joke, Ms. Park.
How could a cop kill someone like that?

778
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:15,802
I've already declared your charges.
Since you're human as well,

779
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:19,514
you have the right to hire an attorney
and give an excuse.

780
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:23,393
You can also file a petition
for a writ of habeas corpus.

781
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,397
Take it after a meal.

782
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,774
-Okay, I will.
-Good.

783
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:31,609
Oh, my. Your son's here.

784
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:35,947
Hello, my son. What brings you here?
I didn't even know you were coming.

785
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,866
I came because I missed you.

786
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,202
Goodness.

787
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,871
I'm so jealous that you have a son.
I'll be going now.

788
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:46,207
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

789
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:54,382
She may look cheerful,
but she's taking anti-depressants.

790
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:59,262
Are you allowed to disclose
other people's health condition?

791
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,182
I enjoy seeing others in misery.

792
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,228
If I can't become like them,

793
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:09,814
I want them to become like me.

794
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,110
What do you want?

795
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,904
I doubt you came here for no reason.

796
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,450
I need some sleeping pills.

797
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:29,834
Honey.

798
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:34,672
Oh, no.

799
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,051
What happened to your face?

800
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,637
I got a paper cut
while looking through some files.

801
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:43,056
I love the rain.

802
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:44,849
You look so happy.

803
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:47,226
A cop shouldn't like the rain.

804
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,355
-It washes away all evidence.
-Come on, it's romantic.

805
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,607
I'm craving something tasty.

806
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:54,776
Really? What do you want?

807
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:56,986
Vegetable pancakes?

808
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:00,114
Vegetable pancakes on a rainy day?
That sounds nice.

809
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:05,787
The police arrested the murderer
of a woman in her 70s

810
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,163
living alone in Gangsu-gu.

811
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:11,125
The killer mimicked Do Min-seok
of the Yeonju Serial Murder Case

812
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,710
in order to cause confusion.

813
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:16,756
However, the police stated
that the crime was lousy and impulsive.

814
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,424
After finding evidence,

815
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,802
they were able
to quickly arrest the killer.

816
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:24,514
Meanwhile, the killer turned out
to be a social worker.

817
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:26,557
We believe the public will be in shock.

REPORTER KIM MOO-JIN

821
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,427
WHERE IS DO HYEON-SU?

822
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:20,945
REPORTER KIM MOO-JIN

823
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,782
The number you have called
cannot be reached.

824
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:28,077
You'll be directed to voicemail.
You will be charged after the beep.

825
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,749
Mr. Kim, this is Nam Sun-gil.

826
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,968
I forgot to tell you something earlier.

827
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:46,763
You'll be intrigued as well.

828
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:52,477
This is something I heard recently.

829
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:56,689
I heard that Do Hyeon-su
was in on it with his dad.

830
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:59,150
I mean, the serial killing.

SUNGIL CHINESE RESTAURANT

832
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:13,998
Shocking, right?

833
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,835
That was exactly why I overreacted.

834
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:21,255
Feel free to call me anytime
if you're interested…

835
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:40,066
Sir.

836
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:45,613
It's… It's Do Hyeon-su.

837
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,033
Do… Do Hyeon-su is here!

838
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:51,828
What did I tell you?
I said he'd take revenge on me!

839
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,456
Your message has been recorded.

YEONJU SERIAL MURDER CASE
DO MIN-SEOK AND HIS SON

841
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,759
When did I fall asleep?

842
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:16,866
I'll forget that I ever met you.
I promise.

843
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,493
I don't want your promise.
I want a guarantee.

844
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:21,287
We found out who Nam Sun-gil
last spoke with.

845
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:22,830
The reporter, Kim Moo-jin?

846
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:27,501
So it means there's a video
that shows you assisting in murder.

847
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:30,337
Mr. Kim didn't come to work for two days.

848
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:34,258
-Why didn't you notify the police?
-I think he might be locked up somewhere.

849
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,385
Break the door down.

850
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:37,845
He fooled me.

851
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:42,099
Someone was here up until now.
They may still be here.

852
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:47,104
