1
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:33,116
-Hurry.
-There's no such thing as a ghost.

2
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,659
I'm sure I heard something.

3
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,746
Hae-su, are you afraid of ghosts?

4
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:39,748
Aren't you?

5
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,541
I've always wanted to meet one.

6
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,918
Just tell Moo-jin to go down by himself.

7
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,796
You're scared, aren't you?

8
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,383
Hey, you guys wait here.

9
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,343
I'll go interview the ghost.

10
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,678
Be careful.

11
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,847
All right.

12
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,561
Reporter Kim Moo-jin is coming in.
Follow me.

13
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,861
I'm scared already.

14
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,990
All right. Let's take it slow.

15
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,912
One step at a time.

16
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,301
Gosh, it's spooky.

17
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,065
This is cool.

18
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:52,862
What is this?

19
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,832
What's that?

20
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,298
Moo-jin, what are you doing here?

21
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,180
Moo-jin, you're very brave.

22
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,643
My kids can barely grab the doorknob
to the basement door.

23
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,897
Did you film anything interesting?

24
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,401
Let me see.

25
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,070
Kim Moo-jin.

26
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:40,702
Oh, dear. Moo-jin,
why are you trembling?

27
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,080
I see.

28
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,876
I guess the elk startled you.

29
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,670
"Elk"?

30
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,754
Yes.

31
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,008
If that's not an elk,
what else could it be?

32
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,136
Oh, so it's an elk.

33
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,557
You're right. It's an elk.

34
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,601
Right?

35
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,438
How does this necklace
look exactly the same?

36
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,941
It's still shining so beautifully.

37
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,528
Are you wearing the necklace I gave you?

38
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,655
Since when?

39
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,616
I'll see you at your place.

40
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,784
Okay.

41
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,473
CHA JI-WON
POLICE AGENCY

42
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,748
Who on earth is he?

43
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,417
Tell me who he is.

44
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,296
I can't tell you that until I become safe.

45
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,756
Who knows?

46
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,884
You might stab me in the back
with him if I tell you.

47
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,136
If you,

48
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,930
by any chance,

49
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,392
get in my way
before I run away with my money,

50
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,270
I'll be sure to side with him
and kill both you and Jung Mi-suk.

51
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,315
Do you like money that much?

52
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,858
I get so thrilled

53
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,236
just by its scent.

54
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:58,256
I can't say we're more than friends
if I don't go to pick her up.

55
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,734
HAE-SU

56
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,829
Why is she not picking up?

57
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,633
Hae-su!

58
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,305
Hae-su. Wake up.

59
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,473
Hae-su.

60
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,478
Hae-su! Hae-su…

61
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,772
Hae-su, wait.

62
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,447
There's an emergency patient.
Please hurry and come right away.

63
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,324
2020-057 MAKMUN-DONG MURDER CASE

64
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,911
The victim, Park Sun-yeong,
came to work at Gong Mi-ja's house

65
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,621
at 10:00 a.m. on the 12th.

66
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,206
10:00 A.M. CAME TO WORK

67
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,957
At 7:30 p.m. on the same day,

68
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,169
she left Gong Mi-ja's house
and took a cab.

69
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:21,464
That's the last camera
that caught her while she was alive.

70
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:28,805
Park Sun-yeong's credit card transactions
show her whereabouts afterward.

71
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:33,184
At 7:50 p.m., she paid the taxi fare.

72
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:37,897
At around 8:00 p.m., she ordered in
some food with her phone in her house.

73
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,899
It was kimchi stew with rice.

74
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,818
The delivery man stated

75
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,154
that he handed the food
over to Park Sun-yeong at 8:30 p.m.

76
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:50,243
So it means she was alive
at least until 8:30 p.m.

77
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,412
8:30 P.M. DELIVERY MAN ARRIVED

78
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,165
So what's strange about that?

79
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,542
Her estimated time of death.

80
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,168
Her estimated time of death?

81
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,713
According to the autopsy report,

82
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,675
she died within
four to six hours after eating.

83
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:11,097
She got her dinner at 8:30 p.m.
That means she died after 12:30 a.m.

84
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,812
But the autopsy report says that her
finger joints had already become stiff.

85
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,107
It means it had been
at least ten hours since her death.

86
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,444
If that's the case,
she should have died before 9:00 p.m.

87
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,115
One says it was after 12:00 a.m.,
and the other says it was before 9:00 p.m.

88
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,200
The time of death doesn't overlap.

89
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,831
The rate of rigor mortis and decay varies
depending on environmental conditions.

90
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:41,210
That's why the NFS couldn't estimate
exact time just by performing an autopsy.

91
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,422
Like you said,
the only thing we can be sure of

92
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,425
is that Park Sun-yeong
was alive until 8:30 last night.

93
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,802
What's important for us

94
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,930
is her whereabouts afterward.

95
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,101
I know that too. I get it.

96
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,608
I should go meet the delivery man myself.

97
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,570
He might have seen someone suspicious
around Park Sun-yeong's house.

98
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,947
It was poorly investigated.
I should get going.

99
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,328
We got the dashcam footage
I talked about earlier.

100
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,754
I'm sure this is when he called
my husband to lure him out.

101
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,424
It also matches with the time
when your husband got the call.

102
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,384
I'll have this footage analyzed.

103
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,511
Wait.

104
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,515
It seems like he chose a place
where there's no CCTV camera around.

105
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,100
Why do you think
he didn't care about the dashcam?

106
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,687
It's a fatal mistake for the culprit.

107
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,607
It's a dead giveaway
that he called Do Hyeon-su.

108
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,610
I find it strange too.

109
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,911
Detective Cha, don't pick it up
unless you know the number.

110
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,037
It might be a reporter.

111
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,580
Okay.

112
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,044
This is Gangsu Police Station.

113
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,505
What?

114
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,812
Eun-ha. Eun-ha!

115
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,567
Where's my daughter?

116
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,153
She's in there, but she won't open
the door unless her mom is here.

117
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,657
We figured if we forced it open,
it might frighten her.

118
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,634
Eun-ha.

119
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:58,931
Mommy's here. Can you open the door?

120
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,058
EUN-HA'S ROOM

121
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,274
Eun-ha, it's really Mom.

122
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,943
You can open it now.

123
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,321
EUN-HA'S ROOM

124
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,456
-Mom.
-Eun-ha.

125
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,541
-Eun-ha.
-Mom.

126
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,045
Mom.

127
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,589
Mom.

128
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,926
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

129
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,013
Someone broke into the house.

130
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,017
The teacher told me

131
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,272
to stay in my room and lock the door.

132
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:52,193
And she told me
not to open it unless it's you.

133
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,281
Good. You did well, Eun-ha.

134
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,912
Where is she?

135
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,257
Promise me.

136
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,677
That you will never leave her alone.

137
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,145
MIJA PHARMACY

138
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,822
You called me a lot later than expected.

139
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,951
Do you think it's easy
to prepare 500 million won in cash?

140
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,623
Where should we meet?

141
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,046
Ms. Jung Mi-suk.

142
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,967
Ms. Jung Mi-suk?

143
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:52,938
Who are you?

144
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,705
I'm

145
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,250
Do Hyeon-su.

146
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,048
The accomplice
in the Yeonju Serial Murder Case

147
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,133
is after you now.

148
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,261
He will be here soon.

149
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,681
Ms. Jung Mi-suk.

150
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,603
You're the only survivor
of the serial murderer

151
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,064
and witness.

152
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,525
And…

153
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,904
I'm going to catch him.

154
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,755
Please don't come close to me.

155
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,007
Please don't come near me.

156
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,154
This is the only key

157
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,199
to this lock.

158
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,507
Unless you unlock
this door yourself, no one…

159
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,469
can open it.

160
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,765
You're safe.

161
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,226
I promise.

162
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,731
Are you saying

163
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,069
you will help me?

164
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:07,990
Yes.

165
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,200
You're lying.

166
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,828
I don't believe you.

167
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,752
The guy also told me
that he'd help me meet my family.

168
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,175
But it was all a lie.

169
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,766
Why?

170
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,853
Why do you want to help me?

171
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,864
Maybe…

172
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,993
that's because

173
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,829
you and I are in a similar situation.

174
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,875
How are we in a similar situation?

175
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,341
Because you have no idea why

176
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,427
you're going through all this.

177
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,266
And that's exactly how I feel now.

178
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,135
Mom, I should get going now.

179
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,470
Ji-won.

180
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,764
Can you

181
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,184
just stay here with me?

182
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,855
Just hide in here with me.

183
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,273
Mom.

184
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,359
I can't believe this is happening to us.

185
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:12,197
Is this all because of Hee-seong?

186
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,866
Isn't it?

187
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,702
He completely deceived you.

188
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,039
And he made you miserable.

189
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,625
I hate him so much.

190
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,799
I haven't changed at all.

191
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,220
I can be happy only when he's happy.

192
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,890
So

193
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,978
when he comes back,
please take pity on him.

194
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,651
Please embrace him
just like you embrace me.

195
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,666
Isn't he the guy from the dashcam footage?

196
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,004
That's him. He was after Ji-won. He was
waiting for her in front of her house.

197
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,340
Who on earth is this bastard?

198
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:17,012
You know what? Maybe…
we should leak some false information.

199
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,264
False information?

200
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,684
If the culprit finds out Ji-won is alive,
she will be in danger.

201
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:26,230
We haven't even
identified the culprit yet.

202
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,690
Yes. You're right.

203
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,361
I'll go leak the information
to some reporters.

204
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,989
Detective Im, call Mapo Police Station
and ask for their cooperation.

205
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,074
Yes, sir.

206
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,620
Is this Mapo Police Station?

207
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,255
It's my fault.

208
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,592
I promised Hyeon-su.

209
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,181
That I would never leave her alone.

210
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,393
I promised.

211
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,772
Hae-su has no defensive wounds.

212
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,569
To protect Eun-ha,

213
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,990
she didn't try to fight back or run away.

214
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,995
Can you catch that bastard?

215
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,499
Yes. We'll catch him at all costs.

216
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:40,012
The weapon cut the peritoneum
and damaged the organs.

217
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,763
She went into shock from blood loss,

218
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,808
so we can't be sure
she will be all right for now.

219
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,686
We need to wait
until she regains consciousness.

220
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:04,953
Director Baek Man-u.

221
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,663
What?

222
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,956
Hae-su asked

223
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,417
Director Baek Man-u for something.

224
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,461
What is it?

225
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,340
The list of the Ilsin University Hospital
overseas volunteers.

226
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,009
From 1999 to 2002.

227
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,719
What about it?

228
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,931
Hae-su said one of the volunteers

229
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,224
is the accomplice.

230
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,602
I'll go get the list first.

231
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,146
I'll tell you the details
at the police station later.

232
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,816
Mr. Kim, I'll come with you.

233
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,738
-Ho-jun.
-Ji-won.

234
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,408
You can't be alive today.

235
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,495
What?

236
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:50,707
FEMALE DETECTIVE FROM GANGSU STATION
STABBED TO DEATH AT HOME

237
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,931
Long time no see, Ms. Jung Mi-suk.

238
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,487
Do you remember me?

239
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,950
You didn't remember me
when we found you 15 years ago.

240
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,290
So you remember me.

241
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,103
You haven't changed.

242
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,566
Okay.

243
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,822
Let's not meet ever again.

244
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,203
I'm totally with you.

245
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:18,790
Goodbye.

246
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,483
Why do we have to meet
like this every time?

247
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,570
I guess

248
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:53,074
no matter how hard you try,
you just can't escape from me.

249
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,039
This must be your fate.

250
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,327
So I'm the one he was trying to kill.

251
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,124
He doesn't know my face.

252
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,461
-What?
-What do you mean?

253
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:51,424
He waited to kill me,
but how could he not know my face?

254
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,887
He even got my husband's fingerprints

255
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,224
and hid the victim's hair
in our car trunk. But how

256
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,810
could he not know my face?

257
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,854
Right. That's strange.

258
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:06,898
What if…

259
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,111
there is more than one culprit?

260
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,447
It was my first time to go there.

261
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,200
Did you notice anything strange
when you handed over the food?

262
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,287
Well, I just gave her the food.

263
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,039
The victim is Deaf.

264
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,876
Did she make any unusual
facial expressions or gestures?

265
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:29,671
No.

266
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,302
Please take a look at these photos.
Did you see a guy who looks like this?

267
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:37,804
I have no idea.

268
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,891
Okay.

269
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,060
If you recall anything…

270
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,605
Oh, right. By the way,

271
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,566
she wasn't Deaf.

272
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,443
What?

273
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,946
There was a doorbell
next to the front door.

274
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,699
Yes, but that's a light doorbell.

275
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,243
If you push the button,
the light flashes inside.

276
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:05,915
No. That night,
I didn't ring the doorbell.

277
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,835
Delivery.

278
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,128
I knocked.

279
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,215
Please enjoy.

280
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,761
There are a lot of families
with babies, so I mostly knock.

281
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,224
There might be more than one culprit.

282
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:27,270
The one who gathered information
might not be the one

283
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,189
who committed murder.

284
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,903
It's Detective Choi.

285
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,655
DETECTIVE CHOI

286
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,448
Yes, Detective Choi.

287
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,116
Check the autopsy report

288
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,702
and see what food was found
in Park Sun-yeong's stomach.

289
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,082
Pork, kimchi, and a little tofu.

290
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,167
But we don't use tofu.

291
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:56,966
Park Sun-yeong didn't die after dinner.
She died after lunch.

292
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,553
When she left
Gong Mi-ja's house at 7:30 p.m.,

293
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,390
she was already dead.

294
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:09,437
Then who is this person on the footage?

295
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,776
Someone who'd do anything
to protect the culprit.

296
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,368
Please enjoy.

297
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,120
The culprit's

298
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,580
mother.

299
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:31,292
Hae-su said one of the volunteers

300
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,752
is the accomplice.

301
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,713
Baek Hee-seong.

302
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,799
Now I know why the culprit
didn't care about the dashcam footage.

303
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:41,386
That's because there were
no dashcam cameras 15 years ago.

304
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:47,100
Baek Hee-seong has come around.

305
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,866
What is this?

306
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,170
Yeom Sang-cheol, that rat bastard.

307
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,970
Come here.

308
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,098
Come over here.

309
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,853
I said come here! Get over here!

310
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,523
Come here!

311
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,576
What is it now?

312
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,955
What game are you guys trying to play?

313
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,839
Where are you looking at now?

314
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:51,641
Stop it. Please stop. You win.

315
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,772
I said stop! It hurts!

316
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,862
Just see who I am before
you beat me up like that, you bastard!

317
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,336
Hi. Nice to see you.

318
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:27,218
You must've been dying to know who I was.

319
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,513
How do you feel to find out?

320
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,606
You seem quite surprised.

321
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,030
Ms. Do Hae-su was stabbed?

322
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:48,990
Yes.

323
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,248
How is she holding up now?

324
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,377
She's still unconscious.

325
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,756
Are you sure she was stabbed

326
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,385
by the accomplice
in the Yeonju Serial Murder Case?

327
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:10,845
I'm sure.

328
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:15,558
That's why we urgently need the names
and photos of the overseas volunteers.

329
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,228
I heard Hae-su asked you for the list.

330
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,734
But Ms. Do is unconscious right now.

331
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,862
What can you do with the list and photos?

332
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:32,283
We can check their alibis
for the time of the incident one by one.

333
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,244
I thought you'd be able to get me the list

334
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,956
more quickly than the foundation would.

335
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,958
So I rushed over here.

336
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,459
I'm glad you came.

337
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,379
I already had it ready.

338
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,966
Please wait a moment.

339
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:54,973
GANGSU STATION CHA JI-WON

340
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,226
Please excuse me.

341
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:02,730
Yes, Detective Cha.

342
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:08,277
Mr. Kim, just answer my questions
with a yes or a no from now on.

343
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:10,780
Okay.

344
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,783
Are you at Director
Baek Man-u's house now?

345
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,035
Yes.

346
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,453
Is someone around you?

347
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,332
-Yes.
-Leave the place quietly.

348
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,168
What?

349
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,337
Do Min-seok's accomplice

350
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,507
who tried to kill Do Hae-su
has been identified.

351
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:32,927
Who is that?

352
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,638
Baek Man-u and Gong Mi-ja's son,

353
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,349
Baek Hee-seong.

354
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,311
Don't show any response.

355
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:47,191
We assume that Baek Man-u
and Gong Mi-ja are his accomplices.

356
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,403
We will be there
as soon as we get a warrant.

357
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,322
So just leave the house quietly.

358
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,412
What's the matter, Mr. Kim?

359
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:04,000
Where is your son?

360
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,964
Baek Hee-seong. Where is he?

361
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,341
Mr. Kim. Mr. Kim!

362
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,262
We have to go there without a warrant.

363
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,639
Mr. Kim is worked up,
so he might be in danger.

364
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,899
What are you doing?
What is this all about?

365
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,617
This is my house. You can't do this.

366
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,743
Baek Hee-seong!

367
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,662
Let's sit and have a talk.

368
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,248
I think there's a misunderstanding.
Let me explain…

369
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,709
Let's talk first!

370
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:58,679
No.

371
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,307
Move over.

372
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,851
Don't do this. You can't do this.

373
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,228
It's no use.

374
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:09,232
The police are on their way here now.

375
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,384
He's not here.

376
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,471
Isn't your son supposed to be lying

377
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,640
unconscious in there?

378
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,754
You can't leave.

379
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,804
Do you still not understand
how pointless all of this is?

380
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,975
Why is it pointless?

381
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,020
It'll be all right if you're dead.

382
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,815
I'll kill you and turn myself in.

383
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,692
What difference does it make?

384
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,236
My son will change!

385
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:44,160
If I sacrifice myself for him,
he will eventually change.

386
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,830
He wasn't like that before.

387
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,293
If he hadn't met Do Min-seok,

388
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,962
he wouldn't have turned out that way.

389
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,465
I want

390
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:02,470
to give him one last chance.

391
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,806
One last chance?

392
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,063
When I was young,

393
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,899
I saw a big sack in the basement

394
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,277
of Do Min-seok's workshop.

395
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,613
I see.

396
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,325
I guess the elk startled you.

397
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,870
-"Elk"?
-Yes.

398
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,374
If that's not an elk,
what else could it be?

399
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,585
Oh, so it's an elk.

400
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:39,423
You're right. It's an elk.

401
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:42,677
And up until now,

402
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,222
I've tried to believe…

403
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,976
that it was an elk in the sack.

404
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,353
Why?

405
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,814
If I didn't…

406
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,821
it would be too frightening.

407
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,616
But you know what?

408
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,162
No matter how hard I try…

409
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,500
the fact that it was a person

410
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,920
that was in the sack
doesn't change.

411
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,930
I know you've always known…

412
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,975
what's

413
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,853
inside your son.

414
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,861
What you want to change
isn't your son's future.

415
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,741
It's the moment you realized…

416
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,119
who your son really was…

417
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,333
and turned away from the truth.

418
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,254
So,

419
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,176
let go of your false hopes.

420
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,518
Let go of me!

421
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,863
We have an obligation

422
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,574
to reveal the truth.

423
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,535
Until you meet the obligation,

424
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,829
you can't die.

425
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,358
It's strange.

426
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,487
We both knew

427
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,408
things would end this way.

428
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,078
So why

429
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,915
did we have to

430
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,168
come this far?

431
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,527
So how does it feel
to have played into my hands?

432
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,655
I finally get it now.

433
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,954
I get how you were able to set me up.

434
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,792
Don't get too excited that you caught me.

435
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:09,258
You will never be able
to escape from my shadow anyway.

436
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,947
Why did you do that?

437
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,415
Why did you do that to me?

438
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,628
I never regret what I did.

439
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,090
I'll be sentenced
to life in prison anyway.

440
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,563
Where's your phone?

441
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,858
The phone you used
to call Yeom Sang-cheol.

442
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:16,075
I'll probably be caught
in the spotlight, right?

443
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,327
Your phone.

444
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,789
I should try publishing a book in jail.

445
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,377
A book about how I grew up,

446
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,714
what Do Min-seok and I did for fun,

447
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,467
and what we talked about.

448
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,261
And even how

449
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,681
we transformed murder into art.

450
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,351
I'm sure everyone's dying to know that.

451
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,689
How well do you think my book will sell?

452
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,116
Don't try too hard.

453
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:01,704
There's no way you can affect me.

454
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,170
My phone is in my pocket.

455
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,759
Tell the police
to come quick and arrest me.

456
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,012
And

457
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,181
get me an ambulance too.

458
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,768
I think I will need one.

459
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,280
Hyeon-su is different.

460
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,452
Do Hyeon-su is a failure.

461
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:45,080
I put a lot of effort into him, though.

462
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,211
What's with that face?

463
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,298
You should be flattered.

464
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:58,052
You're my best accomplishment.

465
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:26,246
CHA JI-WON
POLICE AGENCY

466
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,127
CHA JI-WON
POLICE AGENCY

467
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:36,006
Oh, right. Give me back the ID card.

468
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,050
That's my souvenir.

469
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,806
How…

470
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,518
Why do you have this?

471
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:50,729
Why do you think?

472
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,030
Don't lie to me.

473
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,282
Your house was lovely.

474
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,537
About the model boat behind the TV.

475
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,788
Whose is it?

476
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:10,874
I loved it.

477
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:18,632
Hey.

478
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,594
Don't you dare lie to me.

479
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,059
Tell me it's a lie.

480
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,898
Say that you're lying. Now!

481
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,780
Do Min-seok turned me into a murderer.

482
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,827
So I'll do the same to you.

483
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,291
That's only fair.

484
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,420
Call the police now.

485
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,005
Stick to your plan.

486
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,675
I don't believe you.

487
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,726
I don't believe what you say.

488
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:15,105
"Eun-ha, promise me

489
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:19,902
that you won't open the door
unless it's Mom."

490
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,905
"Can you do that, Eun-ha?"

491
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,079
That was so touching.

492
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,874
I almost cried.

493
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,011
I didn't touch your kid.

494
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:51,517
I wouldn't stoop so low, you know.

495
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,333
Please.

496
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,379
Please pick up.

497
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,308
The person you have called is unavailable.
You will be directed…

498
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:42,609
This is the police situation room.

499
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,031
I'd like to report a crime.

500
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,454
Please put me through…

501
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,627
to Detective Cha Ji-won
at Gangsu Police Station.

502
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:05,841
Please hang up and wait. The detective
in charge will call you back.

503
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,780
-Hello?
-This is Mapo Police Station.

504
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,867
Did you call us regarding
the police officer attack case?

505
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,412
What is it you want to report?

506
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:38,832
Was…

507
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,795
the victim…

508
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,384
Detective Cha Ji-won?

509
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,179
Yes, it's her.

510
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,812
How is she?

511
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:03,774
She passed away.

512
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,326
Hello?

513
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:17,412
Hello?

514
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,373
What about her kid?

515
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:22,876
The kid is safe.

516
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,338
I'm bound to win no matter what.

517
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:13,260
I win even if you hand me
over to the police.

518
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,097
And I win even if you kill me.

519
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:22,060
There's no way you can win this game.

520
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,126
Please call the police.

521
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,755
No. Don't.

522
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:53,341
Tell them…

523
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,388
Do Hyeon-su killed a person.

524
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,559
Don't become a murderer
because of that bastard.

525
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,198
Tell them I cut off

526
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:19,159
all his limbs…

527
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:25,791
and mangled

528
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,753
his face to pulp

529
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,672
while he was still alive.

530
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,426
Even after all that…

531
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:42,349
he kept crawling around alive…

532
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,021
so I stabbed him…

533
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,150
over and…

534
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,654
over again…

535
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,200
to kill him.

536
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,077
Don't.

537
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,848
Run away now. Run!

538
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,100
Run now!

539
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,520
Run!

540
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,369
Don't go.

541
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,789
Please don't go.

542
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:51,960
Darn it.

543
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:54,880
Damn!

544
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,907
Where is Baek Hee-seong?

545
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,994
We really don't know.

546
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,706
All we know is he went
to meet Yeom Sang-cheol.

547
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:33,376
How can you not know?
You guys are his accomplices.

548
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,462
-Calm down, Detective Cha.
-I can't.

549
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:39,633
The murderer must be
with my husband right now.

550
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,136
He's

551
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:45,889
in bad shape now.

552
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,559
He won't be

553
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:53,188
able to harm Hyeon-su.

554
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:56,274
What's the license plate number
of Baek Hee-seong's car?

555
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,652
It's 54 GA 706…

556
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:02,197
Captain, we got a call
from Mapo Police Station.

557
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,491
A man called to ask
if Detective Cha's dead.

558
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:05,909
This is his number.

559
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,205
Do you know this number?

560
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,921
I don't know the number.

561
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:25,345
But he does have an old phone
that he uses to contact Yeom Sang-cheol.

562
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,390
But what's strange is

563
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,809
that he asked about the kid too.

564
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:35,438
Baek Hee-seong wouldn't have asked that
since he didn't touch the kid.

565
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,619
Oh, no.

566
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,539
It must've been him.

567
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:33,788
Hello?

568
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:36,583
This is Detective Cha Ji-won
from Gangsu Police Station.

569
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:39,169
Who is this?

570
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,340
Detective Cha Ji-won?

571
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:46,801
Who is this speaking?

572
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,304
Are you…

573
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,683
Ms. Jung Mi-suk?

574
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,687
Please hurry and come.

575
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:02,567
Please come and save Do Hyeon-su.

576
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:15,997
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

577
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:23,630
Excuse me. How is Do Hae-su?

578
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,673
Visiting hours are over.

579
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:28,259
-Please wait in the waiting…
-Just tell me how she's doing.

580
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:29,677
That's all I need to know.

581
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:31,763
What's your relationship with her?

582
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,974
Well, I'm her friend.

583
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:39,979
We can't speak to you about her condition
unless you're her legal guardian.

584
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:43,942
How could she have a legal guardian
when she hasn't lived with any family?

585
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:46,611
Just do this one for me once.

586
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:49,531
I'm sorry. I'm not allowed to do so.

587
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:51,533
But…

588
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:24,959
Run.

589
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:28,421
Just go ahead and kill me. You psychopath!

590
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,049
I said to run.

591
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,381
Baek Hee-seong ran away,
and Do Hyeon-su went after him.

592
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:56,092
We're searching
around the building and the woods.

593
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:57,844
-Let's go.
-Detective Cha.

594
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,097
She insists on talking to you.

595
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:09,439
She's here.

596
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,031
Ms. Jung Mi-suk.

597
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:22,201
He said he killed you.

598
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:34,672
CHA JI-WON
POLICE AGENCY

599
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:40,136
I felt really bad for your husband.

600
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,307
So even if…

601
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,478
he kills that murderer…

602
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:52,315
it's not his fault.

603
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:56,819
He didn't do anything wrong.
I saw the whole thing.

604
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,491
There can be no excuse for murder.

605
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:04,619
Murder…

606
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,332
is just murder.

607
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:17,382
Thank you for staying alive.

608
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:18,753
Kill me.

609
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:22,131
Go ahead and do it.

610
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,553
You're the one who will live…

611
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,809
and suffer endless pain.

612
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:37,563
All right.

613
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,179
Honey!

614
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,072
Honey.

615
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:37,498
Drop the knife and come over here.

616
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:40,126
Let the police take care of it.

617
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:49,802
You…

618
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:53,973
Are you really Ji-won?

619
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,185
What are you talking about?

620
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:20,833
I don't think he's in his right mind.

621
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:25,254
Detective Cha, step back.

622
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:29,425
Honey, what are you doing?
Drop the knife and come over here!

623
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:34,639
He said… He said you're dead.

624
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:37,350
No. It was part of our plan.

625
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,852
I'm right here alive.

626
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,168
Ji-won.

627
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,712
What are you doing? Come back.

628
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:10,216
Detective Im, her safety is our priority.

629
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:13,761
Shoot if the worst happens.

630
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:15,137
Yes, sir.

631
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:29,944
It's all over.

632
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,573
You just need to come over here.

633
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:39,787
I…

634
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:47,753
I see a dead person.

635
01:06:57,972 --> 01:06:59,890
So I can't believe you're alive,

636
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:03,477
even though
you're standing in front of me.

637
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:09,150
Then come here and hold me.

638
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:12,695
Come here! Come and hug me!

639
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:59,950
Guys, don't let your guard down.

640
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:01,720
Leave Do Hyeon-su be
and go arrest Baek Hee-seong.

641
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:31,417
Doctor, Ms. Do Hae-su is awake.

642
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:52,790
How long have I been here?

643
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,878
My mind is all fuzzy.

644
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,180
I think we're by the sea.

645
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:14,061
But why don't I hear the sound of waves?

646
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:18,440
Don't ask questions.

647
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,443
That's how you can forget everything.

648
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:24,822
Okay.

649
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:30,786
You've lived with all your might.

650
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,248
Thank you so much.

651
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,377
You can rest in peace now.

652
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:42,881
I know…

653
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,469
you've been through a lot because of me.

654
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:53,100
That's how much I loved you, so it's okay.

655
01:11:55,519 --> 01:11:59,064
We've had our happy moments
and painful moments.

656
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:03,193
Every single moment I have had with you

657
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:07,364
will remain a beautiful memory to me.

658
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:13,412
So you don't need to worry
about me anymore.

659
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:16,790
You know,

660
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:20,169
it's really quiet here.

661
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:25,466
Because there's no one else here.

662
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:29,053
It's just the two of us.

663
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:33,599
Then…

664
01:12:35,642 --> 01:12:37,269
this must be heaven.

665
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:51,033
I'm so sleepy.

666
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:52,659
Okay.

667
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:55,371
Sleep tight.

668
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:15,909
CHA JI-WON
POLICE AGENCY

669
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:39,099
Breathe.

670
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,768
It's already been four months.

671
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:46,398
Say something. Anything is fine.

672
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,860
I want your dad to be happy.

673
01:14:49,943 --> 01:14:51,153
So…

674
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:55,157
I want your dad…

675
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,327
to live freely for once.

676
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:07,836
