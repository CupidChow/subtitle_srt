00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,221
Hee-seong!

5
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,140
-I passed it!
-What?

6
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,518
I passed the exam!

7
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,519
Really?

8
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,647
I'm officially a police officer now.

9
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,234
-Are you that happy?
-Yes, I am.

10
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,695
I'm so happy
that my heart's about to burst.

11
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,614
Aren't you happy too?

12
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,824
Of course.

13
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,537
Guess what? My mom just told me
my dream was to become

14
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,581
a police officer
when I was in kindergarten.

15
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,752
Not only did I get a job,
I also made my childhood dream come true!

16
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:33,259
-Are you sure you're happy?
-Of course, I am.

17
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,351
I'll give you an hour.

18
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,562
Come to me in an hour.

19
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,650
I miss you.

20
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:53,947
Yes.

21
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:13,967
I'm Yeom Sang-cheol.

22
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,179
Call me Mr. Yeom.

23
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:31,442
You trust people more easily
than I expected.

24
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,785
It's actually the opposite.

25
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,164
Who you are, what your intentions are,

26
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,416
and what you do with what you buy from me…

27
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,959
None of that matters to me.

28
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,503
Because in our deal,

29
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,132
it's much more important
for you to trust me.

30
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,384
What does that mean?

31
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,717
JAERIM-DONG

32
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,719
Jaerim-dong?

33
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,013
What is he doing there?

34
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,349
MY HUSBAND

35
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,101
Hey.

36
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,313
Where should I meet you?
At the police station?

37
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,276
I'll see you at the park in front of it.

38
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,083
Oh, right.

39
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,379
Put a drop of this on your pillow

40
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,090
before going to bed,
and you'll sleep really well.

41
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,887
Let me assemble this before I go.

42
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,849
-What are you doing?
-It won't take long.

43
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,560
That's not what I meant.

44
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,772
It really won't take long.

45
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,996
Look at that.

46
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,290
It looks cozy, doesn't it?

47
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,217
You left me when I needed you the most.

48
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,373
I thought you had forgotten everything,

49
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,375
but I was wrong.

50
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,270
KIM MOO-JIN

51
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,878
I don't want to apologize

52
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,506
for what I did back then.

53
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,594
I never asked you to.

54
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,431
I don't need you anymore.

55
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,269
There's nothing you can do for me.

56
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,650
Back then, I ran away.

57
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,278
That's why

58
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,866
I can understand you the best right now.

59
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,164
I killed a man.

60
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,501
And like that wasn't enough,

61
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,505
I let Hyeon-su take the blame for it.

62
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,509
And the person he cherishes the most

63
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,430
thinks he's this gruesome murderer.

64
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,809
I need to reveal the truth.

65
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,771
So don't try to talk me out of it.

66
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,314
Hae-su.

67
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,776
-We can find another way.
-Please don't!

68
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,244
Hey.

69
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:37,457
Choosing to isolate yourself
and cry about it

70
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,501
makes you the worst person!
Do you know that?

71
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,560
Why is there nothing I can do for you?

72
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,398
If you're feeling sick,

73
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,610
if your toilet has clogged,

74
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,362
if you need to carry heavy things,

75
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:13,784
or if you suddenly get so scared
that you feel like dying,

76
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,915
you can call me anytime,
whether it's night or daytime.

77
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,335
Just call me.

78
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,795
Okay?

79
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,841
I'm neither pitying you

80
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,512
nor wanting to turn back time.

81
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:35,932
I…

82
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,727
I just don't want you
to endure it by yourself.

83
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,481
That's all.

84
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,880
DO HAE-SU

85
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,094
Cha Ji-won speaking.

86
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,888
I'd like to tell you what I couldn't

87
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,057
last time.

88
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,184
Sorry?

89
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,353
I know…

90
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:28,192
who the real killer of the Gagyeong-ri
Village Head Murder Case is.

91
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,237
What do you mean by the "real killer"?

92
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,074
Hyeon-su…

93
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,036
Do Hyeon-su is innocent.

94
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,330
He never killed anyone.

95
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,333
Someone else is responsible for it.

96
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,422
When it's time…

97
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,551
When I finish what I need to do,

98
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:59,223
I'll tell you everything
about what happened that day.

99
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,852
Please don't forget

100
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,063
this promise.

101
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,561
It took exactly 58 minutes.

102
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,068
I must've been

103
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,528
the only one you had.

104
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,240
And even now,

105
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,785
I must be the only one you have.

106
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,372
Ji-won.

107
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,666
Are you hurt anywhere?

108
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,419
Why would I be?

109
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,175
About that call--

110
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,177
I didn't mean it when I said

111
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,971
that I wanted to break up.

112
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,268
And I really didn't mean it when I said

113
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,438
I didn't love you anymore.

114
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,860
I know. I know that.

115
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,822
No, you don't.

116
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,744
I wish

117
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,997
you could live as me just for one day.

118
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,545
Then you'd know…

119
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,257
how much I love you.

120
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,389
If that was possible,
none of this would feel unfair.

121
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,352
There's…

122
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,856
something wrong,

123
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,066
isn't there?

124
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,211
Do you know what you just said means?

125
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:38,716
A human trafficking broker
is involved in a serial killing?

126
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,969
Are you confident?

127
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,848
-Do you have proof?
-Only speculations for now, sir.

128
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,685
-I need more time.
-More time?

129
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,647
What if Hwang Jeong-sun dies?
How will you find the mastermind?

130
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,320
The surgery just finished.

131
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,780
Tonight will be critical.

132
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:05,868
Damn it. How could things go this awry?

133
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,662
We can only start our investigation

134
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,040
once she regains consciousness.

135
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,919
Anyway, give me a call
if she gets any better.

136
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,796
Thanks. Bye.

137
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,349
Detective Choi Jae-seop
from Gangsu Police Station.

138
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,353
Who? Ms. Oh Bok-ja?

139
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,064
I'm Oh Bok-ja
from Homi Village in Gagyeong-ri.

140
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,027
Homi Village, Gagyeong-ri, Namchon-myeon.

141
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:44,573
Pardon? You have a photo
of Do Hyeon-su from five years ago?

142
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,035
-Do you not know me?
-Of course, I do, ma'am.

143
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,746
Hello, ma'am. How may I help you?

144
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,835
I just came back home
after recuperating at my daughter's place.

145
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,795
While cleaning,

146
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,923
I found a strange item.

147
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,389
This was…

148
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,394
GANGSU POLICE STATION

149
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,396
Why didn't I think

150
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,691
that Hwang Jeong-sun could've run
out the window while I was gone?

151
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,569
I was too sure of myself.

152
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,154
I'm too embarrassed to see my teammates.

153
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,699
Are things not going well?

154
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,831
The job's too tough for me.

155
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,500
How about you be the sole breadwinner?

156
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,381
I mean…

157
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,302
Eun-ha will be
going to school in two years.

158
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,388
I've been thinking
about this for some time.

159
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,392
How about a school in the countryside?
It's popular these days.

160
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,813
Once I'm done with this case…

161
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,486
I'd like to live a quiet life
raising her in the countryside.

162
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,656
What do you

163
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,409
think about that idea?

164
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,753
CHA JI-WON
POLICE AGENCY

165
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,213
I can still remember so clearly

166
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,800
how happy you were when
you first wore this around your neck.

167
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,806
It's okay. I'm tired of this life now.

168
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,853
You're a bit strange today.

169
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,773
No, I'm not.

170
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,443
You should go. I need to get back to work.

171
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,654
I have tons of work to do.

172
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,322
Bye.

173
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,628
I'm sorry.

174
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,423
I need to go.

175
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,195
Wait for my call at 12:00 a.m. tonight.

176
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:26,837
I'm listening.

177
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,256
The deal will begin at midnight tomorrow.

178
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,634
First, bring 100 million won
in cash to my office.

179
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,364
If you pick one of them,
you can buy them tomorrow.

180
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,326
But if you're making an order,
it'll take some time.

181
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,748
Do none of them interest you?

182
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,918
That kid.

183
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,253
I'll take him.

184
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,536
The name and photo
of Do Min-seok's accomplice.

185
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,997
I want those as well.

186
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,304
In that case…

187
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,267
I can't refuse.

188
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,147
Give our client a phone.

189
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,697
This is a burner.

190
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,283
That's how we communicate.

191
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,287
I'll explain the rules now,
so listen carefully.

192
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,582
Break the rules even by the slightest,
and I call off our deal.

193
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,083
If that happens,

194
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,920
I will get rid of all evidence
quickly and without hesitation.

195
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,756
And by "evidence,"

196
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,885
I mean people as well.

197
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,658
So you're telling me…

198
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,623
that the person I hit

199
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,959
with my car…

200
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,129
is living

201
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,549
as me right now?

202
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,306
We didn't think you'd make it.

203
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,936
Then…

204
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,022
what about me?

205
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:38,528
How should I live from now on?

206
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,035
What will happen

207
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:49,373
to my life?

208
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,378
Tell me that.

209
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,548
I'll live…

210
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,427
however you two want me…

211
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,430
to live.

212
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,314
Dad.

213
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,528
Can't you

214
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,030
ask him

215
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,410
to give my name back to me?

216
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,539
Let me…

217
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,377
Let me ask him in person.

218
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,464
Let me meet with him, please?

219
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,890
HEE-SEONG

220
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,233
Why are you calling me at this hour?

221
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,610
I have a favor to ask.

222
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,904
A favor?

223
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,283
I need money.
One hundred million won in cash.

224
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:07,617
What for?

225
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,165
I think I can catch the accomplice
in the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

226
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,591
How?

227
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,677
I found someone who knows about him.

228
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,096
But he wants money in return.

229
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:34,561
Don't you want people to stop mentioning
the name "Do Hyeon-su," too?

230
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:40,233
I'll see you tomorrow.
Come by the hospital.

231
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,325
What is it? What does Hee…

232
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,620
What did Hyeon-su say?

233
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,374
It's nothing.

234
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,383
Dad.

235
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:09,513
Let me meet with him.

236
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,642
Never.

237
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,644
Why not?

238
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,899
He may feel bad

239
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,028
and give in once he sees me.

240
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,659
You shouldn't underestimate him.

241
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,996
Once he finds out that you're awake,

242
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,041
he won't be happy.

243
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,968
So…

244
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,513
what are you going to do?

245
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,766
There's nothing I can do.

246
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,019
We'll just

247
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:02,816
have to hope that
Lady Luck is on our side.

248
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,342
This time,
let's take a look at a happy face.

249
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,178
First, wrinkles form around your eyes.

250
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:17,057
Second, your cheeks rise.

251
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,604
Third,the wrinkles around your eyes move.

252
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,446
You're leaving already?
You didn't even sleep much.

253
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,532
Things are not looking good.

254
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,617
-Hwang Jeong-sun died.
-What?

255
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,743
Ji-won.

256
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,704
Wait.

257
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,210
Why aren't you asking me?

258
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,462
About what?

259
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:34,384
"What did you do with whom yesterday?
Why did you talk like that on the phone?"

260
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,555
You can tell me when you want to.

261
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,601
I'll always be ready to hear you out.

262
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,151
I'll get going.

263
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,071
Everything will work out.
Don't worry too much.

264
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,812
I'm Section Chief Yoon Sang-pil
of the violent crimes unit.

265
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:31,733
I'll brief you on the reinvestigation
of the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

266
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,405
We've already given you the news release,
so I'll answer your questions now.

267
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,993
-Yes?
-I'm Park Jin-gyu from K News.

268
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,205
This news release
isn't detailed enough for us

269
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:48,249
to determine how Hwang is related
to the Yeonju serial killing.

270
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,920
We'd also like to hear your opinion
on whether or not this sting operation

271
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,755
that led to her death was reasonable.

272
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,725
Anything unusual
about Hwang's bank account?

273
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,853
Nothing much except for the fact

274
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,607
that she wired money
to a sanatorium once a month.

275
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,317
For her demented mother.

276
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,447
Have you found out
where she was yesterday?

277
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,325
I could only find out

278
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,536
that she was at Jaerim Market
in Jaerim-dong.

279
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,037
Jaerim-dong?

280
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,872
Yes. Why?

281
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:29,999
It's nothing.

282
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:36,131
No one has claimed her body,
let alone held a funeral for her.

283
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,301
Gosh.

284
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:45,223
Right, you went to Gagyeong-ri yesterday.

285
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:48,476
Right. It was nothing important.

286
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,437
Why did you go there?

287
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,981
Well…

288
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:04,868
Hello,

289
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,787
Detective Cha Ji-won
of the Gangsu reinvestigation team.

290
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,333
Hello?

291
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,837
I'm listening.

292
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:20,216
I'd like to report something important
regarding the Yeonju Serial Murder Case.

293
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,846
May I ask who's calling, please?

294
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,183
Do Hyeon-su.

295
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,523
Who?

296
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,286
Do Hyeon-su.

297
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,588
Ji-won, who is it?

298
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,424
Who?

299
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,264
I'm listening.

300
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,935
Who is this calling?

301
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:16,314
Do Hyeon-su? The Do Hyeon-su?

302
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,066
Do Min-seok's son, Do Hyeon-su?

303
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,905
How many times do I need to say my name?

304
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:25,824
You bastard.

305
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,368
You'll be punished
for making such a prank call.

306
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,539
I could help you catch the accomplice.

307
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,957
But you're quite rude.

308
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,708
You're making me want to hang up.

309
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:39,295
Wait. Hold on a minute, sir.

310
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,965
He's Do Hyeon-su.

311
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,884
That's what he said.

312
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:54,894
First, do not bring any electronics
when we make the trade.

313
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:58,606
Second, I'll check the money first.

314
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,192
Third, once I've checked it,

315
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,862
you'll go to the designated place
and obtain the item.

316
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,113
Simple, right?

317
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,241
As for his photo,

318
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,244
I'll hand it over to you
once I check the money.

319
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,130
Mr. Do?

320
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:26,467
I'll put you on speaker now.
Will that be okay?

321
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:29,762
Sure.

322
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,184
How many detectives are there right now?

323
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,061
There are four.

324
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:41,691
Other than the four of you,
no one else should know about this.

325
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,360
Can you give me your word?

326
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,039
You have my word.

327
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,878
Just so you know,
I am recording this call as well.

328
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,632
What is it that you'd like to tell us?

329
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:12,639
There's a human trafficking ring
that kidnapped and handed over people

330
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,307
to Do Min-seok and his accomplice.

331
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,894
I know who they are.

332
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,530
Do Min-seok and his accomplice
were able to get

333
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,908
their victims through that ring.

334
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,748
And I'm making a trade with them tonight.

335
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,962
They'll be handing over a victim

336
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,923
and some information
about Do Min-seok's accomplice.

337
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:53,680
This will be your best chance
to catch them red-handed.

338
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,392
What time and where
are you supposed to meet them?

339
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:01,771
Now,

340
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,024
these are my conditions.

341
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,862
You probably already know, but this phone
is registered under someone else's name.

342
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,823
Also…

343
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,953
even if you succeed
in tracking my location…

344
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,332
it won't be easy to find me.

345
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,878
In order to help you put an end
to the reinvestigation of the Yeonju case,

346
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,464
I'll provide you
with all the information that I know.

347
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,679
I'd like you to swear
on the police's honor

348
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,973
and promise me anonymity.

349
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:41,144
In addition, I'd like you to get rid
of all the information you received

350
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,355
from our call once the case is solved.

351
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:48,985
Is there anything else?

352
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,155
No.

353
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,824
Hold on. That's all?

354
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,201
A fugitive of almost 20 years

355
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,538
called the police
merely for the sake of justice?

356
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,206
Do you expect us to buy that?

357
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,087
I'm not Do Min-seok's accomplice.

358
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,049
I just want to prove that.

359
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,387
I guess he really isn't the accomplice.

360
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,889
How can we believe him?

361
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:23,561
I mean, I don't even know
if you're the real Do Hyeon-su

362
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:26,064
or just a lunatic.

363
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,523
Mr. Do Hyeon-su.

364
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:32,695
Yes?

365
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,198
How about this?

366
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:41,412
Give us information on the person
who sold kidnapped victims to Do Min-seok.

367
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,373
We'll look into them,

368
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:48,211
and once we confirm
that you've told the truth,

369
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,546
we'll be open to more information.

370
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,549
And if we do receive more information,

371
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,803
we will agree to your demands.

372
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:06,771
Okay.

373
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,233
I'll give you information
on Yeom Sang-cheol.

374
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,652
Yeom Sang-cheol?

375
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,363
Please be prudent.

376
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,990
If he gets wind of this,

377
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,453
he'll kill all of the kidnapped victims.

378
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,163
And…

379
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,000
he'll kill me as well.

380
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,694
Hey, Ji-won.

381
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,448
What are you doing?

382
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,326
I'm on my way to buy some materials.
What is it?

383
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:03,953
Honey.

384
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,539
Come pick me up later.

385
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,041
Let's have dinner together.

386
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,838
Let's have those spicy noodles again.

387
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,506
I'm craving some.

388
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:23,139
Right, I don't think
I'll be coming home tonight.

389
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,561
-Why?
-I'm attending a funeral.

390
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,314
The father
of one of my clients passed away.

391
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:32,982
Don't go.

392
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,111
Why not?

393
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,198
Just don't. I don't want you to.

394
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,493
Ji-won.

395
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,585
The thing is…

396
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,965
I had a bad dream last night.

397
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:06,224
See? It's because
you're not getting much sleep.

398
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,852
So? Are you going to go?

399
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,730
Yes, I have to.

400
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:17,568
Do as you wish, then. Bye.

401
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,653
Ji-won.

402
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,781
I want

403
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,034
to be a decent person…

404
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,246
for you.

405
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,374
I really do.

406
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,802
I should get back to work now.

407
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,346
I'll call you…

408
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,393
around 10:00 p.m.

409
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,561
Okay.

410
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,351
Isn't it chilly?

411
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,187
Yes, but I'm okay

412
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,649
since the fresh air feels so nice.

413
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,506
Would you like a cup of warm tea?

414
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,009
Thank you.

415
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,393
How much

416
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,063
does she know?

417
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:26,197
We purposely hired
someone who can't read lips.

418
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,657
She also signed an NDA.

419
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,871
She wouldn't tell anyone
even if she knew something.

420
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,128
Hee-seong.

421
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,632
Last time…

422
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,470
you said you had to meet someone.

423
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,180
Who was it?

424
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:57,895
A woman.

425
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,356
A woman?

426
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,693
If I didn't get into that accident,

427
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,614
she and I would've met that day.

428
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,201
And if we did…

429
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,914
everything might have…

430
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,211
been completely different for all of us.

431
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,388
THREE MYSTERIES
ABOUT JUNG MI-SUK'S DISAPPEARANCE

432
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,437
"Three Mysteries
about Jung Mi-suk's Disappearance."

433
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:46,152
Everyone already knows this.
You're just hooking people with the title.

434
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,988
The important part
is that the title will hook them.

435
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,329
-What?
-You're really sly.

436
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,458
-Give it to me already.
-Give what?

437
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,501
The exclusive interview with Do Hae-su.

438
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,170
I didn't have that.

439
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,922
She came here and said
that she'd only speak with you.

440
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,966
If you didn't interview her,
what did you do?

441
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,093
I confessed my feelings.

442
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,513
Are you saying you guys are going out?

443
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,515
No.

444
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,435
-Then did she turn you down?
-She did.

445
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,020
It'll all work out, then.

446
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,813
Interview her. What's the problem?

447
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,192
How could you be so inhumane?

448
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,198
We need to meet up. It's urgent.

449
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,744
-I'm going out.
-Moo-jin.

450
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:41,790
I first met my husband
while interviewing him.

451
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,792
And you two divorced.

452
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:48,214
You told me to be prudent
about getting married because you weren't.

453
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,132
That's a different issue.

454
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,718
-Get out of here right now!
-Okay.

455
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,097
You are the wind.

456
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,601
You can go wherever you want.

457
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,687
On the count of three,

458
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:07,525
you'll arrive at your father's funeral.

459
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,443
One,

460
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,029
two,

461
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:13,864
three.

462
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,000
Ms. Do.

463
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,711
You have plenty of time.

464
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,465
Take a good look at the culprit.

465
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,350
It's strange.

466
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,937
The fingernails on his left hand…

467
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,774
are too short.

468
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,903
They look really uncomfortable.

469
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,030
You're doing well.

470
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,869
That design…

471
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,205
I've seen it before.

472
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,625
But where?

473
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:11,380
How does he look?

474
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,556
He's…

475
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:24,226
looking at me.

476
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:26,979
He's…

477
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,357
studying my face.

478
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,154
He's trying to remember my face.

479
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:38,949
I'm scared.

480
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,452
I want to get out of here.

481
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:44,079
Ms. Do, you'll wake up
on the count of three.

482
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,831
One, two, three.

483
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,588
He was trying to remember my face.

484
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,424
Don't you know what that means?

485
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,638
He's going…

486
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,599
to kill me.

487
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,727
Ms. Do, calm down.

488
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:10,648
What you just experienced
happened 18 years ago.

489
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,567
It's okay. You're fine.

490
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,028
Trust me.

491
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,574
I don't think
you should drive home yourself.

492
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,077
Is there anyone you could call?

493
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,286
I'm fine.

494
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,205
I just need a minute.

495
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:35,297
MOO-JIN

496
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,801
Yeom Sang-cheol, born in 1973.

497
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:42,054
He was sentenced to ten years in prison
for attempted murder and arson in 1990,

498
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,472
when he was 17.

499
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:46,475
But in 1997, he was paroled
in return for doing community service.

500
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:51,271
Here's what's important.
He did community service

501
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,275
at a place called
Deep Spring Children Clinic.

502
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,903
Isn't that--

503
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:01,699
Do Hyeon-su was treated there
from 1997 to 1999.

504
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,577
That means Yeom Sang-cheol
and Do Min-seok could've met.

505
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,371
That's right.

506
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,832
Then how could he have met
Hwang Jeong-sun?

507
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:13,585
Yeom owns an employment agency
in Jaerim-dong.

508
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:14,753
Ho-jun.

509
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,257
This footage was from yesterday.

510
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:22,594
She was caught on a security camera
in a parking lot across his agency.

511
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:27,516
I guess Do Hyeon-su
was telling the truth after all.

512
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,477
Yes, I'm positive.

513
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:35,524
How could a human-trafficking ring
be involved in a serial killing?

514
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,277
This is just unbelievable.

515
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,238
If we manage to arrest all of them,

516
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,491
our entire team
could get a special promotion.

517
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:47,244
Don't get ahead of yourself.

518
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,328
So,

519
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,331
we're also after Do Hyeon-su, right?

520
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,550
Are you feeling okay?

521
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,595
From now on, let me tag along.

522
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,766
She said you're not allowed
to drive after hypnotherapy.

523
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,726
I'm getting a new therapist.

524
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,270
She picked up my phone without asking me.

525
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,482
She only picked up

526
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,651
because my saved name
on your phone sounded very friendly.

527
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,615
MOO-JIN

528
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,326
REPORTER KIM

529
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:35,793
-Why don't you open your heart?
-Why should I do that to you?

530
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,337
Not to me. To your therapist.

531
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,135
She said you have deep-rooted suspicions

532
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,678
and anxiety towards others.

533
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:51,016
She said you could be
creating your own fears.

534
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:56,939
Why did Hyeon-su call?

535
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,483
I'm not sure.

536
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,694
He said he remembered something
and wanted to check yesterday.

537
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,112
I'm guessing it's about that.

538
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,660
You're going to fool Do Hyeon-su?

539
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,454
We promised to protect him
in exchange for more information.

540
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,624
There are no detectives
who protect murderers.

541
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:18,377
There's no such law either.
Aren't I right?

542
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,296
Well, yes.

543
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,924
The more times
we talk to him on the phone,

544
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,009
the easier we'll be able to locate him.

545
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,886
A few more phone calls,

546
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:31,640
and we'll be able to get
a rough idea of where he is.

547
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:34,434
We'll get the DNA samples
of men in that area

548
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,062
in their thirties and forties.

549
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:41,316
Then we'll compare them
to Do Hae-su's DNA.

550
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,902
-Since they're siblings--
-Exactly!

551
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,905
We'll be able to identify Do Hyeon-su.

552
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:51,994
Why are you so quiet?
I know you're totally up for this.

553
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,331
You called the police?

554
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:57,875
Yes.

555
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,588
And told them you're Do Hyeon-su?

556
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:08,927
That way, they'd move quickly.

557
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:10,846
We're running out of time.

558
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,850
Wait, have you gone insane?

559
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,227
They agreed to protect me
once they confirm

560
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,187
my information is true.

561
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,898
How can we believe that?

562
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,525
How can you trust the police?

563
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,820
They'll just put you away
after getting what they want.

564
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,864
Are you stupid?

565
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:33,243
You should've just received information
about the accomplice from Yeom Sang-cheol.

566
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,996
Once the police get involved,

567
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,415
he'll know that you've betrayed him.

568
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:39,958
Do you think you'll be safe?

569
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,094
I thought about…

570
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,766
what Ji-won would do if she saw those…

571
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:57,893
kidnapped victims.

572
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,563
I'm positive

573
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:05,233
that she would never turn
a blind eye to them.

574
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,949
Moo-jin, I need your help.

575
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,372
Perhaps, things may go awry.

576
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,583
We need to be prepared.

577
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,418
What about me?

578
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:26,088
I want to help out too. What should I do?

579
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:28,674
Nothing.

580
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,759
I want to help out as well.

581
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:33,762
I don't trust you enough to entrust you

582
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,138
with something important.

583
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:36,807
What?

584
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,351
You're too unpredictable.

585
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,938
Last time, you almost
made a mistake in front of Ji-won.

586
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:48,026
You're too emotional,
so likely to ruin our plan.

587
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,279
How could you hurt her like that?

588
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:52,948
I'm fine.

589
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:55,075
I know how much you love him,

590
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,035
but this bastard has no idea.

591
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,913
Hyeon-su's right, though.

592
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,469
It's Ji-won.

593
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,264
Don't pick up.

594
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,156
Yes?

595
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,827
This is Detective Cha Ji-won.

596
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,747
You're on speaker.

597
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:44,332
I'm Captain Lee U-cheol.

598
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,753
We believe what you told us.

599
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:54,551
I'll tell you one more time.
There are two steps.

600
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,847
First, I'll be handing
the money over to Yeom.

601
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,975
Once he checks the money,

602
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,353
he'll tell me the address
to the second destination.

603
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,357
Then I'll go there

604
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,943
and pick up the victim.

605
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,363
If things go awry during the first step,

606
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,742
there will be no second destination.
And consequently,

607
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,537
you won't have a chance
to raid the human trafficking scene.

608
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:27,375
So you're saying
you'll meet with Yeom first

609
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:30,504
then tell us the address
to the second destination.

610
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:34,132
After that, we'll barge in
when the victim's handed over. Right?

611
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,426
I'll take care of the first step,

612
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,763
and you'll have to take care
of the second step perfectly.

613
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:43,809
That's your only way
of apprehending Yeom's gang.

614
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:45,435
Mr. Do.

615
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:50,315
Doing this single-handedly
sounds too dangerous.

616
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,067
You need police backup.

617
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,363
Where is the first destination?

618
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:57,823
No.

619
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,743
I refuse to allow you to come there.

620
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,620
Look, Mr. Do.

621
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:08,083
We're saying we'll be keeping you safe.

622
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:10,085
Trust us. We won't arrest you.

623
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,800
Mr. Do.

624
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,262
Please trust us.

625
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,101
Here's what's important.

626
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:28,603
In order to track him,

627
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:31,189
we need to speak with him
on the phone many times.

628
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:36,069
When it comes to tasks like this one,
Ji-won is our best bet.

629
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:39,948
I can't do that.

630
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,496
Do Hyeon-su put himself at risk
and tipped us off

631
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,748
to save the kidnapped.

632
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:54,588
If we have to stab
such an informant in the back…

633
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,923
If that's our job,

634
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,303
then I'll just leave this team.

635
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:06,850
We're not some cheap bastards
who backstab their informants

636
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:09,227
who are working for the common good.

637
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,146
You can really count on us.

638
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:18,069
Your plan doesn't guarantee your safety.
That's what we're concerned about.

639
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,406
We're going to do

640
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,534
our best to protect you.

641
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,079
So please think about your safety first.

642
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:32,542
I won't be communicating
with the police in any way.

643
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:37,005
You should focus
on saving the kidnapped victims.

644
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,133
I'll focus on what I need to do.

645
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,071
How are our goods doing?

646
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:05,200
The elderly one isn't doing too well.
It's diabetes.

647
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:07,911
And the boy?

648
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,497
He's a bit exhausted, but he's okay.

649
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,709
-There's no problem as long as he's okay.
-Yes, sir.

650
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:18,046
-Is Hwang Jeong-sun really dead?
-Yes, I've confirmed it.

651
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,842
It's all for the best. We don't need
to get rid of her ourselves now.

652
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:28,640
She fell into the cops' trap.

653
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:31,309
What an idiot.

654
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,814
She had been so full of herself,
so I was getting annoyed, actually.

655
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:39,818
Why are you laughing?

656
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:43,113
She was still one of ours, you know?

657
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:44,990
I'm sorry, sir.

658
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,368
We should lie low for a while
once this deal is over.

659
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,746
Load the remaining goods on the ship.

660
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,540
Yes, sir.

661
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,044
I'm back, sir.

662
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,600
I'm happy to see him again
after a long time.

663
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,062
Do Min-seok and he
used to be attached at the hip.

664
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,565
Haven't seen him at all
these days, though.

665
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,037
I believe

666
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:37,250
problems that can be solved
with money are the easiest ones.

667
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,252
However,

668
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,839
I'm afraid this time
you'll only create a bigger mess,

669
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:45,133
and you certainly won't solve the problem.

670
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,261
I'll solve it.

671
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:50,472
Hyeon-su.

672
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,727
I'll give you ten times this money.

673
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,608
Leave without anyone knowing.

674
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,819
Don't worry about your family.

675
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,490
I'll take care of the rest.

676
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,706
I don't want to.

677
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:18,917
Why not?

678
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,336
I don't want you

679
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,339
to take care of my family.

680
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,218
What do you think of me?

681
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,431
I think you and I are similar.

682
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:35,308
What?

683
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,019
We'll both do

684
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,481
anything to get what we want.

685
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,696
And you?

686
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,909
Would you be okay
to let me take care of your family?

687
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,037
All right, then.

688
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,707
I somewhat feel at ease

689
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,293
by your frankness.

690
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,675
I'm very relieved that you and I want

691
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:10,760
the same thing.

692
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:18,601
I should get going.

693
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,353
All right.

694
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:25,942
Hyeon-su.

695
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,034
Goodbye.

696
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:55,346
Who on earth tipped you off?

697
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,931
I can't tell you, sir.

698
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:01,227
You refuse to tell me who it is,

699
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:02,979
yet you still want backup?

700
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:06,024
Yes, sir. I'd appreciate
as many men as possible.

701
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:11,529
To solve the Yeonju Serial Murder Case
once and for all, we must

702
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,698
catch Yeom Sang-cheol.

703
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,452
U-cheol, look me in the eye.

704
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,293
Are you absolutely sure about this?

705
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:40,600
Ji-won.

706
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:43,811
I'll never say this again,
so listen carefully.

707
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:48,525
I'm truly glad that you're on this team.

708
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:52,612
I realized it today once again.

709
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,993
What is this?

710
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,288
You seem a bit moved.

711
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:05,708
You're so slow-witted.

712
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:09,337
That's not it.
She's feeling nauseous because of

713
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:11,047
your unctuous words.

714
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,925
Ji-won, it's okay. You can vomit.

715
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:16,052
You little… Come here.

716
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,805
We'll talk after I take this.

717
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:22,850
Hey.

718
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:26,479
I'm calling about the formatted recorder.
The data recovery's done.

719
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:12,233
-Yes?
-I have a question.

720
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:17,030
Nam Sun-gil's wife gave me your bag.

721
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:22,327
And I got to listen to the recorder.

722
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:27,040
Can you tell me…

723
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,585
whose voice that is?

724
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:38,760
-If you don't want to--
-It's my mom.

725
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:41,929
Pardon?

726
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:44,766
It was in 1997,

727
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,811
right before my mom went missing.

728
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:55,151
She gave it to me saying
it was a recording of her voice.

729
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,364
My father reported her missing,

730
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:03,409
and the police took her belongings.

731
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,453
I didn't tell them about it

732
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:09,040
because I was afraid
they'd take it away from me.

733
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:13,836
You must have…

734
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,799
truly loved your mother.

735
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:20,927
I was diagnosed

736
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:24,931
as someone
who lacked empathy by a psychiatrist.

737
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:29,644
It's impossible for me
to feel such an emotion.

738
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:35,650
Then why did you hold onto it
for such a long time?

739
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,946
I'm afraid I don't know.

740
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:44,659
I've never seen a doctor
regarding the reason behind that behavior,

741
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,995
so I cannot explain it.

742
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,209
I…

743
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,385
don't want to lie to you.

744
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,473
Mr. Do.

745
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:11,394
Yes?

746
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:16,107
Please…

747
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,572
don't get hurt.

748
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,410
Pardon?

749
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:30,037
Goodbye.

750
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,262
I'll call you…

751
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,182
around 10:00 p.m.

752
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:22,465
I believe the sound on the cassette

753
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:26,552
encouraged and set him off
to be aggressive and violent.

754
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,228
Detective Cha?

755
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,647
Why didn't you know?

756
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:38,773
Sorry?

757
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:42,443
Why did you never consider
the possibility that the cassette might be

758
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:43,736
from his own mother?

759
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,656
Ms. Cha, I'm not following you.

760
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:49,826
His mother had just gone missing
when you treated him.

761
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:53,663
Then it should've been obvious
what that young boy was obsessed with.

762
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:55,957
Any normal kid would've done the same.

763
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,417
-Ms. Cha.
-You should've known that.

764
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:02,505
You were the only one
who could help him back then.

765
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:04,966
-But--
-At least you should've known!

766
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,771
Why are you all asking me for help?

767
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,232
You even have your own forensics team.

768
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:23,901
I hate leaving any records behind.

769
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,737
By the way, "you all"?
Someone else was here?

770
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:29,323
Yes, the detective
you brought along with you last time.

771
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:30,449
The female detective.

772
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:32,994
Cha Ji-won? Why was she here?

773
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:36,330
Come on. I can't do this work
for long if I tell things like that.

774
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:39,500
What a professional.
This is exactly why I like you.

775
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:40,418
Anyway…

776
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:44,338
He is quite strict.

777
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:48,843
He hates it
when things don't go as planned.

778
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:51,596
So he's obsessive about plans.

779
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:55,224
I can't wait to see the headline
of your article, Reporter Kim Moo-jin.

780
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:02,023
-Step on it.
-Hey.

781
01:05:02,106 --> 01:05:04,692
Will we be able
to get there before they do?

782
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:06,652
Yes, for sure.

783
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:07,737
How so?

784
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:13,367
First, I'd like to thank Team Two
for backing us up.

785
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:16,954
Let me brief you on our operation.

786
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:20,958
As you all know, there will be
a human trafficking deal tonight.

787
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:24,337
But first, let me tell you
about the human trafficking ring.

788
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,379
Hyeon-su.

789
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,966
How did Do Hyeon-su
turn into Baek Hee-seong?

790
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:38,100
Forget about everyone else.
How did you fool your wife?

791
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:42,313
-Hey, Moo-jin.
-Yes? I'm listening.

792
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:44,649
I won't judge.

793
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:47,151
Ji-won doesn't know anything about me.

794
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:51,489
About my past or how I'm not normal.

795
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:56,160
Hyeon-su.

796
01:05:57,453 --> 01:06:00,706
How did Do Hyeon-su
turn into Baek Hee-seong?

797
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,169
I'm against it.

798
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:08,047
The very fact that
you're obsessing over a ghost like him

799
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,424
proves that we're
completely lost on this case.

800
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,385
He's not the accomplice.

801
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:15,137
I'm sure. Trust me on this.

802
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,597
Mr. Do.

803
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,184
Please trust us.

804
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,645
We're going to do

805
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:25,815
our best to protect you.

806
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:29,443
So please think about your safety first.

807
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,900
Why are you staring at me?

808
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,613
Did you have to say that to Hae-su?

809
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:17,575
You don't know how hurt she was, do you?

810
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:22,038
Of course, you don't. How would you?

811
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,499
It's just too dangerous for her.

812
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,418
Then you should've said so.

813
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:30,129
That it's too dangerous,
so you can't let her help you.

814
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:35,551
The more dangerous it is,
the more she is willing to help out.

815
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:38,888
What? Then what about me?

816
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,349
Why have you dragged me
into this dangerous situation?

817
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,186
I asked you,

818
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:47,563
but you're the one who made the choice.

819
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:51,942
You're right.
Why the hell did I agree to help you out?

820
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,821
Because I asked you for help
in front of Hae-su.

821
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:59,992
You never say no to me when she's around

822
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,912
because you want her to like you.

823
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:08,501
What? So are you saying
that you manipulated me or something?

824
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,879
Yes. I've been doing it
since we were young,

825
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:14,632
and I'll probably keep doing it.

ILSIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

830
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:13,524
Yeom targeted individuals
who either had no family

831
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:16,777
or had a history
of running away from home.

832
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:19,613
It's highly likely
that the currently kidnapped victims

833
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:22,992
have never been reported missing.

834
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:36,505
Get out.

835
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:38,340
What?

836
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,176
Get out now.

837
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,053
You have no right to be here.

838
01:09:44,763 --> 01:09:46,515
-Detective Choi.
-What's wrong?

839
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:47,725
What is it?

840
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,352
Detective Choi.

841
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:53,480
Let go. Let go, and we'll talk.

842
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:55,232
Jae-seop, let go of her.

843
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:56,692
What are you doing?

844
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:01,363
You knew, didn't you?

845
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:06,535
About what?

846
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:09,496
You knew everything, didn't you?

847
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:17,046
How could you?

848
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,841
How could you of all people do that?

849
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:25,262
You knew everything.

850
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,599
And all this time…

851
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,353
you've been manipulating us.

852
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,188
You have

853
01:10:35,272 --> 01:10:36,649
deceived us.

854
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:48,911
Mr. Do.

855
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:51,997
Please…

856
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:55,584
don't get hurt.

857
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:28,575
What you're feeling right now isn't real.

858
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:32,037
He would never harm other people.

859
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,330
Do you have proof?

860
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:35,374
I want to solve this case
more than anyone else.

861
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:37,710
Take yourself off the case.
It's only right.

862
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:39,586
I'm sorry for visiting so late at night.

863
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:41,672
My name is Do Hae-su.

864
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:43,465
You can't go home.

865
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:45,259
Run as far as you can tonight.

866
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:47,886
Detective Choi has proof
that you're Do Hyeon-su.

867
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,306
Hide somewhere even I can't find

868
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,225
and don't you ever come back to me.

869
01:11:54,518 --> 01:11:58,689
