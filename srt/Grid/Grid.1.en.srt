00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,030
<i>We covered the entire Earth
with the Grid in 2004.</i>

2
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,900
<i>They say if the solar wind
had come a year earlier,</i>

3
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,740
<i>two-thirds of mankind would have died.</i>

4
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,990
<i>If it weren't for this girl...</i>

5
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:55,990
<i>We wouldn't be here now.</i>

6
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,290
<i>Magnetic fields
can no longer protect the earth.</i>

7
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,210
<i>I've seen the world without the Grid.</i>

8
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,710
<i>I don't think going back in time is
only for people in the 21st century.</i>

9
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,300
We've been waiting for this person
for as long as 24 years.

10
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,420
We need to see it through.

11
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,760
<i>The Korean government may be able
to do it in 2021.</i>

12
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,140
<i>If I meet the founder of the Grid?</i>

13
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,890
Open this!

14
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,100
<i>Then I've got to ask
this question.</i>

15
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,770
<i>How is time travel possible?</i>

16
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,600
<i>What's the future of mankind?</i>

17
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,140
<i>As the solar wind
that came around this time yesterday</i>

18
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,390
<i>damaged the ionosphere,</i>

19
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,850
<i>the world is currently facing problems</i>

20
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,480
<i>such as communication failure
and power outages.</i>

21
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,900
<i>According to experts,</i>

22
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,230
<i>this explosion caused materials on
the surface of the sun to release as well,</i>

23
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,740
<i>so strong UV and X-ray radiations
might reach the Earth's surface.</i>

24
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,570
<i>Therefore, you should refrain
from going out—</i>

25
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,250
Hey. Are you home?

26
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,540
Don't be scared. It's nothing.

27
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,300
Yes. I'll soon...

28
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,430
Saeha. Can you hear me?

29
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,430
SON

30
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,510
Saeha.

31
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,060
Can you hear...

32
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,990
Mom...

33
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,660
Mom!

34
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,200
OUT OF SERVICE AREA

35
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,540
Everyone, get inside!

36
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,460
Go back to the classroom, everyone!

37
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,380
Hurry up!

38
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,550
Get your things and get inside safely.

JUNG SAEBYEOK

40
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,390
Jung Saebyeok! Hurry!

41
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,570
<i>Rumors that all species
on Earth will extinct are groundless.</i>

42
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,530
<i>Even if the Earth is
exposed to the solar wind...</i>

43
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,860
If we lived in the Stone Age,

44
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,830
even in cases of huge solar flares,

45
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:29,410
the damage will be only limited
to fires and injuries.

46
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:35,090
<i>But we're living in the digital era
with cable and radio communication,</i>

47
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:40,470
<i>where everything can be controlled
by pressing one button.</i>

48
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,510
The biggest problem would be
an "internet apocalypse."

49
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,390
<i>If we lost the internet,
everything in this world will halt.</i>

50
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,100
<i>Importing will be disrupted.</i>

51
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,980
<i>People will suffer from famine
on a wide scale</i>

52
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,070
<i>not because of food shortage,</i>

53
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,990
<i>but because every plane and ship
in the world</i>

54
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,360
<i>will stop operating.</i>

55
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,910
<i>Even if we restore it,</i>

56
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,160
<i>it's no use if the export countries fail
to restore it.</i>

57
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,060
<i>The first quarter
of 2005 has only just begun</i>

58
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,270
<i>and the loss amounts
to one billion dollars.</i>

59
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,610
<i>Nine thousand households
are left without power</i>

60
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,030
<i>after Hydro-Québec's transport systems
caught on fire.</i>

61
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,860
Sir. It's all set.

62
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,610
Now all we have to do is connect it.

63
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,160
Hello?

64
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,090
Hello?

65
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,130
Yes, sir. We'll begin.

66
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,470
Thank you.

67
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,140
We hope so too.

68
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,190
Shield transmission is starting.

69
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,250
Will it work?

70
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,330
It must.

71
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,210
That's right.

72
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,750
Three seconds left to connect the Grid.

73
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,550
Two, one. Connect.

74
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,020
Did something go wrong?

75
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,680
What's the problem?

76
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,900
Why isn't it working?

77
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,060
Did we connect it properly?

78
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,400
Did we fail?

79
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,280
I think we need to check.

80
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,820
Did we make any mistakes?

81
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,530
Did we fail?

82
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,250
Why isn't it working?

83
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,270
Hey, guys. It looks fine now.

84
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,520
Really?

85
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,610
Gosh, it's a relief.

86
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,700
- Gosh.
- I was really scared.

87
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,410
Hey, Jung Saebyeok!
Are you okay?

88
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,900
The northern hemisphere all connected.

89
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,610
- It's fully running.
- Southern hemisphere is also connected.

90
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,280
The magnetic fields are connecting
to the coronal loops.

91
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,320
Sir. It's a success.

92
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,300
Please tell him that it's all connected.

93
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,680
Yes, it's a success.

94
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,350
Thank you.

95
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:30,890
Good job, everyone.

96
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,860
Good job, gosh.

97
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,770
Good job.

98
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,070
Gosh, it was really...

99
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,040
She was right...

100
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,710

OCTOBER 30, 2021

109
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,870
Hello?

110
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,580
Is anyone here?

111
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,590
Hello?

112
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,350
I need a set of garbage bags, 10L ones.

113
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,250
Thank you.

114
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,660
Ah!

115
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,960
<i>Hello. 911 Emergency Services.</i>

116
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,250
Someone is unconscious here.

117
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,800
I'm at a convenience store
near Green Apartment in Pyosudong.

118
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,410
That one.

119
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,130
When I walked in,
I smelled nothing but cup noodles.

120
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,970
And I think he was holding a beer can
when he walked out of the store later.

121
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,140
You thought he was a part-timer
at this store,

122
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,680
but he was holding a beer can?

123
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,600
I thought he was a part-timer
cleaning up or something.

124
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,950
Here's the cup <i>ramyeon</i>
the suspect supposedly ate.

125
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,370
This man.

126
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
This fellow?

127
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,760
Welcome.

128
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,980
What? Look at him.
He paid cash.

129
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,900
Did he plan to kill him?
Or did he not have a credit card?

130
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,700
The victim is saying something here.

131
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,330
Did they know each other?
You think it was a grudge killing?

132
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,870
What is he saying? Rewind it.

133
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,540
"Excuse me, sir.
You can't drink alcohol in here."

134
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,380
- Who?
- He told the suspect

135
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,800
not to drink alcohol in the store.

136
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,170
The victim did? How do you know?

137
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,590
That's what he said.

138
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,680
Right. I think he's right.

139
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,760
When he opened the can here,

140
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,720
the victim said something
looking at the table.

141
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,980
He must've heard the can opening.

142
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,980
- Can I go now, then?
- Sorry?

143
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,650
- Hey, can he?
- Yes, I got his number.

144
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,320
All right.

145
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,030
What about the fingerprints?

146
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,570
- Well...
- My gosh. It's all smudged.

147
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,160
- Just a minute.
- We can't use any of these.

148
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,870
Gosh, this is not good.

149
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,290
Jeez.

150
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,860
His fingers must be
covered with calluses.

151
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,020
He must've done hard labor
for a long time.

152
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:59,150
People who do hard labor are
the hardest to identify. Jeez.

153
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,450
Huh?

154
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:09,040
- Hey, keep playing.
- Yes, sir.

155
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,080
He's saying something again here.

156
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,750
Should I rewind it?

157
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,220
Wait, sir.

158
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,430
You can read people's lips, can't you?

159
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,310
So?

160
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:31,680
The victim told the suspect
not to drink inside, but he ignored it.

161
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,770
Here. What is the victim saying here?

162
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,690
It seems that the suspect
heard him say something

163
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,610
and followed him to the storage room.

164

I'll show you again.

I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry.

167
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,170
Is there no security camera
in here?

168
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,170
There is one.
But it's behind a box.

169
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,470
That man bought garbage bags here.

170
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,220
I'm sure he doesn't have any plans.

171
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,890
I guess his wife nags him
if he makes her wait.

172
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,440
He just doesn't want to get involved.
You know how people are these days.

173
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,980
Let's see.

174
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,820
Did he stab him in a fit of anger
because he said he was ill-bred?

175
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:30,540
If this is a random murder,
it's going to be a headache.

176
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,780
- Hey.
- I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

177
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,870
No, it's okay. By the way,
I definitely saw garbage bags here...

178
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,160
I'll take care of this.

179
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,120
And I'll pay you for the extra work.

180

No, it's just once in a while.

00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,200
You should stay quiet.

319
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:01,160
She really vanished into thin air
right before my eyes.

320
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,120
How are we going to find him
this late at night?

321
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:07,170
We almost caught him.
That was so close.

322
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,220
This evidence means
that he has an accomplice.

323
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,550
Yes, he obviously does.

324
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,800
Who do you think threw down
the rope for him from the rooftop?

325
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:21,560
But you're saying
that accomplice was a phantom.

326
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:23,520
She disappeared like a ghost?

327
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:26,360
Hey. Who would believe that?

328
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,110
Damn it.

329
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,170
AFTER THAT, THE WOMAN...

330
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:53,510
SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED INTO THIN AIR...

331
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:55,090
<i>"Suddenly disappeared
into thin air"?</i>

332
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:57,720
<i>After that, the woman suddenly
disappeared into thin air,</i>

333
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,350
<i>so I couldn't arrest her.</i>

334
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:28,500
SKETCH OF THE ACCOMPLICE

335
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,530
<i>She's presumed to be
murderer suspect Kim Manok's accomplice.</i>

336
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:56,570
<i>Therefore...</i>

337
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:55,340
<i>I'm now trying to identify her
and track her whereabouts.</i>
