Doctor!

11
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,480
Why? Why does this always happen
if you live?

12
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,020
No! Don't come out!

13
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,910
Siwon.

14
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,910
Siwon!

Siwon!

00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,620
No! Siwon!

17
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,880
You! Why...

18
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,170
Siwon. It's okay. It's all right.

19
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,110
"D-Panthenol."

20
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,400
A vitamin?

21
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,450
What must I do?

22
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,450
What must I do to change the outcome?
You know the answer.

23
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,290
If I save someone's life, the Grid disappears.
And if I try to change that...

24
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,580
- You must know another way.
- I don't.

25
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,540
No, you must know.

26
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,500
- Hey! Careful!
- Come down!

27
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,130
I did it because it's
the only way I know.

28
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
So this is it?

29
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,930
Don't try to change anything.

30
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,890
I teleported many times,
but I'm fine.

31
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,690
I'm talking about your damaged DNA.

32
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,060
You're not sick.

33
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,770
You're perishing.

34
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,900
Thanks to you, I got much better.

35
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,150
Does the janitor have to die
for you to live?

36
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,820
Then what about my father?

37
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,820
No, right?

38
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,830
You just needed an ID
for the lab, didn't you?

39
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,750
That's what I thought.

41
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,760
You even burned a man to death
before his child's eyes.

42
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,510
Do people in the future
have no conscience?

43
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,140
Don't you feel sorry for the victims?

44
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,600
A lot of people died
during the Joseon Dynasty.

45
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,100
Is that heartbreaking too?

46
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,650
What are you waiting for?
Go save those people.

47
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,110
Only then can you
call yourself conscientious.

48
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,820
You wouldn't have gone this far
if it were for the Grid.

49
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,620
This must be to save your own skin.

50
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,040
You're going around ruining everything
just to save yourself.

51
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,750
You're the one ruining everything.

52
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,630
Stay out of this.

Siwon. Go over there. Hurry.

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,950
Go now!

62
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,710
Dad!

63
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,760

64
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,680
Let's go.

65
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,250
Mr. Kwon!

66
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,720
That's enough.

67
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,100
He won't tell anyone.

68
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,680
Don't hurt him.

69
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,150
I won't tell anyone. I swear... I won't.

70
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,190
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for his help.

71
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,240
It doesn't matter.
I can always turn back time.

72
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,740
Then no one will know.

73
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,410
Until someone comes,
he'll be lying here all night long.

74
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,710
- Please contact his family.
- I will.

75
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,800
It's not your fault.

76
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,380
What happened to that child too.

YEAR 2000

78
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,470
You won't make it home
before sunset at that rate.

79
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,760
Who, me?

80
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:16,890
Yes, you.

81
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:18,890
Kwon Saeha.

82
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,940
Do you know me?

83
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,690
Do you not want to go home quickly?

84
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,070
Because your mom drinks all the time?

85
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,420
Who are you, mister?

86
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,960
I'm a friend of your dad's.

87
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,470
My dad passed away

88
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,470
a long time ago.

89
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,470
Is that so?

90
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,720
He passed away mysteriously.

91
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,350
Mysteriously? How?

92
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,440
I don't know.

93
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,980
I heard it was like he got electrocuted.

94
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,650
Who told you that?

95
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,910
I don't know.

96
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,870
My uncle.

97
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,910
I heard him say that to my mom.

98
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,920
Saeha.

99
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,550
Hurry up and go home.
I know you want to go to the bathroom.

100
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,890
How did you know?

101
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,810
Go to the bathroom first
when you get home. Okay?

102
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,960
You'll be fine.

103
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,210
You'll become a grown-up soon.

104
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,760
Let's do...

105
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,100
everything we want to do then.

106
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,390
Your mom loves you.

107
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,400
She's just...

108
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,110
having a hard time now.

109
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,860
So don't hate her so much.

110
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,700
It's a blue light. Go on now.

111
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,870
It's a green light.

112
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,290
Saeha. You aren't home yet, are you?

113
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,430
Are you home, Saeha?

117
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,140
I already injected a lot.

118
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,970

- Don't do it, Eojin.

119

120
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,100
Don't you know

121
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,720
What a great persuader.

122
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,180
Why is that...

123
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,110
Put that down.

124
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,490
You went there, didn't you?

125
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,830
Was this the only way?

126
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,380
I saw a world without the Grid.

127
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,760
What was it that I saw then?

128
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,610
You know what I'm talking about.

129
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,730
Saebyeok.

130
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,280
When did this happen?

131
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,860
Did I see it on my own,
or did you show it to me?

132
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,120
Answer me.

00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,500
Damn it. What is it?

135
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,290
Eojin, get out of there now.

136
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,340
Do you think I want to be in here?

137
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,170
<i>You must get out now.
On the door, they set...</i>

138
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,970
- Jongyi.
- Give it back. Who are you to...

139
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:08,930
Back off.

140
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,650
What did she say?

141
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,320
I'm not sure.
She said "on the door" and...

142
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,910
Wait.

143
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,120
You stay here.

144
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:51,840
No, don't do that!

145
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,430
Hold on!

According to the DNA analysis results...

148

- Oh, I'm sorry.

- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

Gosh.

151
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,100

What about him?

160
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,080
It seemed he got into a fight

00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,780
<i>You're safe, right?</i>

170
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,030
Why wouldn't I be okay?

171
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,750
You sound fine.

172
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,170
<i>It's fine then.</i>

173
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,840
Good.

174
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,850
WELL DONE! YOUR SAFETY
IS YOUR FAMILY'S HAPPINESS!

175
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,530
Hand it over.

176
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,810
He won't tell anyone.

00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,500
By the way...

182
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,500
Thank you.

183
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,090
Go bring a station worker.

184
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,720
Oh, okay.

185
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,600
Damn it.

186
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,810
Why does someone else die
every time I save someone?

187
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,440
<i>You have arrived at your destination.
Navigation will end.</i>

188
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,230
Mother.

189
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,230
Yes?

190
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,690
What is this? What happened to you?

191
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,020
Did you have an accident?

192
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,030
Are you okay, Mom?

193
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:36,200
I should be asking you. You're bleeding.

194
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,410
Who did this to you?

195
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:40,330
Oh, it got on me during
an evacuation drill. It's not mine.

196
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,870
What kind of drill makes a person look
like that? For goodness' sake.

197
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,370
And why can't I find the ointment?

198
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,130
Did you really not have an accident?

199
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:53,130
My car is parked outside. It's fine.

200
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,470
How did you get that
scratch on your face?

201
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,380
What's the point of giving you
a handsome face?

2005 THE HERO OF THE WORLD

10TH ANNUAL MEMORIAL CEREMONY
FOR THE DEATH OF DOCTOR KWON SUKEUN

204
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,090
Did someone at your company do this?
Is that why you're home early?

205
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,140
Who at my company would do this?

206
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,680
That viper.

207
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,810
Who knows what she has done
to my precious son?

208
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:49,890
Who's the viper?

209
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,990
You know this person, don't you?

210
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,960
No, I've never seen him before.

211
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,790
What's your husband's relationship
with him?

212
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,250
Any grudge against him?

213
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,840
Sorry?

214
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,010
<i>"What's your husband's
relationship with him?</i>

215
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,090
<i>Any grudge against him?"</i>

216
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,300
<i>They kept asking me those questions.</i>

217
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,850
I've really never seen him before.

218
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,810
<i>Even though I clearly told them</i>

219
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:33,440
<i>that I had never seen that father
of a child in the picture before.</i>

220
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:43,450
<i>I later heard that the janitor
had died, and I went to his funeral.</i>

221
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:49,410
<i>Because the lab people assumed that
my husband had a grudge against him.</i>

222
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,960
<i>And it was on the same day.</i>

223
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,330
<i>I was afraid</i>

224
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,920
<i>that my husband might have killed him.</i>

225

CERTIFICATE OF MERIT
KWON SUKEUN

226
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,380
I was afraid your dad
might have killed a person

227
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,220
and killed himself as well.

228
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,720
But I got kicked out
as soon as I got there.

229
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,190
How did the janitor's family
recognize you?

230
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,440
The lab people did.

231
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,860
She was there too.

232
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,780
The lab people and the deputy director

233
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,530
kicked you out of there?

234
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,910
And watched you too?

235
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:27,160
At first, I thought they were really
treating my husband like a hero.

236
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,410
And I thought they frequented our house
to check in on you and me.

237
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,250
Regardless of that,

238
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,050
your dad was the one who built the Grid.

239
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,510
Then why did you worry
he might have killed himself?

240
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:51,060
I thought it was strange even before
your uncle said it was strange.

241
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,940
He was totally healthy,
but dying from overwork?

242
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,440
How could I not know

243
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,270
whether he was in condition
to collapse from overwork or not?

244
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,690
Anyway, they're all liars, those snakes.

245
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,200
Don't trust her blindly
just because she's your boss.

246
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,200
Okay.

247
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,990
<i>The person you have called
is unavailable. You'll be...</i>

248
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,950
KWON SAEHA

249
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,250
- Should I keep calling?
- No.

250
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,830
What's with him going AWOL?

251
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,040
Maybe he fears nothing
because he's got connections.

252
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,710
He's never flaunted
his connections though.

253
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,220
He looks that way to you
because you love people

254
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,300
who get jobs through their connections.

255
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,640
But he's like
a pillar of the organization.

256
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,020
You two must not fear anything too.

257
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,070
It's this way. Please follow me.

258
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,630
My goodness. She did say
she heard something from here.

259
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,260
Why did she come down here alone?

260
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,380
I feel so bad for her. Poor lady.

261
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,890
- It's this way.
- How could this have happened?

262
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,840
Let's hear it.

263
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,050
Ms. Choi!

264
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,620
Investigator Jung Saebyeok?

265
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,040
This is where Kim Manok was
until this morning.

266
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,500
I presume that he killed her
during his escape.

267
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,460
Escape? Was he locked up?

268
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,670
It seems so.

269
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,880
It's been pulled up and down recently.

270
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,220
What about these food packages?

271
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,640
He couldn't have ordered them in then.

272
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,100
I suppose the woman bought them herself.

273
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,600
Gloves are over there.

274
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:41,640
Thank you.

275
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,770
Then I guess these
were left by the Ghost.

276
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,690
Since the murderer must've been
locked up inside the shutters.

277
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,150
Then we'll pick them up.

278
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,860
No, don't touch them.

279
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,910
It's under their jurisdiction. Let them.

280
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,410
I don't see any of your colleagues.

281
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:02,960
Manok was caught on camera getting out of
the station, so they're out asking around.

282
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,790
- On the CCTV cameras here?
- Yes.

283
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,000
But the woman...

284
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,250
I have no expectations now.

285
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,050
Hold on. What time
was he caught on camera?

286
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:14,300
- At 10:00 a.m.
- That was only a few hours ago.

287
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:19,310
Kim Manok was caught on camera getting out
of Gudong Station at ten this morning.

288
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,730
Okay. You can do that.

289
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,900
The police are already
searching for him though.

290
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,860
What were you doing
when the detectives found traces of him?

291
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,690
You may move the body now.

292
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,990
Okay, but...

293
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,070
Honey...

294
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,070
My dear wife.

295
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,800
Honey...

296
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,450
How did you know Kim Manok was here?

297
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,080
- I didn't.
- Then?

298
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:10,500
I had no clue, but I had to catch him.

299
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,880
So I thought I should start
from where he was last seen.

300
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,760
How did you know he was last seen here?

301
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,640
When the restaurant owner got hurt,

302
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,310
I asked people in the area then as well.

303
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,660
Bye, then.

304
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,780
Have you been transferred yet?

305
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,160
Mido.

306
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,950
It's today.

307
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:49,000
That's right. It's today.

308
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:53,130
And it also happens to be today that
you informed us of what happened here.

309
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,130
But that doesn't mean
your relocation will be canceled.

310
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,590
I informed you
hoping you would catch the woman soon.

311
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,560
Because if she's not caught,
it's pointless to catch Kim Manok.

312
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:09,310
I think you would suit us better
than the police.

313
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,310
The Secretariat.

314
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,030
I hope you'll find out for yourself...

315
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,780
what she is capable of doing

316
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,030
and what technology she uses.

317
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,330
And where it takes human civilization.

318
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,330
I truly hope that
you'll see for yourself.

319
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,700
- Wait.
- Sorry?

320
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,000
Please go first. I'll catch up with you.

321
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,340

00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:25,360
When that woman came to take you,

329
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,860
I should've thrown salt at her
and kicked her out.

330
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,860
Where did she take me?

331
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,200
Where else? The Administration Bureau.

332
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,750
Talking about special employment...

333
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:41,080
If Doctor Kwon's son didn't work
at the Administration Bureau, then who...

334
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,580
Goodness.

335
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,420
Special employment?

336
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,640
The founder of the Grid has changed.

337
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:56,260
Does that mean...

338
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:56,240
SONGJE POLICE STATION, JUNG SAEBYEOK

339
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:00,830
Feel free to contact me
if you need anything.

340
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,820
I should've killed that jerk.

341
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:25,790
It's this house.

342
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:58,950
Earlier, for a moment,

343
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:03,240
I remembered what we used to be like.

344
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,620
Getting calls from you while at work.

345
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,040
During lunch breaks.

346
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,630
Or before getting off work.

347
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,720
We talked about
whether we'd be home late.

348
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:23,510
Or where we should meet up for dinner.
Things like that.

349
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:28,180
We used to talk about
such trivial things.

350
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,190
Don't be so offended by it.

351
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,570
It was just for a brief moment.

352
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,570
That's not it.

353
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:54,170
Why did you wonder if I was okay?

354
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:58,380
I just had a bad dream.

355
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:06,350
It's not that I dream about you
every day though.

356
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,600
We'll be late.

357
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,440
For what?

358
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:22,150
Why do you think the Ghost locked him up?
She's the one who helped him flee.

359
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:25,120
What I really don't understand is

360
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:27,950
why she let him go now.

361
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:34,790
She opened the shutters.
That means she intended to let him go.

362
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,710
Maybe she knew we'd come to get him.

363
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,800
How?

364
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:49,930
I'm sure it's easy for the Ghost
to stop him from running away.

365
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:55,060
Can I take this off?

366
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,610
You've changed a lot.

367
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,200
Before, you would have taken it off
without even asking.

368
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:16,290
That's not what I meant.

369
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:23,970
Is something wrong with Mr. Kwon Saeha?

370
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:25,260
How do you know him?

371
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:26,760
Is he really sick?

372
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:28,720
Is that why he didn't come?

373
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:30,680
How do you know Kwon Saeha?

374
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,020
Of course I do...

375
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,520
We met the other day.

376
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:46,200
He suddenly left this afternoon
and didn't come back.

377
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,710
- Where are you going now?
- What?

378
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:02,210
- Why?
- What do you mean?

379
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:05,630
I mean, why do you ask where I'm going?

380
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,630
Can't I ask?

381
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:10,550
Yes, you can.

382
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,390
I should get back to the station.

383
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,640
Songje Station.

384
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:21,980
Okay, then.

385
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:23,480
Thanks for the ride.

386
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,560
That's not the way to the station.

387
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:01,770
CALLING
KWON SAEHA

388
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:09,150
<i>Hello?</i>

389
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,890
What's going on?

390
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:18,270
- Who are you people?
- Hey, don't do that.

391
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:35,120
Damn it.

392
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:40,120
Gosh, what's their problem?

393
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,500
- Not here?
- No, sir.
