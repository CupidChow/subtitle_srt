Oh, my.

9
00:00:51,388 --> 00:00:53,308
A girl came over.

10
00:00:57,598 --> 00:00:58,858
I see that your mother is safe.

11
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,688
How did you know my place?

12
00:01:04,568 --> 00:01:07,358
I came here the other day.
When we watched the video of Doctor Kwon.

13
00:01:08,908 --> 00:01:10,488
Do you know my father?

14
00:01:12,158 --> 00:01:13,198
Mr. Kwon Saeha.

15
00:01:14,328 --> 00:01:17,458
<i>There's no one in this country
who doesn't know your father.</i>

16
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:21,418
<i>Doctor Kwon Sukeun
is the most important figure</i>

17
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,088
<i>in Korean history after Admiral Yi Sunsin
and Sejong the Great.</i>

18
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:27,678
<i>"A Korean scientist
did research on the Grid</i>

19
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:29,548
<i>until he collapsed from overwork.</i>

20
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:32,428
<i>He couldn't see it through to the end</i>

21
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,768
<i>but saved the world after his death."</i>

22
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:41,108
<i>That's why I was so shocked
when I saw the footage,</i>

23
00:01:41,808 --> 00:01:44,228
<i>when I learned
that one of the greatest men in history</i>

24
00:01:44,318 --> 00:01:46,528
<i>was actually an accomplice to murder.</i>

25
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:48,858
This is Dr. Kwon Sukeun?

26
00:01:48,948 --> 00:01:52,658
<i>Besides, the person
who showed me that was his son.</i>

27
00:01:53,788 --> 00:01:55,198
<i>What else did I say?</i>

28
00:01:55,868 --> 00:01:58,868
<i>That you didn't understand
why your father did such a thing.</i>

29
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:03,038
I knew that the Administration Bureau
was hiding something.

30
00:02:03,628 --> 00:02:05,418
But I had no idea
it was something like this.

31
00:02:07,258 --> 00:02:09,758
<i>Because I never imagined back then</i>

32
00:02:11,338 --> 00:02:12,508
that it was me.

33
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,098
That I'd do such a thing.

34
00:02:28,988 --> 00:02:30,198
<i>Because of me...</i>

35
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:34,618
It's a fire!

36
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:40,118
Is that when you saw
the world without the Grid?

37
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,628
By any chance,
did you see the future too?

38
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,428
Like what happens to us
in the future or...

39
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:53,848
what the world looks like
100 years from now?

40
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:55,808
No, I couldn't.

41
00:02:56,468 --> 00:03:00,138
I don't know why, but I couldn't move
past the point in time where I came from.

42
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:04,478
Why is that?
Is it because it hasn't happened yet?

43
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:06,518
Because it doesn't exist yet?

44
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:08,608
What time point did you see?

45
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:10,698
What do you mean?

46
00:03:11,198 --> 00:03:12,028
The other day.

47
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,488
What was it that I saw then?

48
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,238
You said you saw something.

49
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,328
Oh.

50
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:20,658
I don't know

51
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:24,538
whether I really
saw something or just...

52
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:28,798
That's not the point.

53
00:03:29,758 --> 00:03:33,548
Let's say the woman perishes if the man
who's to die in 1997 doesn't die.

54
00:03:33,628 --> 00:03:36,258
But what about now?
The solar wind has been blocked,

55
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:38,678
and everything's been solved.
Why is this happening again?

56
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:41,178
- What do you mean, again?
- Kim Manok.

57
00:03:41,728 --> 00:03:44,058
He killed another person.

58
00:03:45,478 --> 00:03:46,558
Is it someone I know?

59
00:03:50,278 --> 00:03:53,198
She knew I'd run to the subway station
as soon as I came to the past.

60
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:55,868
She released him
so I wouldn't be able to arrest him.

61
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,078
And that's why
the cleaning lady was killed.

62
00:04:02,578 --> 00:04:04,328
Was there one more then?

63
00:04:08,588 --> 00:04:09,838
Kim Manok is

64
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:12,508
the child in the footage.
The janitor's son.

65
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:15,048
Then ever since then...

66
00:04:19,098 --> 00:04:20,178
Wait a second.

67
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:24,638
A woman from the future
keeps hovering around a specific person?

68
00:04:24,728 --> 00:04:28,228
And if that goes wrong,
the woman perishes too?

69
00:04:29,818 --> 00:04:31,478
That leads to only one conclusion.

70
00:04:31,568 --> 00:04:33,068
The two are connected.

71
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:34,448
Related by blood.

72
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:41,368
Is it a birth from
the murderer's family?

73
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:47,288
Oh, hello.

74
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:49,788
- I should've said hello to you earlier.
- Oh, no.

75
00:04:49,878 --> 00:04:51,588
We shouldn't be treating
our guest like this.

76
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:55,548
Goodness.
Why didn't you bring her inside?

77
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,548
No, don't mind me. I'm not a guest.

78
00:04:57,638 --> 00:05:01,218
Oh, my. So you're not a guest?

79
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:03,388
I am a guest.

80
00:05:04,018 --> 00:05:04,928
A guest leaving soon.

81
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:09,398
- Please, drink.
- Okay. Thank you.

82
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:10,358
Sure.

83
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,328
I wish we could just say
it's three minus one.

84
00:05:21,828 --> 00:05:24,998
That we saved three people
at the cost of one person's life.

85
00:05:25,578 --> 00:05:26,708
It's two minus one.

86
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:31,378
But I saw earlier that Eojin
and Ms. Choi were safe.

87
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,338
Your mother too.

88
00:05:34,008 --> 00:05:34,918
That injection.

89
00:05:38,678 --> 00:05:40,218
It was a vitamin shot.

90
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:41,348
How?

91
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:43,888
I mean...

92
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:48,188
What I mean is that it's a great relief.

93
00:05:49,518 --> 00:05:50,808
But what's she trying to pull?

94
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:53,188
That means she got shot on purpose

95
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:56,188
and knew that the breakdown
of the Grid was a lie.

96
00:05:57,238 --> 00:06:00,238
Otherwise, she wouldn't have
pretended to harm your mother.

97
00:06:01,948 --> 00:06:02,988
For God's sake.

98
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,748
Is she playing with us or what?

99
00:06:06,578 --> 00:06:08,788
She shouldn't have shown up
in the first place.

100
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,498
She shouldn't have shown up
at the AB in the first place.

101
00:06:11,578 --> 00:06:14,878
You wondered before too
why she showed up before your eyes.

102
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:17,628
Do you know why now?

103
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,088
Now that you've seen the year 1997?

104
00:06:22,928 --> 00:06:25,308
My father wasn't even considered
a victim at first.

105
00:06:25,388 --> 00:06:29,188
"He happened to be on duty that night
and happened to run into the Ghost.

106
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:30,688
What...

107
00:06:32,688 --> 00:06:34,568
rotten luck."

108
00:06:34,648 --> 00:06:35,688
That was the conclusion.

109
00:06:36,568 --> 00:06:39,568
The Administration Bureau was only
interested in the janitor in the footage.

110
00:06:41,908 --> 00:06:43,738
Since that was obviously
not a coincidence.

111
00:06:47,828 --> 00:06:50,118
But the AB guessed wrong as well.

112
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,418
It wasn't the janitor.

113
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:56,048
Since 1997, the Ghost has been
hovering around Kim Manok,

114
00:06:56,128 --> 00:06:58,708
obviously showing us
that she's protecting him.

115
00:06:58,798 --> 00:07:00,628
But is she really protecting him?

116
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:03,338
She killed his father before his eyes.

117
00:07:03,928 --> 00:07:05,678
And she locked him up
as if he was a beast.

118
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,018
It turns out that she's able to teleport
with someone else.

119
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:09,308
Why wouldn't she flee with him?

120
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,568
Why do I care who she meets?

121
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:23,028
Did you park next door?

122
00:07:23,858 --> 00:07:25,618
No, it should be all right.

123
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:39,418
It wasn't your neighbor.

124
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,298
How does it feel?

125
00:07:49,018 --> 00:07:53,058
No one used to remember your father,
but he's a hero now.

126
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:55,098
And you're that hero's son.

127
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:00,188
Do you remember the first time
all your family gathered?

128
00:08:05,238 --> 00:08:06,568
Did you meet your father?

129
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,288
Now I've seen him as an aged man.

130
00:08:13,788 --> 00:08:15,368
He wasn't a hero,

131
00:08:16,378 --> 00:08:18,498
but now I can at least recall his face.

132
00:08:24,298 --> 00:08:25,798
So that's what you left behind.

133
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:45,818
Ooh!

134
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:51,788
Take the chicken bones out of the bag.

135
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:54,328
I told you, they're trash,
not food waste.

136
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,368
What chicken?

137
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,038
What the hell? Did she smell it?

138
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:20,978
<i>Kim Manok is</i>

139
00:09:21,068 --> 00:09:23,938
<i>the child in the footage.
The janitor's son.</i>

140
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:28,908
<i>The two are connected.</i>

141
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:39,878
EPISODE 9

142
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,248
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

143
00:10:23,838 --> 00:10:26,338
Ms. Chae. I need you to send
an official document.

144
00:10:26,838 --> 00:10:28,548
The recipient is Nature Orphanage.

145
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,548
MINISTRY OF TRADE, INDUSTRY AND ENERGY

146
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:31,008
I got this a minute ago...

147
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:34,558
A cop was here, right? You just need
to tell me what you two talked about.

148
00:10:38,928 --> 00:10:40,388
What did you talk about?

149
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:47,398
She said a man from this orphanage
was suspected of murder.

150
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,148
His name is Kim Manok.

151
00:10:49,818 --> 00:10:50,648
I see.

152
00:10:51,238 --> 00:10:52,988
I told her that I was aware of it

153
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:56,368
because some woman had come
to ask about him before.

154
00:10:57,078 --> 00:10:58,038
Some woman?

155
00:10:58,118 --> 00:11:00,368
Well, it was an unusual name.

156
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:03,458
Jongyi or something.

157
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,378
Oh. Go on.

158
00:11:07,548 --> 00:11:09,128
I repeated what I said then.

159
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:12,638
That Manok was found on a market street
and brought to us,

160
00:11:12,718 --> 00:11:15,758
and looked more like an abandoned child
than a missing child.

161
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:20,388
Because handicapped children
are more often abandoned.

162
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:22,388
What handicap?

163
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:29,778
When he first came here,
he couldn't speak at all.

164
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,108
He seemed to be five or six years old,
but he couldn't speak.

165
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:35,318
So I thought he was
born speech-impaired.

166
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:38,078
Then how did you know
his name and birth record?

167
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:41,328
We named him Kim Manok
and re-registered his birth.

168
00:11:41,408 --> 00:11:44,458
Then his record as Lee Siwon
must've been completely deleted.

169
00:11:52,298 --> 00:11:55,088
<i>She said Manok
used to have a family,</i>

170
00:11:55,968 --> 00:11:58,058
<i>though he was adopted.</i>

171
00:11:58,558 --> 00:12:01,428
<i>And his name was Lee Siwon then.</i>

172
00:12:02,178 --> 00:12:04,098
No outsiders entered the building.

173
00:12:04,938 --> 00:12:08,068
It was Sunday,
so only few people entered at all.

174
00:12:08,148 --> 00:12:09,398
I don't know how it happened...

175
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,608
<i>His stepparents ran a business.</i>

176
00:12:11,688 --> 00:12:14,318
<i>But as they went bankrupt,
his stepmother left home.</i>

177
00:12:14,408 --> 00:12:16,488
He said there was no one else
to look after the child.

178
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:17,738
He practically begged...

179
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:20,948
<i>But his stepfather passed away.</i>

180
00:12:21,038 --> 00:12:23,708
<i>That's what I just heard
from that police officer.</i>

181
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:27,588
Manok never said a word
about his stepfamily.

182
00:12:31,088 --> 00:12:33,418
But one day,
he suddenly poured out words,

183
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:36,298
so I remember us saying this.

184
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:38,888
Maybe he's not handicapped.

185
00:12:39,678 --> 00:12:41,558
Was he traumatized?

186
00:12:42,348 --> 00:12:43,808
Or is he aphasic?"

187
00:12:45,438 --> 00:12:47,648
Seeing that no one reported him missing,

188
00:12:47,728 --> 00:12:49,818
I think his family abandoned him

189
00:12:50,398 --> 00:12:52,608
after his stepfather passed away.

190
00:12:53,818 --> 00:12:55,858
He was adopted when he was one.

191
00:12:56,238 --> 00:12:59,658
Then I'm sure he thought
they were his real family.

192
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:01,158
How could they...

193
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,948
Anything else?
What else did the officer say?

194
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,458
What else? Oh.

195
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:12,128
She asked me if any woman visited Manok
when he was here, and showed me a picture...

196
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:16,178
No, should I say it was a sketch?

197
00:13:16,258 --> 00:13:17,968
Anyway, she showed it to me and...

198
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,138
Yes, this is it.

199
00:13:22,098 --> 00:13:24,218
The woman named Jongyi
asked me the same question,

200
00:13:25,178 --> 00:13:27,058
but no one visited him.

201
00:13:30,688 --> 00:13:32,228
How did the officer find out

202
00:13:32,318 --> 00:13:34,228
that Kim Manok and Lee Siwon
were the same person?

203
00:13:34,318 --> 00:13:36,148
She didn't mention that.

204
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,358
She just said

205
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,698
she met Manok's stepmother
before she came here.

206
00:13:43,328 --> 00:13:47,038
Are you suggesting her stepmother told her
Kim Manok's original name was Lee Siwon?

207
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,708
Well, that is...

208
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:50,128
Well.

209
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:53,798
I assume she had a way to find that out
since she's a police officer.

210
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,088
Right.

211
00:14:00,678 --> 00:14:01,718
<i>Lee Siwon.</i>

212
00:14:01,798 --> 00:14:02,888
<i>Kim Manok.</i>

213
00:14:03,638 --> 00:14:07,178
<i>She must've gone to see his stepmother
since she knew they were the same person.</i>

214
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,768
<i>Otherwise, she couldn't have linked
Lee Siwon to Kim Manok</i>

215
00:14:10,848 --> 00:14:13,068
<i>no matter what she heard
from his stepmother.</i>

216
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:16,028
<i>Jung Saebyeok.</i>

217
00:14:17,188 --> 00:14:19,528
<i>How come she knows more than we do?</i>

218
00:14:23,118 --> 00:14:25,328
<i>You remember the
convenience store murderer's accomplice?</i>

219
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:26,788
Of course, I do.

220
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:28,828
How can I forget someone
with disjointed DNA?

221
00:14:35,548 --> 00:14:36,508
Oh?

222
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,548
- Is this from her?
- Yes.

223
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,638
Did you compare the criminal's DNA
to hers last time?

224
00:14:41,718 --> 00:14:44,638
- No. There was no request for that.
- Mm.

225
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,848
Is she his family,
not just his accomplice?

226
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,388
Please find that out for me.
If they're related by blood.

227
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:53,808
Well, considering their ages,
they can't be a parent and child.

228
00:14:53,898 --> 00:14:55,648
- Maybe they're a brother and sister...
- No.

229
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,978
What if...

230
00:14:58,028 --> 00:14:59,988
Just hypothetically.

231
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,358
As for direct ancestors...

232
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:06,118
...how many generations
can you trace back?

233
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:08,828
I'm not sure.

234
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:13,918
Well, in case of a maternal line, we can
trace back as many generations as we want.

235
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:16,168
But if a paternal line is included,
it becomes ambiguous

236
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,298
after three or four generations
as you probably know.

237
00:15:19,838 --> 00:15:22,338
But one of them can't be
the other's direct ancestor.

238
00:15:22,428 --> 00:15:24,638
Didn't you say they were
around the same age?

239
00:15:24,718 --> 00:15:27,888
Please find out everything you can
about them using all your databases.

240
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,018
- Scour it for any clues?
- Yes.

241
00:15:30,098 --> 00:15:31,098
Okay.

242
00:15:31,188 --> 00:15:33,058
I'm sure you're busy,
but how long will it take?

243
00:15:34,228 --> 00:15:36,978
If I have to run it
through the database, well...

244
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,148
- I'll try to finish by the end of the day.
- Thank you.

245
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:43,948
- I'll treat you to a nice meal later.
- What?

246
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:47,078
How about you do it now?
I could use some food.

247
00:15:48,118 --> 00:15:50,408
I have somewhere else
to be right now, so...

248
00:15:50,998 --> 00:15:52,208
Thank you for doing this.

249
00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:53,458
Bye.

250
00:15:56,378 --> 00:15:57,918
I'll ask her to buy me dinner then.

251
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,478
Mr. Kwon called and asked for another

252
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,818
- day off...
- Mr. Song Eojin.

253
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:29,028
Yes?

254
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:33,208
About that child...

255
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:34,748
Who?

256
00:16:35,418 --> 00:16:36,288
Kim Manok.

257
00:16:37,248 --> 00:16:39,748
- Child?
- Find out his original name.

258
00:16:40,588 --> 00:16:42,008
Did he have a different name?

259
00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:45,928
There's no record of a name change.

260
00:16:47,428 --> 00:16:49,558
How old were you in 1997?

261
00:16:51,518 --> 00:16:52,428
I was nine.

262
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:58,108
If you were five or six,
do you think you'd remember?

263
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:01,478
Remember what, ma'am?

264
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:08,198
If you help me understand your question,
I'll be able to give you a better answer.

265
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:09,448
Never mind.

266
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:32,008
She even knew which station
he was last seen at.

267
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,848
If she didn't hear it
from her ex-husband...

268
00:17:53,988 --> 00:17:55,748
Did something happen
to Kwon Saeha yesterday?

269
00:17:56,328 --> 00:17:58,788
Did he go out for lunch?
You said he seemed to have had a fight.

270
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:01,958
No, he looked fine
when he came back from lunch.

271
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:05,048
But in one or two minutes,
he suddenly...

272
00:18:05,758 --> 00:18:07,128
Did he fight with you?

273
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:09,678
Why would I fight
with my colleague at work?

274
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:11,138
But then,

275
00:18:11,218 --> 00:18:13,388
if you two had a fight
and Mr. Kwon looked like that,

276
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,928
you'd probably be hurt more...

277
00:18:15,018 --> 00:18:17,178
What? You don't know
what you're talking about.

278
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:18,888
- I'm taller...
- Enough.

279
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:21,228
How did he look?

280
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,268
Well, his clothes were a mess,

281
00:18:23,358 --> 00:18:25,528
and his cheek was hurt,
so I thought he might have...

282
00:18:25,608 --> 00:18:28,358
A security alarm went off too.
I'm not sure what he was carrying though.

283
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:36,868
Ms. Chae. If you want to brownnose
that moron, do it alone.

284
00:18:37,698 --> 00:18:38,788
Okay.

Isn't that Mr. Kwon?

Where on earth did he spring from?

303

00:21:52,858 --> 00:21:55,858
Goodness, don't run! I'm not late!

322
00:21:55,938 --> 00:21:57,528
ENTER A NAME, ADDRESS, OR PHONE NUMBER

323
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,738
What's wrong?

324
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,078
Nothing.

325
00:22:02,158 --> 00:22:05,078
Well, what was the address?

326
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:08,828
Just type in Mother-in-law's
Korean Restaurant. Then it'll pop up.

327
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,838
MOTHER-IN-LAW...

328
00:22:12,918 --> 00:22:14,548
Tell them today that you're quitting.

329
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:16,628
What's gotten into you?

330
00:22:17,218 --> 00:22:21,888
Anyway, you eat out all the time.
Eat at home at least on your day off.

331
00:22:21,968 --> 00:22:24,758
You've never had a day off.
You'll collapse at this rate.

332
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,768
I'm not that old yet.

333
00:22:27,268 --> 00:22:29,138
Don't treat me like an old person.

334
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:30,808
It doesn't matter how old you are.

335
00:22:30,898 --> 00:22:32,608
It's about how much you've suffered.

336
00:22:33,188 --> 00:22:35,858
You're the one who's suffered.
Because of me.

337
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,398
What about me?

338
00:22:38,068 --> 00:22:39,698
You're my only child.

339
00:22:40,238 --> 00:22:42,068
But I almost adopted you out
to my brother.

340
00:22:42,158 --> 00:22:43,448
This time too?

341
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,118
I must've been out of my mind. What?

342
00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:48,328
What do you mean, this time too?

343
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,248
Never mind.

344
00:22:49,998 --> 00:22:53,338
But my family name has always been Kwon.

345
00:22:54,418 --> 00:22:55,628
What are you talking about?

346
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,168
Of course, it's Kwon.
What else could it be?

347
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:01,638
If Uncle had adopted me,

348
00:23:02,678 --> 00:23:03,928
it would've changed.

349
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,258
I know.

350
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,058
I must've been crazy. Goodness.

351
00:23:08,808 --> 00:23:12,848
I shouldn't have started the business.
I almost left you huge debts.

352
00:23:14,358 --> 00:23:17,648
But I raised you well, didn't I?
To be a decent man.

353
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,108
Am I decent?

354
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,408
Of course, you are. You're my son.

355
00:23:32,668 --> 00:23:34,378
Soup kitchen is now open!

356
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:35,628
Please line up over here.

357
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:41,168
SOCIAL WELFARE CENTER

358
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,498
GREEN SOUP KITCHEN

359
00:24:25,178 --> 00:24:27,138
SNAIL SOUP KITCHEN

360
00:24:28,098 --> 00:24:28,928
Oh!

361
00:25:14,428 --> 00:25:17,768
Do you not need the company anymore?
Because you have no more questions?

362
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,148
Are you here to persuade me
to go back to work?

363
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:23,438
How did you do it?

364
00:25:23,528 --> 00:25:24,608
How did you go there?

365
00:25:26,148 --> 00:25:27,988
It must be still vivid in your memory.

366
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:32,328
To me, it's been over 20 years.
But to someone, it was yesterday.

367
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:35,458
What memory are you talking about?

368
00:25:37,288 --> 00:25:40,248
The memory of the IRR
putting all the blame on the deceased,

369
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:42,378
insisting that he died from overwork?

370
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:45,838
Or the memory of
the IRR people sending out a notice

371
00:25:45,918 --> 00:25:48,638
telling the bereaved to pick up the
mysteriously dead person's body

372
00:25:48,718 --> 00:25:49,588
from the mortuary?

373
00:25:51,808 --> 00:25:54,928
How can you say that when we commemorate
your father's death every year?

374
00:25:55,018 --> 00:25:56,938
Not all my questions have been answered.

375
00:25:57,018 --> 00:25:59,768
I want to know why the labs
from other countries stayed silent.

376
00:25:59,848 --> 00:26:03,398
When you asserted that Doctor Kwon Sukeun
from Korea created the Grid,

377
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,028
why did they keep silent?

378
00:26:06,488 --> 00:26:08,608
Then who were we supposed to say
it was created by?

379
00:26:08,698 --> 00:26:09,778
The Ghost?

380
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,528
What evidence could the AB provide
to support that claim?

381
00:26:12,618 --> 00:26:15,788
Should we have just revealed
the video of the Ghost?

382
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:17,328
Is that why you used my father?

383
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:20,038
It was your father's code
that operated the machine.

384
00:26:20,128 --> 00:26:21,838
We have a clear record of that.

385
00:26:21,918 --> 00:26:24,338
- He was murdered because of that code.
- Keep it down.

386
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,088
Do you think
the rest of the world accepted

387
00:26:28,168 --> 00:26:29,758
that we created the Grid from the start?

388
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,218
What do you think made them all shut up?

389
00:26:33,928 --> 00:26:36,558
The video of Doctor Kwon
and the Ghost together.

390
00:26:37,308 --> 00:26:39,688
<i>The one who made us
use your father...</i>

391
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:41,148
was you.

392
00:26:48,988 --> 00:26:49,898
SONG EOJIN

393
00:26:51,408 --> 00:26:52,238
What is it?

394
00:26:54,578 --> 00:26:56,578
Raise the alert level
and be prepared for the Ghost.

395
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:01,958
Kim Manok has been arrested.
He's being transported now.

396
00:27:04,788 --> 00:27:07,918
Have you grown fond of him or something,
having seen him as a child?

397
00:27:10,048 --> 00:27:12,588
A serial killer has been caught.
What's that look on your face?

398
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,678
Do you want to hand in
your resignation here?

399
00:27:24,148 --> 00:27:25,768
How much time do I have left?

400
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:37,738
I'll go get changed.

401
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:47,208
KWON SAEHA

402
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:53,678
<i>The line is busy.</i>

403
00:27:53,758 --> 00:27:55,428
Please leave a message after the tone.

404
00:27:56,428 --> 00:27:59,428
JUNG SAEBYEOK

405
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:10,858
<i>The line is busy.
Please leave a message...</i>

406
00:28:10,938 --> 00:28:12,068
Where did they catch him?

407
00:28:13,528 --> 00:28:15,198
Being transported? You mean, to the AB?

408
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,278
NFS OFFICER

409
00:28:18,368 --> 00:28:19,488
Detective. I...

410
00:28:19,578 --> 00:28:21,538
<i>Sorry,
I just got an important call.</i>

411
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:22,458
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

412
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:25,288
Okay.

413
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,878
But if...

414
00:28:31,298 --> 00:28:32,628
Thank you for everything.

415
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:35,798
Goodbye.

416
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:42,558
What's Kim Manok's purpose?

417
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,888
Did she just need someone
who could make a mess?

418
00:28:45,898 --> 00:28:47,898
The Ghost can't exist without him.

419
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:57,238
"The Ghost can't exist without him."

420
00:28:59,158 --> 00:29:00,118
Is she his descendant?

421
00:29:01,288 --> 00:29:05,578
If Kim Manok's child or future child

422
00:29:05,668 --> 00:29:08,458
gives birth to the Ghost or something...

423
00:29:09,378 --> 00:29:13,088
Then that explains
why she's protecting that scumbag.

424
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,838
I don't know how they're related.

425
00:29:15,678 --> 00:29:17,048
You don't know their relationship,

426
00:29:17,138 --> 00:29:19,598
but you know the relationship
between the janitor and Kim Manok?

427
00:29:23,848 --> 00:29:27,598
You're the one who gave the information
to the investigator, aren't you?

428
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:31,608
Why?

429
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:34,108
There's good news and bad news.

430
00:29:34,188 --> 00:29:35,608
What's there to be good or bad?

431
00:29:35,698 --> 00:29:37,158
Maybe it's not necessarily good news.

432
00:29:37,238 --> 00:29:40,198
Do you remember I said
that the woman's DNA was a little off?

433
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,988
Yes. That it's disjointed.

434
00:29:42,078 --> 00:29:44,498
<i>But it appears to be normal this time.</i>

435
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:46,458
How is that possible?

436
00:29:46,538 --> 00:29:47,578
What's the bad news?

437
00:29:47,668 --> 00:29:49,248
Well...

438
00:29:49,328 --> 00:29:50,838
They are related by blood.

439
00:29:50,918 --> 00:29:52,458
Between her and the culprit?

440
00:29:52,548 --> 00:29:54,508
<i>No, between you and her.</i>

441
00:29:54,588 --> 00:29:57,128
<i>You two share
the same mitochondrial DNA.</i>

442
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:07,688
<i>Well, I found identical DNA,
so I checked whose it was.</i>

443
00:30:07,768 --> 00:30:11,398
<i>It wasn't in the criminal database
but in the affiliated agency database.</i>

444
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:13,438
<i>Among the police officers
who registered their DNA.</i>

445
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:16,948
And that was me?

446
00:30:17,028 --> 00:30:18,658
<i>Yes, you two are maternally related.</i>

447
00:30:18,738 --> 00:30:21,318
<i>You and the accomplice.</i>

448
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:26,498
<i>Detective?</i>

449
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:30,498
Don't worry, Detective.
She could be a distant relative...

450
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,248
If she's maternally related to me,
what about her paternal line?

451
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:34,628
I mean...

452
00:30:35,508 --> 00:30:37,008
What about her father's side?

453
00:30:37,298 --> 00:30:40,798
<i>So in the past, was
Jung Saebyeok also related to the Grid?</i>

454
00:30:40,888 --> 00:30:42,348
The detective and the Grid?

455
00:30:43,598 --> 00:30:47,268
You leaked the information
to your colleague's ex-wife for no reason?

456
00:30:48,178 --> 00:30:51,438
You're the one who should be blamed
by Mr. Song, not me.

457
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:55,108
If you'd let us work freely,
I wouldn't have needed the police's help.

458
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:58,148
If you didn't make us stay in the office,
I would've done the legwork myself.

459
00:30:58,738 --> 00:31:01,068
You're the one who made me use
someone's ex-wife.

460
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:05,538
And you criticized me for
using your father after what you've done?

461
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:11,208
By the way, I'm sure
this is just a coincidence.

462
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:13,328
<i>But the convenience store murderer
and his accomplice</i>

463
00:31:13,418 --> 00:31:15,088
<i>share the same blood type,
which is cis-AB.</i>

464
00:31:20,298 --> 00:31:21,128
What?

465
00:31:21,468 --> 00:31:23,638
<i>Only 3 or 4 out of 10,000 people</i>

466
00:31:23,718 --> 00:31:25,468
<i>have that blood type, and they both do.</i>

467
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:26,888
Are you saying...

468
00:31:28,018 --> 00:31:30,938
both the culprit and I are

469
00:31:31,018 --> 00:31:33,058
<i>biologically related to the woman?</i>

470
00:31:33,148 --> 00:31:37,148
But as for the culprit and the woman,
only 13% of their DNA matches.

471
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,148
And that doesn't

472
00:31:38,228 --> 00:31:43,528
<i>necessarily mean the culprit and you are
connected through the woman.</i>

473
00:31:45,158 --> 00:31:46,528
What if they're related by blood?

474
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:47,488
I mean,

475
00:31:48,578 --> 00:31:52,328
what if the culprit and she
are a descendant and ancestor

476
00:31:52,418 --> 00:31:53,708
or something like that?

477
00:31:53,788 --> 00:31:55,708
<i>Then it makes sense.</i>

478
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,748
We just can't know
how many generations apart.

479
00:31:57,838 --> 00:31:59,958
<i>But that's out of the question.</i>

480
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:01,878
<i>They live in the same age,</i>

481
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:06,508
<i>so one of them can't be the other's
descendant or grandmother or grandfather.</i>

482
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:11,728
<i>So you used the investigator,
and you're blaming me for that?</i>

483
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:15,398
But you still violated
security protocol.

484
00:32:16,058 --> 00:32:18,648
- You won't just be given a reprimand.
- Okay.

485
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,528
You don't even care?

486
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:28,908
What's wrong?

487
00:32:31,078 --> 00:32:32,498
What was the number for security?

488
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:34,418
Number seven.

489
00:32:36,878 --> 00:32:40,958
Sir. We've been ordered to keep
Kim Manok at the lobby when he arrives.

490
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:42,468
It's Ms. Choi's order.

491
00:32:42,548 --> 00:32:44,428
TO DEPUTY DIRECTOR CHOI SEONUL
IT'S DONE, MA'AM

492
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:57,898
<i>Why did she show up in front of me?</i>

493
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,698
<i>If she's maternally related to me,
what about her paternal line?</i>

494
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:13,658
<i>What about her father's side?</i>

495
00:33:20,088 --> 00:33:24,758
<i>Since 1997, the Ghost has been
hovering around Kim Manok,</i>

496
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:27,548
<i>obviously showing us
that she's protecting him.</i>

497
00:33:28,468 --> 00:33:30,008
<i>He's on her father's side...</i>

498
00:33:31,598 --> 00:33:32,848
<i>And I'm on her mother's side?</i>

499
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:45,438
Are you out of your mind?

500
00:33:47,448 --> 00:33:48,738
I won't let it slide.

501
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:06,718
Status?

502
00:34:07,928 --> 00:34:08,838
All clear in the lobby.

503
00:34:26,988 --> 00:34:27,818
Here he comes.

504
00:34:49,218 --> 00:34:51,468
Hold on. Please stand by here.

505
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:54,218
- What are you talking about?
- You heard her clearly.

506
00:34:54,308 --> 00:34:55,558
Excuse me.

507
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,388
Just a minute, please.
Let me register him.

508
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:10,738
- You should've done this beforehand.
- They are here.

509
00:35:28,548 --> 00:35:29,968
Lee Siwon.

510
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:47,318
Lee Siwon.

511
00:35:58,538 --> 00:36:00,868
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

512
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:02,328
How do you contact the woman?

513
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:06,788
Has she ever told you
why she protects you?

514
00:36:07,378 --> 00:36:08,748
She helped you many times.

515
00:36:11,298 --> 00:36:13,048
Do you need a beating to talk?

516
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:15,848
Is that what you want?

517
00:36:18,508 --> 00:36:20,888
I've never even heard her voice.

518
00:36:22,728 --> 00:36:24,348
She never says anything to me.

519
00:36:26,148 --> 00:36:29,278
She's never apologized to you
for what she did to your father?

520
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,358
Lee Siwon.

521
00:36:31,988 --> 00:36:35,698
Even after your father's business
went bankrupt and his wife left home,

522
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:38,868
he tried to protect you
when you weren't even his real child.

523
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,948
He even took you to a place
that he wasn't supposed to.

524
00:36:46,998 --> 00:36:49,298
I don't have a father.

525
00:36:51,298 --> 00:36:53,548
You've got the wrong person...

526
00:36:55,758 --> 00:36:56,968
So let me go.

527
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:01,138
He burned to death in front of you.
In a place just like this.

528
00:37:01,718 --> 00:37:02,678
By the front door.

529
00:37:20,788 --> 00:37:22,408
Are you sure you've
never seen me before?

530
00:37:47,688 --> 00:37:52,068
If you had been raised by him,
you would've become a different person.

531
00:37:52,148 --> 00:37:53,188
They must be here.

532
00:37:53,278 --> 00:37:55,528
That's when your life got screwed up.

533
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:59,948
But you've completely forgotten it.
Don't you feel wronged?

534
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:01,828
He's right in front of you.

535
00:38:30,398 --> 00:38:33,068
<i>Tell her to come up immediately.</i>

536
00:38:33,148 --> 00:38:34,648
Mr. Jo wants you to come up.

537
00:38:34,728 --> 00:38:36,148
You really don't remember him?

538
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:38,778
Take him.

539
00:38:42,448 --> 00:38:43,488
Stay still!

540
00:38:43,578 --> 00:38:44,618
Don't move.

541
00:39:03,548 --> 00:39:04,558
Don't run!

542
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:20,488
You were...

543
00:39:21,858 --> 00:39:23,028
there.

544
00:39:23,118 --> 00:39:24,578
- Where?
- Take him.

545
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:49,518
Keep an eye on him.

546
00:39:52,138 --> 00:39:54,858
Go to the security office
and keep me posted on his every move.

547
00:39:54,938 --> 00:39:55,898
DR. KWON SUKEUN

548
00:41:14,598 --> 00:41:16,438
The man in the footage from 1997 is me.

549
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:20,818
I took the device from the Ghost
and went to the past.

550
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:24,188
- How?
- The Administration Bureau captured her,

551
00:41:24,278 --> 00:41:27,488
and I knew that two devices
were needed for time travel.

552
00:41:27,908 --> 00:41:30,408
I don't know how it works though.

553
00:41:32,748 --> 00:41:34,248
A chip inserted in the body

554
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:36,618
transforms neural signals
into motor signals.

555
00:41:37,118 --> 00:41:39,748
That's what you said yourself
and that's all I know.

556
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:40,668
I did?

557
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:43,588
- I said that?
- Yes.

558
00:41:46,178 --> 00:41:47,178
Where's the device?

559
00:41:47,258 --> 00:41:48,218
I returned it to her.

560
00:41:48,928 --> 00:41:52,508
- Are you out of your mind? Why?
- She let us capture her on purpose.

561
00:41:52,598 --> 00:41:55,348
She knew all about the AB's plan

562
00:41:55,428 --> 00:41:57,228
and showed up and played along.

563
00:41:59,648 --> 00:42:00,478
Why?

564
00:42:00,978 --> 00:42:02,268
I don't know either.

565
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:05,398
Since her capture was the only way to
make Doctor Kwon's son go to the past?

566
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,278
Did she know that too?

567
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,568
That the two of you had to kill
the janitor together for her to exist?

568
00:42:11,368 --> 00:42:12,868
And? What else?

569
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:14,948
The Ghost came from the future.

570
00:42:15,038 --> 00:42:16,458
And she can travel back in time.

571
00:42:16,538 --> 00:42:19,458
Just as you all know.
And she came here to build the Grid.

572
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:20,458
Is that all?

573
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,588
How the device works,
what the energy source is,

574
00:42:22,668 --> 00:42:25,338
and how you travel through time.
You should've figured that out.

575
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:27,378
You even took her device. Is that all?

576
00:42:27,468 --> 00:42:30,218
I should've also asked
for the blueprint of the Grid, right?

577
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:33,348
It's been 20 years, but all we can do
is use what she built for us.

578
00:42:33,428 --> 00:42:35,678
We haven't even been able
to decipher the first formula.

579
00:42:35,768 --> 00:42:37,268
But I should've asked for it, right?

580
00:42:37,348 --> 00:42:38,808
How dare you act up?

581
00:42:39,398 --> 00:42:42,768
Don't you realize
what an enormous opportunity you missed?

582
00:42:43,398 --> 00:42:46,148
You also have no idea
what opportunity I missed.

583
00:42:49,148 --> 00:42:50,448
It doesn't matter though.

584
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:52,278
What is he talking about?

585
00:42:52,368 --> 00:42:54,578
Has he lost his mind
after time traveling?

586
00:42:54,658 --> 00:42:56,578
What was the
Administration Bureau's plan?

587
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:58,658
How did we capture the Ghost?

588
00:42:58,748 --> 00:43:00,328
We can't use that trick anymore.

589
00:43:02,578 --> 00:43:04,168
We announced that the Grid broke down.

590
00:43:05,748 --> 00:43:08,168
The Ghost knew
that I was the one who suggested it.

591
00:43:09,928 --> 00:43:11,758
Well, if she knows everything,

592
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,468
what do we do... Hey, go ahead.

593
00:43:18,848 --> 00:43:19,688
We need to talk.

594
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,828
Do you think we should believe
what he says?

595
00:43:36,908 --> 00:43:41,078
I don't know about that,
but I don't think he even bothers to lie.

596
00:43:41,168 --> 00:43:42,918
God damn it.

597
00:43:50,258 --> 00:43:53,798
If that's all true, there's no chance
that she'll show up now.

598
00:43:58,768 --> 00:44:01,808
She knows what we haven't even done yet.

599
00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:03,648
Do you think

600
00:44:04,938 --> 00:44:07,318
she released Manok because
he's no longer of any use to her?

601
00:44:08,568 --> 00:44:09,858
If that's not the case...

602
00:44:12,238 --> 00:44:13,278
Then what?

603
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,248
Who's Lee Siwon?

604
00:44:25,328 --> 00:44:28,708
This is the first time I've felt
we didn't have enough CCTVs here.

605
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:30,708
Do you think...

606
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,468
the Ghost will come to rescue him?

607
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:37,808
You've been working here
since the Institute of Radio Research.

608
00:44:38,508 --> 00:44:40,678
Who killed that child's father?

609
00:44:41,138 --> 00:44:42,728
You heard the answer earlier.

610
00:44:43,228 --> 00:44:45,598
What I heard is that Saeha killed him.

611
00:44:46,188 --> 00:44:49,068
But even Kim Manok was too young
to remember what happened.

612
00:44:49,148 --> 00:44:50,648
That means Saeha was a baby then.

613
00:44:50,728 --> 00:44:52,318
A baby killed a person?

614
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,278
You know something, don't you?

615
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:56,988
Yes, I've been working here
since the IRR days.

616
00:44:57,068 --> 00:44:58,908
But I'm just a contract worker.

617
00:44:59,908 --> 00:45:03,618
They give me work,
but they never say anything to me.

618
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:08,538
Even back then, no one said anything to me
about what happened that night.

619
00:45:08,628 --> 00:45:09,548
I'm just...

620
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,838
one of these.

621
00:45:16,638 --> 00:45:18,508
What's your name, sir?

622
00:45:19,678 --> 00:45:20,508
Pardon?

623
00:45:20,598 --> 00:45:22,978
I'm Chae Jongyi. What's your name?

624
00:45:24,308 --> 00:45:25,308
I am

625
00:45:26,978 --> 00:45:27,808
Han Wihan.

626
00:45:28,518 --> 00:45:30,268
Sorry? Hani Hani?

627
00:45:31,858 --> 00:45:34,488
It's Han Wihan whether you
read it forwards or backwards.

628
00:45:35,238 --> 00:45:36,488
Han Wihan.

629
00:45:37,608 --> 00:45:40,238
Oh, Mr. Han Wihan.

630
00:45:53,798 --> 00:45:54,838
UNREGISTERED PERSON
IN POSSESSION OF FIREARMS

631
00:45:55,968 --> 00:45:56,968
UNREGISTERED PERSON
IN POSSESSION OF FIREARMS

632
00:46:01,218 --> 00:46:02,218
Put your gun down.

633
00:46:02,308 --> 00:46:03,218
Just shoot me.

634
00:46:03,308 --> 00:46:04,768
I'd rather die.

635
00:46:04,848 --> 00:46:05,928
Put your gun down.

636
00:46:14,228 --> 00:46:15,148
Will you shoot a cop?

637
00:46:16,278 --> 00:46:17,568
Who's going to shoot?

638
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:21,488
I need to know that to report
who is accountable for shooting a cop.

639
00:46:24,618 --> 00:46:25,788
Anyone?

640
00:46:35,008 --> 00:46:36,508
Wouldn't it be better to talk this out?

641
00:46:38,928 --> 00:46:40,088
What brings you here?

642
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:41,848
Kim Manok is here, right?

643
00:46:41,928 --> 00:46:43,058
What if he is?

644
00:46:43,138 --> 00:46:44,468
I'm going to kill him.

645
00:46:48,558 --> 00:46:49,898
I'll just take her outside.

646
00:46:50,398 --> 00:46:52,018
It's not your concern. Stay out of it.

647
00:46:52,108 --> 00:46:54,438
If that jerk really deserves to die,
I won't stop you.

648
00:46:58,318 --> 00:46:59,948
But can we talk for
a minute before that?

649
00:47:12,128 --> 00:47:13,958
- Back to your positions.
- Yes, sir.

650
00:47:23,678 --> 00:47:25,008
It'll just be a minute.

651
00:47:25,098 --> 00:47:26,558
I just need to ask him one question.

652
00:47:26,638 --> 00:47:27,928
Let me meet that bastard.

653
00:47:28,018 --> 00:47:29,428
How did you know that he was here?

654
00:47:31,058 --> 00:47:32,228
Is it Kwon Saeha again?

655
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,858
How much do you know about him?

656
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:36,228
Stop. I don't want to hear it.

657
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:38,238
How much do you know about him?

658
00:47:39,528 --> 00:47:41,568
Did Manok really meet Saeha
when he was little?

659
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,498
He did, didn't he?

660
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:52,918
And you knew it.

661
00:47:54,168 --> 00:47:55,668
Is that why you're doing this?

662
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:56,878
No.

663
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:58,378
It's just about me.

664
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,378
So what is it?

665
00:48:05,098 --> 00:48:06,558
Seriously, it won't take long.

666
00:48:08,348 --> 00:48:10,478
The whole building is on high alert.

667
00:48:10,558 --> 00:48:12,558
Why do you think they brought him here?

668
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,368
Don't give her a chance.

669
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:32,578
<i>They say the Ghost won't show up
if she stands no chance,</i>

670
00:48:33,668 --> 00:48:35,878
<i>but they're surrounding him
tightly on all sides.</i>

671
00:48:36,588 --> 00:48:38,878
<i>So she can't even grab his hand
even if she pops out.</i>

672
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,628
<i>So she can't take him.</i>

673
00:48:44,298 --> 00:48:45,718
CHAE JONGYI

674
00:48:51,848 --> 00:48:54,098
<i>But if you must see him, I'll ask them.</i>

675
00:48:54,188 --> 00:48:58,268
But what you say will be recorded,
and what you do will be closely monitored.

676
00:48:59,648 --> 00:49:00,608
Is that okay?

677
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:04,198
Forget it. I understand.

678
00:49:05,858 --> 00:49:08,158
You came all the way here
to give up that easily?

679
00:49:08,238 --> 00:49:09,488
What do you want me to do?

680
00:49:15,288 --> 00:49:17,378
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have taken it out on you.

681
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,878
- Give me the key. If you drive now...
- Don't come.

682
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:24,588
The building is on high alert.
Don't leave your post because of me.

683
00:49:45,648 --> 00:49:47,568
- You, go there.
- Yes, sir.

684
00:49:49,908 --> 00:49:52,158
You two, stand by outside.
You two, go out.

685
00:49:52,238 --> 00:49:53,538
And the rest, take the elevator.

686
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:57,618
DUE TO AN EMERGENCY, ALL EMPLOYEES
MUST BE ON ALERT AND ON STANDBY

687
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:03,798
Let's move.

688
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:15,888
Freeze! Don't move!

689
00:50:16,178 --> 00:50:17,138
I'll fire if you move.

690
00:50:23,188 --> 00:50:24,108
Beta on the loose!

691
00:50:27,068 --> 00:50:29,658
- <i>Which way did he go?</i>
- No idea. I can't see him.

692
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:31,368
He's heading to the emergency exit.
