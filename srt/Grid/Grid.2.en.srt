KIM SAEHA B-391

3
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,230
That's the police report
written last night.

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,650
This is about
the convenience store suspect they lost.

5
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,410
I saw it on the news yesterday.

6
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,580
Yes, and I reported the murder
to the police.

7
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,660
- How did that happen?
- I happened to witness the scene.

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,500
I see. And?

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,790
I thought it was a simple murder
by a robber yesterday.

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,290
But the Songje Police Station detective
who wrote this report

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,840
experienced a strange phenomenon
while chasing the suspect.

12
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,640
But she might have made an excuse to
avoid criticism for losing the suspect.

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,180
The sketch is attached below.

14
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,430
It's an unidentified woman.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,060
The culprit's a woman?

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,140
The person in the footage is a man...

17
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,810
SKETCH OF THE ACCOMPLICE

18
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,080
Apparently, she's his accomplice.

19
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:22,630
Accomplice?

20
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,420
On what grounds?

21
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,220
Why do they think she's an accomplice?

22
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,810
She helped the murder suspect escape.

23
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,770
The thing is, after that,

24
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,230
the woman suddenly disappeared
before the detective's eyes.

25
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,000
Do you have anything else to report
as the first witness?

26
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,590
No. I went home right after I
made the witness statement.

27
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,510
Delete the record of sending this to me
from your computer.

28
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,880
I'll delete this report too.

29
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,590
I already did.

30

DELETING THE FILE

31
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,100
Eojin.

32
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,390
By any chance...

33
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,570
Do you still hope that it'll happen?

34
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,940
It's time we gave up.

35
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,490
I hope it's right this time.

36
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,820
Ghost, please appear now.

37
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,300
Who wrote the report again?

38
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,630
It's Jung Saebyeok,
an investigator from Songje Station.

39
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,560
Name. Kim Manok.

40
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,310
What? He doesn't have a family?

41
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,730
No, he doesn't.

42
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,560
It seems that
he just stopped by the store.

43
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,070
It doesn't look like a revenge killing
or a premeditated crime.

44
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,780
I don't think he'll show up
around the victim again.

45
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,660
And he's not wanted,
though he was once on probation.

46
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,660
- For what?
- Animal abuse.

47
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,910
Seeing how he went back to his place,

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,630
I'm not sure
he's smart, bold, or just stupid.

49
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,010
Who are you?

50
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,670
Huh?

51
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,760
You identified the suspect.

52
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,550
We'll take it from here.

53
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,220
- Thank you for your work.
- What?

54
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,020
Why'd you turn it off?
Don't touch it. Who are you guys?

55
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,480
Hand all the evidence over to us.
We'll handle this case now.

56
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,780
Which department are you from?

57
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,320
We're from the Administration Bureau.

58
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,450
Administration?
Administer what? Of where?

59
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,450
I don't see Investigator Jung Saebyeok.

60
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,660
- Where is she?
- I don't care where you guys are from.

61
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,490
Bring Investigator Jung Saebyeok.

62
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,500
What?

63
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,960
Captain.

64
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,750
The chief is asking for you. Something
about the Administration Bureau...

65
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,340
Where's Investigator Jung?

66
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,300
Detective Jung went to the NFS.

67
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,050
For DNA analysis? The culprit's DNA?

68
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,470
Well, the suspect
has an accomplice so...

69
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,680
Hello, sir. Some people from
the Administration Bureau just barged...

70
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,060
Are you serious?

71
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,360
To people I don't even know?

72
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,690
When did Investigator Jung leave?

73
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,320
She left after getting a call
saying the DNA results were in.

74
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,950
Make sure both she and the NFS
don't know anything.

75
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,200
- Yes, ma'am.
- You two follow the manual too.

76
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,870
- We do not see, hear, or speak.
- We do not see, hear, or speak.

77
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,330
We're well aware of that, ma'am.

78
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,300
STRONG TEETH DENTIST

79
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,840
Who'd recognize him?

80
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,800
Sorry?

81
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,090
No one would recognize
a man hanging from the window

82
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,640
unless they personally know him.

83
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,970
That wasn't why I was looking at it.

84
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,350
You have the results.

85
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,640
Yes, the results are in.
I heard she's an accomplice.

86
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,860
- Yes.
- You should find her soon then.

87
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,650
I will catch her. Thank you.

88
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,150
No, that's not what I meant.

89
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,700
Hurry before she dies.

90
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
What?

91
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,660
How can I explain it?
Her DNA is a little off.

92
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,160
How so?

93
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,910
Well, comparing it to bones,
it's like they are all dislocated.

94
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,460
Is that even possible?
Can she still live like that?

95
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,630
No, she can't.

96
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,720
Are you saying it's a dead person's DNA?

97
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,090
Well, I'm not sure. I've never seen
anything like this before,

98
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,010
so I'd like to do further analysis.

99
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,470
Do you have any other DNA samples
of the cap owner?

100
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,980
I'll look for more. Thank you.

101
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,810
Sure. Bye.

102
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,710
<i>How can I explain it?</i>

103
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,800
Her DNA is a little off.

104
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,510
<i>Hurry before she dies.</i>

105
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,470
Well, it's like all her bones
are dislocated.

106
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,110
Yes, Captain?

107
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,110
<i>You're still at the NFS, right?</i>

108
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,240
<i>Well, someone wants to talk to you.</i>

109
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,330
Who?

110
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,870
<i>Investigator Jung Saebyeok?</i>

111
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,000
<i>Listen to me carefully and do as I say.</i>

112
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,540
Who is this?

113
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,590
The Administration Bureau?

114
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,680
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

115
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,200
How can I help you?

116
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,580
Hi, we are...

117
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,040
- What are you...
- That car's the investigator in charge.

118
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,770
Those punks.

119
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,750
Get out of the car!

120
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,630
Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop!

121
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,310
Open the door.

122
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,230
We've collected all other evidence
from your station. That's the last one.

123
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,940
Please cooperate.

124
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,520
You're not asking me to cooperate.
You're forcing me.

125
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,150
You must've heard everything.
Why are you doing this?

126
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,570
Yes, I've heard everything.
But I don't feel like cooperating.

127
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,830
We just need to take this.

128
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,200
I guess you're not busy today.

129
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,910
You wanted nothing to do with it
yesterday. Why do this now?

130
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,380
Since when did the Administration Bureau
order the police around

131
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,630
outside of their jurisdiction?

132
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,840
You have no authority.

133
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,380
Yes, we do. It is under our jurisdiction.
You know that.

134
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,590
How would I know?

135
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,800
All I know is that you are no different
from the Administration Bureau.

136
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,310
Showing up after years and
telling me to just do as you say?

137
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,980
It's not like I wanted to show up.
Let's just get this over with.

138
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,060
Eojin.

139
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,780
Can you please roll down
this window for me?

140
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,580
You must find this absurd and offensive,

141
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,540
but we're also public officials.
You can trust us.

142
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,250
This is important for us too.
We'll do our best to catch the culprit.

143
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,130
Just think of it
as a transfer of jurisdiction

144
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,290
and give us the document.

145
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,660
Thank you.

146
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,040
Did you take a look at this?

147
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,250
What if I did?

148
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,340
Say you didn't.

149
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,880
You must say no.

150
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,060
I regret that I didn't.

151
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,120
Why, of all people...

152
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,340
Well, that investigator is...

153
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,260
No need.

154
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,230

Okay.

163
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,180
All right. Let me see.

164
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:09,810
All right.

165
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,270
What? My money! That...

166
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,480
Hey, you!

167
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,650
My money! That... Catch him!

168
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,070
My money! That...

169
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,450
That jerk! Catch him! My...

170
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,830
That crazy jerk.

171
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,590
Why did he touch my butt?

172
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,100
Have you talked to anyone
about what happened today?

173
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,180
I saw the Grid breaking again
on my way back.

174
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:20,440
And the Grid Control Team always acts
like they're the center of the world?

175
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,740
But they won't be able to do that anymore
because we finally found her.

176
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,360
Right, Ms. Choi?

177
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,990
What about the NFS?
Did you keep them quiet?

178
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,950
Yes, we told them to erase
the analysis results from their memory.

179
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:40,290
Our team finally produced actual results
after almost 30 years, Ms. Choi.

180
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,340
Did you work in pairs
while on duty according to the rules?

181
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,840
- Have you ever gone alone?
- Never.

182
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,760
Oh, right.
I heard you're the witness to the case.

183
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,390
Have you personally contacted
the detectives in charge since then?

184
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,890
No, never.

185
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,440
You'll be punished accordingly if it's
revealed that you've leaked any secrets.

186
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,360
- Do you consent?
- I do.

187
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,360
Thank you.

188
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,450
Thank you.

189
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,920
We should get the murderer first
to get some clue about the Ghost, right?

190
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,550
We should get ready to investigate then.

191
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,380
Get ready to go home.

192
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,430
Yes, ma'am.

193
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,560
I guess all you care about
is going home no matter what happens.

194
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,270
We need to go home
to come to work the next day, Eojin.

195
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,900
Thank you.

196
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,330
A person like him is
definitely overpaid. Jeez.

197
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,460
In movies, a person like him
usually turns out to be an alien

198
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,000
or an emperor of a star that's perished.

199
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,510
He could be an Oscar winner then.

Would you like to make a reservation?

00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,420
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,420
What do you mean?

210
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,210
I saw that place was surrounded
by the police.

211
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,930
<i>Oh, they're all gone.
No police here now.</i>

Oh, no! My phone!

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,640
- Isn't it in your pocket?
- Where did it go?

217
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,020
Sir. I used my phone here earlier.

218
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,740
My phone. Did I drop it here somewhere?

219
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,410
- It's 10,000 won.
- Is it cool material?

220
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,450
It is.

221
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,950

This is easy for you, isn't it?

235
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,230
Because you can just disappear.

236
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,860
Like you did before.

00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,080
Who are you?

238
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,630
So it's because of the woman, huh?

239
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,880
Not the suspect.

240
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:41,970
My eyes hurt.

241
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,020
What are you doing here?

242
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,650
Can't you see?
Why are you yelling at me?

243
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,570
That was rude of me.

244
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,120
I'm sorry.

245
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,460
By any chance, I didn't kick you
somewhere I shouldn't, did I?

246
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,220
No, I'm perfectly fine.

247
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,590
You don't seem fine at all.

248
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,990
If you try to take this away
from me again,

249
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,820
you really won't be fine then.

250
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,920
Is that
the accomplice's fingerprint?

251
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,800
The suspect's been identified,
so I doubt you need his fingerprints.

252
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,740
- Hey, get down here!
- Hey, let go of the rope!

253
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,660
Hurry!

254
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,830
Gosh!

255
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,790
Collateral damage?

256
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,770
You said you got the accomplice's
fingerprints from her cap.

257
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,390
When did I?

258
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,060
In the report that you wrote.

259
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,270
Were they not enough?

260
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,290
The window frames were gently
placed on the floor yesterday.

261
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,920
Where is he?

262
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,880
<i>If the suspect
tore them out to escape,</i>

263
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,840
<i>they would've been broken or damaged.</i>

264
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,720
If his accomplice had torn them out
for him... That makes sense.

265
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,890
She even prepared a rope beforehand.

266
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,850
How's the investigation going?

267
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,020
You don't know anything.

268
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:42,440
You must know more than I do,
seeing how you said I don't know anything.

269
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,280
Why do you keep
asking me questions?

270
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,160
You're the one
who should be giving me answers.

271
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,120
You forced us to hand it over.
There must be some progress.

272
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,950
It is progressing.

273
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,870
And?

274
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,670
We've been excluded.
No, we'll be excluded.

275
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,960
It's always like that.
My team finds traces.

276
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,930
Then another team
carries out the investigation.

277
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,090
"It's always like that" means

278
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,640
the AB has been looking
for her for some time.

279
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,100
That means...

280
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,770
I didn't see it wrong.

281
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,860
No, you didn't.

282
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,320
Check the phone records.

283
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,320
The culprit's records?
You didn't write about that in the report.

284
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,870
It's because
I received the records afterwards.

285
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,210
I can't even read my own report
because you deleted it.

286
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,800
Then you sound like you memorized it.

287
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:51,560
Wait. Was it someone else
on your team that deleted it?

288
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
Eojin didn't even get
a chance to read it.

289
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,270
I wasn't asking if Song Eojin did.

290
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,120
I should've checked
the rope first yesterday.

291
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,790
Darn it.

292
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,590
Get down from there.

293
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,340
She disappears into thin air.

294
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,600
DNA or fingerprints...

295
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,270
Would those be of any help?

296
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,640
Get down. Now.

297
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,120
Do you think

298
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,370
she's really an accomplice?

299
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,750
You know her, don't you?

300
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:05,460
The woman I saw.
You know her, don't you?

301
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,220
No.

302
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,050
This is easy for you, isn't it?
"Because you can just disappear

303
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:15,010
Like you did before."

304
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,100
You said this to me earlier,
mistaking me for her.

305
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,900
She disappeared into thin air before
like this time,

306
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,570
and you saw it, didn't you?

307
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,610

318
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,980
This kimchi is so delicious.
Why is there a lot left?

319
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:51,990
Well, something not good happened
in this area yesterday, so... Goodness.

320
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,530
Oh, because the news said
the culprit was living

321
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,950
on the second floor of this building?

322
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,990
But customers don't come
for such a reason?

323
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,830
I guess people are scared.

324
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,210
Aren't you scared, ma'am?

325
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,080
You must know his face.

326
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,000
Of course, I do.

327
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,300
You never know
what a person is really like, you know.

328
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,840
Were you and the suspect close?

329
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:19,800
What? I barely knew him.

330
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,890
He just came from time to time and...

331
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,110
<i>I should've just stayed quiet.</i>

332
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,150
<i>Goodness. Me and my big mouth.</i>

333
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:37,320
Why is it so hot
even with the AC on? Jeez.

334
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,990
I hope the new tenant
on the second floor

335
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:45,160
will be a company
whose employees have lunch here.

336
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:51,460
<i>I happened to say that the dental clinic
upstairs was shut down.</i>

337
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,050
- When was that?
- By any chance...

338
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:55,970
Here you go.

339
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,050
Enjoy.

340
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,090
Thank you.

341
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,060
When was that?

342
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,600
I think it was a couple of months ago.

343
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,650
Goodness gracious. Who would've known
that he'd go live there?

344
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,230
Goodness.

345
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:19,320
By any chance,
have you ever seen him with a woman?

346
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,910
What woman?

347
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,290
Well, I just saw him
come and go a few times.

348
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,960
And every time, he was alone.

349
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,380
What's wrong? Does it taste bad?

350
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,590
No. It's delicious.

351
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,510
But it tastes like the one
I had long ago.

352
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,390
Well, most old people make it
in a similar way.

353
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:46,980
Come to think of it,

354
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:52,440
the news said some woman helped him
when he was fleeing from here.

355
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,770
Was there was such news?

356
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,610
Who could it have been?

357
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:01,700
By the way, did he really kill a person?

358
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,170
It's true that Kim Manok
committed murder.

359
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,760
If you remember more about him
or happen to see him near here,

360
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,260
make sure to call me.

361
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,760
He's a dangerous person, so be careful.

362
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,760
Okay.

363
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,850
And your kimchi is really the best.

364
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,480
Oh, thank you.

365
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,060
- It was delicious.
- Bye. Thank you.

366
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,900
- Come again.
- Sure.

367
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,450
- Oh, wait. Your change...
- Later.

368
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:46,410
Oh, I really enjoyed the food too.

369
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,620
Can I also have your business card?

370
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,840
If you gave me yours first, we'd be
exchanging cards, nicely and naturally.

371
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,090
I thought you knew
we don't have business cards.

372
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,260
Is it still
like that over there?

373
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,220
So you do know.

374
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,100
From what I remember,

375
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,480
Eojin used to work

376
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,190
in a department that handles the Grid.

377
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:19,190
Why is he looking for people now?

378
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,570
Because he transferred.

379
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,070
I'm asking why he transferred.

380
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,370
Well... though it's none of my business.

381
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,830
If so, why don't you ask him yourself?

382
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,170
That's never going to happen.

383
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,270

Yes, all of them.

From here to there.

391
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,910
It's 51,000 won.

392
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,410
How many forks do you need?

393
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:00,540
- Put this one back. Just one fork, please.
- Okay.

394
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,960
None of them to go, right?

395
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:07,340
Yes. I have a lot of time to kill.
I'm going to eat all of them here.

That uniform's a new CIRAS model.
Is it a custom one?

411
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,190
There's no mark on it at all.

412
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:50,650
So what is it?

413
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,820
What do you mean?

414
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,890
The Special Investigation Bureau will
take the convenience store murder case.

415
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:25,520
- And we're...
- We're excluded?

416
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,730
But our bureau found her.

417
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,610
Yes, finding people is our job.

418
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:32,650
And that's where our bureau's job ends.

419
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,900
So are we supposed to just click
on a mouse at our desks as always?

420
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:39,410
I can put up with other teams
looking down on us.

421
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:42,160
But the one
we've been looking for every day...

422
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,120
The one we started to call the Ghost

423
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,580
because we weren't even sure
if she really existed.

424
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,620
We've finally found her.

425
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,290
But we're excluded?

426
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,130
It was so hard to find her, so
we should leave it to experts from here.

427
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:00,050
Mr. Song Eojin. Have you ever
carried out an investigation?

428
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,800
No, because you never let me.

429
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:06,890
You were hired to click on a mouse
to search the web at your desk.

430
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:08,430
As an office worker.

431
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,810
Not to act like a police officer.

432
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,440
Then why did you share all that with us?

433
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,650
Share what?

434
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:19,820
You knew that we'd be excluded
and that another team would take it.

435
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,910
You knew it before they told you.

436
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:24,950
If we were going to take it,
we would've been busy since yesterday,

437
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:26,660
on a stakeout or investigating.

438
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,120
- But even yesterday, we...
- Got off work on time.

439
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,630
- Yes.
- You'll continue to do so.

440
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:33,920
Don't worry.

441
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,840
As you said,
we've never investigated a case.

442
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,300
And I'm not saying we should lead
the investigation team alone.

443
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:45,050
But if you really think of us
as your team members,

444
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,890
I think you should tell us
what this is all about,

445
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:51,520
how you recognized the Ghost
just by looking at the composite sketch,

446
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,100
and what exactly our job is.

447
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:56,190
We're not search engines,
but your people.

448
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,660
The Ghost is somewhere out there
right now.

449
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:12,960
She might disappear again any moment.

450
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,290
If you have time for this,
go find more traces of her.

451
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,050
Dig up the murderer's past.

452
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:22,380
Find out why the Ghost is helping him

453
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:25,090
and if there's any connection
between them.

454
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:28,310
His house, hometown, and school.
We need to go to all those places.

455
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:29,720
We have a lot of work to do.

456
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:31,100
Get back to work.

457
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,770
- Ma'am.
- What?

458
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,650
Shall I go? To the places you just said?

459
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:37,060
Why don't you go with her?

460
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:39,980
I will stay here.

461
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,630
Jongyi. You're having fun
at work, aren't you?

462
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,640
Like watching a wildfire, right?

463
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,100
Not only that.
I watch fights happening too.

464
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,100
I apologize.

465
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,390
I was overzealous
and disrespectful to you.

466
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,480
It's fine.

467
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,730
Let's go.

468
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:19,320
What the hell is he doing?

469
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,360
I'll make sure it won't happen again.

470
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:28,820
Get your hands off.

471
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:31,790
I'm sorry.

472
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,760
