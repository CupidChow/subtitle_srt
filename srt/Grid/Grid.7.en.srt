Sir, this is Kim Saeha.

13
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,990
There's something
I must tell you in person right now.

14
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,860
No, not later.

15
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,620
It's about the woman.

16
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,960
No, I must tell you now...

17
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,830
This is Jung Saebyeok
from Songje Station.

18
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,170
There's important information
that I only gave to Ms. Choi.

19
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,920
And I think I should tell you too,

20
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,300
now that Ms. Choi
can no longer report it to you.

21

All right. What is it?

29
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,140
Come on in.

30
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,480
Now,

31
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,810
what is it about?

32
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,730
Hey, Kim Saeha.

33
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,150
- Hey, Kim Saeha!
- Down on the floor.

34
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,070
Saebyeok. Don't!

35
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,620
- You can't.
- Don't move.

36
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,920

DIRECTOR JO HEUNGSHIK

38
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,200
Saebyeok,

39
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,370
you shouldn't get involved in this.

40
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,740
Shut it.

41
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,080
Not one more step.

42
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,170
Shut up. Don't come closer.

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,840
Saeha.

44
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,050
Let Saebyeok go.

45
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,220
Do you think I was dragged in here?

46
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,010
Don't say anything.

47
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,050
Don't say anything.

48
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,100
Not another word.

49
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,650
What did you do to my mom?

50
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,030
Your mom...

51
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,490
Your mom...

52
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,080
is already dead.

53
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,470
<i>It seems they destroyed
the access device.</i>

54
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,260
<i>Even the security office
can't open the door.</i>

55
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,220
All right.

56
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,100
What's the matter?
What happened on the 13th floor?

57
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,190
Who said you could touch that?

58
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,910
What the hell?

59
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,330
What did you put in there?

60
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,930
She's dead.

61
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,300
There's only one way
to bring her back to life.

62
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,370
No. Don't be fooled.
She won't save your mom.

63
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,960
Why kill her in the first place then?

64
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,120
Don't you think?

65
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,420
Believe me.

66
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,460
I'll overlook what you've done to me.
What do you say?

67
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,050
Are you crazy?

68
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,340
This is an opportunity we mustn't lose!

69
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,180
The future of humanity depends on it!

70
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,180
Wait. Hey!

71
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,930
You will not get away with this.
Both of you!

72
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,150
I'm going to make you rot in prison
for the rest of your lives! I will...

73
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,360
I already injected a lot.

74
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,160
This will be lethal.

75
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,830
Don't do it, Eojin.

76
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,870
If she gets it back, it's over.

77
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,340
Don't you know
what we've sacrificed for this?

78
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,890
What are they...

79
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,550
Get up.

80
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,930
Implant it.

81
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,520
No. You're going too far.

82
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,560
Implant it in me!

83
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,540
<i>With it, I can do anything.</i>

84
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,000
I can bring everyone back to life.

85
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,710

86

We'll go home afterward,
so wait just a little longer.

106
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,790
Yes, I had dinner a while ago.

107
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,580
Just something simple.

108
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,430
I'm sorry.

109
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,640
It'll just be a minute.

110
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,010
Yes.

111
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,600
I can sleep in the night-duty room.

112
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,060
Okay. Bye.

113
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,800
Oh, no.

114
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,760

115
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,840

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,970

00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,700
I'm calling from Laboratory 1.
Call 911 right now...

Call 911 now. He's still alive.

129
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,800
I already did.

Hey, son.

133
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,000
I know. When you got up from your nap,
I was already gone, wasn't I?

134
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,960
I'm sorry.

135
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,930
I'm on night duty.

136
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,100
Night duty?

137
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,100
That means
I have to spend the night at work.

138
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,940
Yes, I can't go home

Who are you?

143
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,210
So this is what the initial program
looks like.

144
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
We don't use it.

145
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,670
Who are you? How do you know that?

146
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,130
Interesting.

147
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,760
That's what I've always
wanted to ask you.

148
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,180
You know me?

149
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:16,930
Of course I do...

150
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,470
murderer.

151
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,280
You think you're the savior

00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,660
<i>Why did you come back and kill him?</i>

155
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,490
Why do you keep saying I killed someone?

156
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,380
When you could tell me why,
I wasn't able to ask.

157
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,420
Now that I can, you have no idea.

158
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,420
How crappy.

159
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,100
Who you are, really?

160
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,770
You don't recognize me

161
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,270
when everyone mistakes me for him.

162
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,860
That means you weren't
specifically after my father.

163
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,320
You just needed that ID card.

164
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,410
Nothing has changed.

165
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,880
<i>You and everyone at this institute</i>

166
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,640
<i>treated people like expendable parts.</i>

167
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,970
But he was a living person.

168
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,060
He studied all his life

169
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,320
and just began to live a decent life.

170
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,950
I heard he was so happy
to have gotten a job at this institute.

171
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,740
Then your father is...

172
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,700
That's right.

173
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,460
My father, whose face
has faded from my memory.

174
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,750
He had a child and a wife.

175
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,260
He wasn't someone who could
be sacrificed for the mighty Grid.

Density?

186
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,690
What's the density?

No.

00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,670
Is Ms. Kim Minseon here?

203
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,290
Who's Kim Minseon?

204
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,670
She's my mother.

Is she not here?

206
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,890
There's no one by that name here.

207
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,520
Are you saying she's never worked here?

208
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,520
Yes.

209
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,480
Right? She doesn't work here.

210
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,520

Thank you.

212

No.

213

214
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,890
Get out of here now!

215
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,520
There's a fire. Hurry out. Hurry!

216

It's a fire!

- Don't go out!

- What's happening outside?

220
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,790
What? Why not?

221
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,620
Is there a basement here?
A basement with running water?

222
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,920
Yes, there is. The cafeteria.

224
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,050
It's here!

225
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,340
- Get under the tables!
- Okay.

226
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,720
Under the tables!

227
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,890
Get under the tables!

228
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,480
Wait! Bring the flashlights!

231
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,410

251
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,050
My.

252
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,890
Why are you soaking wet?

253
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,770
And why are you wearing shoes
inside the house?

Saeha.

255

Kwon Saeha. Are you okay?

256
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,320
Mom.

257
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,820
Yes?

258
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,030
Your body is burning hot.

259
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,490
You must be running a fever.

260
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,580
Go upstairs and get changed.
And soak in a hot bath.

261
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,830
You'll catch a cold like a kid.

262
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,130
Now.

263
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,710

265

Your dad is home!

266
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:09,260
You're home early.
You must've parted early.

267
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,220
We only had dinner.

268
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,390
What's that?

269
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,470
Oh, Saeha seems to have a slight cold.

270
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,230
Are you not feeling well?

271
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,100
- You're home.
- Yes.

272
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,360
He doesn't have a fever though.

273
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,490
When I tell you my whole body aches,
you just ignore it.

274
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,160
Look how devoted you are to your son.

275
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,830
Of course. You're over 60.
It's normal for your body to ache.

276
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,370
That's just natural.

277
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,960
- Drink up.
- Okay.

278
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,050
Okay.

279
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,320
Just leave it.
Your clothes will get dirty.

280
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,460
So this is how short you were.

281
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,170
You see me every day,
but you realize that now?

282
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,130
Be grateful that you didn't inherit
your height from me.

283
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,490
Are you coming with us?

284
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,540
Yes.

285
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,830
Okay. Then get in.

286
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,820
You'll be alone when the Korean
Food and Drug Administration come.

287
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:20,320
They only need to test three samples
this time, so I can handle it.

288
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:21,870
Okay.

289
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,450
You've been in charge
of quality control anyway.

290
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,250
I hope they send
a quick-witted one this time.

291
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,210

work as a civil servant?

00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,510
<i>since the river water flows
through the mountain...</i>

333
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:40,360
<i>...the white stream looks
just like the back of a white dragon.</i>

334
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:44,820
<i>It was created
about 150 million years ago.</i>

335
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:50,040
<i>The only river in Korea
that crosses a mountain...</i>

336
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,290
Are you going out at this hour?

337
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:55,370
Why are you wearing shoes?

338
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,470
Is something wrong?

339
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,300
Mom.

340
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:07,430
Yes?

341
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,430
Dad.

342
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,060
Go on.

343
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,630
Did something happen?

344
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,640
I'm sorry.

345
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,520
What? For what?

346
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:06,240
KWON SUKEUN

347
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,790
Mr. Kwon. I've finished,
so I'll be heading home...

348
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:41,150
What?

349
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,020
How did you come out of there?

350
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:45,030
What do you mean?

351
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,030
Where did it go?

352
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,030
Have you seen my gown here?

353
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:56,950
You were wearing...
No, you were carrying it earlier.

354
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,500
I was? When?

355
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,290
Just now. On your way to the laboratory.

356
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,710
I've been here all along.

357
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,590
Wasn't that you?

358
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,800
- What?
- Did you see someone?

359
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:13,800
I thought it was you.

360
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:15,760
It's the weekend, so
there's no one else.

361
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:20,140
Call the security office
and ask who was here.

362
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:21,150
Yes, sir.

363
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:03,940
What the hell?

364
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:07,270
No, Dad!

365
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,400
It's me, Saeha.

366
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,950
Who are you?

367
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,490
How do you know my son?

368
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:25,540
LABORATORY 1

369
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:47,230
Doctor!
