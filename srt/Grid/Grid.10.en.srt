00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,940
Two murders and one assault.

10
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,650
I've agreed to step down if we lose him,
so we must not lose him.

11
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,400
Not because of our bureau's mistake.

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,450
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

13
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,160
The Ghost is where Kim Manok is.

14
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,370
You all wanted to go out to the field.

15
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,160
This is your chance.

16
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,080
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

17
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,060
About what we heard
at the lobby earlier...

18
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,770
Was Ms. Choi mistaken?

19
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:43,770
A misunderstanding?

20
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,490
Do you also want us
to pretend to be deaf and dumb?

21
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
No.

22
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,950
I think, Ms. Chae,
he just answered your question.

23
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,450
I think so too.

24
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,420
He doesn't deny it.

25
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,210
Why did she bring you back so soon?
There must've been a lot to find out.

26
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,600
<i>Let's use Kwon Saeha as bait too.</i>

27
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,190
If it wasn't the Ghost who released Manok
and she still needs him,

28
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,440
she'll show up.

29
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,820
No.

30
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,320
Even if that's the case,
she wouldn't come here voluntarily.

31
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,620
Then we should let him out.

32
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,500
The culprit?

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,080
And him?

34
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,380
I think you should see this.

...as bait too.

39
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,570
He's not completely useless.

40
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,700
<i>Along with the culprit.</i>

41
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,410
<i>It's time to put
all our cards on the table.</i>

Find all organisms

43
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,480
emitting over 100 microteslas
of electromagnetic radiation.

44
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,020
- What's the upper limit?
- No limit.

45
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,320
Are you sure the Founder emits
electromagnetic radiation?

46
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,990
You're also a scientist.

47
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,120
<i>What's the normal level of electromagnetic
radiation emitted by a human?</i>

48
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,700
<i>You don't need a scientist for that.</i>

49
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,330
I think you should see this.

50
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,290
<i>A normal person emits
a very small amount.</i>

51
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,960
<i>Over 100? That means...</i>

52
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,090
this person has frequently been
exposed to magnetic fields.

53
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,380
Exactly.

54
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,260
There, 106!

55
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,640
No, that's Kwon Saeha.

56
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,100
The measurement has to be
much higher than this.

57
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
Please.

58
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,230
<i>Let's split.</i>

59
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,650
<i>Ms. Chae.</i>

60
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,110
Mr. Kwon.

61
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,820
Whatever you do, do it alone.

62
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,070
- Don't drag Saebyeok...
- I won't drag you into anything.

63
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,480
<i>Alpha has appeared. 34K3756.</i>

64

65
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,000
<i>That's 34K3756. 3755!</i>

66
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,970
<i>It's the next alley!</i>

67
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,940
C1 and C2, stay in your position.
You're to watch for Beta.

68
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,170
Over there.

69
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,670
Alpha.

70
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,130
Alpha 25K1754.

71
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,630
He's right next to Beta.

72
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,120
Damn it.

73
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,240
Halt. Stand by.

74
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,970
Inform us of Beta's position. I repeat.

75
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,230
<i>Inform us of Beta's position again.
We don't see him here.</i>

76
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,190
What do you mean, you don't see him?
He's right between you two!

77
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,410
What are you doing? What?

78
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,670
Beta has removed the GPS tracker.

79
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,750
<i>He's out of our sight.</i>

80
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,880
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

81
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,510
Gosh, I can't locate him.

82
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,130
<i>We've lost Kim Manok.</i>

83
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,180
<i>As for the signal,
I think the Ghost showed up on purpose.</i>

84
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,760
<i>What do we do? Do we continue?</i>

85
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,470
<i>Retrieve Kim Manok.</i>

86
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,700
<i>Tell me this is the only way.</i>

87
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,080
Tell me this is worth it.

88
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,830
As long as the sun exists,
the solar wind is a threat.

89
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,540
Both to your generation

90
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,540
and mine.

91
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,590
Did many people die in your time too?

92
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,100
They would

93
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,760
without the Grid.

94
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,730
How many more
need to be sacrificed to complete it?

95
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,690
Are there more left?

96
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,150
Among the people I know?

97
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,850
We've repeated this dozens of times.

98
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,560
To find another way.

99
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,900
Though it doesn't matter since
you are all people in the past to me.

100
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,780
Yes.

101
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,610
It's for us to be born.

102
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,820
For my mom and me.

103
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,660
Then what about my mom?

104
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,450
If I'm gone too...

105
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,580
If she has no one to look after her...

106
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,760
I'm not going to die for you.

107
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,970
Figure something out
for your mom yourself.

108
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,140
You're shameless.

109
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,510
I know.

110
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,150
When will it happen?

111
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,480
When will I...

112
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,450
How much time do I have left?

113
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,000
<i>Mom...</i>

114
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,920
<i>I'm sorry, Mom.</i>

115
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,600
<i>I wanted to make it.</i>

116
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,230
<i>But I couldn't.</i>

117
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,330
Kwon Saeha!

118
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,260
Saeha!

119
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,220
<i>Saeha!</i>

120
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,230
Darn it.

121
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,490
Damn it.

122
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,120
Are you okay?

123
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,010
Detective. What are you doing here?

124
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:46,800
Why that...

125
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,380
Kwon Saeha!

126
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,680
He came this way for sure.

127
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,390
- I mean Kim Manok.
- Yes, he's nearby.

128
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,690
Did you let him go on purpose?

129
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,610
A murderer in this crowded place?

130
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,190
That's why you shouldn't be here.

131
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,950
Where is that bastard?

132
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,740
My higher-ups already know
that you're here.

133
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,300
Northwest?

134
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,800
It's that way.

135
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,550
Kim Manok recognized me.

136
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,890
How all of a sudden?

137
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,190
Hey!

138
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,400
Beta has removed the GPS tracker.
He's out of our sight.

139
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,690
Is the deputy director out of her mind?

140
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,570
She's your boss. How could she put you
in danger instead of protecting you?

141
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,910
Let me see.

142
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,200
Did he do this?

143
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,910
Did he?

144
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,920
Kim Manok must be full of spite now.

145
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,630
So you must be careful too.
He's more dangerous than ever.

146
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,050
That piece of trash.

147
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,180
Whatever happened when he was little,

148
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,980
he's been like that because he was
hopeless in the first place.

149
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,560
I should've shot him
when I first saw him.

150
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,240
- Did something happen?
- Nothing between me and that jerk.

151
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,870
You didn't

152
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,580
happen to spot Manok, did you?

153
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,830
You came
to the Administration Bureau, right?

154
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,840
Why?

155
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,220
I...

156
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,100
He and I...

157
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,640
Go on.

158
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,690
There's something I have to check.

159
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,650
And if it turns out to be true,

160
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,280
I'll nip it in the bud.

161
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,210
What the hell...

162
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,130
What is it you have to check?

163
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,500
We'll lose him. Let's go.

164
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,960
No.

165
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,260
- What was that noise?
- Call 911.

166
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,430
- What?
- Please call 911.

167
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,590
- My gosh.
- Call 911.

168
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,890
Hurry up! Over here!

169
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,310
Look at me, Saeha.

170
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,140
Saeha. Look at me.

171
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,610
You'll be fine.

172
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,860
Just keep breathing.

173
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,780
You'll be fine.

174
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,370
They'll come save you soon.

175
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,460
You can't die because of me.

176
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,880
You...

177
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,350
You knew...

178
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,200
Saeha.

179
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,320
<i>The Ghost is right next to you.</i>

180
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,240
Ms. Choi...

181
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,410
- Saeha is...
- <i>She's right next to you!</i>

182
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,510
It's not me. Can't you see it?

183
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,970
<i>You'll save him, right?</i>

184
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,730
<i>You're here to save him, right?</i>

185
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,320
<i>Are we really connected?</i>

186
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,090
- What happened?
- There were people here.

187
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,090
- Where did they go?
- I don't know.

188
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,810
- They were here for sure.
- Where did they go?

189
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,070
Why?

190
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,740
Why?

191
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,280
I can't find her. We've lost her.

192
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,790
Go back one minute.

193
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,250
Is it broken?

194
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,790
That can't be. What's wrong with this?

195
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,610
It wasn't just one.

196
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,200
<i>Ms. Choi.</i>

197
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,070
<i>Saeha is dead.</i>

198
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,450
<i>Ms. Choi. Can't you hear me?</i>

199
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,280
CONDOLENCES

200
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,250
LATE KWON SAEHA

201
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:45,850
KWON SUKEUN GRAVE

202
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:48,850
Goodness.

203
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,770
She's outlived not only
her husband but also her son.

204
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,530
How is she going to live now? Goodness.

205
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,530
How unfortunate for her.

206
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,420
You took him.

207
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,840
You.

208
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:24,300
I clearly told you
that I wouldn't allow it.

209
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:30,560
I told you I didn't want my son to work
for the IRR or the Administration Bureau.

210
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,350
But you made...

211
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,190
You made him work...

212
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,480
at the place where his father died.

213
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:41,990
Didn't you?

214
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,570
He said he was on leave.

215
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,080
Why did he suddenly go to work? Why?

216
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:55,040
Why was a public officer
beaten to death by a murderer?

217
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,210
Why?

218
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,460
What on earth were you guys
doing then? Why?

219
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,510
- You took him!
- Yes, go ahead, sir. It's okay.

220
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,480
Then there were two of them,
not just one.

221
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,270
It wasn't an error.

222
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,950
We'll keep searching.

223
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,610
But I don't see the point of it.

224
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,570
What do you mean, why?

225
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,990
Only the Grid Control Team
has the facilities.

226
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,410
How can the Secretariat afford such
pricey machines with our current budget?

227
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,540
I'll tell you when I get back.

228
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,380
No, we're done here.

229
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,750
Yes, sir.

230
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,550
Open it.

231
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,350
Can you drop me off on the way?

232
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,600
I'm going home.

233
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,060
Then drop me off there.

234
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:52,030
MEMORIAL GATE

235
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,500
Are you going to take a cab?

236
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,250
We're almost here.

237
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,340
Yes.

238
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,760
Thanks.

239
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,560
Do you want to have a drink?

240
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,540
Yes?

241
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,420
Hello?

242
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,390
<i>The deputy director
pushed him to admit it.</i>

243
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,800
<i>That's how I found out what he had done.</i>

244
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,640
What are you talking about?

245
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,310
<i>Kwon Saeha.</i>

246
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:35,030
<i>I was going to ask him that evening
how he was entangled with Kim Manok.</i>

247
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,160
<i>I was determined not to let him go
until he gave me a proper answer.</i>

248
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,170
Where are you?

249
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,840
But why do I have to ask you about this?

250
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,210
How do you know all this?

251
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,760
Why are you the only one left to ask?

252
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,570
Did you drink all evening?

253
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,200
Alone?

254
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,620
You turned me down, so...

255
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,930
I didn't like him.

256
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,470
I never liked Kwon Saeha
even before he got involved with you.

257
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,980
Involved?
I didn't even know him that well.

258
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,940
I wish I hadn't known him at all.

259
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,730
Then he wouldn't have died.

260
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,490
He'd be sad to hear that.

261
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,700
You're pretty much the only person
who remembers him properly.

262
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,420
At first, I thought
he was just acting tough.

263
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,370
You can kill me later.

264
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,250
If I use it for some other purpose,

265
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,500
you can shoot me. I don't care.

266
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,630
When he told me to kill him...

267
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,130
I thought he was saying
such a thing so easily.

268
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,980
There's old footage
on the 13th floor of your office.

269
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,810
All the information about her is
on the 13th floor of my office building.

270
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,480
Footage of the woman
when she first appeared in 1997.

271
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,570
You saw that?

272
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,910
<i>In the footage, the woman kills</i>

273
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,160
<i>Kim Manok's foster father.</i>

274
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,290
<i>And someone helps her.</i>

275
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,460
That must be Kwon Saeha.

276
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,830
Why did she kill him?

277
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,090
If she hadn't, neither the woman

278
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,420
nor the Grid would exist.

279
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:02,880
You too.

280
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,260
Why me?

281
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,770
You captured the woman.

282
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,860
And while doing so...

283
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,200
<i>...you were hurt.</i>

284
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
Seriously.

285
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,040
I guess that's how
he could go back in time.

286
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:37,130
If I had been fine, I wouldn't have
given up the chance for anyone.

287
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,920
You helped him.

288
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,130
No way. Do I look like the type?

289
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,340
Song Eojin.

290
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,050
You helped your colleague

291
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,390
and saved me.

292
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,940
Was it worth it?

293
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,320
I don't know exactly what happened
in the past either.

294
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,370
But time was turned back,

295
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,410
and you came back to life.

296
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,410
Though I'm not sure
if that's the right way to put it.

297
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,420
But...

298
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:22,420
the person who turned back time
suffered a bigger loss while doing it.

299
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,010
Even after that...

300
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,810
his family was constantly used
by the Administration Bureau.

301
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:37,150
It must have been
how Mr. Kwon felt all his life.

302
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,070
He was ready to die at any time.

303
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,990
He lost his dad as a child,

304
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,450
managed to grow up...

305
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,500
and eventually died like that.

306
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,170
I wish he had just lived his own life.

307
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,630
Why couldn't he?

308
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,700
Get up. I'll take you home.

309
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,080
Though I don't know where to take you.

310
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,920
We were married for seven years,
and I don't even know where you live.

311
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,710
But lately, we see each other

312
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:49,180
pretty often.

313
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,470
Right.

314
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,410
Now that it's all over,

315
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,330
let's become strangers again.

316
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,420
Is that what you wanted to tell me?

317
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,590
If you come see me
like nothing has happened,

318
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,510
I'll have to act like that too.

319
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,730
I don't want to go back to the old days.

320
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:54,910
So that was...

321
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,160
when it happened.

322
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,750
The other day...

323
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,800
you suddenly asked me if I was okay.

324
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,220
That's when it must've happened.

325
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,310
It wasn't just a bad dream.

326
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,660
<i>The Secretariat is reborn today.</i>

327
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:01,780
<i>We turned from
an insignificant secondary department</i>

328
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:05,290
<i>to the core department, recognized
for its competence and importance.</i>

329
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,500
<i>But we mustn't be content with it.</i>

330
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,630
<i>After time passes, those who try
to diminish our power will rise again.</i>

331
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:15,010
<i>To stop them, we must always
produce satisfactory results.</i>

332
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,970
<i>We must produce concrete results.</i>

333
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,340
<i>Yes, ma'am!</i>

334
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,940
1 YEAR LATER

335
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,070
Just grill and eat one of them.

336
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,690
They're for sale.

337
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,940
My goodness.

338
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:41,370
You won't live forever.
Stop living like that.

339
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:51,500
Gosh. Your mom is here.

340
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,040
Mommy.

341
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:54,380
My goodness.

342
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:58,130
Sweetie. Your mom is here.

343
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,470
Are you finished?

344
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:01,340
- Yes, I'm done.
- I see.

345
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,300
Oh, my daughter. Did you have fun today?

346
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:04,600
Time to go home.

347
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,640
She's just a baby.
She doesn't know what's fun yet.

348
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,900
Thank you for looking after her.

349
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,520
Don't mention it.

350
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:18,360
I'm doing this because you pay me.

351
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,280
- I'll get going then.
- Okay.

352
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,240
Oh, right. I left some scorpionfish
in the kitchen, so snack on them.

353
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:25,990
Thank you, as always.

354
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:27,910
- I'll be off.
- Bye.

355
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,830
Oh, dear.

356
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,710
It's time to eat.

357
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,210
All right.

358
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,840
Ooh. Ooh...

359
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,510
You're eating so well, my daughter.

360
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,850
You must've been hungry.

361
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:44,740
My daughter.

362
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,410
When will you grow up and
follow me to the sea to see me work...

363
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,750
and to many other places?

364
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,630
I hope time passes quickly...

365
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,680
No.

366
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,600
Time doesn't flow.

367
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:14,440
That's not how it worked.

368
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:18,150
Time...

369
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,440
Let's go. You need to leave here.

370
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,240
What are you saying,
popping out of the blue?

371
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,610
I'll explain on the way.

372
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,820
If you don't leave now,
you and Byeori will be in danger.

373
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:11,160
How do you know her name?

374
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:12,990
Who told you?

375
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:16,830
You did.

376
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,990
<i>Maybe this child isn't the one.</i>

377
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,750
<i>Even when she's grown up
and a long time after that,</i>

378
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,370
<i>maybe nothing will happen.</i>

379
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:04,000
<i>But I've made my decision...</i>

380
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:07,380
<i>to finish what hasn't even begun yet.</i>

381
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:13,640
<i>Just like our traces have been erased,
we don't see the path ahead of us.</i>

382
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:31,070
<i>Drinkable water, breathable air,</i>

383
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:35,660
<i>thick forests,
and many living things in them.</i>

384
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,040
I couldn't prepare
a car seat for the baby.

385
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:43,460
<i>This child may not be able
to enjoy those things in the future.</i>

386
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,920
<i>Even without the solar wind,</i>

387
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,680
<i>we've already taken so many things
from future children.</i>

388
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,800
<i>If I can give even
one of those things back...</i>

389
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:00,600
<i>If my choice can protect them...</i>

390
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,400
<i>But...</i>

391
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,980
<i>I didn't expect that day
to come so soon.</i>

392
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:39,680
Sir. It's all set.

393
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,210
The Grid is all gone.

394
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,790
From all the times and layers.

395
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,920
You never know.

396
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,240
No one knows.

397
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:41,160
Is there really an end?
