9
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,860
Sir. A minute ago, the director asked me
to tell you to report on the progress.

10
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,490
Get all the CCTV footage
from the subway station.

11
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,910
Is it even traceable?

12
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,210
We can't do anything as a recon unit
if the target is not traceable.

13
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,510
What are you?

14
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:29,760
A soldier, sir.

15
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,890
You're a soldier
who makes the impossible possible.

16
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,510
Don't think about whether it's possible.

17
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,270
Hello, sir.

18
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,440
I'm sorry, sir. He got away.

19
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,740
Alpha didn't even show up.
There was no sign of the accomplice.

20
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:53,160
I think we should check the validity
of the police report again.

21
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,120
<i>Agent down.</i>

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,750
The Secretariat may have selected
intel not very reliable

23
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,750
and given it to us without verifying it.

24
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,420
<i>Agent down in the
Beta surveillance area.</i>

25
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,000
Major, one of our agents is down.

26
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,960
Report the details.

27
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,170
<i>We lost communication,</i>

28
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,470
<i>so we went to check Coast C
and found him down.</i>

29
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,760
What was the weapon? How's the agent?

30
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,970
<i>He's unconscious.
And we're figuring it out,</i>

31
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,520
<i>but it's neither a knife nor a gun.</i>

32
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,810
The agent is unconscious.

33
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,860
Forgive me for interrupting, sir.

34
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,690
But one of our agents has been injured.

35
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,700
I apologize.

36
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,490
We don't know yet.

40
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,140
Let me go.

41
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,310
It's the restaurant owner, right?

42
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,770
Leave.

43
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,320
I'm her daughter.

44
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,610
- What?
- What?

45
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,030
Daughter?

46
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,330
I came after getting a call from her.

47
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,750
Let go of me. Who are you
to stop me from seeing my mom?

48
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,300
Her daughter happens
to be a police officer?

49
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,880
You should've removed the police mark
from your car first.

50
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,270
Yes, I am a police officer.

51
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,230
I came after getting a call from the victim.
Anything wrong with that?

52
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,150
Let go.

53
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,110
Let go of me!

54
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,150
Jeez, why are the cops
fighting among themselves?

55
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,820
They don't cooperate with each other.

56
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,080
That's why they failed

57
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,910
to protect one old lady
with all these officers.

58
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,870
Goodness.

59
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,980
Get out.

60
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,030
Just tell me one thing.

61
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,740
What happened to the restaurant owner?

62
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,150
Is she hurt badly?

63
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,990
I'm not trying to meddle.

64
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,790
It's just that I saw the lady
right before this happened.

65
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,040
I even had a meal there.

66
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,170
I also had a meal there today.

67
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,460
You must understand me then.

68
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,460
What happened to her?

69
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,510
Kim Manok.

70
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,380
He came here, right?

71
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,770
How did you know?

72
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,650
I got a call.

73
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,780
- From whom?
- The owner.

74
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,450
About what?

75
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,910
Ask her yourself, dude.

76
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,620
How dare you call me "dude"?

77
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,460
How dare I?

78
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,210
You talked down to me when we first met,
so I thought we were the same age.

79
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,840
Well, you do look too old
for a guy my age.

80
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,300
I'm sure you heard
the police are off this case.

81
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:44,680
I did.

82
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,390
But...

83
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,810
now that I've seen how you failed to
protect an old lady with all those agents,

84
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,730
I don't think we should stay out of it.

85
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,320
You think you'll make any difference?

86
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,950
The suspect must be a big fish
seeing how the government is involved.

87
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,280
What's his deal?

88
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,280
Did you just scoff?

89
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,080
There must be something else.

90
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,580
Major.

91
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,640
Who is she?

92
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,350
She's a police officer.

93
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,020
From Songje Station?

94
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,980
Investigator Jung Saebyeok?

95
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,110
Then you should've told us in advance

96
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,320
to keep the guns at point
whether or not Beta gets away.

97
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,700
You're the one who said if we kept
an eye on Beta, Alpha would show up.

98
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,700
That's why our agents chased Beta.
Is that our fault?

99
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,740
Where's the murderer?

100
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,750
As you've heard,
we're searching for him.

101
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,290
Why are you still searching?

102
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,540
You trusted my intel so much
that you chased him

103
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,750
without noticing your agent
was attacked.

104
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,340
Then shouldn't you
have caught the suspect already?

105
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,090
What about that detective then?

106
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,090
You must've done
a terrible job taking over,

107
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,340
seeing how she interfered
as she pleased.

108
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,390
- Didn't you bring her here?
- Why would I...

109
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,810
Why would I do such a thing?

110
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,230
I heard you told the director to check
the validity of the police report again.

111
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,940
That the Secretariat gave you
unreliable intel in the first place.

112
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,740
Didn't you bring her here
to confirm that?

113
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,370
Our special agent was fully armed,
and someone caught him off guard.

114
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,330
No one could do it except Alpha.
The intel you gave us wasn't wrong.

115
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,920
The intel we gave you was accurate.

116
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,340
Even before your agent was attacked.

117
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,840
Hand the detective over to us.

118
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,670
Yes, ma'am.

119
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,790
Investigator Jung Saebyeok.

120
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,960
You said you got a call
from the restaurant owner.

121
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
But why did she call you?

122
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,500
When did you give her
your contact number?

123
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,300
Have you ever interfered in the case
other than this time?

124
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,130
Since you were
ordered to stay out of it.

125
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,510
Answer the question.

126
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,770
What happened to the old lady?

127
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,100
Investigator Jung Saebyeok.

128
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,150
She said she thought
the murderer was back.

129
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,860
And it took 15 minutes at most
for me to get there.

130
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,400
When I arrived,

131
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,190
there were already a swarm
of the so-called police officers.

132
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,070
And an ambulance carrying a person
left as soon as I arrived.

133
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,950
It wouldn't have been possible
if they hadn't been staking out the place.

134
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,460
With so many agents staking out,

135
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,790
what did they do
until a civilian was attacked?

136
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,670
Was there a second murder?

137
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,680
You used her as bait, didn't you?

138
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,940
They weren't there to catch the murderer.
It was to catch the woman, right?

139
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,910
You people said you'd catch him.

140
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,830
What kind of investigation is this?

141
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,540
Investigator.

142
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,920
Tell us everything you and
the restaurant owner said over the phone.

143
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,890
I'll take your place now.

144
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,920
- Investigator.
- It may be difficult for you

145
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,300
to accept, but we're not obliged
to give you a convincing explanation.

146
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,920
I'm not obliged to report to you either.

147
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,590
All we can say is that,

148
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,640
if you keep acting
independently like this,

149
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,010
you'll be removed from your duties.

150
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,430
Make sure to warn her that
she'll be jobless if she runs wild again.

151
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,390
From all your duties, I mean.

152
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,830
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

153
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,120
That Investigator Jung Saebyeok
is your ex-wife. Why?

154
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,970
Is that a problem?

155
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,470
What do you think, Mr. Song Eojin?

156
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,010
A detective who was
brought in for spying

157
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,350
is a family member
of one of our employees.

158
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,810
What do you think?

159
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,440
Will that be a problem or not?

160
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,860
She was. Not anymore.

161
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,110
And we split up many years ago.

162
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,780
- Have you been in touch with her?
- No.

163
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,910
Why didn't you say anything
when you went to the NFS to get her?

164
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,660
Because it was just a personal matter.

165
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,800
I had no other intentions, ma'am.

166
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,970
Stay out of this from now on.

167
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,310
Though we won't be dealing
with it anymore anyway.

168
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,270
What do you mean?

169
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,810
I'm telling you to get back to work.

170
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,280
Or do you not want to do any work
that's not about your ex-wife?

171
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,300
Make a right turn.

172
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,440
<i>She just left.</i>

173
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,170

Darn it.

177
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,640
<i>Stay out of this from now on.</i>

178

"How long do you think
the press will keep quiet..."

181
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,300
Gosh, my neck is so sore.

182
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,930
Can you still see her?

183
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,230
Yes.

184
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,860
When was that?

185
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,860
7:28 p.m.? What station?

186
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,410
Okay.

187
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,830
Got it.

188
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,840
So?

189
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,670
Did the Ghost appear again?

190
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,050
How did you know that, Ms. Chae?

191
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,300
- That I...
- Does it matter? Just tell me.

192
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,140
It seems so.

193
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,640
I wish she'd shown up in front of me.

194
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,480
I desperately want to see her
at least once.

195
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,440
Ms. Chae. This isn't some kind of a game
or virtual reality.

196
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,320
You'll get hurt if you think that way.
You know how dangerous she is?

197
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,230
How dangerous is she? Do you know?

198
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,070
Ms. Choi just said people got hurt.

199
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,200
Two people.

200
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,950
Don't you get it?

201
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,740
With the murderer, she...

202
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,410
Where's Mr. Song?

203
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,080
Oh, he said he missed breakfast
coming in early today.

204
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,010
Did you eat?

205
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,930
I'm sorry. My blood sugar level
drops if I skip a meal.

206
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,520
Kim Manok, the murder suspect,

207
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,150
got on a northbound train
that left Songje Station at 7:28 p.m.

208
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,530
<i>The tracking devices attached to his stuff
were found on the floor of that train.</i>

209
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,070
<i>We don't know where he got off
or where he went.</i>

210
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,160
Check the CCTV footage
of every metropolitan subway station.

211
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,370
And have the control center and run
a face-recognition program at every gate.

212
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,710
The special team will check the CCTV
footage too, so let's find him first.

213
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,710
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

214
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,730
<i>It seems that
the old lady is only injured.</i>

215
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,490
<i>What time did you see
the ambulance at the scene?</i>

216
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,660
Please stop here.

217

RUSTIC HANDMADE KALGUKSU

218
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,440
Jeez. How could
something like this happen?

219
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,770
Wait a minute.
I've seen you somewhere.

220
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,860
Oh, you're the one who lied
about being the old lady's daughter.

221
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,950
I guess you can still see
with those tiny eyes.

222
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,490
If I can't see them,
they're not eyes but just holes.

223
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,370
Two people were stretchered off
from this narrow street.

224
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,450
And this young lady was dragged away.

225
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,120
Even a blind person would've seen that.

226
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,830
Two? Two people were stretchered off?

227
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,380
So how's the old lady?

228
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,010
Fortunately, she just got some stitches.

229
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,920
Were they both carried
out of this building?

230
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,430
- Yes.
- No, they weren't.

231
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,760
The one carried out of here
was the lady.

232
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,560
The other one was
carried from back there.

233
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,480
- Were they?
- How could you not remember?

234
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,850
That barbecue place.

235
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:52,110
The cops went up and down the stairs
the whole time.

236
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,650
They thought the staircase
would crumble.

237
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,240
Was someone carried on a stretcher
from behind the building too?

238
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,370
- Did you see a person on it?
- No, I didn't.

239
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,250
Did you?

240
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,500
No, I didn't see a person.

241
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,220
Then who got hurt
other than the restaurant lady?

242
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,640
Does that person live in this alley?

243
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,930
What the hell? Do you hope that
it was someone from this neighborhood?

244
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,520
- Where did the ambulances go?
- Where else?

245
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,640
A hospital, of course.

246
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,810
Which hospitals? Which way did they go?

247
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,400
Well, I think they both went this way.

248
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,980
What are you talking about?

249
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,690
They all went in different directions.

250
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,360
This way.

251
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,070
And that way. They split up
and went in different directions.

252
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,410
Jeez.

253
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,470
Have you ever seen a ghost
get caught on CCTV?

254
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,270
Jeez, this is no different
from physical labor.

255
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,480
Company work is supposed
to be repetitive and laborious.

256
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,020
We'll be doing this
for another 20 years.

Look at this.

How is it?

00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,470
I thought I saw you here yesterday too.

Never mind.

279
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,280
What was that?

280
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,100
Yes, around 7:40 p.m. last night.

281
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,900
Okay. Saint Family Hospital

<i>There is a reason for it.</i>

00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:01,260
Mido Maritime Police wants to expand
their forensic investigation team.

290
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,300
<i>All we can say is that,</i>

291
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,430
if you keep acting
independently like this,

292
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,600
you'll be removed from your duties.

293
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,100
From all your duties, I mean.

294
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,190
Criminals keep dumping evidence
into the sea,

295
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,690
so they want to expand
their underwater forensic team.

296

Who gave the order?

297

Don't make it worse.

301
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,290
I don't know what's going on,

302
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,670
but I've never seen anyone getting away
with posting online complaints.

303
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,840
It'll only work against you.

306
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,070
I've always put it off.

307
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,660
I'll take some time off.

308
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,450
Sure.

309
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,410
You need time to pack.

310
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,750
I do.

311
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,640
Hey. Why are you taking those?

312
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,350
I bought these with my money.
I've been buying them all this time.

313
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,100
You didn't know, did you?

314
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,150
Who's going to refill them now?

315
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,410
I'm not saying my team
must take the lead in everything.

316
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,490
If you at least share and discuss with us
how the special agent was injured

317
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,660
and what the situation was,

318
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,790
<i>we wouldn't be having trouble
working together like now.</i>

319
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,710
<i>The special team at the scene, us here,</i>

320
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,090
and Grid Control Team.
We're all fighting separately.

321
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:02,210
<i>What we do for confidentiality
makes everything inefficient.</i>

322
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,840
Can't you see the special team is
hardly living up to its name?

323
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,680
It's how it's always been.

324
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:11,970
- And you've been doing well so far...
- That's because nothing big happened.

325
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,640
As the Director,
you should be different.

326
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,190
The Ghost started to appear
while you were in that position.

327
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,600
Aren't you going to catch her?

328
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,650
Isn't it because
you want to see to the end of it

329
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,110
while still in your position?

330
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:26,110
We must see it end. We've been
waiting for this chance for decades.

331
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,240
That's right.
I can't criticize you for that.

332
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,080
We both have questions to ask her
when we meet her in person.

333
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,790
And you'll find out

334
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,920
<i>if she's caught. To do so, first...</i>

335
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,250
We never know when lunatics will pop up,

336
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,670
so security is paramount.

337
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,220
Weren't you the one who said this to me
when I was appointed as director?

338
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,890
If there's a lunatic,
we'll catch him too.

339
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,810
I see.

340
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,610
If I meet the founder of the Grid?

341
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,440
Then I've got to ask this question.

342
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,950
<i>"How is time travel possible?"</i>

343
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,280
"What's the future of mankind?" And...

344
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,200
And?

345
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,080
"Why did she have to kill the janitor?"

346
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,670
What was the point?

347
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,920
Right.

348
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,960
That's exactly...

349
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,050
Let's think it over.

350
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,180
I know you're doing this because you
have as many questions as I do.

351
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,230
Please think it over.

352
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,730
Why?

353
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,820
A researcher could've served useful.

354
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,740
But why...

355
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,500
Hello?

356
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,960
Is anyone there?

357
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,210
Hello?

358
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,750
Are you okay?

359
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,800
Are you hurt?

360
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,760
They must be here.

361
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,430
You saw it, right?

362
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:23,100
Can you tell me
what happened to your dad?

363
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,390
<i>His name was...</i>

364
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:57,180
Lee...

365
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,480
It was Lee something.

366
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,020
Gosh.

367
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,690
Even if you're a police officer,

368
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,570
I'm not allowed to talk
about patients' conditions.

369
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:13,700
He's involved in the case.
We need to know how he is...

370
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,120
I know what you mean.

371
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:19,040
But his guardian specifically told us
not to tell anyone about him.

372
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,450
What guardian?

373
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,210
His family?

374
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,920
Or the Administration Bureau?

375
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,880
I guess it is.

376
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,260
It's the AB who told you
not to tell anyone about him, right?

377
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,970
I told you to stop doing this.

378
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,610
- It's fine. I'll take care of this.
- Okay.

379
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:52,690
I told you he already left the hospital.
Stop bugging the doctor.

380
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,990
I'm sorry.

381
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:06,370
Did you hear that
from the information desk downstairs?

382
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,210
Could it be true?

383
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:15,680
Why did you come here?
I thought you'd go to another hospital.

384
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,430
- I already did.
- Did you see the restaurant owner?

385
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,390
What did she say?

386
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,810
She was so traumatized,
I'm going to ask her again later.

387
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,150
Wait a minute.

388
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,780
The one hospitalized here
is one of your soldiers, right?

389
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,610
One of those who staked out there.

390
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,950
I don't know either. I'll go find out.

391
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,210
Even without your request,
we never disclose our patient information.

392
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,420
I'm relieved.

393
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,340
Some people just tell everything
even with our request.

394
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,760
At another hospital, though.

395
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,680
By any chance, our soldier...

396
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,890
No, I mean our patient.

397
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:07,100
Do you have any idea
what he was attacked with?

398
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,190
No. It's something you should find out.

399
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,480
That's right.

400
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,490
But this case is quite...

401
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,700
<i>I've never seen such a corpse before.</i>

402
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:26,200
<i>His organs seemed as if they were
damaged by something electrical.</i>

403
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,790
Doesn't it seem...

404
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:31,710
as if he was electrocuted?

405
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,260
And his organs have been damaged?

406
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,010
How did you know?

407
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:46,310
One of my team members said he heard it
from a doctor here. Aren't you the doctor?

408
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,600
Yes, I am.

409
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,440
Uh...

410
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:54,650
Well... It does seem that
he was exposed to excessive heat.

411
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,820
But I have no idea how.

412
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,900
It's one of the special agents
who was injured.

413
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,230
And he was already discharged.

414
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,990
- I guess he isn't seriously injured.
- He was slightly burned.

415
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,160
- The back of his neck?
- Yes.

416
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,950
Someone who can burn
a special agent's neck?

417
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,250
It must've been her.

418
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,750
Then they lost her.

419
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,680
Why is it only a slight burn?

420
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,640
She burned someone
to death 24 years ago.

421
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,310
Shouldn't the question be the other way?

422
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,320
She could've burned him slightly.

423
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,320
But why did she go
all the way back then?

424
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,200
Maybe she's sick of the smell now.

425
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,700
By the way, how did you
find out it was this hospital?

426
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,040
I asked emergency services.

427
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,210
I asked them where the ambulance
went from that alley.

428
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,920
You found that out
with a single phone call?

429
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,260
Isn't that how you found out, too?

430
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,300
Well, kind of.

431
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,690
When did you find out
that two people were attacked?

432
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,360
While I was at work.

433
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,320
But I couldn't tell
outsiders about it, so...

434
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,740
I wasn't blaming you
for not sharing the information.

435
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:17,670
You told me how the old lady was
when you didn't have to.

436
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:23,460
What about you? How did you find out
that there were two injured people?

437
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,970
I went to the scene this morning
and heard about it.

438
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,800
You went there again?

439
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,310
You'll be punished
if you keep on doing that. Seriously.

440
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,440
Was I supposed to leave this there?
Shouldn't I have gone to get it?

441
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:50,660
You should go back.
Your lunch break must've already ended.

442
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,670
Kim Manok

443
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,130
appeared at a subway station last night,

444
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,470
though he disappeared again somewhere
between Songje Station and Gudong Station

445
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,510
around 7:30 p.m.

446
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,020
Did anyone see him disappear?

447
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,060
So far, you are the only one

448
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,560
who's witnessed that moment.

449
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,360
Right.

450
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,660
Why is that?

451
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,470
<i>So your name was Lee Siwon.</i>

452
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:57,810
<i>Are you dead?</i>

453
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,690
<i>He's been declared dead.</i>

454
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:05,900
Let's see.

455
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,690
The person you're looking for...

456
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,910
he's been declared dead.

457
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:16,330
No, not the one who died in 1997.
I'm looking for his son.

458
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:22,500
Yes, the one who died in 1997 is
Mr. Lee Janghyeok, the father.

459
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,800
And Mr. Lee Siwon, the son,
also died in 2015.

460
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,420
NAME: LEE SIWON
STATUS: DECEASED

461
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,130
He wasn't his biological son.

462
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:32,890
Who?

463
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:46,440
<i>Mr. Lee Janghyeok adopted Mr. Lee Siwon
in 1992 when he was one year old.</i>

464
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:04,580
<i>And Mr. Lee Janghyeok
died on May 18, 1997.</i>

465
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:08,170
But his adopted son also died in 2015?

466
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,420
He could have died before that.

467
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:14,260
The authority reported him dead.

468
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:18,260
It seems it's because
they couldn't reach him

469
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:21,060
when he reached the age
to enter the military.

470
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,100
They do that when the person's place
of residence is not registered.

471
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,610
If that was the case,

472
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,530
you don't know whether he is dead or not.
He was just reported dead.

473
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,280
That's possible too.

474
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,490
Why don't you look for his mother?

475
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:43,160
She's his stepmother,
but it says she's still alive.

476
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,760
<i>He said he'd starve all day at home
since there was no one to look after him.</i>

477
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:58,300
<i>Mr. Lee practically begged me
to let him in, so...</i>

478
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,640
An adopted child
who had no one to look after him.

479
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:04,890
All biological parents are dead.

JUNG SAEBYEOK
TRANSFER TO JEONAM PROVINCE

485
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,260
Hello.

486
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,350
<i>Detective. Later tonight...</i>

487
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:34,530
<i>Where are you?</i>

488
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:36,740
I am...

489
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,570
By the way, what's up?

490
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,700
Can I talk to you later tonight?

491
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,950
<i>If you have time.</i>

492
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:44,950
I have a lot of time now.

493
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,080
Okay.

494
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,170
Bye.

495
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,340
<i>Maybe she's sick of the smell now.</i>

496
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,590
What smell?

497
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,260
The smell of burning flesh.

498
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,350
All the information about her is
on the 13th floor of my office building.

499
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,260
You just need to help me get in there.

500
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:06,810
You can kill me later.

501
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,810
<i>You can shoot me.</i>

502
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,690
I don't care.

Hi, it's me.

505
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:32,710
By any chance,
can you stay longer tonight?

506
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,300
Oh, you can't.

507
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:38,970
Then...

508
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,470
Pardon?

509
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:44,050

His last name isn't Kim.

RIGHTEOUS AND RELIABLE SONGJE POLICE

516
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:23,990
What was she like?

517
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:25,950
What?

518
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,870
You saw her.
The woman we're looking for.

519
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,950
You saw her vanish.

520
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,670
That's what you're curious about.

521
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:44,920
I thought you might have
turned this place upside down.

522
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,010
You must've learned
to control your temper.

523
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,850
Are you here to tell me
I used to have a nasty temper?

524
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:52,390
No, what I mean is...

525
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,730
Are you going to
the place you're assigned to?

526
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,400
What's the point of
turning this place upside down?

527
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,740
The heart of the problem lies elsewhere.

528
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,050
We like working in the provinces.

529
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,640
They're planning to expand
their underwater forensic team.

530
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,720
If I go become an expert,
I can go abroad for training too.

531
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:41,190
<i>Something came up,
so I can't make it. I'm sorry.</i>

532
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,860
My transfer isn't so bad.

533
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:50,200
You must've already made up your mind.

534
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,370
If you say so, fine.

535
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,040
What about you?

536
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:58,160
Why are you working there?

537
00:49:58,250 --> 00:49:59,710
I've always been working at the AB.

538
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:00,830
No, I mean your team.

539
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:04,340
You were glad about being
assigned to the Grid Control Team.

540
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,670
So why...

541
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,340
did you move to the current team?

542
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,310
Well...

543
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:16,850
It just happened.

544
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:21,350
- I'm not here to...
- To talk about yourself?

545
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,940
Why are you here then?

546
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,980
You don't say anything about yourself.

547
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:28,820
And you get annoyed when I ask.

548
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:32,490
Forget it. I don't need your advice.

549
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:34,200
I'm not here to give you advice.

550
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,830
I'm in no position to.

551
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:37,700
- I'm the one who...
- The one who what?

552
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,540
Forget it.

553
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:52,760
If it were the old days,

554
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,350
I would've asked you what

555
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:58,100
when you talked like that.

556
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,770
Because I'd be worried if you were okay.

557
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,360
Then you would frown and say,

558
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,490
"It's nothing, so don't worry."
And you'd go into your room.

559
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,410
I won't ask anymore.

560
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,920
Why didn't you just leave things be?

561
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,170
Then this wouldn't have happened.

562
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,800
I decided to leave you be,
but I can't do that with my job.

Excuse me.

565
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,350
Are you from the nursing service?

566
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,110
Was everything okay?

567
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:34,900
Yes. You're home
earlier than I expected.

568
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,360
Yes, a little.

569
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,410
Thank you. You may leave.

570
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:54,550
Goodbye.
