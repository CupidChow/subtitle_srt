00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,730
Show me the footage of my office.

10
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,690
From five minutes ago.

11
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,240
Did I miss something?

12
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,640
The corridor too, right?

13
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,950
I guess your subordinates
wash that for you too.

14
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,920
<i>I was emptying your trash can
and thought I could wash this too.</i>

I apologize. I won't touch
anything in this room again.

and the last place he lived...

00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,320
- And his orphanage.
- Can you go there? The orphanage?

Hello? Jung Saebyeok speaking.

22
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,620
Pardon?

23
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,300
IT'S ME, SONG

24
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,370
You're the only person who can make this for me.
You specialize in biopsy evidence.

25
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,380
My phone number that I never gave you,
and even my work experience.

26
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,210
What else do you know?

27
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,220
If you help me, I'll share every piece
of information I get with this.

28
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,390
It's illegal.

29
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,510
No, it's not.

30
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,310
It's just one of my company's bylaws.

31
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,560
We're not allowed
to enter the 13th floor,

32
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,900
but that's just a line drawn by
my higher-ups to monopolize information.

33
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,310
You're not obliged to follow that.

34
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,980
To lift the fingerprints,
I need to use the equipment in here.

35
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,280
And that's illegal.
Using it for personal reasons.

36
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,410
But it's to catch the accomplice.

37
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,820
What if you find the murderer,

38
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,990
but she shows up,
helps him flee, and disappears again?

39
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,410
What are you going to do then?

40
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,460
All the information about her is
on the 13th floor of my office building.

41
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,040
You just need to help me get in there.

42
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,670
- You told me to stay out of it.
- That didn't stop you yesterday.

43
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,010
What's your name?

44
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,590
I'm sorry.

45
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,430
I'm Kim Saeha.

Mr. Kim Saeha.

47
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,310
It doesn't seem
you're doing this out of curiosity.

48
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,810
Seeing how you're desperate
to enter the 13th floor,

49
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,610
I don't think it's because you're
pissed off by the line they drew.

50
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,860
You won't help me unless
you're convinced why I'm doing this?

51
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,280
Who said I'd help you?

52
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,620
You promised me to let me in on it.

53
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,910
If you betray me,

54
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,500
I'll go talk to your boss.

55
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,080
Sure.

56
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,420
How long will it take?

57
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,270

How are these so clear?

76
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,350

How did you get the value
of the thickness?

79
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,270
That's always the hardest part.

80
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,560
If it's thick, it's stable,
but it's unrecognizable

81
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,940
because electrical currents
can't pass through it.

82
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,730
To make it stick to the skin and
for electrical current to pass through it...

83
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,400
Wait. You know
about the thickness setting?

84
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,580
You've tried it yourself, haven't you?

85
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,620
You've tried forging
a fingerprint before.

00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,670

88
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,130
Let go of me.

89
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,340
You can kill me later.

- Please help me.

91

Yes.

93
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,100
I have tried to make it myself.

94
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,310
But I failed every time,
so I couldn't try it at work.

95
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,520
If you make it for me
and I use it for some other purpose,

96
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,940
you can shoot me. I don't care.

97
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,740
What would you say
if I asked why you're doing this?

98
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,910
You don't care why I'm doing this.

99

So I'm to snitch on you to her

I guess the AB is

116
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,870
But we must catch

If she really is his accomplice.

118
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,450
You guys are the opposite of us.

119
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,790
We tried to get the accomplice
in order to get the culprit.

120
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,630
You tried to catch the one
who would disappear in a flash?

121
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,760
Your colleagues
didn't believe you, right?

122
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,350
I should've listened to Captain and
not mentioned the woman in the report.

123
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,640
Then I wouldn't have found out.

124
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,240
Done.

125
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,750

to keep him only in the storage room.</i>

163
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,500
<i>So I let the kid in.</i>

164
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,880
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

165
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,380
<i>I came out when my weekend shift ended,</i>

166
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:12,890
<i>and I saw a man on the ground
and a child next to him.</i>

167
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,810
Ms. Choi.

168
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,310
<i> It was one of our janitors.</i>

169
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,360
<i>His body was burned black,
and it also reeked.</i>

170
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,570
<i>After calling for emergency services...</i>

171
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,570
<i> The child...</i>

172
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,160
<i>I didn't know the kid,
but he seemed so shocked,</i>

173
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,660
<i>so I stayed with him in the lobby
until an ambulance came.</i>

174
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,460
<i>That's all I saw.</i>

175
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,250
<i> I didn't see any woman.</i>

176
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,960
<i> I didn't even know something like that
had happened in the laboratory building.</i>

177
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:55,560
<i> I don't know... how it happened.</i>

178
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:02,560
<i> We came after we got a report, and...</i>

179
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:05,480
<i> I arrived first and went to the lobby.</i>

180
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,280
<i>He seemed to have died on the spot.</i>

181
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,570
<i> His heart had already stopped,</i>

182
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,740
<i>and I could still smell the burnt flesh.</i>

183
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,410
<i> Sorry?</i>

184
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,960
<i> No. The female staff member
was the only woman I saw.</i>

185
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,880
<i> The lady who was with the child.</i>

186
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,380
<i> We didn't think it would be right</i>

187
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,380
<i>to have the child in the same ambulance
as his father's body,</i>

188
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,180
<i>so we were going to call
another ambulance.</i>

189
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,770
<i> But she said it would still be the same
as going with the dead body</i>

190
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:44,690
<i>and offered to take the child
to the hospital herself.</i>

191
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,940
<i>And after that...</i>

192
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,650
<i> Well, that's about it
since the child's father was dead.</i>

193
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,660
No.

194
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,120
That's not all.

195
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,260
<i>And the person
who just called was Eojin.</i>

196
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,250
CALLS

197
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,150
INVESTIGATOR JUNG SAEBYEOK

198
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,140
I'm sorry for making you come here.

199
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,850
Whatever.

200
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,320
Let's go over there.

201
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,660
COMMUNITY CENTER

202
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,440
GERMANY, US, HONG KONG,
AUSTRALIA, RUSSIA, SPAIN

203
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,900
Is this it?

204
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,400
Yes.

205
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,070
Wait, the time differences are...

206
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,530
They're all around the same time.

207
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,620
It was Sunday, May 18, 1997 in Korea.

208
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,330
From 8:58 p.m. to 9:05 p.m.

209
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,800
Europe, Korea and even Australia?

210
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,970
She appeared in all those places
in ten minutes on the same day?

211
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,180
Not even Santa Claus
could travel that fast.

212
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,760
She probably killed someone
because she isn't Santa Claus.

213
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,260
Do you recognize her?

214
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,680
Sorry?

215
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,890
The person who disappeared
right before your eyes.

216
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,100
Is it her?

217
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,440
Or is it not?

218
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,150
No?

219
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,780
Are you asking me if the person

220
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:07,580
caught on camera in 1997
is the same person I saw a few days ago?

221
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,830
Is it her?

222
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,420
She looks like her.

223
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,500
I could say they're the same person.

224
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,550
She travels from continent to continent
in a few minutes.

225
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,010
And she hasn't aged at all

226
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,810
for over 20 years.

227
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,520
Her appearance...

228
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,560
By any chance, did she have a weapon
in her hand when she attacked you too?

229
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,400
What kind of weapon is that?

230
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,360
Burning a person in only a few seconds?

231
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,530
We must catch her before she
does something like that again.

232
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,950
Consider yourself lucky
because she didn't do that to you.

233
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,540
If she did, you wouldn't be here now.

234
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,460
You know about the weapon, don't you?
What is it made of?

235
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,830
I don't know either.

236
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:02,210
Though I heard
he seemed to have been electrocuted.

237
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,180
Something like this?

238
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,440
She used it on you too?

239
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,650
But how...

240
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,270
How am I still alive?

241
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,780
I don't know.

242
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,240
It happened so quickly.

243
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,240
I didn't even know I got this wound.
Maybe that's why.

244
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,790
Because it touched my arm only briefly?

245
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,620
But wasn't it hot?

246
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,960
Or didn't it feel weird
when it touched you?

247
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,250
No.

248
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,340
She only went to labs
and engineering colleges.

249
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,590
What did she do in those places?

250
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,510
She seemed to be
operating some machines.

251
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,640
She set up the Grid.

252
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,310
That's when the
project started. In 1997.

253
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,520
This woman started the Grid project?

254
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,230
"What did this person do here?"

255
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,820
That question was the beginning.

256
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,400
That's how they learned
that it was possible

257
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,360
to build a magnetic field shield.

258
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,240
If it weren't for her...

259
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,700
Then we wouldn't be here now.

260
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,830
The earth was covered
with the Grid in 2004.

261
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,960
The sunspots exploded
right after the Grid was complete.

262
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:21,380
They say if the solar wind
had come a year earlier,

263
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,210
two-thirds of mankind would have died.

264
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,720
The Grid is even in textbooks
as the greatest achievement of mankind.

265
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,470
But...

266
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:32,350
"But that was actually done by a murderer
who burned a man to death right

267
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,430
before his child's eyes."

268
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,390
They can't put that in the textbooks.

269
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,900
I saw her with my own eyes.

270
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,820
But I feel like a fool to believe it.

271
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:52,700
Wait, she came to save mankind.
Why did she murder a person then?

272
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,330
It wasn't accidental.
She definitely planned it.

273
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,540
And why did she
show up again after 24 years

274
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,040
only to help
the convenience store murderer?

275
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,970
I'm sorry,
but I can't stay out for a long time.

276
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,980
<i>You can kill me later.</i>

277
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,110
If you make it for me
and I use it for some other purpose,

278
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,610
you can shoot me. I don't care.

279
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,740
Who's the man that was killed?

280
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,540
An employee.

281
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,170
A janitor
of the Institute of Radio Research.

282
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,770
She isn't just any woman.
She's our savior.

283
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,730
If we were directly exposed
to the solar wind,

284
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,900
we would have all
been destroyed by radiation.

285
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,660
Why don't you tell the bereaved
of the convenience store owner?

286
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,830
That she's our savior even though she
helped the person who killed your dad.

287
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,500
Why did he bring him to his workplace?

288
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,550
He looked like his son.

289
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,880
I guess there was no one else
to look after him.

290
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,850
Did the janitor try to stop her
from building the Grid?

291
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,350
If that was the case,
for the sake of humanity—

292
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,440
It's okay to kill a person?

293
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,190
Why are you so serious?

294
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,230
I was only guessing why.

295
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,690
Just don't say things
that would make me serious.

296
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,210
Bye.

297
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,300
He must be completely
whipped by his wife.

298
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,730
Hello?

299
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,740
<i>Why did she do that
when she had such abilities?</i>

300
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,780
What do you mean?

301
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,950
<i>Why did
she show up in front of me?</i>

302
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:46,750
If she has the ability
to travel through time and space,

303
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,460
she could've just told the culprit,

304
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:53,000
"Detectives are coming,
so run that way."

305
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,880
And then she could've
left the place too.

306
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,090
Don't you think?

307
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,310
Then I wouldn't have learned of
her existence in the first place.

308
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,190
Wouldn't that have been easier for her?

309
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,020
Why did she attack me?

310
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:16,110
She can just disappear
whenever she wants,

311
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,160
so she doesn't mind being seen?

312
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,950
Would that be it?

313
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,420
We have questions but no answers.

314
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,130
<i>All right.</i>

315
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,580
A Coast, clear.

316

00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,710
Goodness. What a lucky day.

321
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:37,750
All the customers paid in cash,
and not by credit card.

323
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:36,980
<i>Beta appeared.</i>

324
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,480
<i>Beta appeared in F Coast.</i>

325
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,240
What about Alpha?

326
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,110
<i>We don't see Alpha.
Beta's alone. Do we go in?</i>

327
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,040
<i>Do we go in?</i>

328
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,160
Wait until Alpha appears.

329
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,890
- Ma'am.
- Oh, no!

330
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,310
Ma'am.

332
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,860
<i>Give us a signal.
Do we go in?</i>

333
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,360
I told you to wait.

334
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,360
Any signs of Alpha?

335
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:11,570
No, sir. We don't see her.

336
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,280
Major, but...

337
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:18,710
Major.

338
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,290
Go in.

339
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,970
<i>I did hear some sounds.</i>

340
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,220
<i>But what if it's not him?</i>

341
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,810
<i>I don't want to cause you
any inconvenience.</i>

342
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,080
<i>He's moving towards C Coast.</i>

343
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,970
<i>He just passed
through the alley behind the motels.</i>

344
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:14,340
<i>He's running towards
the large grocery store straight ahead.</i>

345
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,050
The subway station?

346
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,310
Keep a close distance.

347
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,060
- To the subway station.
- Yes, sir.

348
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:11,690
<i>The train for Namyangsan
is now approaching.</i>

349
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,490
<i>The train is now approaching.</i>

350
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:17,740
<i>Please take a step backward.</i>

351
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,200
He got on the northbound train.
Did you find him?

352
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:25,580
Do you see Beta? Did you lose him?

353
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:29,790
They hopped on the subway

354
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,130
and are on their way to the car
where Beta is in.

355
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,630
We need to get to the next station first
and join them.

356
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:03,950
Beta is right in front of you guys.
Do you see him?

357
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:28,640
Cameras.

358
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:40,990
C1. At eleven o'clock.

359
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,700
<i>C2. At two o'clock.</i>

360
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,830
C3. Walk two meters forward.

361
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,540
<i>C4. Stay where you are.</i>

362
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,720
<i>Presumably in her late 20s or 30s.</i>

363
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:05,010
<i>Alpha's height is between
165 and 170 centimeters.</i>

364
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,100
<i>It's highly likely that she's armed.</i>

365
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,260
<i>The next station is Gudong.</i>

366
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,260
<i>The doors are on your right.</i>

367
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,740
Beta is right in front of you guys.
Do you see him?

368
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:32,540
I don't see him yet...

369
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:39,130
<i>C1.</i>

370
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:40,540
C1. What's wrong?

371
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,670
<i>The next station is Gudong.
The doors are on your right.</i>

372
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:51,510
<i>He's still on the train.</i>

373
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,100
<i>Get him before the next stop!</i>

374
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,440
Open this.

375
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,570
Open it!

376
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:35,120
Hey!

377
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,330
I'll kill you when I get you.

378
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:46,000
I swear I'll kill you!

379
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,460
Open it!

380
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,430
Open it right now!

381
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,390
Open it!

382
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:21,370
Open this! Open it right now!

383
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,710
Hey!

384
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,380
There's a person locked up in here!

385
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,170
Help!

386
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:33,050
Help!
