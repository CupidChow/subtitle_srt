This smells amazing.

11
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,110
Stop buying them.

12
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,320
- What?
- Games.

13
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,450
You didn't buy them.
I bought them with my own money.

14
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,410
That's why.
You can't save money that way.

15
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,990
Can I if I don't buy games?

16
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,540
When will you buy a house like that?

You sound like you own a house yourself.

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,960
What will you do if I want to split
the deposit money and live on my own?

00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,590
Come on, you're crossing the line.

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,600
Here. Chicken, your favorite.

Eat up and live a long life. All right?

23
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,320
And try not to eat late at night.
You always go to bed right after you eat.

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,820
Oh, Mother. When did you get here?

25
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,030
Look at the grease
floating here.

26
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,530
Is this an oil field or what?

27
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,620
That's the miracle
of creating something out of nothing.

28
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,420
<i>If you keep acting
independently like this,</i>

29
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,840
<i>you'll be removed from your duties.</i>

30
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,680
<i>From all your duties, I mean.</i>

31
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,520
I told you to keep the lid down!

32
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,020
Keep the volume down.

33
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,780
Jeez.

34
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,210
Darn it.

35
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,610
Can you talk now?

36
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,900
How are you?

37
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,990
Are you okay?

38
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,910
Word travels fast. I guess you heard
that I'm going to a good place.

39
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,500
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,670
<i>If you're really sorry,</i>

41
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,380
<i>give me the latest information
you've got.</i>

42
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,340
The latest information?

43
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,670
<i>Anything about Kim Manok</i>

44
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,920
or the woman.

45
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,260
I'll catch those punks and make a deal
with the Administration Bureau.

46
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,310
<i>It doesn't matter to you
who catches them first, does it?</i>

47
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,230
What makes you think so?

48
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,190
<i>What matters to you is that
they get caught.</i>

49
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,690
Am I wrong?

50
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,450
Have you ever seen a ghost
caught on camera?

51
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,360
<i>Do you know what we do these days?</i>

52
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,620
<i>Since Kim Manok vanished
from the subway,</i>

53
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,540
<i>we're going through every surveillance
footage from every station.</i>

54
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,290
<i>But that's to no avail.</i>

55
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,500
<i>There's no way she was caught on camera.</i>

56
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,380
<i>Vanishing into thin air
is a piece of cake to her.</i>

57
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,500
<i>What about Kim Manok?</i>

58
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,590
<i>He was only seen
getting on the subway.</i>

59
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,340
<i>It's an old subway line,
so there are no cameras on the train.</i>

63
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,980
What do you mean?

64
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,240
Her DNA is slightly out of alignment.

65
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,120
To be precise, there's something wrong
with the enzymes binding her DNA strands.

66
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,200
These enzymes need to function
for DNA strands to keep its structure.

67
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,250
What?

68
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,710
Simply put,

69
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,290
it's not possible for living things
to be like that,

70
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,750
<i>biologically.</i>

71
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,760
Are you saying she's really a ghost?

72
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,260
<i>No, I hope not.
That'd be too scary.</i>

73
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,220
Sorry?

74
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,640
I mean...

75
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,010
What I mean is,

76
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
there must be an abnormal cause
for that to have happened.

77
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,020
What's most abnormal about her?

78
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,320
Do you mean her DNA abnormalities
were caused by teleportation?

79
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,900
If that's the case, teleportation may
not be as easy for her as we thought.

80
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,200
It might cause her pain or exhaustion.

81
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,330
I hope you're right, but...

82
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,750
What? You don't think so?

83
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,540
If it caused her extreme pain,
wouldn't she be refrain from teleporting?

84
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,590
You said you wondered

85
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,550
why she disappeared before your eyes

86
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,420
instead of fleeing with the culprit
beforehand?

87
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,300
The fact that she used her ability
when it wasn't necessary...

88
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,270
<i>Maybe it's not a big obstacle
for her.</i>

89
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,890
<i>Gosh, then there's really no clue.</i>

90
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,940
No.

91
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,020
<i>People around Kim Manok
don't know anything either.</i>

92
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,400
What people around him?

93
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,610
I went to the construction site
he last worked

94
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,240
and where he last lived.

95
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,490
No one knows anything, right?
We went there too.

96
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,990
Nothing at all.

97
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,370
I went there for nothing.

98
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,330
By the way, did you learn
about her DNA abnormalities

99
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,040
from the NFS analysis report?
You said you didn't read it then.

100
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,170
What if I did?

101
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,510
Darn it.

102
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,180
- What if I read it?
- Gosh.

103
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,640
What are you going to do?

104
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,970
Jeez, who is she nagging this time?

105
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,350
You won't tell
Eojin about this, will you?

106
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,270
Eojin?

107
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,360
Anyway, I hope you're right
about her DNA.

108
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,990
Then we can take advantage
of her weakness.

109
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,490
Who knows?

110
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,240
Maybe your guess is right.

111
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,950
It may have nothing to do
with her ability.

112
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,580
Who is she talking to? What ability?

113
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,040
Forget how difficult it is
to deal with her.

114
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,290
I've only seen her once,
so I have nothing to go on.

115
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,420
I'll call you if I find anything
in the footage.

116
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,510
Don't get your hopes up though.

117
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,510
I will.

118
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,140
I'll have high hopes.

119
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,550
- Don't forget to call me.
- Jeez.

120
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,600
She's so clingy, isn't she?

121
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Okay. Bye.

122
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:58,400
I guess she's seeing someone,
but his parents don't approve of her.

123
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,980
Jeez.

124
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,070
Is that why she brought up the deposit?

125
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,490
Gosh, I don't have any money.

126
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,920
What should I do?

127
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,930
We checked all the CCTV footage from
inside and outside every subway station.

128
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,810
But he wasn't caught leaving anywhere.

129
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,310
Darn it.

130
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,850
To be honest, the way we work is

131
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,150
a little old-fashioned
and inefficient, isn't it?

132
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,440
Ms. Chae, you must know a cutting-edge
and efficient way to find him.

133
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,740
Please tell us.

134
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,450
Maybe we should change the way
we approach this, not the way we work.

135
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,120
- Like...
- For example,

136
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,120
if subway surveillance cameras
can't capture her,

137
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,540
we should make
the whole nation look for her.

138
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,630
Are you saying we should
put out an open APB for her?

139
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,880
No matter her abilities,

140
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,880
as long as she's a human,
she must eat and sleep.

141
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,840
She'll have to come in contact
with someone eventually.

142
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,010
Even if she does,
would people recognize her?

143
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,760
We don't even know our neighbors' faces.

144
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,180
We must make people recognize her.

145
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,640
We must make all 50 million people
in this country look for her.

146
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,020
She won't be able to escape that.

147
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,770
What if people get hurt?
She is currently protecting a murderer.

148
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,610
If an ordinary civilian
tries to report her,

149
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,110
will she let them do it?

150
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,820
She might appear and snap their neck.

151
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,570
It's like we're hopping on the ground,
trying to catch a bird flying in the sky.

152
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,570
We need to approach it
in a different way.

153
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:37,080
What I meant to say is not
that we should make citizens do our job.

154
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,500
What do you suggest then?

155
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,920
We announce that the Grid broke down
and it'll collapse soon.

156
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,380
Are you out of your mind?

157
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,170
The Ghost built the Grid.

158
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,420
She built it herself using the technology
that didn't even exist back then.

159
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,140
If she hears that it's broken,
she'll try to fix it.

160
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,260
And she knows where to go to fix it.

161
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,520
So she'll come here?

162
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,480
Are you saying she'll voluntarily
come here to fix it?

163
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,980
Ms. Choi.

164
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,740
Director. Do you have time now?

165
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,240
Can we have a video conference?

166
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,240
Okay.

167
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,870
Mr. Kim.

168
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,880
<i>What is it?</i>

169
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,630
The Grid has broken twice since it was
reported that the Ghost reappeared.

170
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,340
<i>The Ghost must've seen it.
There's no way she could have missed it.</i>

171
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,860
<i>"The Grid is broken. The magnetic
fields can no longer protect the earth."</i>

172
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,950
EMERGENCY ALERT
COLLAPSE OF THE GRID, PLEASE EVACUATE

173
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,240
EMERGENCY ALERT

174
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,830
<i>Traveling through time
may be dangerous for the Ghost too.</i>

175
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,740
<i>But she still appeared in 1997.</i>

176
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,500
<i>I don't think the Grid is needed
only for people of the 21st century.</i>

177
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,250
<i>It must be needed
even in the future she came from.</i>

178
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,710
<i>But what if we say it's broken?</i>

179
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,550
<i>She's a being that can teleport.</i>

180
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,720
<i>It's impossible for us to find her
because there's no fixed positional value.</i>

181
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,430
<i>Instead of looking for her,
we should make her come to us.</i>

182
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,140
<i>That's easier said than done.</i>

183
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,100
It won't be easy
even if she really does come.

184
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,520
While we discuss possibilities
without giving it a try,

185
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,480
another 24 years will be wasted.

186
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,570
Well, let's say it does
make her come, Minister.

187
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,940
But to make that happen,

188
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,530
we need to make a fuss as if the Grid
would collapse any moment.

189
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,490
Have you thought through how chaotic
the whole country would become?

190
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,540
It will agitate people,

191
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,670
but the best in people
usually come out in times of crisis.

192
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,540
If it can be handled within a week,
it won't be that serious...

193
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,590
What about internationally, Minister?

194
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,510
What would other countries think of us?

195
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,430
They may think our technology is
so poor that we can't even

196
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,760
maintain the protective shield
over our own territory.

197
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,140
That'd be humiliating.
It'd completely hurt our country's image.

198
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,890
But if things go as planned,

199
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,110
it'll be the best year for the
Korean government in terms of diplomacy.

200
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,490
We'll be solving the biggest mystery
in modern human history.

201
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,780
No country has been able
to solve it for almost 30 years.

202
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,410
And the Korean government
will be solving it in 2021.

203
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:08,920
And what if we also find out how the woman
was able to bring the future technology

204
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,080
to the year of 1997,

205
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,040
and monopolize it?
What do you think will happen?

206
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,130
But...

207
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,970
if we fail?

208
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,310
A way to catch the woman without
bringing disgrace on our country?

209
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,850
There is.

210
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,400
We can offer a reward for her capture.

211
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,650
An amount that has
never been seen before.

212
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,110
We should reveal her face to the public
so anyone can recognize her.

213
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,450
Then, anyone who comes in contact
with her can report her.

214
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,660
Then a lot of women will suffer.

215
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,000
There are already tons of people
who would even chase murderers

216
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,910
if it could increase
the number of views.

217
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,580
We wouldn't be able to stop people

218
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,580
from harassing or secretly
photographing innocent women.

219
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,090
Then let's also offer a reward for the
convenience store murderer's capture.

220
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,840
Aren't they accomplices?

221
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,550
Call them a killer couple
and put them on the wanted list.

222
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,800
That's a good idea.

223
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,600
Why are they a killer couple?
Because they've already killed before.

224
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,480
Do you think they'll just let people
report them to the police?

225
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,150
Will she voluntarily come to us?

226
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,150
Or will we find her
by using all of our 50 million citizens?

227
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,280
We already know
which is more likely to happen.

228
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,570
We should try the more probable one.

229
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,740
If we corner her like that, she might
just go back to where she came from.

230
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,120
And if she flees, it's all over.
Do you want to wait another few decades?

231
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,830
Using the citizens is too risky.

232
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,170
If we announce the Grid is about
to collapse, the Grid Control Team...

233
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,210
will be the first to be held accountable.
Isn't that why you're against it?

234
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,640
If someone has to be held accountable,
it'll be the two of you.

235
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,970
Director and Deputy Director.

236
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,100
If we announce
that the Grid has broken down,

237
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,640
whatever the result is,

238
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,350
you'll have to apologize to the public
and step down.

239
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:58,610
The director can just
go back to teaching.

240
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,530
And the deputy director
who has devoted her life to this...

241
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,070
Why do you think I've devoted my life?

242
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,910
Whether I step down or apologize,
let me think about it later.

243
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,630
I think...

244
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,090
we need to find
a fundamental solution to this.

245
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,380
Go on.

246
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,350
To fight against someone
who travels through time,

247
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,810
we need a time machine as well.

248
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,810
I suggest that we start developing one.

249
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,230
Well, that's already
being taken care of.

250
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,440
What?

251
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,860
It's already being developed?

252
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:46,990
A time machine?

253
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,660
Where?

254
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,410
How can I work there?

255
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,540
What's your major?

256
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,090
My major? It's comparative literature.

257
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,470
Too bad. Everyone who works there
has a doctorate in engineering.

258
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,590
I agree that this is a big
opportunity for the country.

259
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,600
But the risks are...

260
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,640
Boy.

261
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,940
If they succeeded,
they should be here now.

262
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,400
Even if they succeeded in developing it
hundreds of years from now,

263
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,690
they developed it for this moment,
so they should be here right now.

264
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,900
If not, that means they failed.

265
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,700
And that suggests
you need more than engineers.

266
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,330
Ms. Chae Jongyi.

267
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,790
- Let's talk without your subordinates.
- Yes, sir.

268
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,880
Mr. Kim.

269
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,810
Putting them on the wanted list
will only make her more alert.

270
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,730
If you announce the Grid is broken
on top of that, would she buy that?

271
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,190
Then let's not say it's broken.

272
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,610
You two.

273
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,070
Jeez.

274
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,990
Do you think they're really
developing a time machine?

275
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,370
Or was he mocking me?

276
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,880
Is this...

277
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,380
really necessary?

278
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,310
OCTOBER 7, 2021
DONGSIN-RO 21-GIL

279
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,930
Major Im Jiyu.

280
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,310
Do you recognize this?

281
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,900
That's one of my agents.

282
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,030
It's a scar he got when he was hit
in the back of the neck by Alpha.

283
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,070
MAY 18, 1997
INSTITUTE OF RADIO RESEARCH

284
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,290
May 18, 1997. It's that day.

285
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:00,040
Both wounds were caused
by the same weapon.

286
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:06,170
This is the person who died in 1997?
At the Institute of Radio Research?

287
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,220
And this happened a few days ago?

288
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,470
Yes, what we've found out
about these scars so far

289
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,060
is that they were formed by electrical
stimulation through a superconductor.

290
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,600
It's absolutely impossible
with current technology, Minister.

291
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,190
Superconductors only work below -100°C.

292
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,110
A weapon? It's...

293
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,900
That's right. In other words,
the person the Secretariat calls the Ghost

294
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,280
and the Grid Control Team calls
the Founder is definitely that woman.

295
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,790
From 1997

296
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,540
until now, 2021.

297
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,580
Minister.

298
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:47,590
We've been waiting for this one person
for 24 years.

299
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,170
We mustn't lose her.

300
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,060
Let's go.

301
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,390
Where to, sir?

302
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,810
The Blue House.

303
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,480
The President should have the final say.

304
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,860
"It's been over 100 years...

305
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,610
Facing difficulty in utilizing...

306
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,450
In 2020...

307
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,320
Succeeded in developing..."

308
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,680
How is she these days?

309
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:26,190
There were times
when someone had to watch her 24/7

310
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,560
because she'd go into convulsions often.

311
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,730
But that no longer happens these days.

312
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,780
You didn't have to come back.

313
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:37,820
I know.

314
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,700
We've done everything we could.

315
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,450
The decision is now in their hands.

316
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,750
How did you figure out the connection
between the Ghost and the Grid?

317
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,670
We've never officially admitted it.

318
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,510
I've read
all the relevant research papers.

319
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,970
No research was conducted on it
before 1997.

320
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,470
The order should be a theory, research,

321
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,980
and then implementation.
But it was the opposite for the Grid.

322
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,480
The research papers started
to come out after 1997

323
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,230
when the Institute of Radio Research
was elevated to the AB.

324
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,150
And in the same year,
the Secretariat was founded.

325
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,410
That's when my seniors started
searching for an unidentified woman.

326
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,120
The keyword was teleportation.

327
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,160
I hate engineering majors.

328
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,120
I've always loathed them.

329
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,210
Since working at the IRR?

330
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
To the scientists there, we were nothing

331
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:38,380
but their private secretaries
who helped them with their taxes.

332
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,590
I'm sure
not all scientists were like that.

333
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,010
Maybe.

334
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,390
Actually, I didn't know many of them.

335
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,310
On the outside,
we seemed to be working as a team,

336
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,020
but the scientists in the research lab
and the administrative staff

337
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,650
worked in different buildings.

338
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,770
We even sat separately in the cafeteria.

339
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,320
You didn't know them very well then.

340
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,570
I'll get going.

341
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,210
Hello, Director.

342
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,260
CLOTHES FITTING AND REPAIR

343
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,390
I guess you've used it before.

344
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,440
- Three million won for ten.
- I brought the amount you asked for.

345
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,700
SINWOO BANK
BAE JUNHYUNG

346
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,910
It'll leave a transaction record.

347
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,990
It's your problem if you get caught.

348
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,120
You don't need bullets
if you're not going to fire it.

349
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,760
TRANSFER 3,000,000 WON?

350
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,010
TRANSFERRING

351
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,220
Okay...

352
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,620
Mom.

353
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,290
Mom.

354
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,430
Mom.

355
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,940
Mom...

356
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,420
Mom...

357
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,630
We're almost there, Mom.

358
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,180
Almost...

359
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,890
We need to move to a different office?

360
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,140
Gosh, that's ridiculous.

361
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,390
For real?

362
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,100
What's going on? Are we really moving?

363
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,950
Tell everyone in Planning, Finance,
and Data Processing

364
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,620
to work from home for now.

365
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,540
Only a skeleton staff will stay
in the building.

366
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,500
Yes, ma'am.

367
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,670
But our work can only be done
in the control room.

368
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,080
What are we supposed to do?

369
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:54,540
Say something abnormal has been detected
in the control room and shut it down.

370
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:58,090
Are you trying to break the Grid for real
like the rumor we'll spread?

371
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,130
What rumor?

372
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,350
Empty the office right now.

373
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,900
That little...

374
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,190
She must be enjoying this.

375
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,950
The teleportation device is the key.

376
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,460
Regardless of type or shape,
there must be some kind of device.

377
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,050
As soon as Alpha shows up,
you must take that device from her.

378
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,090
This isn't a tranquilizer gun.

379
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,380
Has the firearms ban been lifted?

380
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,800
Of course, capturing her alive
would be the best.

381
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,690
<i>It won't end
with just an injury this time.</i>

382
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,230
<i>As soon as she shows up,
shoot her in the hand.</i>

383
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,150
<i>Disarm her.</i>

384
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,360
If that fails,

385
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,110
kill her.

386
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,240
But orders to capture her...

387
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,330
Whether we lose everything or secure
at least her body and the device...

388
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,120
depends on you guys.

389
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,590
Yes, sir.

390
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,790
- Is it ready?
- <i>Yes, it's connected.</i>

391
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,170
The lobby is all set.
I'm going down to the basement.

392
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,420
<i>Okay.</i>

393
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,510
Online streamers
are already going wild.

394
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,340
It's 700 million won for each of them.

395
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,760
It's the highest bounty ever.

396
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,100
But the Ghost must be aware
that she's wanted.

397
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,730
Do you think she'll buy it?

398
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:42,110
When did they say they'd put out an APB?

399
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,700
TIP-OFF REWARD: 700 MILLION WON

400
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,080
- Hey, what's that?
- What?

401
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,330
- Look at that.
- Wow, the reward is 700 million won.

402
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:02,080
- Seven...
- Then if we capture both of them...

403
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,090
- Isn't it 1.4 billion won?
- What, 1.4 billion won?

404
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,630
They must be brutal criminals.

405
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,710
I know.

406
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,470
It's my first time seeing
a wanted poster with a reward.

407
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,470
- I know.
- Me too.

408
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:18,810
My gosh.

409
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,480
<i>All right! Hi, guys.</i>

410
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:31,400
<i>I'm Samgu of Samgu TV.
Why am I here today?</i>

411
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:32,860
<i>You guys all saw it, right?</i>

412
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,490
<i>Yes, it's been on the news too.
The reward of 700 million won!</i>

413
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,870
<i>It's 1.4 billion won in total.</i>

414
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:42,830
<i>If we win that money,
we can remodel our lives.</i>

415
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,420
<i>What? Nonsense?</i>

416
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,500
<i>What the heck? I should just slap you...</i>

417
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,090
<i>Gosh.</i>

418
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,840
<i>There are a lot of
pretty girls out today.</i>

419
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,270
<i>Oh!</i>

420
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,060
<i>Excuse me.</i>

421
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,810
<i>Excuse me. Wait.</i>

422
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,560
<i>Yes, this is it!</i>

423
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,280
<i>This hood! Right?</i>

424
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,440
<i>- Right, guys? Wait!
- What do you think you're doing?</i>

425
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,490
<i>Don't get me wrong.
I just want to talk to you.</i>

426
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,610
<i>I'm not a weirdo.</i>

427
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,240
<i>You know Samgu TV, right? Samgu TV.
Let's just talk for a moment.</i>

428
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,370
<i>- Let go.
- Don't go.</i>

429
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,080
<i>Darn it!</i>

430
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,410
<i>What's wrong with her?</i>

431
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,920
<i>Did she think I was interested in her?</i>

432
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,500
<i>Jeez.</i>

433
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,750
<i>Oh!</i>

434
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,130
<i>- Excuse me! Mr. Kim Manok!
- Let go!</i>

435
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,760
<i>Oh! Mr. Kim Manok! Hey, guys!
Hold this guy! Hurry!</i>

436
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,310
<i>- Let go!
- Mr. Kim Manok.</i>

437
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:41,220
<i>- Let go!
- Let's just talk for a minute.</i>

438
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,560
<i>Let's just talk.
Hey, hold him! Darn it!</i>

439
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,020
Should I quit my job
and become a bounty hunter?

440
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,400
I'll make big bucks if I catch the guy.

441
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,900
<i>The Grid is a kind of shield...</i>

442
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,400
I know it's urgent, but...

443
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:55,490
It sure is. You're the one
who brought up the deposit.

444
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,530
If I catch both of them,
I can buy an apartment.

445
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,540
This isn't some kind of game.

446
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,160
If it were a game,
I would've already crushed them.

447
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,920
This is the guy
who kicked you off the wall.

448
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,500
I'll teach him a lesson if I catch him.

449
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,930
Sis, I'm the only one
who cares about you, right?

450
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,600
Come on.

451
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,770
Who am I talking to?

452
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,570
You can't plug that in there.

453
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,690
What?

454
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,650
- But this is the only outlet...
- You can't.

455
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,580
TIP-OFF BOARD

456
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:45,910
Hello?

457
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,460
Yes, you can report it to us.

458
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,170
Where did you see him?

459
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,050
You shouldn't make prank calls,
Mr. Yoon Subin living of Seonheung-dong.

460
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,720
Isn't this Yoon Subin? Guo Middle School,
Class 4. Should I call and check?

461
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,150
Come on in.

462
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,330
Tip-off number 924.

463
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,990
I think you should check it out.

464
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,500
I guess we've finally got something
that's not bullcrap.

465
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,340
- You two go.
- Yes, ma'am.

466
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,470
Where's Mr. Song?

467
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,930
- Take Ms. Chae with you.
- Yes, ma'am.

468
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,310
<i>The Grid hasn't broken down, right?</i>

469
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,480
It has something to do
with the APB, right?

470
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,900
We don't really
have to evacuate people, right?

471
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,160
You know I can't tell you anything.

472
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,120
It's a lie then.

473
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,530
Thank you for your answer.

474
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,660
<i>You should know this.</i>

475
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,080
<i>It was probably a good idea
for the Administration Bureau.</i>

476
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,660
But you just disturbed public order.

477
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,000
Don't blame me. It wasn't my idea.

478
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,960
If it wasn't yours,

479
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,670
<i>was it your colleague's?</i>

480
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,630
My colleague?

481
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,050
Was it Mr. Kim Saeha's idea?

482
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,140
How do you know him?

483
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,680
Do you call each other by name?

484
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,640
<i>What's it to you? Forget it.</i>

485
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,310
And the same goes for the reward.

486
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,360
<i>There are tons of people crazy about
money. How could you use them like this?</i>

487
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,570
Well, since there are many,
we should make use of them.

488
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,280
Productively.

489
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:48,580
I really hope no one gets hurt
because of this.

490
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,090
"Mr. Kim Saeha"?

491
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,040
FIREARMS WITHDRAWAL RECORD

492
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,960
CORPORAL JUNG SAEBYEOK

493
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,400
Welcome.

494
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
Is this her?

495
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,200
Yes, it is her.

496
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,790
No, it's not.

497
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:14,750
Yes, it is.

498
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,920
- I think it's her.
- No, it's not.

499
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,800
Miss, what's your name?

500
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,380
We're asking your name.

501
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:27,930
Come on. That's not what matters.
What matters is what she looks like.

502
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:30,930
That's why I'm asking her name.
She looks similar.

503
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:31,930
Yes, doesn't she?

504
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,810
If she loosens her hair.

505
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,020
Oh, be careful.

506
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,810
Goodness,
there's trash all over here.

507
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,230
- Good gracious.
- What's with her?

508
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,280
- Why is only this spot so dirty?
- Hey.

509
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,820
- Hey...
- Hey, it's dusty!

510
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,070
I know. It's really dusty here.

511
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,990
These pieces of trash
that should be burned. Goodness!

512
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,450
Hey. Do you want to die?

513
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,160
No, who would want to die?
Let go of me, please.

514
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,470
When two or more people gather
to assault, threaten, or incite sedition,

515
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,100
they may face up to ten years in prison.

516
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,140
But...

517
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,560
judges will probably release them.

518
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,230
You should dress like that all the time.

519
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,150
You look much better
when you're neatly dressed.

520
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:25,440
I thought you were homeless.
I worried for nothing.

521
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:33,580
Is there any place
someone would hide around here?

522
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,790
In this station?

523
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,580
I'm not sure if there is any.

524
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,170
Empty storage rooms or such?

525
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,800
All the storage rooms here
are frequented by workers like me.

526
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,380
I see.

527
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,890
May I ask how long
you've been working here?

528
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,390
It's been about a year now.

529
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:01,190
Then have you seen these people
around here recently?

530
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,730
No, I don't think I have.

531
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:10,610
- Thank you.
- Sure.

532
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,870
By the way...

533
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,370
Thank you.

534
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,080
Sure.

535
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,920
Have a good day.

536
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,140
That's 700 million won.

537
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,270
- It's her.
- Get her!

538
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,120
<i>Is there any place

539
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,170
Empty storage rooms or such?

540
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,670
Hey.

541
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,090
Right.

542
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,890
Goodness, she's already gone?

543
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,480
I should've told her about that.

544
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:14,860
Hello?

545
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:17,820
<i>You called earlier.
I'm sorry. I wasn't able to answer.</i>

546
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:19,870
Where are you...

547
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,790
Are you out?

548
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:24,210
<i>Yes, at Gudong Station.</i>

549
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,620
Gudong Station?

550
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:27,960
<i>I want to get the reward too.</i>

551
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,090
Detective.

552
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:32,460
<i>We must catch either the woman
or the murderer to end this disaster.</i>

553
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:35,680
I may not be able to catch the woman,
but I'll catch Kim Manok.

554
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,470
Do you think Kim Manok is still there?

555
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,930
You said he was last seen here.

556
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:45,140
Then I should start from here.

557
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:47,020
GUDONG STATION FLOOR PLAN

558
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,230
Did you know a new railroad was
planned to be built at Gudong Station?

559
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,370
<i>But the plan was canceled,</i>

560
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:03,660
<i>and some of the area for it
was abandoned too.</i>

561
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,090
<i>A dead space that was supposed
to be used as a passageway.</i>

562
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,840
<i>It's a completely isolated space.</i>

563
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:23,260
<i>She's someone
who can go anywhere she wants.</i>

564
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:25,520
<i>She may be
on the other side of the Earth now.</i>

565
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,180
<i>And you're looking for her there?</i>

566
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,020
There can't be anything here.

567
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:35,530
<i>That's what I thought at first,</i>

568
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:38,780
<i>but the text messages
she sent to Kim Manok bother me.</i>

569
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:41,530
<i>The bathroom.</i>

570
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:43,990
<i>The truck.</i>

571
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,330
<i>She told him the escape routes.</i>

572
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,720
<i>What if...</i>

573
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,680
<i>she can only teleport alone?</i>

574
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:26,790
Open this.

575
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,960
Open this!

576
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,170
Open this!

577
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:56,150
<i>If she could disappear with someone else,
why would she text him?</i>

578
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,030
<i>She could've just disappeared
with Kim Manok...</i>

579
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,320
- Detective?
- <i>Ma'am!</i>

580
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,200
Detective.

581
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,950
Detective! Hello...

582
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,250
Over there.

583
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:22,430
Ma'am.

584
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,680
- Please go bring a station worker.
- Sorry?

585
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,220
Go bring a station worker.

586
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,390
Oh, okay.

587
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:31,850
And ma'am, don't come back here.
