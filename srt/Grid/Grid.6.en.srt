Hurry up. Which way?

00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,680
- Where?
- In the basement.

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,550
- The basement?
- The basement.

11
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,640
There. Hurry up. Hurry.

12
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,890
Where is she?

13
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,190
Where is she? Tell me.

14
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,200
I don't know.

15
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,410
Where is the woman?

16
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,620
I don't know.

17
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,210
I really don't.

18
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,630
I don't know who she is.
She's a complete stranger.

19
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,920
After locking me up here,
she only comes to give me food.

20
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:11,470
I don't know either.

21
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,510
Why did she help you?

22
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,720
I don't know.

23
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,760
I asked her too.

24
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,020
But she wouldn't tell me.

25
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,390
I've never even heard her voice.

26
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,310
I swear.

27
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,860
Damn it.

28
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,740
Please go up and call the police...

29
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,040
Please call Songje Station
and tell Chief Go

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,540
that the convenience store suspect
has been caught.

31
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,540
Yes, ma'am.

32
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,590
Is he really the culprit?

33
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,470
With that woman... What was it?

34
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,680
The murderer?

35
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,220
Open this!

36
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,930
He's been here all along?
In this station?

37
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,440
Detective.

38
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,990
I told you not to come back here.
It's dangerous.

39
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,700
Well... Can I have another look
at the picture you showed me?

40
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,870
The woman.

41
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,420
My goodness. It looks just like her
looking at it again.

42
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,260
Have you seen her?

43
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,550
You also saw her earlier, Detective.

44
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,520
The lady who was harassed by those guys.

45
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,930
What?

46
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,310
I thought she was a homeless person
when I first saw her.

47
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,480
In this station?

48
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,400
I'm not sure if there is any.

49
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,120
Because she kept washing up
at the station.

50
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,830
When did she start... No.

51
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,870
Do you know where she is...

52
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,210
Damn it.

53
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,880
Well... I don't know
where she is either.

54
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,550
Where?

55
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,890
This way! Please follow me!

56
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,890
Hey! Jung Saebyeok!

57
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,180
Why did you come here alone?

58
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,350
What if you got hurt, you punk?

59
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,900
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,650
- What are you waiting for?
- Okay, sir.

61
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,900
Let's go.

62
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,110
For God's sake.

63
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,110
Good job.

64
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,240
What about the woman?

65
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,580
- Please collect the things here.
- Yes, ma'am.

66
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,460
It seems that she bought food
from restaurants.

67
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,370
What?

68
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,130
- Collect all of them. They're important.
- Yes, sir.

69
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,130
We'll have to check
the restaurants then.

70
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,090
More importantly,

71
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,760
if you take him, she might show up.

72
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,680
I don't know why,
but she's been helping him get away.

73
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,510
If she shows up, please catch her.

74
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,730
What? Aren't you coming with us?

75
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,610
I wasn't mistaken when I said
she disappeared into thin air.

76
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,480
You really need to be cautious.

77
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,820
Okay.

78
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,400
I don't know how I'm going
to catch such a person,

79
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,740
but I'll try my best.

80
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,580
Jeez, he's been locked up in a place
that suits him just perfectly.

81
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,870
My goodness.

82
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,460
EPISODE 6

83
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,000
Get in.

84
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,840
The clerk said she paid in cash

85
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,090
but seemed to be a little short on cash.

86
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,760
Everything from here to here?

87
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,310
Yes. But she didn't get them to go.

88
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,930
She ate them all by herself here.
I thought that was unusual.

89
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,100
- Did she speak Korean?
- Yes.

90
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,860
Did she stammer when she spoke?
Or did she look like an alien...

91
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,610
I mean, a foreigner fluent in Korean?

92
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,740
She said she didn't seem
like a foreigner at all.

93
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,700
Nothing peculiar
about her appearance either.

94
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,700
I guess she didn't buy that many
for someone else.

95
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,040
- You mean the convenience store murderer?
- Yes.

96
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,790
Without weapons
or the teleportation device,

97
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,960
she may be just an ordinary person.

98
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,330
She eats like us after all.

99
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,050
So we mustn't inflict
any injuries on her.

100
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,050
She may easily get hurt.

101
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,470
We must catch her alive and intact
no matter what.

102
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,310
Could sugar be the energy source
that she uses to teleport?

103
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,430
Or maybe she can only break down sugar.

104
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,190
The clerk said she ate
through her mouth and spoke Korean.

105
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,560
It may not be as it seems. What if she's
equipped with an automatic translator?

106
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,480
Like the universal translator
from <i>Star Trek.</i>

107
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,070
Maybe she uses holograms
to change her appearance.

108
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,240
It's great that we found out about this.

109
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,450
Putting out an APB on her paid off.

110
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,910
Sure. Good job, Mr. Song Eojin.

111
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,950
Thank you.

112
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,830
One moment, please.

113
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,960
Jongyi. Please move over a bit.

114
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,930
<i>What did you see?</i>

115
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,480
Boy, I hope it'll be helpful.

116
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,860
Jeez, I can't wait for this to end.
For God's sake.

117
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,360
This is a smoke-free building.

118
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,120
I heard you used to work
on the Grid Control Team.

119
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,660
Yes.

120
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,460
No wonder you're different.

121
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,420
- Me?
- Yes.

122
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,170
Who are you comparing me to?

123
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,380
The Deputy Director.

124
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,800
And what was his name?
The one with the Grid failure idea.

125
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,560
- Kim Saeha.
- Yeah, him.

126
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,680
Jeez, that was such an absurd idea.

127
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,060
He knows nothing about our work,
for God's sake.

128
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,360
He used to work
on the Grid Control Team too.

129
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,030
- What?
- Only for six months, though. While...

130
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,860
I worked there for four years.

131
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:54,620
Then did he also cause trouble
and get transferred to the Secretariat?

132
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,080
I didn't cause trouble.
I only pointed out what was wrong.

133
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,750
Oh, yes. I know.
I've briefly heard about it.

134
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,130
As you know, there are still many people
on my team who got their jobs

135
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,930
through personal connections.

136
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,010
So I was thinking

137
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,510
it'd help me a lot if there were
a senior officer like you

138
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,060
who could keep them under control
in the middle.

139
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,650
Jeez, kids these days don't step forward
even if they see a problem.

140
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,320
What a shame.

141
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,780
So...

142
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,910
what did you see
in the Deputy Director's office?

143
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,590
The founder of the Grid.

144
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,470
Who saw the founder?

145
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,350
So? Is it a person?

146
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,980
Shouldn't we prepare for it?

147
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,310
Prepare for what?

148
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,610
If we're unarmed, we might lose her.

149
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,900
Shouldn't we lower the security level
and bring in weapons?

150
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,610
Everyone seems okay to you, right?

151
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,410
If the operation drags on,
there will be renegades.

152
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,620
Among us.

153
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,580
Do we have to worry about that?

154
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,330
Shouldn't we worry about that?

155
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,960
Joining our enemy. Isn't that
the problem with traitors or renegades?

156
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,960
If anyone joins her side,
that'll be good news for us

157
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,090
since it'll at least form a link.

158
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,300
I guess you've only
seen decent lunatics.

159
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,220
Fanatical employees that believe
the Ghost is mankind's savior.

160
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,020
Applicants who believed
the Grid was created by cults

161
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,810
and wanted to blow up the control room.

162
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,360
And executives who got caught
selling inside information

163
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,940
about the Ghost to magazine publishers.

164
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,530
I've seen all kinds of lunatics
in the past 24 years.

165
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,530
Among our team members?

166
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,240
Those who made it into the AB?

167
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,370
There was a time
when we had more freedom here.

168
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,910
They keep information confidential and
run many different teams for a reason.

169
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,540
Humans are always
the problem in the end.

170
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,590
They're all out.

171
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,900
<i>Specialists from all fields
are trying to figure out the reason</i>

172
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,240
<i>why the Grid isn't working properly,</i>

173
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,950
<i>but there hasn't been
any noticeable progress yet.</i>

174
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:24,750
<i>If they fail to figure out the reason
and fix the problem,</i>

175
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,920
<i>the magnetic fields of the Earth
will stop functioning properly.</i>

176
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,630
Ms. Choi. Kim Manok has been arrested.

177
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,260
- Where is he?
- His arrest was just on the news.

178
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,550
He's at Songje Police Station.

179
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,260
Damn it. We have everything set up.
Why now of all times?

180
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,390
They should've just kept their mouths
shut about it. What terrible timing!

181
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,100
The police announced it immediately
because of all the disturbance.

182
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,610
To tell us to stop...

183
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,480
That issue was brought up
from the start.

184
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,030
You've never cared about it,

185
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,780
but to cover up for your ex-wife now...

186
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,040
The only thing the Ghost has done
this time is help Kim Manok.

187
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,090
And he's been arrested,
so she'll come for him.

188
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,460
We must make her come here.

189
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,380
Whether it's for the Grid or Kim Manok,

190
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,920
she must come to us.

191
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,590
Then I'll go and take care of it.

192
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,430
Ms. Choi.

193
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,650
Where is she going?

194
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,020
Ms. Choi.

195
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,650
Stay out of your wife's business.

196
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,620
She's my ex.

197
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,910
Ex-wife!

198
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,300
I'm on my way now,
so don't hand him over to her, Captain.

199
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,420
She's here.

200
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,300
Gosh.

201
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,570
I told you to have him ready for me.

202
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,780
- Did you guys catch him?
- Did you?

203
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,280
One of my men did.

204
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,030
Isn't a felon always handed over
to the violent crimes unit?

205
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,410
Inspector Go Hanseung. Answer me.

206
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,250
Is it unreasonable to hand him over
to the branch in charge?

207
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,790
Come on.
You always barge in like this...

208
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,220
We do all the hard work,
and you always take the credit.

209
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:28,720
Good job.

210
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,770
I can't explain the details,
but we have no time to lose.

211
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,060
Bring Kim Manok now.

212
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,400
If you delay it any longer,
your hard work may be for nothing.

213
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,730
Bring him.

214
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,760
Hey.

215
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,150
I was wondering why you weren't here...

216
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,690
Hey.

217
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,860
Did you think I'd let you
walk all over me again?

218
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,490
- Shoot me.
- No.

219
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,910
Shoot. We don't have time.

220
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,410
Both you and I know
that I won't shoot you.

221
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,620
It's no use if you don't shoot me.

222
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,420
We could stay like this for good.
Or I could just kill that guy.

223
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,750
- Has he opened his mouth?
- Yes.

224
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,720
He admitted to his crime
but denied the rest.

225
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,010
Then let's just kill him.

226
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,890
Hey, Jung Saebyeok!

227
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,640
The woman appeared because of him
in the first place.

228
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:59,270
If he dies, she'll leave.
Then everything will go back to normal.

229
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,990
Investigator Jung Saebyeok.

230
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,990
You saw the woman with your own eyes.

231
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:20,120
You can't handle her.
You're just wasting our time.

232
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,750
Can the AB, then?

233
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,880
Why did you lie and say
that the Grid was broken?

234
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,090
Are you waiting for her?

235
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,100
You've gathered a lot of information.

236
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,360
So?

237
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,610
If you're taking him
because you can't trust us,

238
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,780
I want to see how reliable
the Administration Bureau is.

239
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,200
If you want to see that,
put that gun down.

240
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,200
We mustn't waste any more time.

241
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,480
Hey, you...

242
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,440
Be careful. All right?

243
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,400
Ms. Choi.

244
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,360
- Are you really taking her with us?
- Stop her if you can.

245
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,300
She associated the breakdown
of the Grid with the woman.

246
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,100
That means she knows
the origin of the Grid.

247
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,010
My colleague?

248
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,600
<i>Was it Mr. Kim Saeha's idea?</i>

249
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,850
How do you know him?

250
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,940
How would an investigator know that?

251
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,110
I have no idea.

252
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,080
How did you catch him?

253
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,370
I assumed that Kim Manok
would be left at the station.

254
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,000
Hmm.

255
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,050
When we arrive,
I'll introduce someone to you.

256
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,500
I'd like you to teach him a lesson.

257
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,800
Oh, you've already met him.

258
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,010
You mean the major?

259
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,730
I think the Secretariat would suit you
better than Mido Police Station.

260
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,440
Would it be awkward
to work with your ex-husband though?

261
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,650
I doubt that's what matters.

262
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,690
Do you think Mr. Song
feels the same way?

263
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,860
I didn't mean that.

264
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,620
It'll be bad if the operation fails,
but what if it succeeds?

265
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,040
Whether or not I suit the Secretariat,
will the AB even still be there?

266
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,250
That's what I meant.

267
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,960
It seems it was established
to find the woman.

268
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,000
But once you find her... what next?

269
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,090
Why are you coming with us?

270
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:18,180
Because of your pride?
To see how we handle it?

271
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,300
I know it's neither of them.

272
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,890
I'm sure you can't forget her because
you saw her with your own eyes.

273
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,400
I only sensed her presence
a very long time ago,

274
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,810
but I still remember it vividly.

275
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,610
Think about it.

276
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,660
If we learn the technology she has,
how much will the world change?

277
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:44,120
How much will it help improve human life
and advance human history?

278
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,870
I'm dying to know.

279
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,710
And we can lead that.

280
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,050
So we must capture her.

281
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,590
We must find out.

282
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,240
Yes?

283
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,410
It's quiet here.

284
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,460
Pardon?

285
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,080
Okay.

286
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,420
Sir.

287
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,970
The Deputy Director
is bringing two outsiders.

288
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,180
Outsiders?

289
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,550
One of them is armed,

290
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,430
so she wants you to make sure the alarm
doesn't go off when they come in.

291
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,300
<i>Alpha, 11th floor.</i>

292
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,510
Central hallway, 11th floor.

293
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,860
Control room, 9th floor.

294
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,150
<i>In front of the door.</i>

295
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,200
It's not clear which hand
the teleportation device is in.

296
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:06,970
Where'd she go?

297
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,530
<i>Alpha is in.</i>

298
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,380
<i>On the count of three,
shoot the nearest arm from you.</i>

299
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,100
<i>One.</i>

300
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,440
<i>Two.</i>

301
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
<i>Three.</i>

302
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,870
<i>Raise it to Level A.</i>

303
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,580
<i>Level A. We've been exposed.</i>

304
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,500
Leave your gun here.

305
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,550
As a police officer,
I'm supposed...

306
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,880
Do you want to leave?

307
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,440
- Yes?
- <i>The Ghost.</i>

308
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,650
They're not tranquilizer rounds.

309
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,270
Ms. Choi!

310
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,600
Ms. Choi...

311
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,620
Come on.

312
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,550
It's cold.

313
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,560
Mr. Jo.

314
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,850
Mr. Jo!

315
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,270
She's really dead.

316
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,540
You guys killed her. You...

317
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,340
- You fired live ammunition!
- Hey!

318
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,260
She was aware
that the Grid hadn't broken down.

319
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,350
It was a miracle that she showed up
again in the lobby instead of vanishing.

320
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,470
We didn't lose her.

321
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,270
A miracle? A person just died.

322
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,560
Ms. Choi is your superior.

323
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,270
Are you going to leave her
on the cold floor like this?

324
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,530
Hurry up and call an ambulance.
Call her family too.

325
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:32,860
And take the culprit now.

326
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,740
- And Major.
- Yes, sir.

327
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,870
Give me your guns, both of you.

328
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,580
- Are you crazy?
- One of them killed Ms. Choi.

329
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,120
Give me your guns.

330
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,830
They were carrying out an operation.

331
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,460
If a cop kills
an innocent citizen by mistake,

332
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,630
will you let it slide like this?

333
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,590
Tell me who killed her.
Give me the guns!

334
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,430
They all use the same guns and bullets.
Can you tell whose bullet shot her?

335
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,060
Every bullet and gun gets
a unique scratch when fired.

336
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,060
It's distinctive like fingerprints.

337
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,890
Don't treat us like idiots.

338
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,150
Did you order them
to use live ammunition, Mr. Jo?

339
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,900
If you let them leave,
they'll switch their guns around.

340
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,950
Ms. Choi has passed away!

341
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Give it to him.

342
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,330
Now.

343
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,960
This is an important time for us.
Why did you...

344
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,630
Give it.

345
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,100
Everyone,
let's sort this out and move.

346
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,100
Let's go.

347
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,060
Who's that?

348
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,190
I'm a detective from Songje Station.

349
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,320
I brought the culprit.

350
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,990
Security Manager, escort this detective.

351
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,740
Take the culprit too.

352
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,620
- I'm...
- Let's talk later. All right?

353
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,710
Not now. Take good care of her.

354
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,090
I'll take that.

355
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,380
Please follow me.

356
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,770
The bullet.

357
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,450
Wait. Please open the door.

358
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,210
I'm sure she's gone to a better place.

359
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,920
Because she was a good person.

360
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,140
Well, the minister will be here soon.

361
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,980
So I'd better go.

362
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,810
- How is it going?
- We're scanning her now.

363
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,230
We got her ready,
so you can see her when you get there.

364
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,100
I didn't expect this day would come.

365
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,230
Ah! I'm sorry, sir.

366
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,450
- Were you at the scene?
- Yes, sir.

367
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,030
- You were at the meeting too, right?
- Yes, sir.

368
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,970
You're the one who suggested
luring the woman here, right?

369
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,680
Yes, Minister.

370
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:25,190
Anyway, the operation was a success
although the sacrifice was great.

371
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,610
Don't blame yourselves.

372
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,690
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

373
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,820
What was the name
of the Deputy Director?

374
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:36,120
It was Choi Seonul, sir.

375
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,670
This way.

376
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,670
What did she say?
Has she said anything yet?

377
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,430
She hasn't yet. But she will soon.

378
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,520
Did you feel hopeless
now that Ms. Choi is gone?

379
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,600
Are you going to empty
their trash cans too?

380
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,440
Are you even human?

381
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,370
- Thank you, Minister.
- What?

382
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,540
What for?

383
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:24,420
If you hadn't given us permission then,
we couldn't have come this far.

384
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,460
Don't mention it.

385
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,760
This way, sir.

386
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,450
You can see her up close.

387
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:24,490
We found it from a gamma-ray scan.

388
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,870
It's a chip.

389
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,040
A chip?

390
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:44,600
This is what we presume
the role of the chip is.

391
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,770
It seems that the chip

392
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:51,350
transforms nerve signals from her brain
into electronic signals.

393
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:56,400
And this metallic device seems
to transform them into motor signals.

394
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,610
However,

395
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,780
what is inside the metallic device

396
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,910
or what functions it has

397
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:07,410
is still a mystery.

398
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,630
Hmm.

399
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:44,200
Since the President is waiting,

400
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,950
I'll go and brief him on this.

401
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,620
Hmm...

402
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:53,790
I think he'll come here in person
within a few days.

403
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,710
Don't you think
you should have better results by then?

404
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,590
I mean, everything you have now
is just speculation.

405
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:05,090
Yes, sir. We're currently doing
a biopsy as well.

406
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,930
Once we get the DNA analysis results,

407
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,850
we'll find out
how different she is from people today

408
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,140
and if her direct ancestors
presently exist.

409
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:15,690
We'll figure out
those things by tonight.

410
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,150
Well, things like those
could be meaningful too.

411
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:25,200
But what really matters
is the teleportation device.

412
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,220
<i>No.</i>

413
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,490
You have a lot of work to do.
There's no need to come down.

414
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,330
Let's keep up the good work
and proudly make good results.

415
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,540
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

416
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,920
Go see him out.

417
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:25,880
All right.

418
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,300
I'm running out of time,

419
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:32,430
so I want you to handle trifling matters
quickly on your own. Okay?

420
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,270
Major, find out as much as you can
about the murderer.

421
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,850
- His relationship with the woman and such.
- Yes, sir.

422
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,610
And... Hold on.

423
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:44,150
Oh, right. There's the detective too.
Who on Earth brought her here?

424
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,780
At a crucial time like this.
Talk to her nicely and send her away.

425
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,240
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, by the way,

426
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,280
which one of you is the superior?

427
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,240
I am, sir.

428
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,950
Then you take care of
the Secretariat for the time being.

429
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,410
All right? Now,

430
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,170
hurry up and move. Go.

431
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,040
Yes, sir. Come.

432
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:06,220
What are you doing? Go and send
the detective away. All right?

433
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,180
Wait, you!

434
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,180
The senior!

435
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,890
Yes, you. Come here.

436
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,460
Me?

437
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,540
What's your name?

438
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,420
Where are you from?

439
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,540
No, not that!

440
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,500
Ask her what the mechanism is.

441
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,420
Entropic recursion?
The quantum Hall effect?

442
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:17,100
What's the mechanism for teleportation?

443
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,560
What technology do you use?

444
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,850
Did you succeed in building
the Grid at one go?

445
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,860
Answer me! How did you come here?

446
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,740
One more. Give her another shot.

447
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:40,790
Hurry.

448
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,830
When were you born? In what year?

449
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:22,660
Two thousand...

450
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,420
Ninety-one.

451
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:31,340
The year 2091?

452
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,590
The year 2091?

453
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,930
How? What did you ride to come here?

454
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,640
How did you travel back in time?

455
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,260
No.

456
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:41,310
No...

457
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:44,930
Time...

458
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:49,480
doesn't flow.

459
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,790
Why did you come here?

460
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:35,480
If it weren't for me,

461
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,610
she wouldn't have been shot dead.

462
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:40,910
I'm to blame too.

463
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:44,200
I was ordered to
lower the security level

464
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,830
for a few weapons
to be brought into the building.

465
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,420
Who ordered you to lower it?

466
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:52,790
The Director did.

467
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,260
Then...

468
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,260
this happened.

469
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:04,310
Long ago, someone died
right before my eyes.

470
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:08,140
The same thing happened again
because of me...

471
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,530
I shouldn't have let them in.

472
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:23,490
You mean the weapon?

473
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:25,950
Or the child?

474
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,380
Do you know about... that incident?

475
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,430
If I had

476
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:46,180
kept saying no to the end,

477
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:51,100
he might have gone back home
holding the child's hand.

478
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,440
I still think about that.

479
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,490
Can I just turn this off?

480
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,070
No, let me.

481
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,160
Let's go.

482
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:15,130
You need to give me my gun back.

483
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:16,960
How about you head out first

484
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,170
and I give it to you
outside the security gate?

485
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,220
Sure.

486
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,060
My car is 6238.
You saw it earlier, right?

487
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:30,850
It's fine. I'll get a cab.

488
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,570
Don't do it.

489
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:51,040
They even killed their deputy director.

490
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,710
Do you think you'll be safe?

491
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:57,250
Whatever you're planning on,
don't do it.

492
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:02,130
Even I can see
that you're up to something.

493
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:04,630
Do you think they won't notice?

494
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,930
I know how you feel,
but something bad could happen to you.

495
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,690
How do you know how I feel?

496
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:17,690
It's because of your dad.

497
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:21,530
The child in that video.

498
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:22,940
It's you.

499
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,240
It isn't.

500
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,370
The person who died that day
was your father!

501
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,080
Don't do it.

502
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:39,710
What do I do then?

503
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:43,130
Should I just let them break it?

504
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:45,800
Should I let them break it into pieces?

505
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,680
Break what...

506
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,270
They're breaking that metallic thing?

507
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,100
With it, I can do anything.

508
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,650
I can bring everyone back to life.

509
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,650
Ms. Choi, my father,

510
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,450
and even my mom.

511
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:11,370
You have no idea what it's taken me

512
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:13,790
to come this far.

513
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,480
I'll get going.

514
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:54,450
I think you got a text message.

515
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,970
3 UNREAD MESSAGES

516
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,400
No.

517
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,300
Mother.

518
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:17,790
Please.

519
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,540
Please.

520
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:22,790
Please.
