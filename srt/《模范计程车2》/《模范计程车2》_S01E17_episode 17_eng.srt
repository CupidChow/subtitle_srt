1
00:00:00,488 --> 00:00:03,568
 

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,448
 

3
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:12,408
 
 We've never been dispatched without any plan like this. 

4
00:00:12,408 --> 00:00:15,598
 
 Mr. Kim, where are we going now? 

5
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,328
 We don't know where, but I know who I should visit first. 

6
00:00:17,328 --> 00:00:19,928
 We don't know where, but I know who I should visit first. 

7
00:00:19,928 --> 00:00:21,008
 Who? 

8
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:25,408
 

9
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:28,808
 

10
00:00:28,808 --> 00:00:31,808
 

11
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:33,978
 

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,700
 

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,990
 Thanks for watching Taxi Driver 2 on Viki! 

14
00:00:46,998 --> 00:00:49,408
Could you tell me...

15
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,908
what has happened to you so far?

16
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,208
Actually, I am the one

17
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:59,608
 
who got into this car, wanting to know what happened to you, Je Hoon.

18
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:02,118
I mean, what happened that

19
00:01:02,118 --> 00:01:05,768
people are going crazy over the Premium Taxi?

20
00:01:06,908 --> 00:01:08,208
 

21
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,088
Come on. Tell me.

22
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:13,888
Because it was at such a vast scale.

23
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:17,038
The production costs are way higher than other dramas, right?

24
00:01:17,038 --> 00:01:18,428
Tell me.

25
00:01:18,428 --> 00:01:20,668
Come on, tell me.

26
00:01:23,468 --> 00:01:25,208
Geez, so petty!

27
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:30,238
Because it's not only popular nationwide but all over the world!

28
00:01:30,238 --> 00:01:32,758
Taxi Driver is the most watched drama.

29
00:01:32,758 --> 00:01:36,118
The appearance fee. You must've got paid a lot!

30
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:37,878
Come on, tell me!

31
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,118
 

32
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:41,368
Tell me!

33
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:44,678
I got in the car because you said you would tell me!

34
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,028
Then I will tell you.

35
00:01:50,178 --> 00:01:52,198
Dispatch 5283...

36
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:55,518
commencing operation.

37
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,798
What's this? You didn't tell me anything!

38
00:01:58,798 --> 00:02:01,038
You did all the cool stuff by yourself!

39
00:02:01,758 --> 00:02:05,768
 

40
00:02:05,768 --> 00:02:06,828
 

41
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:08,968
- Taxi Driver Special?
- It's destiny.

42
00:02:08,968 --> 00:02:10,908
We can't do it for this much

43
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:12,258
I'm doing only the amount of work matching the pay!

44
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:13,808
"They cut it and put it together."

45
00:02:13,808 --> 00:02:16,908
The amount felt huge to me.

46
00:02:16,908 --> 00:02:19,198
 

47
00:02:19,198 --> 00:02:20,778
You didn't tell me about this!

48
00:02:20,778 --> 00:02:22,008
Whoa, daebak.

49
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,288
But from the staff...

50
00:02:23,288 --> 00:02:25,468
 I have a lot to say about Rainbow Transportation Services. 

51
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:26,678
I'm sure they were good to us, right?

52
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:28,478
 He was not who we thought he was. 

53
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:30,658
 He said he would do it himself. 

54
00:02:30,658 --> 00:02:32,348
What is suitable for broadcasting.

55
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:34,308
I feel like they're playing us.

56
00:02:34,308 --> 00:02:37,998
- They know a lot about us.
- I think I guess who this is.

57
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:41,098
- Because he told me to.
- He said he didn't make you.

58
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:42,528
So funny!

59
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:44,238
What?

60
00:02:44,238 --> 00:02:47,888
 

61
00:02:47,888 --> 00:02:50,358
 

62
00:02:50,358 --> 00:02:51,498
 

63
00:02:51,498 --> 00:02:52,618
 

64
00:02:52,618 --> 00:02:55,328
- Your pupils are shaking!
- Please air this!

65
00:02:55,328 --> 00:02:58,268
- His ears are red!
- You should've told me!

66
00:02:58,268 --> 00:03:01,158
 

67
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:06,128
 
We managed to have all five actors of Taxi Driver in the studio today.

68
00:03:06,128 --> 00:03:08,138
Everyone, welcome!

69
00:03:08,138 --> 00:03:09,618
Thank you!

70
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:11,068
The ratings have skyrocketed.

71
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:14,168
Ranking No. 1 in drama and actors' popularity.

72
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:18,568
The most viewed drama in 16 countries

73
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:21,328
was Taxi Driver 2.

74
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:23,938
I don't know if you know all this already.

75
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:28,178
Compared to the last time I saw you, you seem to have a slight arrogant look in your eyes.

76
00:03:28,178 --> 00:03:30,388
 

77
00:03:30,388 --> 00:03:33,668
- As if they're glaring.
- Right?

78
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:35,488
I think everyone is feeling that.

79
00:03:35,488 --> 00:03:38,138
When we usually say this, they say no.

80
00:03:38,138 --> 00:03:39,558
But they don't even deny it.

81
00:03:39,558 --> 00:03:42,608
Oh, no, that's not true!

82
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:45,768
Honestly, I can relate because

83
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:50,008
my schedule overlapped slightly with another program today.

84
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:53,418
But when I heard Taxi Driver Special Edition, I said, "I'll do it!"

85
00:03:53,418 --> 00:03:55,978
In these situations, you just have to tag along.

86
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:58,248
- When they're so popular.
- Of course!

87
00:03:58,248 --> 00:04:02,398
Keep this in mind. If something is popular, you have to tag along.

88
00:04:02,398 --> 00:04:05,718
Taxi Driver's Laughter Service. Rainbow Transporting Good Fortune.

89
00:04:05,718 --> 00:04:10,258
We prepared a video of the messages from Season 2 of Taxi Driver 2.

90
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:11,978
Shall we watch it together?

91
00:04:11,978 --> 00:04:14,048
 Dispatch 5283, commencing operation. 

92
00:04:14,048 --> 00:04:15,888
 

93
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,578
 

94
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:23,528
 

95
00:04:23,528 --> 00:04:26,188
 

96
00:04:26,188 --> 00:04:28,758
 

97
00:04:28,758 --> 00:04:31,608
 

98
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:34,008
 

99
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:36,008
 

100
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:37,498
 

101
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:42,808
 

102
00:04:45,878 --> 00:04:47,828
Announcer Jo Jung Sik. All of a sudden!

103
00:04:47,828 --> 00:04:50,598
Hello, I'm Jo Jung Sik, the sixth member of Rainbow Transportation Service.

104
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:52,178
The sixth member?

105
00:04:52,178 --> 00:04:54,158
Not possible, you say?

106
00:04:54,158 --> 00:04:55,738
You have no idea what you are talking about.

107
00:04:55,738 --> 00:04:59,508
In Episode 10, the one who caught the bad doctor performing proxy surgery.

108
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:00,828
That was me.

109
00:05:00,828 --> 00:05:03,648
 
 I heard you promised to donate the entirety 

110
00:05:03,648 --> 00:05:08,938
 of this year's hospital revenue to the welfare of the entire nation's elderly. 

111
00:05:10,128 --> 00:05:11,808
 - I did?
- Please give it up once again! 

112
00:05:11,808 --> 00:05:14,128
 

113
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:18,208
They were able to catch her because I let it out on broadcast.

114
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:22,808
Please recognize that I do have some stake in Taxi Driver 2.

115
00:05:22,808 --> 00:05:26,758
And even if I don't, I'd be grateful if you count it as if I do.

116
00:05:26,758 --> 00:05:30,588
 The factory was back in operation just after three hours after a worker died stuck in a machine... 

117
00:05:30,588 --> 00:05:33,458
 A man who indiscriminately assaulted a woman who was returning home alone 

118
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,498
 was given a five-year sentence from the first trial. 

119
00:05:36,498 --> 00:05:40,538
The reason Taxi Driver 2 received so much love from viewers

120
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:44,278
was because the series was created

121
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:47,118
based on true events.

122
00:05:47,118 --> 00:05:49,818
 Someone who needs help is right in front of us. 

123
00:05:49,818 --> 00:05:52,198
 If we just hold back, 

124
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:54,748
 what are we there for, exactly? 

125
00:05:54,748 --> 00:05:57,338
 
 It's because that's the rule. 

126
00:05:57,338 --> 00:05:59,008
 
 I told you clearly. 

127
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:02,098
 The information department just needs to work on the requested cases. 

128
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:04,908
 The police just played it by the book. 

129
00:06:04,908 --> 00:06:10,178
And by pinpointing the limitations of the system through unsolved cases,

130
00:06:10,178 --> 00:06:12,448
the show can be very meaningful.

131
00:06:12,448 --> 00:06:17,868
 

132
00:06:20,568 --> 00:06:22,268
 In that moment, 

133
00:06:22,268 --> 00:06:26,528
 seeing through the eyes of those disillusioned 

134
00:06:26,528 --> 00:06:29,808
 they opened the door for those people. 

135
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:34,338
 Could you tell me what you have been through? 

136
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:36,718
 The one who listened to their stories. 

137
00:06:36,718 --> 00:06:38,898
 I don't know what to do. 

138
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:44,368
 Taxi Driver became a source of comfort for us in dealing with reality. 

139
00:06:44,368 --> 00:06:48,558
Also, did you know that Taxi Driver does not simply provide comfort

140
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:52,478
but also conveys a very important message?

141
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,928
 The first message is a concept that exists in good 

142
00:06:55,928 --> 00:07:00,828
 but does not exist with evil. 

143
00:07:01,728 --> 00:07:04,138
 

144
00:07:04,138 --> 00:07:05,518
 Dad... 

145
00:07:05,518 --> 00:07:10,278
 Employment as bait, they imprisoned and assaulted young men. 

146
00:07:10,278 --> 00:07:13,438
 Help me, I want to live. 

147
00:07:13,438 --> 00:07:17,808
 Even worse, illegal gambling website organization that committed murders. 

148
00:07:17,808 --> 00:07:19,698
 Using extremely brutal methods... 

149
00:07:19,698 --> 00:07:20,868
 That chairman... 

150
00:07:20,868 --> 00:07:23,708
 - especially the leader of the organization...
- He's a cop. 

151
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,448
 
 - was a corrupt cop.
- That was shocking. 

152
00:07:25,448 --> 00:07:28,718
 
 Many viewers were shocked. 

153
00:07:28,718 --> 00:07:33,468
 There are so many homes in this world, but how come I'm the only one without one? 

154
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:35,748
 I thought about it over and over again. And finally... 

155
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:39,238
 - And using his own secret method,
- I found the solution. 

156
00:07:39,238 --> 00:07:42,058
 - Kang Pil Seung, who became a real estate consultant.
- Are you curious? 

157
00:07:42,058 --> 00:07:43,898
 But that secret method involved... 

158
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:46,918
 Hey, orphan. What did I say I'll do if you don't listen? 

159
00:07:47,978 --> 00:07:50,868
 - I won't ever do it again.
- It turns out... 

160
00:07:50,868 --> 00:07:54,448
 he was using helpless children as offerings. 

161
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:59,798
Between the corrupt cop and Kang Pil Seung exists commonalities.

162
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:02,838
 The two of them both... 

163
00:08:09,718 --> 00:08:11,468
 Successfully taken care of. 

164
00:08:11,468 --> 00:08:13,818
 They met their death 

165
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:23,268
 not by Taxi Driver but another evil entity. 

166
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:26,158
Evil punished evil.

167
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:28,148
Here we know...

168
00:08:28,148 --> 00:08:32,128
that what exists in good but not in evil

169
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:36,108
is a win-win situation.

170
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:40,068
In the end, regardless of whether it is good or evil,

171
00:08:40,068 --> 00:08:45,108
evil will receive judgment. Those were the cases that conveyed that message.

172
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,888
 
 - Mom!
- You scared me! 

173
00:08:46,888 --> 00:08:51,398
 Yoo Sang Gi, who heinously scammed the elderly in rural areas. 

174
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:55,448
 Mom, you just need to take it over and die. 

175
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:56,598
 And... 

176
00:08:56,598 --> 00:09:00,048
 
 There aren't that many seats left on the train to Pure White Land! 

177
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:05,298
 Ok Joo Man who went after what he wanted as a cult leader of Pure White Land. 

178
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:07,318
These two also had something in common.

179
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:12,808
 What's worse is that the believers rarely realize that they're victims of a crime. 

180
00:09:12,808 --> 00:09:14,258
 
 Because of their trust. 

181
00:09:14,258 --> 00:09:19,278
Both of them took advantage of people's trust to commit crimes.

182
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:20,058
That's right.

183
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:22,208
 We shouldn't interrupt while he's treasure hunting. 

184
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:26,358
 The way Taxi Driver punished them was also done in the same fashion. 

185
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,918
 It's like prison. 

186
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:30,528
 - Once you believe it...
- A prison created by his own greed. 

187
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,458
 there is no other way. 

188
00:09:34,358 --> 00:09:36,088
 Yes, Priest Kim. 

189
00:09:36,088 --> 00:09:38,938
 
 Priest, my foot. Call me Kim Do Gi. 

190
00:09:38,938 --> 00:09:42,388
 

191
00:09:42,388 --> 00:09:46,368
- The revenge here was so gratifying.
- So gratifying, right?

192
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:48,948
 Priest Kim! 

193
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:53,538
An evil heart will destroy itself.

194
00:09:53,538 --> 00:09:59,268
 
 From now on, you were arrested for sexually assaulting a club worker. 

195
00:09:59,268 --> 00:10:02,628
 You're totally f***ed now. 

196
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:07,488
What happens when people who should have a sense of duty abandon it?

197
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:11,108
There was an incident that showed how scary such a situation could be.

198
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:13,858
That does happen in real life.

199
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:17,488
 

200
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,908
 Drugs. 

201
00:10:25,998 --> 00:10:27,868
 Sexual assault. 

202
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:36,978
 Illegal filming and circulation. 

203
00:10:36,978 --> 00:10:41,718
 All kinds of crimes were portrayed in the Black Sun episodes. 

204
00:10:41,718 --> 00:10:44,498
When governmental authority joins forces with evil,

205
00:10:44,498 --> 00:10:47,368
reality could immediately become hell.

206
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:50,198
This case clearly showed us such a fact.

207
00:10:50,198 --> 00:10:53,338
 Let's get started, Dr. Gong. 

208
00:10:53,338 --> 00:10:54,588
 

209
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:58,538
 My greatest achievement of catching the doctor in proxy surgery 

210
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:00,288
 could be viewed in the same context. 

211
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:05,408
 The sense of duty is very important for doctors as well. 

212
00:11:05,408 --> 00:11:10,228
All right. Up to this point, we went over the messages conveyed through

213
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:12,418
Taxi Driver 2 one at a time.

214
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:15,958
What are your thoughts?

215
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:22,168
Our crew really worked hard on this.

216
00:11:22,168 --> 00:11:24,558
I know. They worked really hard.

217
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:28,748
Even our global announcer made his appearance as well.

218
00:11:28,748 --> 00:11:29,908
I told you earlier.

219
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:32,808
When something is popular, you ought to tag along.

220
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:35,108
He knows all that.

221
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:37,328
Besides the content we put together,

222
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:41,308
I'm sure the actors also felt and realized

223
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:44,868
some things while working on the drama. How was it?

224
00:11:44,868 --> 00:11:47,968
There were many cases that I was not aware of.

225
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:51,408
And I didn't realize how deep the pain was.

226
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:54,468
But when I thought about it, all these things happened around us.

227
00:11:54,468 --> 00:11:59,418
So, I realized this was a drama that made me take a look around my surroundings.

228
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,498
And there's a line like this by Kim Do Gi.

229
00:12:01,498 --> 00:12:03,838
 There was something I retrieved by remembering. 

230
00:12:03,838 --> 00:12:05,998
That you have to remember.

231
00:12:05,998 --> 00:12:11,148
You have to remember so that our world will become kinder

232
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,118
and is worth living.

233
00:12:14,118 --> 00:12:18,308
I really felt that a lot while making this drama.

234
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:20,538
I see. Yoo Ram, how was it?

235
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:24,488
I like shows like "I Want To Know."

236
00:12:24,488 --> 00:12:27,998
So there were cases that I have heard of before.

237
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:33,198
And on Saturdays, "I Want To Know" is on the right after our drama.

238
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:37,188
I think, thanks to us, their ratings went up a little bit, too.

239
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:39,848
Hey, when did you get so arrogant?

240
00:12:39,848 --> 00:12:42,678
Great! People like him experience a high level of happiness.

241
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:46,448
- "It's all me. Thanks to me..."
- That's not what I'm saying.

242
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:49,418
 
It's all us... our production crew... made it together...

243
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:54,918
But Yoo Ram, did you like a specific revenge plot?

244
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:57,418
Because this one was different from Season 1.

245
00:12:57,418 --> 00:12:58,988
Since the private cells were gone,

246
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:02,258
it was pretty fun to watch a variety of revenge methods.

247
00:13:02,258 --> 00:13:05,288
I'm always put into the plot at some point.

248
00:13:05,288 --> 00:13:06,548
 

249
00:13:06,548 --> 00:13:08,228
I join the cult...

250
00:13:08,228 --> 00:13:11,728
 I want to be healed first, Father. 

251
00:13:13,548 --> 00:13:15,548
 Path to Pure White... 

252
00:13:15,548 --> 00:13:17,758
 Move your hand. 

253
00:13:17,758 --> 00:13:21,008
 I won't give up on you. 

254
00:13:22,998 --> 00:13:24,838
I watched the shrine scene.

255
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:27,808
Whoa, I had no idea they would go to that extent to produce that scene.

256
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:31,818
To deceive him, he pretends to be possessed by the mom.

257
00:13:31,818 --> 00:13:33,208
 

258
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,588
 My son. 

259
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:41,121
 

260
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,488
 
 Mom will... 

261
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:45,938
 never... 

262
00:13:45,938 --> 00:13:48,898
 give up on my son! 

263
00:13:48,898 --> 00:13:50,258
It was so fun!

264
00:13:50,258 --> 00:13:52,278
- You like that story setup.
- Yes, I loved it.

265
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:54,628
Jang Hyuk Jin, which part is your personal favorite?

266
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:56,638
I also liked that story setup as well.

267
00:13:56,638 --> 00:13:58,628
Yoo Ram was right.

268
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:00,208
 

269
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,828
Each of your roles were so well-defined.

270
00:14:03,828 --> 00:14:05,468
And they were so harmonious.

271
00:14:05,468 --> 00:14:08,788
To take a look at each of your roles,

272
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:11,778
we did our own analysis. Let's take a look at the video.

273
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:15,988
Now, as the sixth member of Taxi Driver...

274
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,328
They're my sunbaenims at work.

275
00:14:18,328 --> 00:14:22,998
I will analyze five members of Rainbow Transportation Service in detail.

276
00:14:22,998 --> 00:14:25,538
 

277
00:14:25,538 --> 00:14:28,758
The first thing that comes to mind when I think of Do Gi

278
00:14:28,758 --> 00:14:32,318
is the intense fighting power, no matter what others say.

279
00:14:32,318 --> 00:14:34,718
 You guys need a beating. 

280
00:14:36,368 --> 00:14:38,728
 

281
00:14:38,728 --> 00:14:40,758
 
That's one against how many?

282
00:14:43,018 --> 00:14:45,378
He went through a lot doing all that.

283
00:14:46,768 --> 00:14:50,718
It must've been so tough to film that scene.

284
00:14:52,988 --> 00:14:55,158
 

285
00:14:56,268 --> 00:15:00,258
It's an unbelievable character when you watch only his action scenes.

286
00:15:00,258 --> 00:15:03,748
But Do Gi's true ability is something else.

287
00:15:03,748 --> 00:15:06,438
Do you know what it is, by chance?

288
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:09,308
 

289
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,088
 
 You know what they say. 

290
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:13,508
 "The crime scene 

291
00:15:13,508 --> 00:15:15,638
 knows the truth." 

292
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:19,048
 
 But a car suddenly came in. What should I do? 

293
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:20,218
 I see... 

294
00:15:20,218 --> 00:15:23,368
 They sell touch-up pens at car supply stores for 20,000 won. 

295
00:15:23,368 --> 00:15:24,998
 You can just cover it up with that. 

296
00:15:24,998 --> 00:15:27,568
 Meperidine hydrochloride was found in it. 

297
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:29,358
 
 Meperidine hydrochloride? 

298
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:31,308
 It's an opioid pain treatment. 

299
00:15:31,308 --> 00:15:33,788
- He knows everything!
 - It's usually for severely ill cancer patients. 

300
00:15:33,788 --> 00:15:35,518
But I don't know.

301
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,298
 Would they have kept that record? 

302
00:15:37,298 --> 00:15:39,148
 I would've gotten rid of it myself. 

303
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:42,628
 
 Medical records have to be kept for 10 years by law. 

304
00:15:42,628 --> 00:15:44,418
 Is it a chemical symbol? 

305
00:15:44,418 --> 00:15:47,898
 
 Trinitrotoluene. In short, it's called TNT. 

306
00:15:47,898 --> 00:15:51,828
- Now that we see them all together...
- He knows so much.

307
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:53,258
 

308
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:54,518
 He's a genius. 

309
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:58,368
 The clue is probably over there. 

310
00:15:58,368 --> 00:15:59,748
 

311
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:01,858
 It's a drawing of her playing in the playground in the rain. 

312
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:03,728
 It's not raining. 

313
00:16:03,728 --> 00:16:05,328
 She drew prison bars. 

314
00:16:05,328 --> 00:16:08,568
 
 - Prison bars?
- She's not playing in the playground. 

315
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,688
 She's watching them. 
 

316
00:16:10,688 --> 00:16:13,558
 
 

317
00:16:14,628 --> 00:16:16,918
 He has the face of a national traitor. 

318
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:18,208
 

319
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:24,058
 
 - He's not one to give up until you die. 
- National traitor...

320
00:16:24,058 --> 00:16:26,458
Those production crew...

321
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,248
 
 Would you like some coffee? 

322
00:16:30,338 --> 00:16:32,338
 

323
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:35,094
 How did you know I was here? 

324
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,008
 I thought you might be here to see your sister. 

325
00:16:38,008 --> 00:16:41,138
 

326
00:16:41,138 --> 00:16:42,698
However...

327
00:16:42,698 --> 00:16:47,498
one surprising aspect was discovered while we were analyzing Taxi Driver characters.

328
00:16:47,498 --> 00:16:50,988
That is the fact that there exists the most powerful one

329
00:16:50,988 --> 00:16:53,498
inside the Taxi Driver universe worldview.

330
00:16:53,498 --> 00:16:55,288
 - The ones who know her did.
- Like who? 

331
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:57,768
 - There's only Go Eun. 
- Me?

332
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:01,258
 
 That person is Ahn Go Eun! 

333
00:17:01,258 --> 00:17:06,368
To bad guys, Go Eun's existence is frightening.

334
00:17:06,368 --> 00:17:08,918
 
As you know, she's a genius hacker.

335
00:17:08,918 --> 00:17:10,378
 

336
00:17:10,378 --> 00:17:13,108
I heard you normally use two fingers.

337
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:15,358
- Gosh, no.
 - Game over. 

338
00:17:15,358 --> 00:17:18,628
 
In Season 2, she even added martial arts skills.

339
00:17:19,648 --> 00:17:21,138
You!

340
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:28,498
Nice...

341
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:33,118
I forgot to turn this in.

342
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:37,618
 
And Rainbow Transportation Service people are also scared of her.

343
00:17:37,618 --> 00:17:39,678
 What are you doing in my seat, Mr. Jang? 

344
00:17:39,678 --> 00:17:40,998
 

345
00:17:40,998 --> 00:17:44,108
 Huh? Oh, I'm in the office right now. 

346
00:17:44,108 --> 00:17:47,878
 You're not in the office. You're sitting in my seat right now- 

347
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,368
I just hung up on her...

348
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:56,028
 
 Were you guys playing hooky again? 

349
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:59,408
 We weren't playing hooky. We just had extra time... 

350
00:18:02,658 --> 00:18:04,768
 You're so bad. 

351
00:18:04,768 --> 00:18:05,998
 You're really a bad person. 

352
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:08,278
 

353
00:18:11,488 --> 00:18:14,218
 
 I think it's time to make a move. 

354
00:18:20,508 --> 00:18:22,328
 I'm ready. 

355
00:18:22,328 --> 00:18:24,508
 

356
00:18:28,778 --> 00:18:30,968
 The more I get to know her, the scarier she is. 

357
00:18:30,968 --> 00:18:33,258
I really love this role.

358
00:18:34,138 --> 00:18:38,498
And going back and forth between high-tech and analog,

359
00:18:38,498 --> 00:18:39,878
they are Kim Do Gi's...

360
00:18:39,878 --> 00:18:41,188
 Become my hands and feet. 

361
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:44,968
Two managers became his right and left hands.

362
00:18:44,968 --> 00:18:47,308
 Okay! Just leave it to us. 

363
00:18:47,308 --> 00:18:50,668
I had given them their nickname.

364
00:18:50,668 --> 00:18:53,478
 They seem idiotic, yet they're geniuses. What should we call them? 

365
00:18:53,478 --> 00:18:55,808
 - Smart Fools?
- Smart Fools! 

366
00:18:55,808 --> 00:18:59,568
To give you another nickname,

367
00:18:59,568 --> 00:19:01,648
I'll say "Invisible Hand."

368
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:05,228
By chance, have you thought about this?

369
00:19:08,418 --> 00:19:09,808
Oh, the newlywed...

370
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:12,948
 Who do you think blew all those balloons? 

371
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:20,338
 And these flags. Who do you think put them all there? 

372
00:19:20,338 --> 00:19:21,868
Right...

373
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:26,448
 Poop... 

374
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:29,028
 - And this poop! 
 - Why is there poop... in here... 

375
00:19:29,028 --> 00:19:31,558
- Is this how far we're taking this?
- Did you guys poop yourselves?

376
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:33,728
 Who do you think put them there? 

377
00:19:33,728 --> 00:19:36,298
Impressive!

378
00:19:36,298 --> 00:19:39,108
 Motorcycles and Vietnamese police uniform. 

379
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:41,018
 Who do you think got all these things? 

380
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:43,478
 Don't shoot. Whatever you do, don't shoot. 

381
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:47,008
These two people are the busiest people in Rainbow Transporation Services.

382
00:19:47,008 --> 00:19:48,398
 - Right.
- That is true. 

383
00:19:48,398 --> 00:19:50,828
They work hard even when people aren't looking.

384
00:19:50,828 --> 00:19:53,908
So there are side effects at times.

385
00:19:53,908 --> 00:19:56,418
 - Hyungnim.
- Huh? 

386
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:59,198
 - You know what?
- What? 

387
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,308
 Pure White Land. 

388
00:20:02,308 --> 00:20:05,418
 It might actually exist. 

389
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:07,668
And lastly!

390
00:20:07,668 --> 00:20:10,998
As for CEO Jang Sung Cheol of Rainbow Transportation Service,

391
00:20:10,998 --> 00:20:15,308
Do Gi personally analyzed him for us.

392
00:20:15,308 --> 00:20:19,428
He's the elderly specialist actor.

393
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:24,168
 

394
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:27,308
I'm just an old man.

395
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:29,548
It was so funny that time, too.

396
00:20:29,548 --> 00:20:32,888
 

397
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:36,838
 Grandpa, you came all the way out here? 

398
00:20:36,838 --> 00:20:38,388
The old man, Mr. Jang.

399
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:41,988
 

400
00:20:41,988 --> 00:20:43,778
 Aigoo! Help him. 

401
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:48,018
 - Please walk slowly. 
- His luxury shoes were really funny.

402
00:20:48,018 --> 00:20:52,218
- I can't stop walking.
- Aigoo, what should you do?

403
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:54,828
Oh! What are these?

404
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:57,748
Oh, my. Look at the granny.

405
00:20:57,748 --> 00:21:00,588
 
Granny has a mustache.

406
00:21:00,588 --> 00:21:02,968
 

407
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:04,988
I didn't see that.

408
00:21:04,988 --> 00:21:07,318
 

409
00:21:10,908 --> 00:21:13,058
 

410
00:21:13,058 --> 00:21:17,388
As an elderly specialist actor, he was remarkable in revenge scenes.

411
00:21:17,388 --> 00:21:21,728
 
This is the reason for the existence of Mr. Jang.

412
00:21:21,728 --> 00:21:25,828
 I think she was more afraid of her son's suffering than hers. 

413
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:29,528
 I think we need to be extra careful this time. 

414
00:21:29,528 --> 00:21:33,968
 No matter what the truth is, it's all about the child in the end. 

415
00:21:34,998 --> 00:21:36,758
 Aigoo. 

416
00:21:36,758 --> 00:21:39,068
 Did you have a bad dream? 

417
00:21:39,068 --> 00:21:41,048
 The center balance for Rainbow Transportation Service. 

418
00:21:41,048 --> 00:21:44,298
 I believe Mr. Jang showed a portrayal of an adult 

419
00:21:44,298 --> 00:21:48,448
 that this generation needs. 

420
00:21:48,448 --> 00:21:50,598
And lastly,

421
00:21:50,598 --> 00:21:53,678
the reason why Rainbow Transportation Service must exist.

422
00:21:53,678 --> 00:21:58,918
 Someone like him, who needs help, is the reason we exist. Don't you think? 

423
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:02,818
 

424
00:22:03,968 --> 00:22:05,358
Yes...

425
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:08,818
He's so good.

426
00:22:08,818 --> 00:22:11,208
Seeing the way it's edited like that,

427
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,648
it seems like Kim Do Gi

428
00:22:13,648 --> 00:22:16,201
really knows everything.

429
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:19,331
That's also true, but he doesn't let it be known.

430
00:22:20,228 --> 00:22:23,428
I didn't realize he would have that much common knowledge.

431
00:22:23,428 --> 00:22:26,348
No matter how smart Mr. Kim Do Gi is,

432
00:22:26,348 --> 00:22:30,168
there was Ye Jin about his head.

433
00:22:30,168 --> 00:22:33,958
The video says she's the most powerful one.. Do you agree?

434
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:38,798
Yes, I only thought she was bold in Season 1.

435
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:41,018
But in Season 2, she got stronger and stronger

436
00:22:41,018 --> 00:22:43,928
and eventually became truly the powerful one.

437
00:22:43,928 --> 00:22:45,778
Then who was the weakest one in contrast?

438
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:48,488
Why are you looking at me?

439
00:22:48,488 --> 00:22:51,628
- You already decided on the answer.
- I thought we were doing the wave.

440
00:22:51,628 --> 00:22:52,868
When I mentioned "the weakest,"

441
00:22:52,868 --> 00:22:55,838
starting with Eui Sung, everyone turned that way.

442
00:22:55,838 --> 00:22:57,848
Then who was the weakest one in contrast?

443
00:22:57,848 --> 00:23:02,488
 

444
00:23:02,488 --> 00:23:05,618
I have good reactions, so even though he's younger than me...

445
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:08,258
- Don't talk too long.
- Yes.

446
00:23:08,258 --> 00:23:11,578
When he said he was an elderly specialist actor,

447
00:23:11,578 --> 00:23:13,878
Kim Eui Sung said, "No, I'm just an old man."

448
00:23:13,878 --> 00:23:16,338
You are not an old man.

449
00:23:16,338 --> 00:23:20,428
Especially when he played the role of an old man...

450
00:23:20,428 --> 00:23:24,208
 - Hundred dollars. 
- He often brings out $100 bills.

451
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:27,398
- I wanted to live like that.
- Me, too.

452
00:23:27,398 --> 00:23:29,148
The atmosphere on set is very important, isn't it?

453
00:23:29,148 --> 00:23:32,498
 Who plays the role of a mood maker? 

454
00:23:33,988 --> 00:23:35,908
 

455
00:23:35,908 --> 00:23:36,958
 

456
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:40,078
He made the set atmosphere so warm and friendly.

457
00:23:40,078 --> 00:23:42,248
Je Hoon...

458
00:23:42,248 --> 00:23:46,188
He's so flippant...

459
00:23:46,188 --> 00:23:48,408
 
Too much... Look at him.

460
00:23:48,408 --> 00:23:50,678
He's doing this all day.

461
00:23:50,678 --> 00:23:52,298
It's Mr. Kim Do Gi.

462
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:54,568
- He was like this all day long.
- On the set, too.

463
00:23:54,568 --> 00:23:57,688
It's good at first, but if you see that too long...

464
00:23:57,688 --> 00:24:02,288
In Taxi Driver, he acts like, "I'm so sorry!"

465
00:24:02,288 --> 00:24:04,188
I thought he was good at acting like that, too.

466
00:24:04,188 --> 00:24:06,938
- But he's normally like that, too.
- It's painful to watch.

467
00:24:06,938 --> 00:24:11,098
 The dead man is back. The ghost is driving! 

468
00:24:11,098 --> 00:24:12,508
 

469
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:16,218
 

470
00:24:16,218 --> 00:24:17,698
Did you get the result?

471
00:24:17,698 --> 00:24:19,898
 

472
00:24:19,898 --> 00:24:22,558
At this rate, your second character is when you're serious.

473
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:24,508
That can be true. You're right.

474
00:24:24,508 --> 00:24:29,688
There were many scenes where Kim Do Gi acts alone or did action scenes.

475
00:24:29,688 --> 00:24:33,298
I was so excited and happy when we were all together.

476
00:24:33,298 --> 00:24:39,318
But actually, you may not know yourselves that well.

477
00:24:39,318 --> 00:24:43,428
What the staff sees can be relatively accurate.

478
00:24:43,428 --> 00:24:46,828
- This is scary.
- How the staff members

479
00:24:46,828 --> 00:24:51,038
who moved with you on the set thought of you.

480
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:52,238
 

481
00:24:52,238 --> 00:24:54,488
- But...
- Are you nervous?

482
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,538
I'm sure they were good to us, right?

483
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,898
But when I heard from the staff,

484
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,158
they all went along with it because of the set atmosphere.

485
00:25:02,158 --> 00:25:05,808
But during the interview, after the drama was over, the mood was a bit...

486
00:25:05,808 --> 00:25:06,908
 

487
00:25:06,908 --> 00:25:08,138
 

488
00:25:08,138 --> 00:25:11,808
- Who is it?
- We said you can't be too explicit for it to air.

489
00:25:11,808 --> 00:25:13,968
So we edited and edited a lot.

490
00:25:13,968 --> 00:25:16,188
We carefully selected only what is suitable for broadcasting.

491
00:25:16,188 --> 00:25:18,788
As long as they have enough to show on TV.

492
00:25:18,788 --> 00:25:21,728
I think I can guess who it is.

493
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:25,218
We have to mix carrots and sticks.

494
00:25:25,218 --> 00:25:28,268
There's a fun quiz in between. If you answer the quiz correctly,

495
00:25:28,268 --> 00:25:30,088
- we'll give you a prize.
- Oh, my!

496
00:25:30,088 --> 00:25:31,598
It's an amazing prize.

497
00:25:31,598 --> 00:25:34,838
- You can look forward to it.
- Shall we look at the prize first?

498
00:25:34,838 --> 00:25:36,868
Let's take a look at the prize in the video.

499
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,148
 

500
00:25:39,148 --> 00:25:40,518
 Dispatch complete. 

501
00:25:40,518 --> 00:25:42,398
 Good job, everyone. 

502
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:45,188
 

503
00:25:45,188 --> 00:25:48,418
 Premium hanwoo.* 
(High quality Korean beef)

504
00:25:48,418 --> 00:25:52,438
 We have no choice but to eat the hanwoo everyone wants. 

505
00:25:52,438 --> 00:25:54,768
 When you feel weak, go for hanwoo! 

506
00:25:54,768 --> 00:25:58,368
-  Let's go with hanwoo. Let's get it, hanwoo. 
- Really?

507
00:25:58,368 --> 00:26:00,608
 

508
00:26:00,608 --> 00:26:03,528
- Whoa!
- Really!

509
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:06,348
It's a real premium set of hanwoo.

510
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:07,868
Out of Rainbow Transportation Service members,

511
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:10,988
who will be the lucky one to take home the nutritious

512
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:14,618
hanwoo set to enhance physical strength and immune system?

513
00:26:14,618 --> 00:26:17,588
Since you kept mentioning it in the drama,

514
00:26:17,588 --> 00:26:20,268
we prepared premium hanwoo.

515
00:26:20,268 --> 00:26:22,798
One person can take them all, right?

516
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:25,668
- Blazing!
- Let me tell you how we'll do the quiz.

517
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:27,628
Whenever you get the correct answer,

518
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:31,428
you get a chance to put in a ball with your name on it.

519
00:26:31,428 --> 00:26:36,118
- Put as many as you can.
- You don't get the hanwoo set for putting the ball in.

520
00:26:36,118 --> 00:26:37,488
- Draw a ball?
- That's right.

521
00:26:37,488 --> 00:26:39,588
The probability increases.

522
00:26:39,588 --> 00:26:42,458
- Then, the probability increases.
- Right, right.

523
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:47,408
Let's see who will be the first staff member.

524
00:26:47,408 --> 00:26:51,258
Hello, I'm Yoon Dae Won, the martial arts director of Taxi Driver 2.

525
00:26:51,258 --> 00:26:53,138
Nice to meet you.

526
00:26:54,158 --> 00:26:55,618
Since I'm a martial arts director,

527
00:26:55,618 --> 00:26:59,478
I especially worked with Lee Je Hoon a lot.

528
00:26:59,478 --> 00:27:03,918
Even if it's dangerous, he said he would do it himself.

529
00:27:03,918 --> 00:27:05,938
Something like this happened one time.

530
00:27:05,938 --> 00:27:11,348
In Episode 1, it was *** scene.

531
00:27:11,348 --> 00:27:14,238
After he finished the challenging scene,

532
00:27:14,238 --> 00:27:17,188
he acted like, "Did you see me? I did it."

533
00:27:17,188 --> 00:27:19,018
He was so satisfied with himself.

534
00:27:19,018 --> 00:27:22,208
 

535
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:26,138
In Episode 1, what was the scene

536
00:27:26,138 --> 00:27:31,098
where Je Hoon was so proud and happy?

537
00:27:31,098 --> 00:27:33,638
- Please go ahead.
- Yes, Yoo Ram.

538
00:27:33,638 --> 00:27:38,668
After Hyung did it, I think he told us, "I did it!"

539
00:27:38,668 --> 00:27:40,868
I think it was the drift scene.

540
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:43,928
Did he do the drift himself?

541
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:47,408
- After the escape scene in Episode 1...
- Right.

542
00:27:47,408 --> 00:27:49,628
- the car flipped over and...
- What kind of car flipped?

543
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:51,648
- The prison van...
- The prison van flipped over and...

544
00:27:51,648 --> 00:27:54,468
and the prisoners came out. And to take them, Hyung...

545
00:27:54,468 --> 00:27:56,608
does the drift and arrives right there.

546
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,258
But he drove it himself and did it in one shot.

547
00:27:59,258 --> 00:28:00,988
- That's right.
- Wow...

548
00:28:00,988 --> 00:28:02,728
Anyone else?

549
00:28:02,728 --> 00:28:04,088
 

550
00:28:04,088 --> 00:28:08,658
So he didn't have much to brag about except that scene?

551
00:28:08,658 --> 00:28:11,058
So, was it really that scene, as Yoo Ram said?

552
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:12,268
Let's check the answer.

553
00:28:12,268 --> 00:28:14,618
In Episode 1, the prison van flips over and

554
00:28:14,618 --> 00:28:17,688
- the Premium Taxi shows up for the first time.
- He was precise.

555
00:28:17,688 --> 00:28:20,558
Other staff members said to take the scene separately

556
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:22,778
and connect the scenes in the editing process.

557
00:28:22,778 --> 00:28:25,358
But Lee Je Hoon practiced that

558
00:28:25,358 --> 00:28:28,408
and did it in one shot! So cool!

559
00:28:28,408 --> 00:28:33,308
 

560
00:28:33,308 --> 00:28:37,478
 

561
00:28:37,478 --> 00:28:40,188
 Get in! Right now! 

562
00:28:41,698 --> 00:28:44,288
It's late, but Do Gi hyung, I'll give you that!

563
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:47,308
You were so cool!

564
00:28:48,748 --> 00:28:50,088
 

565
00:28:50,088 --> 00:28:52,008
So, that's how it was possible.

566
00:28:52,008 --> 00:28:55,258
The camera zoomed and turned like that.

567
00:28:55,258 --> 00:28:57,298
And you were sitting there in one take.

568
00:28:57,298 --> 00:28:58,968
It was so neat.

569
00:28:58,968 --> 00:29:02,068
Well, I did it because the martial art director told me to.

570
00:29:02,068 --> 00:29:04,398
He said he didn't make you.

571
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:06,218
He said he told you not to do it.

572
00:29:06,218 --> 00:29:08,138
Why did you do it?

573
00:29:08,138 --> 00:29:10,168
If you don't do it in one-take,

574
00:29:10,168 --> 00:29:12,968
people would say, "Someone else took that shot."

575
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:14,258
"They cut it and put it together."

576
00:29:14,258 --> 00:29:16,288
Did you want to show everyone that you did it?

577
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:19,108
How about his voice? "Get in! Right now!"

578
00:29:19,108 --> 00:29:21,908
- So confident.
- His voice comes from deep down.

579
00:29:21,908 --> 00:29:24,008
But there must've been a lot of retakes.

580
00:29:24,008 --> 00:29:26,258
I hardly had any NGs.

581
00:29:26,258 --> 00:29:28,748
The camera just couldn't keep up with me.

582
00:29:28,748 --> 00:29:30,178
 

583
00:29:30,178 --> 00:29:31,858
 

584
00:29:31,858 --> 00:29:35,808
Still, due to safety issues...

585
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:39,188
The martial arts director was considering the safety of the film crew, but he had no clue...

586
00:29:39,188 --> 00:29:42,318
 

587
00:29:42,318 --> 00:29:44,608
And I insisted on doing it.

588
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:49,258
Director Yoon did a superb job putting together all the action sequences.

589
00:29:49,258 --> 00:29:52,968
Kim Do Gi was able to look much stronger

590
00:29:52,968 --> 00:29:57,328
and did such cool action scenes. Thank you so much.

591
00:29:58,328 --> 00:30:03,568
Let's watch a video from another staff from the set.

592
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:06,368
 
 Hello, I'm from the Taxi Driver makeup team. 

593
00:30:06,368 --> 00:30:09,118
 I have a lot to say about Rainbow Transportation Service. 

594
00:30:09,118 --> 00:30:11,448
 It was a very busy day. 

595
00:30:11,448 --> 00:30:15,098
 It was an out-of-town shoot, and I had a lot to prepare for the makeup. It was chaotic. 

596
00:30:15,098 --> 00:30:17,838
 And actor Jang Hyuk Jin threw *** at us and walked away. 

597
00:30:17,838 --> 00:30:20,808
 

598
00:30:20,808 --> 00:30:24,148
I don't think he remembers, either.

599
00:30:24,148 --> 00:30:26,608
- Did you cuss?
- Cuss...

600
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:31,008
We can record this for now. We'll decide whether we air it or not later...

601
00:30:31,008 --> 00:30:35,238
Because you can't throw things at people...

602
00:30:35,238 --> 00:30:36,858
You may not remember, but...

603
00:30:36,858 --> 00:30:39,908
it could be a painful memory for the victim...

604
00:30:39,908 --> 00:30:43,508
Oh, maybe... is it his wig?

605
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,908
He wore a permed hair wig.

606
00:30:45,908 --> 00:30:51,068
- A wig?
- I think I left them a snack filled with love.

607
00:30:51,068 --> 00:30:52,768
Oh, snack...

608
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:55,178
He tells a good story about himself.

609
00:30:55,178 --> 00:30:59,388
- You told your own story.
- I told you earlier. My shoulders are up high.

610
00:30:59,388 --> 00:31:00,718
Is it correct?

611
00:31:00,718 --> 00:31:03,918
 Jang Hyuk Jin threw a shopping bag at us. 

612
00:31:03,918 --> 00:31:05,558
 I looked inside to see what was there. 

613
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:10,638
 It had warm and fresh rice cake from One Hundred Year Old Rice Cake House. 

614
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:12,388
 He's such a tsundere. 

615
00:31:12,388 --> 00:31:14,118
 Sunbaenim, thank you! We enjoyed it so much! 

616
00:31:14,118 --> 00:31:16,478
Aigoo...

617
00:31:16,478 --> 00:31:19,938
Gosh, really. I'm glad she enjoyed it.

618
00:31:19,938 --> 00:31:22,018
He takes such good care of the staff members.

619
00:31:22,018 --> 00:31:24,158
You had a big picture in mind.

620
00:31:24,158 --> 00:31:26,648
I had no idea.

621
00:31:26,648 --> 00:31:29,128
Anyway, you said "Snack."

622
00:31:29,128 --> 00:31:31,098
But we'll take it as a correct answer.

623
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,198
 

624
00:31:32,198 --> 00:31:36,268
Actually, the interview went longer. And we edited it out.

625
00:31:36,268 --> 00:31:41,708
She said, "Where did he get such cheap and tasty rice cake?"

626
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:44,938
- We edited it out.
- Maybe he found it on the street and threw it to them.

627
00:31:44,938 --> 00:31:47,508
I thought he meant he really picked it up.

628
00:31:47,508 --> 00:31:49,958
Or maybe it expired a while ago.

629
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:52,178
Is the rice cake 100 years old?

630
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:55,058
 

631
00:31:55,058 --> 00:31:56,768
 

632
00:31:56,768 --> 00:31:58,808
They asked, "Was it supposed to be that hard?"

633
00:31:58,808 --> 00:32:00,838
 

634
00:32:00,838 --> 00:32:03,248
Let us continue and watch some more.

635
00:32:03,248 --> 00:32:05,788
I'm the VFX supervisor, Sung Hyung Joo.

636
00:32:05,788 --> 00:32:09,388
There was pretty heavy CG work in Taxi Driver 2.

637
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:10,888
 

638
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,698
 As if the bullet trajectory was visible, 

639
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:15,958
 it's a scene where it's obvious that it's CG work. 

640
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:20,458
 Or turning the South Sea into Ha Long Bay. 

641
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:24,828
 We also had to transform the Incheon Chinatown into a Vietnam street using CG. 

642
00:32:24,828 --> 00:32:28,528
The scene that took us the longest is where a bus turns over in Episode 1.

643
00:32:28,528 --> 00:32:31,088
One, two, three!

644
00:32:31,088 --> 00:32:35,048
 Our plan was for the bus to fall back straight. 

645
00:32:36,118 --> 00:32:37,848
 But it fell on its side. 

646
00:32:37,848 --> 00:32:40,838
So, for us to recreate the scene the way the director wanted,

647
00:32:40,838 --> 00:32:42,758
I think it took around three months.

648
00:32:42,758 --> 00:32:47,998
And for one month, we worked to adjust *** scene with the director.

649
00:32:47,998 --> 00:32:50,848
 

650
00:32:50,848 --> 00:32:54,188
So, even the viewers are going...

651
00:32:54,188 --> 00:32:57,448
"It took three months to do that work?"

652
00:32:57,448 --> 00:33:01,408
Did you know that it took close to three months to do that type of work?

653
00:33:01,408 --> 00:33:04,118
I had no idea that it took that long.

654
00:33:04,118 --> 00:33:09,898
And because of some detail, he had to work with the director

655
00:33:09,898 --> 00:33:12,678
- for about a month.
- Probably to adjust the guarantee?

656
00:33:12,678 --> 00:33:15,068
Oh, right.

657
00:33:15,068 --> 00:33:17,608
"We can't do it for this much!"

658
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,118
"This is different from what we agreed!"

659
00:33:21,118 --> 00:33:24,268
Try to create it with CG!

660
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:27,498
- So precisely.
- I'm doing only the amount of work matching the pay!

661
00:33:27,498 --> 00:33:30,288
 

662
00:33:30,288 --> 00:33:33,458
What was it that they needed a month to work on it?

663
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:36,578
If you see the screen, you'll see a hint. There was a hint.

664
00:33:36,578 --> 00:33:38,198
 

665
00:33:38,198 --> 00:33:40,938
- Answer.
- Answer?

666
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:42,448
The dust wind.

667
00:33:42,448 --> 00:33:43,908
What's dust wind?

668
00:33:43,908 --> 00:33:48,888
When the bus fell, you know the dust does this. Did it take a month to adjust the sand?

669
00:33:48,888 --> 00:33:51,868
Why would it take a month for the dust?

670
00:33:51,868 --> 00:33:53,948
I think the guarantee is a better guess...

671
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,498
I think it's more convincing.

672
00:33:55,498 --> 00:33:57,598
I guess not, then.

673
00:33:57,598 --> 00:34:00,728
I mean... if he guesses it so soon...

674
00:34:00,728 --> 00:34:03,408
 

675
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:06,528
- Really?
- You really do know everything!

676
00:34:06,528 --> 00:34:11,958
And for about a month, I worked with the director to adjust the amount of dust on the bus.

677
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:16,288
- I got the chills.
- I thought there should be lots of dust for the size of the bus.

678
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:21,098
But the director said he wants to bus that's flipping to show up better.

679
00:34:21,098 --> 00:34:23,738
 

680
00:34:28,508 --> 00:34:33,208
 I was working with the director to figure out the right amount of dirt. 

681
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:38,838
It was tough then, but I think it looked good when I watched the drama. So I'm proud.

682
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:41,438
- It came out so nicely.
- It seemed so real!

683
00:34:41,438 --> 00:34:45,788
When I watched that, I thought it looked just like a movie.

684
00:34:45,788 --> 00:34:48,828
Yes, they received a lot in guarantee, right?

685
00:34:48,828 --> 00:34:50,948
They adjusted even details like that, I see.

686
00:34:50,948 --> 00:34:53,108
Then, let's look at the next quiz.

687
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:55,598
 Actor Bae Yoo Ram is so different from his image. 

688
00:34:55,598 --> 00:34:58,078
 - He's nothing like what we imagined.
- She talks a lot. 

689
00:34:58,078 --> 00:35:01,848
 While we were putting on makeup, he knew *** all of it. 

690
00:35:01,848 --> 00:35:04,358
 

691
00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:05,678
 

692
00:35:05,678 --> 00:35:12,268
Bae Yoo Ram isn't the actor that fits his image...

693
00:35:12,268 --> 00:35:14,138
What is my image?

694
00:35:14,138 --> 00:35:16,368
- What's my image?
- Someone who doesn't know anything?

695
00:35:16,368 --> 00:35:17,848
 

696
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:22,688
But you knew everything about something while putting makeup on?

697
00:35:25,638 --> 00:35:29,408
The latest idols' song.

698
00:35:30,308 --> 00:35:34,268
When I saw him raise his hand, I thought he'd say "multiplication table."

699
00:35:34,268 --> 00:35:38,198
When we're putting makeup on, and the makeup team turns the music on, he sings with them.

700
00:35:38,198 --> 00:35:41,658
Or he even looks it up himself on the phone and

701
00:35:41,658 --> 00:35:45,108
I just sing along when I'm getting makeup done.

702
00:35:45,108 --> 00:35:48,318
- Shaking his body, too, right?
- Is that right?

703
00:35:48,318 --> 00:35:52,198
 We turn on the latest songs while doing makeup. And he knew all the songs. 

704
00:35:52,198 --> 00:35:54,968
That was the correct answer.

705
00:35:54,968 --> 00:35:57,068
Do you have a favorite idol group?

706
00:35:57,068 --> 00:35:58,958
NewJeans.

707
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:01,028
No hesitation.

708
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:08,288
They're amazing, but still...

709
00:36:08,288 --> 00:36:11,418
- If you turn on "Ditto," he'll dance, too.
- No, no...

710
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:13,608
Really?

711
00:36:13,608 --> 00:36:16,018
 

712
00:36:16,018 --> 00:36:18,108
Suddenly?

713
00:36:18,108 --> 00:36:22,038
 

714
00:36:22,038 --> 00:36:23,878
You didn't say anything about this!

715
00:36:23,878 --> 00:36:28,048
In front of the sunbaenims, and the viewers, just a little bit...

716
00:36:28,048 --> 00:36:31,078
 

717
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:36,688
 

718
00:36:39,788 --> 00:36:41,368
Please come to the front.

719
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:43,338
 

720
00:36:44,948 --> 00:36:46,528
He's good.

721
00:36:47,508 --> 00:36:49,948
Geez, this is crazy.

722
00:36:49,948 --> 00:36:52,818
 

723
00:36:52,818 --> 00:36:56,008
You dance kind of like Shin Dong Yeob.

724
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:58,848
I grew up watching him.

725
00:36:58,848 --> 00:37:01,838
Jang Hyuk Jin did get the correct answer.

726
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:04,208
But since you danced a little bit,

727
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:07,438
as the MC, I'll give you a lucky ball...

728
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:10,198
I told them to turn it on!

729
00:37:10,198 --> 00:37:13,948
- Thank you.
- Then, I will give one to Kim Eui Sung.

730
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:16,388
He doesn't do stuff like that!

731
00:37:17,738 --> 00:37:20,358
He laughs it off but doesn't give in...

732
00:37:20,358 --> 00:37:21,788
I see hanwoo right in front of me.

733
00:37:21,788 --> 00:37:24,208
Because hanwoo is right in front of him.

734
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,628
Shall we go to the next quiz?

735
00:37:25,628 --> 00:37:29,588
Hello, I'm Kim Joon Beom, a synchronous recording director for Taxi Driver 2.

736
00:37:29,588 --> 00:37:33,748
Taxi Driver 2 had great actors and veteran staff members,

737
00:37:33,748 --> 00:37:35,608
so I had a great time working on it.

738
00:37:35,608 --> 00:37:39,808
If I were to pick the most meaningful scene as the synchronous recording director is...

739
00:37:39,808 --> 00:37:42,008
*** scene.

740
00:37:42,008 --> 00:37:44,088
 

741
00:37:44,088 --> 00:37:46,208
- Whoa, this is too hard.
- Is there a hint?

742
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:48,278
- This is too hard.
- Too hard.

743
00:37:48,278 --> 00:37:51,028
We're doing this to have fun, right?

744
00:37:51,028 --> 00:37:53,038
But he's so serious.

745
00:37:53,038 --> 00:37:57,508
- So hard.
- Don't talk about fun with hanwoo on the line.

746
00:37:57,508 --> 00:38:00,048
When we recorded in Ulsan,

747
00:38:00,048 --> 00:38:06,408
we captured the sound of nature with a mic.

748
00:38:07,858 --> 00:38:11,478
 

749
00:38:13,038 --> 00:38:14,718
 

750
00:38:14,718 --> 00:38:18,388
 I thought that scene came out so beautifully. 

751
00:38:18,388 --> 00:38:20,108
 Seeing such a scene... 

752
00:38:20,108 --> 00:38:24,098
But I don't think that director is all that sentimental...

753
00:38:24,098 --> 00:38:25,768
He's not all that sentimental...

754
00:38:25,768 --> 00:38:30,198
For me, on Pure White Land, when Bae Yoo Ram

755
00:38:30,198 --> 00:38:32,958
also had to experience a lot of pain.

756
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:37,348
 Mr. Kim Do Gi, I've never been hit this much in my life. 

757
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:42,308
I think I heard that he was very satisfied watching that scene.

758
00:38:42,308 --> 00:38:43,808
At the sound of him getting hit?

759
00:38:43,808 --> 00:38:45,768
The sound of getting beat up?

760
00:38:45,768 --> 00:38:48,338
Yes, when he's getting hit...

761
00:38:48,338 --> 00:38:50,118
As for me,

762
00:38:50,118 --> 00:38:52,588
when we were filming Black Sun scenes,

763
00:38:52,588 --> 00:38:56,448
the scene where people had to dance without music. Isn't it something like that?

764
00:38:59,058 --> 00:39:03,448
 In scenes where they're dancing and partying, 

765
00:39:03,448 --> 00:39:04,988
 you can't turn on any type of music. 

766
00:39:04,988 --> 00:39:06,908
 - It's very quiet.
- Silence. 

767
00:39:06,908 --> 00:39:09,278
 

768
00:39:09,278 --> 00:39:12,688
"Wow, it's not easy to make money..."

769
00:39:12,688 --> 00:39:15,288
- You don't turn on any music, right?
- Right.

770
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:17,738
More than that, if it weren't for this scene,

771
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:20,728
I don't think you could see this person like this...

772
00:39:20,728 --> 00:39:24,468
Pyo Ye Jin, I think you should get this one right.

773
00:39:24,468 --> 00:39:26,928
Is it Ye Jin singing?

774
00:39:28,618 --> 00:39:30,168
That's the answer!

775
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,208
Really?

776
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:36,448
If I were to pick the most meaningful scene as the synchronous recording director is...

777
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:39,198
the scene where Pyo Ye Jin sings.

778
00:39:39,198 --> 00:39:41,148
First, Pyo Ye Jin sings so well.

779
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:44,548
So, my ears were so happy when I had my headphone on.

780
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,598
We were able to see another charming point of Pyo Ye Jin.

781
00:39:47,598 --> 00:39:49,848
It was surprising and entertaining.

782
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:54,178
I'm glad that I was able to make a meaningful drama that I could identify with the viewers.

783
00:39:54,178 --> 00:39:55,878
It was my honor.

784
00:39:55,878 --> 00:39:58,498
See you in Season 3!

785
00:39:58,498 --> 00:40:00,768
Even securing his job.

786
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,488
Securing his job...

787
00:40:02,488 --> 00:40:05,298
I heard the singing scene was very difficult for you.

788
00:40:05,298 --> 00:40:08,148
It was your first time singing without drinking, right?

789
00:40:08,148 --> 00:40:09,958
I had to sing sober...

790
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:12,528
She was doing this in the back...

791
00:40:12,528 --> 00:40:13,688
I think it was water, though.

792
00:40:13,688 --> 00:40:15,618
I'm sure she drank water to loosen up her throat.

793
00:40:15,618 --> 00:40:17,588
But she was drinking out of a small shot glass.

794
00:40:17,588 --> 00:40:18,908
What a professional.

795
00:40:18,908 --> 00:40:21,838
During the day. Sober.

796
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:27,028
 

797
00:40:27,028 --> 00:40:28,808
 You sing so well! 

798
00:40:28,808 --> 00:40:31,068
 We recorded twice. 

799
00:40:31,068 --> 00:40:32,408
 You did well. 

800
00:40:33,638 --> 00:40:36,358
 

801
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:39,248
 I heard you came up with the dance moves, too. 

802
00:40:39,248 --> 00:40:42,518
 - She came up with it.
- Slightly. Just like song gestures. 

803
00:40:45,198 --> 00:40:46,688
 Here we go. $100 bill. 

804
00:40:46,688 --> 00:40:48,588
Here he goes. A symbol of wealth.

805
00:40:48,588 --> 00:40:51,138
 

806
00:40:52,068 --> 00:40:54,008
 A symbol of wealth. 

807
00:40:54,008 --> 00:40:57,218
 

808
00:40:57,218 --> 00:41:00,248
I don't know what the exchange rate is...

809
00:41:00,248 --> 00:41:02,568
It was an unexpected charm coming from Go Eun.

810
00:41:02,568 --> 00:41:04,998
Even in Season 1...

811
00:41:04,998 --> 00:41:08,738
 

812
00:41:10,368 --> 00:41:14,968
 

813
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:19,268
 It had been released as a song... 

814
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,718
and she made pretty good money with it.

815
00:41:21,718 --> 00:41:25,508
With the money she earned from the song, she bought us hanwoo.

816
00:41:25,508 --> 00:41:27,618
- She bought us BBQ.
- Amazing.

817
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:29,538
When Pyo Ye Jin eats with the team, they eat hanwoo.

818
00:41:29,538 --> 00:41:31,978
This is a hanwoo drama. They even say it in their lines.

819
00:41:31,978 --> 00:41:36,408
And now that we have hanwoo as a prize, all of your eyes are sparkling.

820
00:41:36,408 --> 00:41:37,498
What's the current score?

821
00:41:37,498 --> 00:41:40,338
Kim Eui Sung put in one ball.

822
00:41:40,338 --> 00:41:44,508
Lee Je Hoon has one. Jang Hyuk Jin and Bae Yoo Ram have two.

823
00:41:44,508 --> 00:41:46,008
But Ye Jin...

824
00:41:46,008 --> 00:41:48,728
I'll get the next one correct.

825
00:41:48,728 --> 00:41:50,978
- This one.
- Okay, the this video clip...

826
00:41:50,978 --> 00:41:53,608
would you like to give Ye Jin a chance?

827
00:41:53,608 --> 00:41:56,018
 

828
00:41:56,018 --> 00:41:57,168
Let's see it.

829
00:41:57,168 --> 00:41:58,588
Just because we give her a chance doesn't mean she'll get it right.

830
00:41:58,588 --> 00:42:02,588
 It was while we were putting makeup on Kim Eui Sung as an old man. 

831
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:06,528
 He suddenly asked us what if he wears *** without ***? 

832
00:42:06,528 --> 00:42:08,898
 

833
00:42:08,898 --> 00:42:12,218
He wanted *** without***.

834
00:42:12,218 --> 00:42:14,108
A wig without hair.

835
00:42:15,008 --> 00:42:17,898
You have to be precise. It's still lacking.

836
00:42:17,898 --> 00:42:21,318
- A wig without the middle?
- So what do you call that?

837
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:23,108
They say you're missing this.

838
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:25,478
Without top hair*?
(In Korean, it sounds like "thoughtless" or "insensible.")

839
00:42:25,478 --> 00:42:29,248
A wig without top hair. Correct!

840
00:42:30,408 --> 00:42:34,708
 He suddenly asked us what if he wears a wig without top hair? 

841
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:38,618
 Actually, we were going to prepare an all gray-haired wig to make him look like an old man. 

842
00:42:38,618 --> 00:42:42,638
 But he said he should look like he's in disguise and that he should look funny. 

843
00:42:42,638 --> 00:42:46,698
 He said if we made him look funny that he'd act accordingly. 

844
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:51,158
 That's when I thought, this is what a pro is like. 

845
00:42:51,158 --> 00:42:53,948
 

846
00:42:53,948 --> 00:42:58,088
You wanted to make it funny while you were at it, right?

847
00:42:58,088 --> 00:43:02,888
Actually, I was so jealous of those two managers, even from Season 1.

848
00:43:02,888 --> 00:43:05,538
They did this and that and the other. So...

849
00:43:05,538 --> 00:43:08,598
when I saw "play an old man," I thought, "Yay!"

850
00:43:08,598 --> 00:43:12,368
So asked the director if I could wear a bald head wig.

851
00:43:12,368 --> 00:43:14,908
I wanted to beat them.

852
00:43:14,908 --> 00:43:16,348
 

853
00:43:16,348 --> 00:43:19,968
That's why he was bent over all the time, so he could show that.

854
00:43:19,968 --> 00:43:22,398
After getting my makeup like that,

855
00:43:22,398 --> 00:43:26,488
 my posture became like that and I'd move my mouth in a chewing motion. 

856
00:43:26,488 --> 00:43:28,738
 And I would stick out my tongue here and there. 

857
00:43:28,738 --> 00:43:31,908
 Old Man Jang's luxury brand shoes... 

858
00:43:31,908 --> 00:43:33,448
 That old geezer's shoes are a designer brand, right? 

859
00:43:33,448 --> 00:43:34,528
 They're Gucci. 

860
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,688
 He was using a golf club as a furnace poker. 

861
00:43:36,688 --> 00:43:39,348
I actually cracked up so loudly.

862
00:43:39,348 --> 00:43:44,598
Yes, it's fun to watch their main character and side characters.

863
00:43:44,598 --> 00:43:48,158
The scene that drew a lot of attention is

864
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:50,308
the Shaman-ritual Do Gi.

865
00:43:50,858 --> 00:43:52,868
 

866
00:43:56,228 --> 00:43:59,188
 

867
00:43:59,188 --> 00:44:00,498
 

868
00:44:02,478 --> 00:44:05,028
We had a front-row seat.

869
00:44:05,028 --> 00:44:06,928
It was fun.

870
00:44:08,488 --> 00:44:10,588
 

871
00:44:10,588 --> 00:44:13,678
 After I shot that scene, 

872
00:44:13,678 --> 00:44:17,288
I got the flu. Whoa, it was so hard on me.

873
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:19,748
- Rather than fighting scenes...
- That was much harder.

874
00:44:19,748 --> 00:44:22,418
Je Hoon never says he's struggling.

875
00:44:22,418 --> 00:44:24,848
But after that scene, he said it was tough.

876
00:44:24,848 --> 00:44:29,058
For us to watch, it's only a few minutes. But it takes a long time to shoot it, right?

877
00:44:29,058 --> 00:44:31,048
It takes all day to shoot it.

878
00:44:31,048 --> 00:44:34,588
But the sunbaenim who got hit with red beans must've had it tough.

879
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:38,348
I had to actually throw the red beans while yelling, "Go away!"

880
00:44:38,348 --> 00:44:39,858
Go away!

881
00:44:39,858 --> 00:44:42,698
 - Red beans are hard, right?
- It really hurts. 

882
00:44:46,888 --> 00:44:50,008
 He said it hurt so much. He said he wanted to go home. 

883
00:44:50,008 --> 00:44:52,248
I want to go home!

884
00:44:52,248 --> 00:44:53,748
Start the car!

885
00:44:53,748 --> 00:44:55,588
Yes, I felt so bad.

886
00:44:55,588 --> 00:44:58,808
But it's not like you can cook the red beans.

887
00:45:00,168 --> 00:45:02,768
Then the red beans would stick to him.

888
00:45:02,768 --> 00:45:04,948
Right.

889
00:45:04,948 --> 00:45:08,108
It would've been worse if we had cooked the red beans.

890
00:45:08,108 --> 00:45:11,798
Now, it's the last staff video clip.

891
00:45:11,798 --> 00:45:19,558
 
 Actually, while filming Taxi Driver 2, 

892
00:45:20,628 --> 00:45:23,678
there's an actor I started to like...

893
00:45:24,678 --> 00:45:27,528
He always smiles when he sees me

894
00:45:27,528 --> 00:45:32,208
every word he says and the way he behaves is so considerate.

895
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:37,068
- Especially when we eat, he'd take care of me...
- When they eat?

896
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:40,528
So, I ended up like him without knowing.

897
00:45:41,418 --> 00:45:43,948
So I conveyed my heart...

898
00:45:45,798 --> 00:45:49,698
and confessed to him...

899
00:45:49,698 --> 00:45:54,208
but he rejected me.

900
00:45:55,308 --> 00:45:58,908
- Then he must know.
- My heart aches, but...

901
00:46:01,228 --> 00:46:05,818
if I had an opportunity, I'd like to see him again

902
00:46:05,818 --> 00:46:07,958
and talk to him.

903
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:09,968
Is it a man?

904
00:46:09,968 --> 00:46:12,988
- I think it's a woman.
- Now that I say it, I really miss him.

905
00:46:12,988 --> 00:46:15,898
- If it's a man, it's for Ye Jin.
- I think it's a woman.

906
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,958
So...

907
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:20,408
when the person says there was a confession, it's not all that straightforward.

908
00:46:20,408 --> 00:46:24,408
Slightly, I think the signal was given.

909
00:46:24,408 --> 00:46:28,298
The person slightly ignores this person...

910
00:46:28,298 --> 00:46:30,858
so when we were conducting the interview, this person almost teared up.

911
00:46:30,858 --> 00:46:33,598
Pyo Ye Jin, do you remember?

912
00:46:33,598 --> 00:46:35,018
It's not me.

913
00:46:35,018 --> 00:46:36,748
I've never received a confession.

914
00:46:36,748 --> 00:46:39,088
- Isn't it a man?
- I think it's a woman.

915
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,128
It must've been a very subtle expression.

916
00:46:41,128 --> 00:46:43,808
- Yoo Ram? Is it you, Yoo Ram?
- No, not me.

917
00:46:43,808 --> 00:46:45,748
Yoo Ram doesn't give out food. He eats it.

918
00:46:45,748 --> 00:46:47,698
Yes, that's right.

919
00:46:47,698 --> 00:46:51,728
Have you ever gotten a confession from a female staff?

920
00:46:51,728 --> 00:46:54,638
Well, it's not just once or twice...

921
00:46:54,638 --> 00:46:56,028
 

922
00:46:56,028 --> 00:46:57,208
 

923
00:46:57,208 --> 00:46:58,478
Nice!

924
00:46:58,478 --> 00:47:02,448
I'd have to see the face to know.

925
00:47:02,448 --> 00:47:04,308
- Wow!
- So ecstatic!

926
00:47:04,308 --> 00:47:07,748
When this person heard that we were doing a special,

927
00:47:07,748 --> 00:47:11,878
she said she wanted to come and just see your faces.

928
00:47:11,878 --> 00:47:15,738
Since she doesn't know whether she'll be in the next season.

929
00:47:15,738 --> 00:47:20,608
She said she wanted to take some photos and stuff...

930
00:47:20,608 --> 00:47:24,058
She said she'd come if she could.

931
00:47:24,058 --> 00:47:26,428
Now or after the filming? Now?

932
00:47:26,428 --> 00:47:29,088
Is it after? Or should she just join us for a moment?

933
00:47:29,088 --> 00:47:31,528
Stop the camera for a moment and come...

934
00:47:31,528 --> 00:47:33,751
Please stop the camera.

935
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:36,110
- Taking pictures is okay, right?
 Look for... 

936
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:38,890
 the most handsome bastard here. 

937
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:42,330
 the most handsome bastard here. 

938
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:47,360
 the most handsome bastard here. 

939
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,010
Oh, my gosh!

940
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:50,993
Wang Tao Chi!

941
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,893
 

942
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:55,810
 

943
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,290
 

944
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:03,280
Welcome!

945
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,570
Wang Tao Chi!

946
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:09,460
Gosh, I really wanted to see them meet each other!

947
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:12,950
- I missed you.
- You look even more handsome today.

948
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:14,950
They were so shocked. Shocked for real.

949
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:16,410
They couldn't even imagine it.

950
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,020
Daebak...

951
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,730
Their shocked faces are so funny.

952
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:24,250
I was so surprised.

953
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,520
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

954
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,590
Our Madam Lim. Shim So Young.

955
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:31,840
Please say hello to our viewers.

956
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:37,470
Hello, I'm Shim So Young, who portrayed Madam Lim.

957
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:45,060
Even though I was a villain, I received so much love from everyone.

958
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,890
I wanted to say thank you to you all.

959
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:50,300
And I get this chance to thank everyone.

960
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,470
I'm so relieved. Thank you!

961
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:56,630
Earlier, we blurred you out and changed your voice.

962
00:48:56,630 --> 00:49:00,500
Did you even suspect it might be Shim So Young?

963
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,870
- Not at all.
- I did a good job, right?

964
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:03,670
You did. Good job.

965
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:08,420
I did want Madam Lim to come out in Season 2, but...

966
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:11,510
When I first got the script, I was so happy and excited.

967
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:13,270
Saying, "Oh, she's coming out!"

968
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:18,210
What kind of love story was in Season 2 between Madam Lim and Wang Tao Chi?

969
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:19,590
Let us see the video first.

970
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:21,200
I'm getting excited.

971
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,630
 Wow, she was intense from the start. 

972
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:30,140
 I'll never trust a man! 

973
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:33,830
 I'll never trust a man! 

974
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:36,400
 

975
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,440
 Wang Tao Chi. 

976
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,810
 The asshole who came to... 

977
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:45,060
 ruin my life. 

978
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,830
 

979
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:51,810
 It was hard to peel because the shell is hard. 

980
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:54,180
 I hope you enjoy it. 

981
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,910
 

982
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,260
 

983
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,020
 

984
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,780
 

985
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:11,430
 I thought of you as my man. 

986
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:14,620
 - Were you ever... 
- My heart aches.

987
00:50:16,116 --> 00:50:18,660
 genuine with me? 

988
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,240
 No. Not even once. 

989
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,870
He's bad.

990
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:26,521
 

991
00:50:29,112 --> 00:50:30,532
 

992
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:37,352
 

993
00:50:37,939 --> 00:50:41,082
 

994
00:50:41,082 --> 00:50:43,792
What a sharp swag.

995
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:46,192
 

996
00:50:46,192 --> 00:50:49,782
From Wang Tao Chi's point of view...

997
00:50:49,782 --> 00:50:51,642
 It's my real name. 

998
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:57,332
 

999
00:50:58,402 --> 00:51:00,072
 

1000
00:51:01,812 --> 00:51:07,032
 It's not good to look at such harsh things with those beautiful eyes. 

1001
00:51:07,032 --> 00:51:10,362
 

1002
00:51:10,362 --> 00:51:13,382
She said she doesn't trust any men.

1003
00:51:13,382 --> 00:51:14,902
The camera is shaking.

1004
00:51:14,902 --> 00:51:16,872
 

1005
00:51:16,872 --> 00:51:20,762
 Seeing your face, I guess I'm the only sad one. 

1006
00:51:20,762 --> 00:51:22,682
Great editing job!

1007
00:51:26,622 --> 00:51:29,112
 She has to come to her senses. 

1008
00:51:29,112 --> 00:51:32,182
 

1009
00:51:33,172 --> 00:51:35,842
This scene was so funny, too.

1010
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,002
It's Mad Max.

1011
00:51:38,002 --> 00:51:42,192
 I wonder what Madam Lim thinks of me. 

1012
00:51:42,192 --> 00:51:46,522
 Look for the most handsome bastard here. 

1013
00:51:46,522 --> 00:51:48,632
 Look for the most handsome bastard here. 

1014
00:51:48,632 --> 00:51:50,962
 Look for the most handsome bastard here. 

1015
00:51:50,962 --> 00:51:52,672
 

1016
00:51:55,602 --> 00:51:58,752
If she were carrying flowers in her hands, it wouldn't seem so off.

1017
00:51:58,752 --> 00:52:01,282
Her heart says she's not going to capture him.

1018
00:52:01,282 --> 00:52:05,482
 

1019
00:52:05,482 --> 00:52:09,192
 I wanted to ask him something... 

1020
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:16,912
 Wang Tao Chi! 

1021
00:52:16,912 --> 00:52:18,162
 Didn't you hear it? 

1022
00:52:18,162 --> 00:52:20,442
 

1023
00:52:22,512 --> 00:52:23,742
 

1024
00:52:23,742 --> 00:52:28,422
This character was so loved.

1025
00:52:28,422 --> 00:52:31,522
You must have so much affection for this character.

1026
00:52:31,522 --> 00:52:34,642
Did you think about making a funnier face or something like that?

1027
00:52:34,642 --> 00:52:37,412
Not at all.

1028
00:52:37,412 --> 00:52:38,732
I was so serious about it.

1029
00:52:38,732 --> 00:52:41,982
- Sincerely.
- I was so serious.

1030
00:52:41,982 --> 00:52:47,742
But I saw the staff members and the director laughing while monitoring.

1031
00:52:47,742 --> 00:52:50,682
Honestly, I can say it now.

1032
00:52:50,682 --> 00:52:52,902
I was a little bit offended.

1033
00:52:52,902 --> 00:52:57,542
I mean, I was acting with all seriousness.

1034
00:52:57,542 --> 00:52:59,462
I wondered, "Why are they laughing?"

1035
00:52:59,462 --> 00:53:03,492
But after I saw it broadcast, I understand why they did.

1036
00:53:03,492 --> 00:53:06,592
"Gosh, this is why they laughed!"

1037
00:53:06,592 --> 00:53:08,492
It was so funny to me, too.

1038
00:53:08,492 --> 00:53:12,512
You had prepared your front teeth sticking out and did makeup, right?

1039
00:53:12,512 --> 00:53:16,202
I went to the dentist that I go to and asked them

1040
00:53:16,202 --> 00:53:20,192
You know my natural mouth does protrude a bit.

1041
00:53:20,192 --> 00:53:24,322
So, people are even more confused. But they're not my teeth.

1042
00:53:24,322 --> 00:53:26,362
You should make that clear.

1043
00:53:26,362 --> 00:53:31,222
Some viewers might think, "This is a special. Why doesn't she take it out?"

1044
00:53:31,222 --> 00:53:32,892
 

1045
00:53:32,892 --> 00:53:34,372
 

1046
00:53:34,372 --> 00:53:36,002
I was curious, too.

1047
00:53:36,002 --> 00:53:40,342
What was it you wanted to ask Wang Tao Chi?

1048
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:43,272
No matter how much I asked if he was genuine,

1049
00:53:43,272 --> 00:53:46,152
he says no. But I still can't believe it.

1050
00:53:46,152 --> 00:53:48,702
Wang Tao Chi is my first love.

1051
00:53:48,702 --> 00:53:51,282
There has to be another reason.

1052
00:53:51,282 --> 00:53:54,232
"There had to have been a moment you were genuine."

1053
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:57,232
- That's right!
- Not even a moment? A passing

1054
00:53:57,232 --> 00:53:59,542
"You just don't remember it."

1055
00:53:59,542 --> 00:54:06,042
But if you two were to meet again in Season 3,

1056
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:08,182
what do you want the storyline to be?

1057
00:54:08,182 --> 00:54:10,502
I want to meet Madam Lim

1058
00:54:10,502 --> 00:54:13,350
and get up close, lock our eyes,

1059
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:17,042
- and whisper into his ears.
- How exciting.

1060
00:54:17,042 --> 00:54:20,212
Did you repent?

1061
00:54:20,212 --> 00:54:22,455
I think this is what Madam Lim would say.

1062
00:54:22,455 --> 00:54:24,855
"If I repent, will you marry me?"

1063
00:54:25,692 --> 00:54:29,362
Madam Lim has made it here to congratulate all of them.

1064
00:54:29,362 --> 00:54:31,982
We'll have to say goodbye to her here.

1065
00:54:31,982 --> 00:54:35,322
In the music program that I currently emcee,

1066
00:54:35,322 --> 00:54:38,382
we pick out a song like that.

1067
00:54:38,382 --> 00:54:43,262
There are balls in there with five of their names on them.

1068
00:54:43,262 --> 00:54:45,542
Please pick one of them.

1069
00:54:45,542 --> 00:54:47,792
- It's my honor.
- From Rainbow Transportation Service,

1070
00:54:47,792 --> 00:54:52,592
who will get to take a nutritious hanwoo set to enhance physical strength and immune system?

1071
00:54:52,592 --> 00:54:55,602
who will get to take a nutritious hanwoo set to enhance physical strength and immune system?

1072
00:54:55,602 --> 00:54:58,092
I'm so curious!

1073
00:54:58,092 --> 00:55:01,392
My heart is for Wang Tao Chi.

1074
00:55:01,392 --> 00:55:03,762
- Wang Tao Chi.
- I'm getting goosebumps.

1075
00:55:03,762 --> 00:55:05,192
Hold on.

1076
00:55:05,192 --> 00:55:09,272
- You keep us in suspense.
- Madam Lim has been gambling for a while.

1077
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:11,192
- Okay, now...
- Who could it be...

1078
00:55:11,192 --> 00:55:12,662
 

1079
00:55:16,802 --> 00:55:20,202
My Wang Tao Chi!

1080
00:55:21,432 --> 00:55:23,602
 

1081
00:55:24,592 --> 00:55:26,502
Really? We didn't plan this!

1082
00:55:26,502 --> 00:55:28,352
 
Wait!

1083
00:55:28,352 --> 00:55:30,442
Let us see everything in there.

1084
00:55:30,442 --> 00:55:33,122
This could be a trick by the crew.

1085
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:35,892
- Is the ball warmer than others?
- No.

1086
00:55:35,892 --> 00:55:37,252
No, no.

1087
00:55:37,252 --> 00:55:39,732
What's daebak is that this one says Lee Je Hoon.

1088
00:55:39,732 --> 00:55:42,522
This one says Bae Yoo Ram.

1089
00:55:42,522 --> 00:55:44,712
- How did I...
- They're all different.

1090
00:55:44,712 --> 00:55:46,912
We were meant to be.

1091
00:55:46,912 --> 00:55:48,442
I'm getting the chills!

1092
00:55:48,442 --> 00:55:51,622
I received this hanwoo, but...

1093
00:55:51,622 --> 00:55:53,372
this hanwoo is not mine.

1094
00:55:53,372 --> 00:55:55,832
It is our Shim So Young sunbaenim's.

1095
00:55:55,832 --> 00:55:57,802
 

1096
00:55:58,892 --> 00:56:03,222
So, we give hanwoo to the person whose name was picked right away.

1097
00:56:03,222 --> 00:56:07,672
I am so happy that I could give it to you like this.

1098
00:56:07,672 --> 00:56:11,512
T-Thank you so much!

1099
00:56:11,512 --> 00:56:14,722
It looks like Wang Tao Chi is giving it to Madam Lim.

1100
00:56:14,722 --> 00:56:17,892
And take this, too. It's Rainbow Transportation Services merchandise.

1101
00:56:17,892 --> 00:56:20,462
Oh, a T-shirt!

1102
00:56:20,462 --> 00:56:22,082
So cute!

1103
00:56:22,082 --> 00:56:25,112
Doesn't it look good? Aren't you jealous?

1104
00:56:25,112 --> 00:56:28,832
It was practically a 007 movie.

1105
00:56:28,832 --> 00:56:31,032
I came here a bit early.

1106
00:56:31,032 --> 00:56:35,342
So, until other actors went into recording,

1107
00:56:35,342 --> 00:56:38,302
I couldn't go to the bathroom for two hours.

1108
00:56:38,302 --> 00:56:42,252
I was so thankful that they welcomed me so much.

1109
00:56:42,252 --> 00:56:45,002
Je Hoon, thank you so much!

1110
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:46,892
I will eat this and work with a fighting spirit.

1111
00:56:46,892 --> 00:56:48,292
Je Hoon, fighting!

1112
00:56:48,292 --> 00:56:51,122
That was so neat. She picked me.

1113
00:56:51,122 --> 00:56:53,272
Some guys have all the luck.

1114
00:56:54,762 --> 00:56:55,962
It's still not over.

1115
00:56:55,962 --> 00:56:58,562
Let's see if the lucky one continues to be lucky.

1116
00:56:58,562 --> 00:57:00,212
- Yes.
- We'll see.

1117
00:57:00,212 --> 00:57:03,402
I feel like the energy is leaving my body.

1118
00:57:03,402 --> 00:57:05,012
This time, not only for hanwoo

1119
00:57:05,012 --> 00:57:08,542
but your pride as Rainbow Transportation is on the line, too.

1120
00:57:08,542 --> 00:57:11,902
It is the so-called Taxi Driver 2's Premium Exam.

1121
00:57:11,902 --> 00:57:13,882
We'll do it the same way as earlier.

1122
00:57:13,882 --> 00:57:19,282
As for the method, Lee Je Hoon and Pyo Ye Jin have prepared.

1123
00:57:19,282 --> 00:57:20,602
 

1124
00:57:20,602 --> 00:57:22,432
 A pop quiz. 

1125
00:57:22,432 --> 00:57:24,512
 How much asset do you own currently? 

1126
00:57:24,512 --> 00:57:26,282
 Above 300 million won? Below? 

1127
00:57:26,282 --> 00:57:27,342
 - Above.
- Below. 

1128
00:57:27,342 --> 00:57:29,452
 

1129
00:57:29,452 --> 00:57:31,112
 

1130
00:57:31,112 --> 00:57:33,222
- I see.
- Like this?

1131
00:57:33,222 --> 00:57:34,642
Yes, thumbs up. No, thumbs down.

1132
00:57:34,642 --> 00:57:37,062
Since it could be confusing,

1133
00:57:37,062 --> 00:57:39,523
we'll do one practice question.

1134
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:41,142
The topic of the question.

1135
00:57:41,142 --> 00:57:43,852
"Don't die and call us."

1136
00:57:43,852 --> 00:57:45,532
Yes, yes.

1137
00:57:45,532 --> 00:57:47,762
 Private proxy revenge service. 

1138
00:57:47,762 --> 00:57:50,222
Rainbow Transportation Services' phone number is?

1139
00:57:50,222 --> 00:57:52,942
080-555-8282.

1140
00:57:52,942 --> 00:57:54,412
If yes, up. If no, down.

1141
00:57:54,412 --> 00:57:57,022
One, two, three!

1142
00:57:58,122 --> 00:58:00,322
Up, up, up, down, up.

1143
00:58:00,322 --> 00:58:02,782
We didn't get a unanimous vote!

1144
00:58:02,782 --> 00:58:06,032
Over there. Jang Hyuk Jin!

1145
00:58:06,032 --> 00:58:09,402
Well, I'm an engineer...

1146
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:10,772
 

1147
00:58:10,772 --> 00:58:12,372
Could it be...

1148
00:58:12,372 --> 00:58:13,662
The number is this easy?

1149
00:58:13,662 --> 00:58:16,392
I know. The answer is...

1150
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:20,492
 

1151
00:58:20,492 --> 00:58:24,802
 

1152
00:58:24,802 --> 00:58:27,582
 

1153
00:58:27,582 --> 00:58:29,232
What does it say?

1154
00:58:29,232 --> 00:58:32,072
 Don't die and call. We take care of things for you. 

1155
00:58:32,072 --> 00:58:34,902
 

1156
00:58:34,902 --> 00:58:37,652
 

1157
00:58:37,652 --> 00:58:40,182
Only Hyuk Jin got the right answer, but...

1158
00:58:40,182 --> 00:58:42,662
- It's so important!
- It was 505.

1159
00:58:42,662 --> 00:58:45,352
 

1160
00:58:45,352 --> 00:58:47,702
We're going with one number difference?

1161
00:58:47,702 --> 00:58:50,742
- So detailed.
- This is tough.

1162
00:58:50,742 --> 00:58:52,682
You're going to give out crappy questions like this?

1163
00:58:52,682 --> 00:58:54,222
 

1164
00:58:54,222 --> 00:58:56,192
What hurts me is that...

1165
00:58:56,192 --> 00:58:59,922
Hyuk Jin and I are friends.

1166
00:58:59,922 --> 00:59:03,302
The thing about unlucky guys is that he's the only one who got the correct answer during the practice run.

1167
00:59:03,302 --> 00:59:06,802
- You're right!
- That's what happens to unlucky people.

1168
00:59:06,802 --> 00:59:10,372
 

1169
00:59:10,372 --> 00:59:11,812
Fighting.

1170
00:59:11,812 --> 00:59:14,502
We just had the practice run, so you know how the questions are.

1171
00:59:14,502 --> 00:59:17,392
The first question. The topic for the first one is...

1172
00:59:17,392 --> 00:59:19,322
"Secret door."

1173
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:21,712
Secret door. You all know that that is, right?

1174
00:59:21,712 --> 00:59:23,292
 Yes! 

1175
00:59:24,772 --> 00:59:31,442
 

1176
00:59:33,492 --> 00:59:37,642
 The secret door that leads the house on the other side to the basement garage. 

1177
00:59:37,642 --> 00:59:42,092
The painting that's hanging on that door is called "The Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog."

1178
00:59:42,092 --> 00:59:44,392
The artist who drew this painting is...

1179
00:59:45,392 --> 00:59:49,132
Caspar David Friedrich. If correct, up. If not, down.

1180
00:59:49,132 --> 00:59:53,462
Okay. Caspar David Friedrich.

1181
00:59:53,462 --> 00:59:56,722
The priest is here. He's gathering the energy.

1182
00:59:56,722 --> 00:59:59,592
We wouldn't know how many times we record this part, right?

1183
00:59:59,592 --> 01:00:04,812
Actors actually analyze and review...

1184
01:00:04,812 --> 01:00:07,122
every single props...

1185
01:00:07,122 --> 01:00:08,422
Analyze props?

1186
01:00:08,422 --> 01:00:11,012
Did I even have that painting?

1187
01:00:11,012 --> 01:00:13,222
Hey, let's just relax about stuff like this.

1188
01:00:13,222 --> 01:00:15,282
Up if it's correct. Down if it's wrong.

1189
01:00:15,282 --> 01:00:17,612
One, two, three!

1190
01:00:17,612 --> 01:00:19,762
Oh, unanimous!

1191
01:00:19,762 --> 01:00:22,192
- We'll all go for it.
 - Yes! 

1192
01:00:22,192 --> 01:00:24,982
- I feel better.
- I think they all guessed.

1193
01:00:24,982 --> 01:00:27,142
He's a very famous painting.

1194
01:00:27,142 --> 01:00:31,072
Okay, the painting hanging on the secret door, "The Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog"

1195
01:00:31,072 --> 01:00:37,602
is the work of 19th-century painter during the Romantic period,

1196
01:00:40,272 --> 01:00:42,122
Caspar David Friedrich.

1197
01:00:42,122 --> 01:00:46,712
 

1198
01:00:46,712 --> 01:00:49,242
 

1199
01:00:49,242 --> 01:00:52,932
I know him pretty well...

1200
01:00:52,932 --> 01:00:58,132
 

1201
01:00:58,132 --> 01:00:59,652
Okay, next question, please.

1202
01:00:59,652 --> 01:01:03,462
The topic this time is, "Please find So Mang."

1203
01:01:03,462 --> 01:01:05,222
I'll go right into it.

1204
01:01:05,222 --> 01:01:08,472
 
 Little Seo Yeon asked Kim Do Gi to look for her sister So Mang. 

1205
01:01:08,472 --> 01:01:11,522
 And she gave him everything she had. 

1206
01:01:11,522 --> 01:01:14,205
- Do you remember?
- Yes.

1207
01:01:14,205 --> 01:01:18,235
All the money Seo Yeon had then...

1208
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,062
It was 930 won.

1209
01:01:22,062 --> 01:01:23,762
Up if it's correct, down if it's wrong.

1210
01:01:23,762 --> 01:01:26,902
Whoa, that scene was so...

1211
01:01:26,902 --> 01:01:29,322
I felt so sad.

1212
01:01:29,322 --> 01:01:32,682
And it's funny to count the coins while watching that scene.

1213
01:01:32,682 --> 01:01:34,362
I think they counted.

1214
01:01:34,362 --> 01:01:36,082
930 won...

1215
01:01:36,082 --> 01:01:38,752
But you did receive the money from her.

1216
01:01:38,752 --> 01:01:42,092
I received the coins, looked at Seo Yeon's face, and then...

1217
01:01:42,092 --> 01:01:43,722
You counted, right?

1218
01:01:43,722 --> 01:01:45,522
I did take a look.

1219
01:01:45,522 --> 01:01:49,262
You looked at the coins again when you were determined to take Seo Yeon's revenge.

1220
01:01:49,262 --> 01:01:51,492
That's right.

1221
01:01:54,522 --> 01:01:56,732
But were you genuine then?

1222
01:01:56,732 --> 01:02:00,112
Or was it just a scene you took?

1223
01:02:00,112 --> 01:02:03,452
We're not that stressed, even if you get it wrong.

1224
01:02:03,452 --> 01:02:05,692
Is 930 won correct?

1225
01:02:05,692 --> 01:02:07,662
Up if it's correct, down if it's wrong.

1226
01:02:07,662 --> 01:02:10,462
One, two, three!

1227
01:02:10,462 --> 01:02:12,732
 

1228
01:02:12,732 --> 01:02:15,972
Then if we're right...

1229
01:02:15,972 --> 01:02:19,432
As the one being hired by Seo Yeon,

1230
01:02:19,432 --> 01:02:21,792
the money isn't the issue for me.

1231
01:02:23,732 --> 01:02:27,442
How is Kim Do Gi's tongue so long?

1232
01:02:27,442 --> 01:02:30,112
How can I accept money from her?

1233
01:02:30,112 --> 01:02:32,762
- Don't care about the amount?
- Don't care.

1234
01:02:32,762 --> 01:02:34,952
And what if you're right?

1235
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:37,112
Okay, let's check the answer.

1236
01:02:37,112 --> 01:02:39,962
 Seo Yeon... 

1237
01:02:39,962 --> 01:02:42,502
 please give us just 920 won. 

1238
01:02:42,502 --> 01:02:46,312
 Gosh, she's taking it out. 

1239
01:02:46,312 --> 01:02:50,702
 

1240
01:02:50,702 --> 01:02:55,062
 - Please find So Mang for me.
- She was so desperate. 

1241
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:57,132
 

1242
01:02:57,132 --> 01:02:59,072
 

1243
01:02:59,072 --> 01:03:01,272
I was wrong.

1244
01:03:01,272 --> 01:03:04,462
 
But this amount...

1245
01:03:04,462 --> 01:03:06,582
felt huge to me.

1246
01:03:07,752 --> 01:03:11,532
How could I accept that as 910 won?

1247
01:03:11,532 --> 01:03:14,292
It felt like the biggest amount of money to me.

1248
01:03:14,292 --> 01:03:18,072
Excluding Lee Je Hoon, we'll add balls for the four of you.

1249
01:03:19,192 --> 01:03:23,062
That episode was so heartbreaking.

1250
01:03:23,062 --> 01:03:28,132
When I saw the adults taking turns taking pictures around Seo Yeon...

1251
01:03:28,132 --> 01:03:32,902
 
 Wow! It really dug into the hearts of the viewers. 

1252
01:03:32,902 --> 01:03:35,952
 Smile a little bit. Say apartment! Apartment! 

1253
01:03:35,952 --> 01:03:38,892
 One, two, three! 

1254
01:03:38,892 --> 01:03:42,352
They're trying to raise their scores, right?

1255
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:44,392
They're fabricating adoption.

1256
01:03:44,392 --> 01:03:46,782
That's why the parents keep changing like that.

1257
01:03:52,612 --> 01:03:54,892
Gosh, that scene is so...

1258
01:03:56,202 --> 01:04:00,692
 Seo Yeon had a total of four moms and dads. 

1259
01:04:13,052 --> 01:04:16,152
The actor who played the victim in that story.

1260
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:19,442
He was excellent. He played such a sly role.

1261
01:04:19,442 --> 01:04:23,132
The actors who appeared in different episodes.

1262
01:04:23,132 --> 01:04:25,932
- They're amazing, too.
- Yes.

1263
01:04:25,932 --> 01:04:30,522
Okay, the next topic for the word is "an old-fashioned whole fried chicken."

1264
01:04:30,522 --> 01:04:36,712
In Episodes 1 &amp; 2, the Vietnam episodes, Dong Jae's chicken store was introduced.

1265
01:04:36,712 --> 01:04:39,532
 Dong Jae chicken from the past 

1266
01:04:39,532 --> 01:04:44,062
was 5,000 per chicken.

1267
01:04:44,062 --> 01:04:47,142
Now, if you buy two chickens,

1268
01:04:47,142 --> 01:04:49,852
it will cost 11,000 won.

1269
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:51,682
Up if it's correct. Down if it's wrong.

1270
01:04:51,682 --> 01:04:54,252
If you buy one, it's 5,000. But if you buy two, it's 11,000 won?

1271
01:04:54,252 --> 01:04:57,752
We're trying to give away the hanwoo, so we made the questions easy.

1272
01:04:57,752 --> 01:05:01,102
The crew made it so not fun.

1273
01:05:01,102 --> 01:05:03,482
Logically speaking, they should be cheaper if you buy two, right?

1274
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:06,462
- It doesn't make sense.
- It's likely this part won't air.

1275
01:05:06,462 --> 01:05:09,932
Because it's not fun. The question is too childish.

1276
01:05:09,932 --> 01:05:11,992
Let's just do this for now.

1277
01:05:11,992 --> 01:05:15,452
Up if it's correct. Down if it's wrong. One, two, three!

1278
01:05:17,472 --> 01:05:19,142
Oh, you're split.

1279
01:05:19,142 --> 01:05:20,992
Some of you said it's correct?

1280
01:05:20,992 --> 01:05:22,502
Yes.

1281
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:25,032
5,000 x 2 is...

1282
01:05:25,032 --> 01:05:28,882
Since the question is outside the logic,

1283
01:05:28,882 --> 01:05:31,902
I don't think I should answer logically.

1284
01:05:31,902 --> 01:05:33,782
You twisted it one more time, huh?

1285
01:05:33,782 --> 01:05:36,472
In my opinion, I think...

1286
01:05:36,472 --> 01:05:38,372
if it were for that dad,

1287
01:05:38,372 --> 01:05:43,902
he'd feel sorry for people who couldn't afford more than one chicken.

1288
01:05:43,902 --> 01:05:46,222
So I think he gave a lower price for one chicken.

1289
01:05:46,222 --> 01:05:48,042
You twisted it one more time, huh?

1290
01:05:48,042 --> 01:05:50,452
- Wow...
- To that extent?

1291
01:05:50,452 --> 01:05:54,562
It was initially 5,500 won, but he sold one for 5,000 won?

1292
01:05:54,562 --> 01:05:56,652
That came to my mind.

1293
01:05:56,652 --> 01:06:00,692
- Why is your thumb up, Yoo Ram?
- The TV people aren't that easy.

1294
01:06:00,692 --> 01:06:02,922
Oh, that was your instinct, huh?

1295
01:06:02,922 --> 01:06:06,522
- So sharp.
- Ye Jin, since it makes no sense?

1296
01:06:06,522 --> 01:06:09,502
Of course. I'm not stupid.

1297
01:06:09,502 --> 01:06:11,692
- "I'm a brain, huh?"
- And Jang Hyuk Jin, too?

1298
01:06:11,692 --> 01:06:15,142
I'm right. One for 5,000. Two for 11,000 makes no sense.

1299
01:06:15,142 --> 01:06:17,165
The question is too much, actually.

1300
01:06:17,165 --> 01:06:19,275
Let's check the answer.

1301
01:06:20,832 --> 01:06:23,972
 Take this and eat it with your friends. 

1302
01:06:24,852 --> 01:06:26,922
 See you later, Dad! 

1303
01:06:26,922 --> 01:06:32,272
 

1304
01:06:32,272 --> 01:06:34,462
It's right.

1305
01:06:36,049 --> 01:06:37,272
Three chickens are more expensive!

1306
01:06:37,272 --> 01:06:40,472
17,000 won for three!

1307
01:06:40,472 --> 01:06:42,642
What is the baseline here?

1308
01:06:42,642 --> 01:06:46,612
- I never imagined.
- The answer is up.

1309
01:06:46,612 --> 01:06:48,952
 

1310
01:06:48,952 --> 01:06:51,692
- Wow, this isn't easy.
- No, it's not.

1311
01:06:51,692 --> 01:06:54,272
If we review the score thus far,

1312
01:06:54,272 --> 01:06:56,152
they all have such an obsession with hanwoo.

1313
01:06:56,152 --> 01:06:57,752
Bae Yoo Ram and Kim Eui Sung.

1314
01:06:57,752 --> 01:07:00,562
You got all the questions correct!

1315
01:07:00,562 --> 01:07:03,082
They scored a perfect score so far.

1316
01:07:03,082 --> 01:07:04,992
Would you drop out right around now?

1317
01:07:04,992 --> 01:07:07,622
Yes, I'll get it wrong on purpose.

1318
01:07:07,622 --> 01:07:09,032
Moving onto the next question.

1319
01:07:09,032 --> 01:07:11,502
The topic is Mr. Kim Do Gi.

1320
01:07:11,502 --> 01:07:14,422
- It's the last question.
- Let's be cautious.

1321
01:07:14,422 --> 01:07:18,872
Mr. Kim Do Gi likes to express himself with his hands.

1322
01:07:18,872 --> 01:07:23,552
In 16 episodes of Taxi Driver,

1323
01:07:23,552 --> 01:07:27,392
the total number of thumbs up and hearts he made with his hands

1324
01:07:28,392 --> 01:07:31,872
is 16. Up if it's correct. Down if it's wrong.

1325
01:07:31,872 --> 01:07:35,152
- It's so detailed.
- Including thumbs and hearts?

1326
01:07:35,152 --> 01:07:37,272
- Did you count all that/
- We did.

1327
01:07:37,272 --> 01:07:38,592
We counted all of them.

1328
01:07:38,592 --> 01:07:41,102
Will Lee Je Hoon be able to get it right?

1329
01:07:41,102 --> 01:07:42,962
I've seen them over 1,600 times.

1330
01:07:42,962 --> 01:07:44,822
Yes, I know. I think that's why it's so confusing for us.

1331
01:07:44,822 --> 01:07:46,302
Even if it's 1/10th of that.

1332
01:07:46,302 --> 01:07:50,582
I don't think I did more than 16 times...

1333
01:07:50,582 --> 01:07:54,162
If it's more than 16, it's also down, right?

1334
01:07:54,162 --> 01:07:56,822
We have to go inside their heads.

1335
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:59,192
So serious! Really?

1336
01:07:59,192 --> 01:08:01,522
One, two, three!

1337
01:08:03,242 --> 01:08:06,122
You couldn't have counted exactly 16 times.

1338
01:08:06,122 --> 01:08:08,522
They watched it five times.

1339
01:08:08,522 --> 01:08:09,952
The series.

1340
01:08:09,952 --> 01:08:11,712
You think it's less than 16 times?

1341
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:13,592
I think it's less than.

1342
01:08:13,592 --> 01:08:15,462
- I think it's more.
- You think so?

1343
01:08:15,462 --> 01:08:18,772
I think they could be split right here.

1344
01:08:18,772 --> 01:08:21,952
Now, let's check for the answer.

1345
01:08:21,952 --> 01:08:24,182
Geez!

1346
01:08:24,182 --> 01:08:26,362
Follow me.

1347
01:08:26,362 --> 01:08:28,922
 We're so full of love. 

1348
01:08:28,922 --> 01:08:31,632
 So full! 

1349
01:08:31,632 --> 01:08:33,372
 The smaller the bed is, the better for newlyweds. 

1350
01:08:33,372 --> 01:08:36,562
 The smaller the bed is, the better for newlyweds. 

1351
01:08:36,562 --> 01:08:38,952
 Five. 

1352
01:08:38,952 --> 01:08:40,792
 Six. 

1353
01:08:40,792 --> 01:08:42,352
 - Seven.
- Already seven? 

1354
01:08:42,352 --> 01:08:45,572
 You did a lot. 

1355
01:08:45,572 --> 01:08:48,572
 Nine. 

1356
01:08:48,572 --> 01:08:51,162
 - Ten.
- You're the taxi driver, right? 

1357
01:08:51,162 --> 01:08:53,602
Eleven.

1358
01:08:53,602 --> 01:08:55,102
 

1359
01:08:55,102 --> 01:08:57,902
- So, no more after that?
- No.

1360
01:08:57,902 --> 01:09:00,512
But we saw too many times. I must've gotten confused.

1361
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:02,992
Now, there are so many balls in here.

1362
01:09:02,992 --> 01:09:04,882
You put all the balls in there, right?

1363
01:09:04,882 --> 01:09:07,755
We put each of your name on the ball and put them in here.

1364
01:09:07,755 --> 01:09:10,055
The final result is...

1365
01:09:10,851 --> 01:09:14,502
 

1366
01:09:14,502 --> 01:09:17,932
 
 Kim Eui Sung and Jang Hyuk Jin got four correct. 

1367
01:09:17,932 --> 01:09:19,885
 The rest of you tied. 

1368
01:09:19,885 --> 01:09:23,735
 Lee Je Hoon, Pyo Ye Jin, and Bae Yoo Ram have five each. 

1369
01:09:25,098 --> 01:09:28,552
This became too important.

1370
01:09:28,552 --> 01:09:31,362
It became the reason we're here today.

1371
01:09:31,362 --> 01:09:32,932
 

1372
01:09:32,932 --> 01:09:35,032
In other variety programs,

1373
01:09:35,032 --> 01:09:37,752
they usually select one person for hanwoo.

1374
01:09:37,752 --> 01:09:39,722
But since today is a good celebratory day,

1375
01:09:39,722 --> 01:09:43,282
hoping good fortune to everyone,

1376
01:09:43,282 --> 01:09:46,992
we'll give all three of you hanwoo.

1377
01:09:46,992 --> 01:09:48,422
Really?

1378
01:09:48,422 --> 01:09:52,412
Hyun Jin, I think if you and I work together, we can flip this table.

1379
01:09:52,412 --> 01:09:54,402
Oh, my goodness...

1380
01:09:54,402 --> 01:09:56,762
Whoa, thank you!

1381
01:09:56,762 --> 01:09:58,972
Hyung, let's go get some.

1382
01:09:58,972 --> 01:10:00,672
Oh, no. We're the only ones who got it.

1383
01:10:00,672 --> 01:10:02,852
Lee Je Hoon could give it away again.

1384
01:10:02,852 --> 01:10:07,672
No, no. If he keeps doing that and elevating his image...

1385
01:10:07,672 --> 01:10:10,662
I don't really want to see something like that.

1386
01:10:10,662 --> 01:10:13,702
- Thank you!
- Rainbow Transporting Good Fortune.

1387
01:10:13,702 --> 01:10:16,522
 
The special edition of Taxi Driver 2 with the stars of the drama.

1388
01:10:16,522 --> 01:10:18,322
 
We'll wrap it up here.

1389
01:10:18,322 --> 01:10:21,542
 
Can we meet again in Taxi Driver Season 3?

1390
01:10:21,542 --> 01:10:23,182
 
We'll look forward to it.

1391
01:10:23,182 --> 01:10:25,525
 
We'll say goodbye to our viewers...

1392
01:10:25,525 --> 01:10:29,786
and that'll be so sad, wouldn't we?

1393
01:10:30,564 --> 01:10:32,685
I don't think the crew knew, either.

1394
01:10:32,685 --> 01:10:35,180
The two of them who didn't get anything and their expressions...

1395
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:37,030
 
They were stunned.

1396
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:39,100
Their expressions looked bad for real.

1397
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:42,600
We will also give the two of you a chance.

1398
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,720
 

1399
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:47,260
I feel like I'm being played.

1400
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:49,860
 

1401
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:52,684
 

1402
01:10:52,684 --> 01:10:55,204
 Coin toss. 

1403
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:59,390
Inside that area. In a variety show,

1404
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:02,825
you have never seen a huge safe area. In case it might go over,

1405
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:04,870
we even built a lip here.

1406
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:07,590
A lip. So the coins won't go past it.

1407
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:09,530
And you even gave us two coins.

1408
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:12,090
You have to take hanwoo for us to be finished.

1409
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:14,950
If you want to go home, you have to take hanwoo.

1410
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:16,623
One, two, three, please throw.

1411
01:11:16,623 --> 01:11:19,433
 

1412
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:23,200
 

1413
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,400
 

1414
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,890
One, two, three!

1415
01:11:29,647 --> 01:11:31,890
 

1416
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:35,030
He knows how to do a show!

1417
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:36,560
Gently, gently.

1418
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,820
Okay, on top of that?

1419
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:41,560
Okay, on top of that?

1420
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:42,890
 

1421
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:46,550
Now, we'll give the hanwoo set to everyone!

1422
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:48,620
 

1423
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:50,240
I got one, too!

1424
01:11:51,445 --> 01:11:53,740
Who's this!

1425
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:56,820
 

1426
01:11:57,650 --> 01:12:01,990
 

1427
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:09,360
Our director and writer!

1428
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,480
They wanted to give you hanwoo to the remaining two of you.

1429
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:15,790
Actually, the viewers are so grateful to the writer. So...

1430
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:19,950
please say hello to our viewers.

1431
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:21,580
 
She's the director.

1432
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:23,850
He's the writer.

1433
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:25,950
 

1434
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,180
Please air this!

1435
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:29,950
Please air this!

1436
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:32,400
 

1437
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,860
His ears are turning red.

1438
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:36,550
Please do a close-up.

1439
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:39,760
But anyone would think that she's the writer, and he's the director.

1440
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:43,680
But when I said, "Please say hi," she kept doing this.

1441
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,630
 

1442
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:48,340
I kept thinking, "Why does the writer have that look on her face?"

1443
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:49,790
 

1444
01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:52,653
I'm sorry.

1445
01:12:52,653 --> 01:12:54,973
You should've said, "I'm the writer!"

1446
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,050
Okay, Director, go ahead.

1447
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:03,680
 
When we first did the script reading,

1448
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:07,120
we said our goal was to finish without trouble and end nicely.

1449
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:09,600
And our process was nice and done safely.

1450
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,220
But even our results turned out beautifully.

1451
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:16,580
I think what made that possible is our Rainbow family, our writer,

1452
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:19,570
our crew members, and our viewers. Thank you all.

1453
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:24,340
 
They said all I need to do is hand out the prizes.

1454
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:26,200
So, I came here joyfully.

1455
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:29,600
But three minutes ago, they started putting on a mic on us.

1456
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:33,030
I don't even know what I should say.

1457
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,610
Yes. More than anything, what we're curious about is...

1458
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:38,490
Will there be Season 3?

1459
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:39,860
- Season 3?
- Yes!

1460
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:41,300
Could we say it?

1461
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:44,360
Leave out a few of them, and then...

1462
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,330
Mix them around, and then...

1463
01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:50,090
I guess they haven't decided as to who's not going to come out.

1464
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:53,620
As for me, if Rainbow family wants to go for it...

1465
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:56,010
then I'll prepare hard.

1466
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:58,630
Let's go!

1467
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:02,820
All right. Everyone, let's look forward to Season 3

1468
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:05,273
and we'll say our goodbye here.

1469
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:09,700
- Now, Rainbow Transporting Good Fortune!
 - Rainbow Transporting Good Fortune. 

1470
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:14,840
 Thanks for watching Taxi Driver 2 on Viki!
