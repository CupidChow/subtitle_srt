1
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,500
 

2
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,210
 
- Let's drink.
- How long has it been?

3
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:44,220
There's no better combination than makgeolli and eel.

4
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,900
How are things these days? I heard you let go of all the employees

5
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,170
and doing the defense in the retrial alone.

6
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,840
We were winning more but getting paid less. What can I do?

7
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,800
I need to wait until things improve.

8
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,450
Why didn't you just accept it when you got the offer as a special prosecutor?

9
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,880
It would've been nice to let your pretty face be known.

10
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,280
Why would I be a puppet by joining a game that's already rigged?

11
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,170
You're right.

12
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,070
Anyway, you got some guts.

13
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,820
How did you think about using the assistant prosecutor general's office as your address?

14
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,020
He kept it for me without throwing it away because he's my hoobae.

15
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,980
That's why I set it up that way.

16
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,900
I knew your hoobae would keep your mail for you.

17
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,430
What does it say next to my name?

18
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,680
Detective Jang? Is that you?

19
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,390
Thank you for keeping this for me! I'll pay for this meal instead.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,600
- You know that Kang Pil Seung case.
- Yes.

21
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:49,300
It's a really strange case, as you said.

22
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,030
A real estate broker donated his entire assets,

23
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,850
lived homeless in the subway station and was found dead in the mountain.

24
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:01,320
I could assume who donated his assets,

25
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,910
but I can't figure out which bastard made it look like the

26
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,880
homeless real estate broker committed suicide.

27
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,610
My guts say they definitely were cutting off their tail.

28
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,670
The fact that they closed the case as a simple suicide

29
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,990
means the investigation was already polluted, too.

30
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,110
You mean the body the tail belonged to might be big.

31
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,300
Now that we're on the topic, don't you think you should quit now?

32
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,920
What are you talking about?

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,060
- I don't want something bad to happen to you.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

34
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,810
Just eat the eel. It's getting cold.

35
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,790
Don't just dismiss me like that!

36
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,950
It's nice that you help people out. It's all good.

37
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,180
But that's only possible when you're not in danger.

38
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,900
What would be the point of helping others if something happened to you?

39
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,850
I'm not helping them.

40
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,730
It's...

41
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,370
just like having a respirator.

42
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,980
If I stop doing it, I can't breathe well.

43
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,410
It's not for others. It's for me to breathe and live.

44
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,670
I'm doing it for myself.

45
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,560
Aigoo!

46
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,320
Just don't go out at night alone. I'm worried you'd get attacked.

47
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,940
Just let them do that.

48
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,390
You think we'd just do nothing?

49
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,270
Aigoo, seriously.

50
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,780
It's a package from outside the country.

51
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,010
They're documents sent from Kotaya.

52
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:46,440
I thought you should have a look first because you were at the scene yourself.

53
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,850
Detective Jang?

54
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,120
You don't know, but he's a really good detective.

55
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,180
Hyungnim.

56
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:02,440
I got some coffee. I'd like your advice on something.

57
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,970
I actually have a lot of younger friends.

58
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,030
But I started noticing that they kept getting beaten by someone.

59
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,680
It didn't just happen a few times.

60
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,040
I just couldn't figure out why they were beating them.

61
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,750
It wasn't for revenge or anything.

62
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,830
So I'm thinking of becoming friends with him.

63
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,540
I thought I could figure it out if we became friends.

64
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,180
What do you think about that?

65
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,080
Do you think I could become friends with this person?

66
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,970
No.

67
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,010
Why not?

68
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,320
I just need to ask him to be my friend, right?

69
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,200
But he'd keep beating up your friends.

70
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,780
That would be such a problem.

71
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,050
Hyungnim, can I use your bathroom?

72
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:04,030
 !

73
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,230
Do Gi hyung is really crossing the line.

74
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,780
You're taking a long time looking for the bathroom.

75
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,280
Hyungnim, what's wrong with me today?

76
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,270
I had a really important plan, but I just remembered about it.

77
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,710
I was enjoying talking to you.

78
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,810
It's okay. We'll have another chance.

79
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,700
I'm sorry, Hyungnim.

80
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,810
 

81
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,730
Get in. Let me drive you.

82
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,910
I need to tell you something, too.

83
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,890
What did you want to talk about?

84
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,720
An official notice came from Cotaya police.

85
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,830
I knew you were aware, Hyun Jo.

86
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,920
Why didn't you tell me about it, then?

87
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,230
How about the fact that you're still playing pretend like a child?

88
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:52,300
Can't you tell what they're trying to find in Kotaya?

89
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,880
It's me.

90
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,010
They're looking for me right now.

91
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,550
I don't think you wouldn't know that.

92
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:06,550
Let me ask you one more time. Why didn't you tell me?

93
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,600
Is it because of your pride?

94
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,850
What? Are you out of your mind?

95
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:16,080
You got the wrong idea because Bishop has been coddling you.

96
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,850
You're nothing but a guard dog.

97
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,720
Don't people usually just keep stuff like that to themselves?

98
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,230
This is a warning.

99
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,040
Be careful.

100
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,350
Careful?

101
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,550
 

102
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,570
Hey, hey! You need to pay!

103
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,710
Crazy bastard.

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,120
Mr. On, drive safely.

105
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,690
Salute!

106
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,390
 - Good morning, sir! 
- Welcome, Director.

107
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:14,290
They say there's no free taxi in this world.

108
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,730
Tell them to upload the details of the adjustment today.

109
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,810
What were you doing? You should've told me to come in.

110
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,810
- Sir!
- Hey, Mr. On.

111
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,300
You got bitten by a guard dog. You should hurry up and report me.

112
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,850
Are you okay?

113
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,830
Don't come in! I'm okay. Go ahead and get to work.

114
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,710
Yes, sir!

115
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,450
Look. You have so many things you want to protect.

116
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,580
A lot of things would break around you even if you move just a little.

117
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,050
This is a warning.

118
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,950
Be careful.

119
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,810
Why won't you be careful? I was because you told me to earlier!

120
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,270
I said, be careful.

121
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,490
Careful...

122
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,360
Let me know right away if you get information about me from now on.

123
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,880
Don't just make a decision yourself.

124
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,510
Okay?

125
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,350
 The current wind speed is 2 meters per second. 

126
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,150
 The weight of a 500-won coin is 7.7 grams. 

127
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,210
 The distance to the target is about 3.5 meters. 

128
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,060
 Considering the gravity and the strength of my arm... 

129
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,310
 It should be about 35 degrees upward! 

130
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,030
- Aigoo!
- Gosh.

131
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,830
You're totally a pro! Why are you so good at tossing coins?

132
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,520
I'm very good with my hands, you know.

133
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,610
- Is it your turn, Hyungnim?
- I want to skip this round.

134
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,320
You can't do that.

135
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,310
- Right? I can't, can I?
- Just throw it now.

136
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,280
Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim.

137
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,930
Are you good at tossing coins?

138
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,250
- No.
- You must be better than me.

139
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,360
- This is the last coin.
- I have to go to work right now.

140
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,700
You just need to toss it into that circle. Please.

141
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,380
Over there?

142
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,840
Aigoo, seriously?

143
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,050
Well, hey! That's not right! That's cheating!

144
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,340
What do you mean?

145
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,840
This isn't your coin. It's Mr. Kim's!

146
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,400
I gave it to Mr. Kim. That's my coin.

147
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,330
In that logic, we got all these coins from the customers.

148
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,720
So they're not ours. They're the customers, right?

149
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,520
Look at you! Look how you're popping blood vessels at Hyung!

150
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,300
That's not the same as this! Anyway, that's my coin.

151
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,260
It's not yours, I said!

152
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,090
- What are you doing?
- Perfect.

153
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,190
Go Eun will be the judge. Listen to the judge no matter what.

154
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,200
Exactly. Go Eun, you be the judge and tell us who's right.

155
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,840
Were you guys playing hooky again?

156
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,280
We weren't playing hooky. We just had extra time...

157
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,620
You're so bad.

158
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,240
- You're really a bad person.
- Am I?

159
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,390
Seriously!

160
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,000
Seriously, get to work!

161
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,680
Thank you.

162
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,400
Take care.

163
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,000
My gosh, I'm late!

164
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,520
Welcome.

165
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,200
Sir, let's go to Jeil Chakhan Hospital.

166
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,770
Yes.

167
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,620
 

168
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,280
 

169
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,960
 

170
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,600
 

171
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,750
- Thank you.
- Yes.

172
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,970
 

173
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,560
Thank you!

174
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,630
 - Dr. Ahn Young Sook, the murderer 
- Unni!

175
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,660
 must reveal the truth 

176
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,000
and bring my daughter back to life!

177
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,130
He's so loud every morning.

178
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,890
Should I go and ask him to stop?

179
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,520
Don't do that.

180
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,030
He apparently has a bunch of weapons in the tent.

181
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,830
I'm fine with the noise,

182
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,080
but he smells too much. It's driving me crazy.

183
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,140
Stop right now!

184
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,630
Dr. Ahn Young Sook

185
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,320
shouldn't be considered a doctor!

186
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,140
What's this?

187
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,480
Looks like you haven't eaten.

188
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,670
Why don't you go have a meal

189
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,360
and go to a sauna, too?

190
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,350
Do you think I'm a beggar? I don't need stuff like this.

191
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,480
What are you doing? You can't be like that when someone's offering kindness.

192
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,400
Kindness? She killed someone, and now she's kind?

193
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,540
She was found not guilty in court regarding that already.

194
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,450
It's because you people lied!

195
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,410
Who lied, exactly?

196
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,310
Why don't you show us evidence, then?

197
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,210
Just stay put.

198
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,150
I don't mind you protesting,

199
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,440
a lot of people go in and out of this place.

200
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,300
Could you try not to use the megaphone, at least?

201
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,180
Why would I do that for you?

202
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,960
What happened to Soo Ryeon

203
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,620
was an unfortunate event for me, too.

204
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:14,310
But sometimes, unavoidable things happen.

205
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:18,200
Shut your mouth! You did that to her!

206
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,640
I'm not saying I didn't do that, but-

207
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,510
Dr. Ahn, let's go inside now.

208
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,180
All right, then.

209
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,340
Take this with you!

210
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:42,520
"Dr. Ahn Young Sook should stop performing surgery that kills people?"

211
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,430
If she really stops performing surgery,

212
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,480
whose loss would it be?

213
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,490
Do you even know how many surgeries she performs a day?

214
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,980
You think I don't know that you're all in on this.

215
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,720
The truth will come out eventually!

216
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,390
The truth already came out through the trial!

217
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,430
You think doctors perform surgery to kill people?

218
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,100
They try to save people!

219
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,240
The only thing she did wrong

220
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,190
was that she even accepted you people and performed surgery on you.

221
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,860
I keep saying this, but we didn't fabricate anything

222
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,910
and we have nothing to hide! Do you know that?

223
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,170
You didn't fabricate or hide anything?

224
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,960
Give me a break!

225
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,570
This is considered assault. I heard you're on probation.

226
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,440
Hit me! Hit me!

227
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,110
The police data says no one requested an official document from Cotaya.

228
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,440
Someone must've received a package, at least.

229
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,930
That package was delivered to the Prosecutor's Office. But the recipient didn't exist.

230
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,830
 So to summarize, 

231
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:14,440
 a detective named Jang who doesn't even exist in Korea 

232
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,320
sent a package to an office that doesn't exist

233
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,940
and a taxi driver ended up getting it?

234
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,740
I'd better stop playing pretend, as you said.

235
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,040
It's hard to figure it out because all the lines were cut off-

236
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,870
We can bring things to the surface to find out if there's more.

237
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,760
How would we do that?

238
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,360
There isn't enough reason to investigate.

239
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,450
Not the way you'd do it.

240
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,770
- I'll have tonkatsu, then.
- I'll have the seafood rice.

241
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
I'm full! I'm full. I ate.

242
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,220
- He ate?
- He ate.

243
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,320
He doesn't skip a meal.

244
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,950
Spicy pork wrap.

245
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,570
The way they'd do it.

246
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,650
Let me go to the bathroom.

247
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,780
- What?
- Geez!

248
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:12,420
Hey! You should apologize if you hit someone.

249
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,790
Why won't he apologize?

250
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,400
How come people in Jamsil

251
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,570
don't apologize?

252
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,880
 

253
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,270
 

254
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,180
Yes.

255
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,440
Where are you right now?

256
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,150
Could you tell us

257
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,070
about what happened to you?

258
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:42,120
Since it's a medical error...

259
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,140
I'm honestly kind of confused.

260
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,570
About what?

261
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,190
It's still true that she got surgery.

262
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,530
Y-Yes, it is.

263
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:01,990
 

264
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,010
Thankfully, the director will be performing your surgery herself.

265
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,850
She's on TV often. She's famous.

266
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,930
You don't have to worry about anything!

267
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,870
This surgery isn't even considered surgery, apparently.

268
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,950
It only takes a few hours, and you can go home afterward, too.

269
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,410
Don't worry about anything!

270
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:21,660
- Dad, by the way-
- Yes, what is it?

271
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,060
I want some red bean fish buns.

272
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,440
I'll get you a drum full after you get out of surgery!

273
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,790
- Okay.
- Yes.

274
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,600
Soo Ryeon, how do you feel today?

275
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,580
I feel good.

276
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:43,320
The surgery will take about three hours.

277
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,410
Don't worry so much, sir.

278
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,710
What's wrong?

279
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,490
It's nothing. Thank you so much.

280
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,440
Yes.

281
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,920
Let's go in, then.

282
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,920
Fighting!

283
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,360
- I'll be back.
- See you!

284
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,510
Fighting!

285
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,840
 

286
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,820
 

287
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,450
 

288
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,380
 

289
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,790
 

290
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,240
Soo Ryeon.

291
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,560
Aigoo.

292
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,820
Soo Ryeon...

293
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,550
Patient Han's surgery went well.

294
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,370
Thank you!

295
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:58,350
She'll be sent to the general ward once she wakes up in the rehabilitation center.

296
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,020
- Thank you, Doctor!
- Yes.

297
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,380
Soo Ryeon.

298
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,580
- By the way...
- You scared me!

299
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,670
Han Soo Ryeon didn't wake up afterward.

300
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,950
His only daughter didn't wake up! Of course, he got angry. Why wouldn't he?

301
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,420
Nurse! Nurse! Nurse!

302
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,120
I need to talk to her!

303
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,930
She's not in there right now!

304
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,340
I know she's in there! I need to talk to her!

305
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,950
You need to talk to me now! I'm in charge of medical malpractice insurance.

306
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:34,040
The director has insurance. You'll get the insurance payment!

307
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,010
Do you think this is about insurance payment?

308
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,070
What did she do to my daughter?

309
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:42,160
Excuse me! If you keep doing this, I'll report you for obstruction of business!

310
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,280
Go ahead! Go ahead!

311
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,990
I just need to know what happened in the operating room that day!

312
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,090
Move, you bastards!

313
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,110
Dr. Ahn! Dr. Ahn!

314
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,440
Let go of me!

315
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,980
Let go!

316
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,440
But everything was already revealed in court!

317
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,150
Why are you harassing me, taking turns?

318
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,500
According to the anesthesia record and nurse's chart,

319
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,460
all the medical practice in the OR was carried out according to the law.

320
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,500
I definitely!

321
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,990
smelled alcohol from Dr. Ahn Young Sook.

322
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,680
Do you have evidence?

323
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,240
I smelled it myself.

324
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,750
I'm telling the truth.

325
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,340
According to the testimonies, you're the one who was always drunk.

326
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,450
Well...

327
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,530
As the evidence file suggests, when a patient who went through a successful surgery

328
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,420
didn't wake up from anesthesia,

329
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,060
the reason for the patient's unconsciousness

330
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,420
is due to side effects from anesthesia that are caused by the patient's condition.

331
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,520
Experiencing a side effect from anesthesia, which happens to one person out of 10,000 people

332
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,780
is an unfortunate medical accident

333
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,410
that can't be avoided.

334
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,130
Thank you.

335
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,500
I'll now commence the ruling.

336
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,920
The security footage the plaintiff requested from in front of the OR

337
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,770
can't be watched as the hard drive has been wiped.

338
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,980
But it is not the hospital's duty to back up the files.

339
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,270
Also, considering that they've been regularly wiping the hard drive for years,

340
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,840
it can't be considered that they removed evidence

341
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,870
just because the footage isn't available.

342
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,510
Therefore, the plaintiff's claim has been dismissed.

343
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:57,030
There's a victim, but there's no perpetrator.

344
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,210
How strange.

345
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,470
Two of the most common places where there are victims but no perpetrators are

346
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,440
the military and hospitals.

347
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,730
That means it'd be that difficult to reveal the truth.

348
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,470
The client is responsible for supplying evidence, and all the evidence belongs to the hospital.

349
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,200
There isn't much to do if the hospital doesn't cooperate.

350
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,320
What kind of person is Dr. Ahn Young Sook?

351
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,690
Well...

352
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,380
They say seeing is believing.

353
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,260
Should we go meet her? She's not far away from us.

354
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,910
Did you find her? She must be around there.

355
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,030
Take care, then.

356
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,090
- Thank you.
- Yes.

357
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,590
Take good care of yourself.

358
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,650
Thank you.

359
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:08,630
Wow, she's apparently been campaigning in the area every weekend by

360
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,160
doing a "Free Treatment Marathon" for senior citizens who live alone.

361
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,150
Not just in the neighborhood but in the entire administrative district.

362
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,640
Isn't that impressive?

363
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,710
What else is there?

364
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,540
She's famous for performing a lot of surgery.

365
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,660
Well...

366
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,810
They feel uncomfortable about this.

367
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,120
I hope you don't take photos here.

368
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,350
- Got it.
- Thank you for cooperating.

369
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,400
 She has business agreements with each borough office, 

370
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,100
and she's working as a doctor at the neighborhood welfare center.

371
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,830
Other than that,

372
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,740
she's an adjunct professor at a medical school,

373
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,800
a car accident consultant for an insurance company,

374
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,450
 a member of the Medical Dispute Mediation Agency, and so on. 

375
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,030
 She does tons of stuff. 

376
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:55,170
I think we're done. Shall we go to the next neighborhood?

377
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,810
Let's go.

378
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,040
Hello?

379
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,090
Oh, yes.

380
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,940
Was that today?

381
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,500
I'm sorry, I forgot. I'll call you back right away.

382
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,390
What should I do? I forgot that I have an interview.

383
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,050
Oh.

384
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,920
- Please have a meal with this-
- No, Dr. Ahn.

385
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,290
We'll pay for our own meals. You don't get paid at all doing this, either.

386
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,960
It's not that much. Use it to pay for the meals.

387
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,990
Thank you so much.

388
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,070
- Yes, take care.
- Take care.

389
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,490
You were right.

390
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,410
"Seeing is believing."

391
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:57,220
I told you! It's always a good idea to listen to me.

392
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,010
- Hello.
- Jeil Chakhan Hospital, please.

393
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,310
Yes.

394
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,400
Can we listen to the radio?

395
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,670
The elderly people in the neighborhood apparently call Dr. Ahn Young Sook

396
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17,960
the "Schweitzer of the Hillside Villages."

397
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,000
 Do you like that nickname? 

398
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Aigoo, I don't just do it alone.

399
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,640
It's something I do with the volunteers with all our hearts.

400
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,200
They're the ones who should be praised.

401
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,860
 You treat patients, perform surgery, make TV appearances, and do volunteer work. 

402
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,960
 You have unbeatable stamina. 

403
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,560
 Until when are you planning to do volunteer work in hillside villages? 

404
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,690
I don't have much of a plan.

405
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,000
I should just do as much as I can.

406
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,040
 Doesn't she just sound so trustworthy? 

407
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:52,370
 That was Schweitzer of the Hillside Villages, Dr. Ahn Young Sook of Jeil Chakhan Hospital. 

408
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,940
Thank you for making time for us.

409
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,280
Yes, thank you.

410
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,710
I happened to overhear your conversation. You do a lot of good things.

411
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:14,190
It's an honor to have you as a passenger.

412
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,450
I once took a passenger to that hospital.

413
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:26,010
But there was a one-person protest going on in front of the hospital.

414
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,440
He was yelling about revealing the truth about something.

415
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,590
It was really loud.

416
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:37,860
Sir. I'm sorry, but can we just drive quietly?

417
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:42,200
I'm sorry. I was not reading the air.

418
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,300
I'll just drive quietly.

419
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,930
Thank you.

420
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:38,220
If the client smelled of alcohol in front of the OR,

421
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,570
that means she loves drinking a lot.

422
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,630
 So? 

423
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:44,920
She mostly frequents cafes and restaurants.

424
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,160
She doesn't go to bars at all.

425
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,920
How's the incision healing?

426
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,400
Aigoo, doesn't it hurt at all?

427
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,650
I shouldn't be in pain when you're treating me.

428
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,570
I don't have any family,

429
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:00,000
but you're treating me without taking any money.

430
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,670
Make sure to eat regularly

431
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:04,280
and you can't drink at all.

432
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,840
I'm always just taking from you.

433
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,140
This is all I can give you. I'm sorry.

434
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,540
Aigoo, it's okay. You should drink it.

435
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,300
You're making me feel embarrassed. Please take it.

436
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,770
If so, I'll gladly take it.

437
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,690
Yes.

438
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,850
Thank you. I'll enjoy it!

439
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:25,210
The medical instrument you requested is all set.

440
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,250
Okay, thank you.

441
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,070
Shall we get moving, then?

442
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,440
Yes. Take it easy, sir.

443
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,530
Take care.

444
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:36,590
He's such a kind gentleman.

445
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,130
Oh, right.

446
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:43,170
I heard you got a new car, sir.

447
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,640
Gosh. A small one.

448
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,190
It's all thanks to Dr. Ahn's generosity.

449
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:52,190
It's not me. It's all because you've been so thrifty.

450
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,680
Not at all!

451
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,060
Coffee's on me today!

452
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,740
Let's go!

453
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,450
She's getting all the compliments and respect.

454
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,860
What's with this heartwarming scene?

455
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,680
Did the client lie?

456
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,350
 

457
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,670
It's definitely confusing.

458
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,210
What are you confused about?

459
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,910
Do you think the client is lying right now?

460
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,080
That's not what I'm saying, Hyungnim.

461
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,850
It's not, right?

462
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,680
But honestly, I'm not really sure, either.

463
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,630
That's what surgery is like.

464
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:33,760
On the verge of life and death, you sometimes have to

465
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,750
make dangerous decisions.

466
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,850
What do you think, Mr. Kim?

467
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,510
Was it just an accident due to a mistake?

468
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:46,650
Or was it medical malpractice?

469
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:50,180
Honestly, I can't really tell.

470
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,360
If it was due to a mistake or a misfortune,

471
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,790
should we still be accepting this case?

472
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,670
I don't think we should accept this case.

473
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,790
Do you guys agree?

474
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,720
Yes.

475
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,480
Yes, I suppose.

476
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,770
Yes.

477
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:33,240
Excuse me, can I borrow a coin?

478
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,870
I don't have any change.

479
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,950
Do you want coffee-

480
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,510
Are you giving it to me?

481
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,950
Thank you.

482
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,390
Yes.

483
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,600
They're so generous with cream and sugar.

484
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,130
This is so...

485
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,540
delicious, I meant.

486
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,660
It's a lawsuit document. Is it yours?

487
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,510
Do you want me to have a look?

488
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:29,320
Oh, let me introduce myself.

489
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,800
Here you go. That's who I am.

490
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,320
 
You got me a coffee, too. I'll have a look at it

491
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,190
to return the favor.

492
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:43,560
You won't be losing anything since you're looking for an answer.

493
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,730
Why do you think I'm looking for an answer?

494
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,040
I didn't think that. I just...

495
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,040
Your face... Your expression.

496
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,900
Your expression says you've been looking for an answer all this time.

497
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,840
What brings you here, anyway?

498
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,190
I'm here to pick up something I lost.

499
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,430
I left my bag in the taxi.

500
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:05,470
But I arrived sooner than my bag. So I'm waiting.

501
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,830
I see.

502
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:09,610
Seriously. Get your drink and give me that thing.

503
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,690
Let me have a look at it.

504
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,470
 

505
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:19,060
The ruling, info...

506
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,960
Oh, I see.

507
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,410
It's a tricky case.

508
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:29,360
The plaintiff has to prove that the medical practitioner was at fault.

509
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,700
But the defendant has all the records, and the defendant won't just easily hand him

510
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,000
the information that would jeopardize them.

511
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,120
It's a difficult game from the beginning.

512
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,060
Thank you for your advice.

513
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,150
Hold on.

514
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,600
There's another thing that makes it more difficult.

515
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,460
Well...

516
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,390
This person...

517
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:56,830
probably never had anyone on his side from the beginning.

518
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:01,100
That's the impression I got.

519
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,910
Since he worked in a construction site full of noise for decades,

520
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:07,770
his voice must've gotten louder and more blunt.

521
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:12,700
Most people might think he sounds aggressive.

522
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,720
Unlike the briefcases office workers carry,

523
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,900
his work bag must've been filled with things that looked like weapons.

524
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,820
That probably made him look even more threatening.

525
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,830
If someone's clean, they look like a good person. If they look dirty, they look like a bad person.

526
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:30,200
Their lives are tiring, and their workplace is like a battlefield.

527
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:36,080
Just because they don't sound sophisticated, people think less of them.

528
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:40,150
That sounds unjust, doesn't it?

529
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,840
I've been noticing this, but you're very quiet.

530
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,420
Did you notice that I've been talking alone all this time?

531
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,070
I was listening carefully because it was interesting.

532
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:58,210
I see. You have a nice voice, and you're handsome, too.

533
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,870
I have a question. If you're a taxi driver,

534
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:07,450
you must hear about people's tiring lives, right?

535
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:09,930
It does often happen in a taxi.

536
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:13,030
If so, there must be passengers

537
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,150
who need legal help or

538
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:18,050
who have difficulties that laws can't seem to solve.

539
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,830
What if I have in-depth conversations with them-

540
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:24,360
Sounds like you want me to introduce them to you.

541
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,410
Huh?

542
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:28,370
You're pretty quick.

543
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:31,150
Instead, I'll give you 50 percent of

544
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:34,200
the commission fee for bringing me clients.

545
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,780
 

546
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,750
It says the commission fee is 1,000 won.

547
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,550
It's easy to share one out of 10.

548
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:47,590
But sharing half of one thing is very difficult.

549
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:51,170
That's what I'm suggesting right now.

550
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,350
Let me think about it.

551
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,500
Think carefully about this person's case, too.

552
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,640
Have a nice day. You're handsome.

553
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:18,390
 

554
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,420
 

555
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,080
 

556
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:41,440
 

557
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,350
 

558
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,150
 

559
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,490
Give me the freshly made ones,

560
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,670
not the premade ones.

561
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,990
You always ask me that.

562
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,400
So I'm already giving you the fresh ones.

563
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:37,140
 

564
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,430
Ready.

565
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,590
 

566
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,220
Dad!

567
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,160
- Are you okay?
- When did you get here?

568
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,810
A moment ago.

569
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,280
What's that?

570
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,830
- Bungeoppang!
- Are you all done for the day?

571
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:45,970
Yeah. You said you couldn't make it today!

572
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,900
I canceled it so I could see you.

573
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,230
They canceled on you, more like.

574
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,260
Let's go.

575
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,920
Give me your bag.

576
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,650
They look so good.

577
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,330
Have some.

578
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:01,190
 

579
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:06,860
I looked into it, and apparently, the treatment

580
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,710
can be done in six months if you take good care.

581
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,250
I'm okay, Dad.

582
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,870
No, you're not okay. You need to get surgery.

583
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:14,930
Let's do it.

584
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:18,200
Can't I just do more physical therapy?

585
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,200
The doctor also said

586
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,920
the more you wait, the worse it gets. Looking at you earlier,

587
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,510
I think we have waited long enough already.

588
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:29,520
I'm kind of afraid of getting surgery.

589
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,280
You can get a driver's license while recovering.

590
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,190
I can get you a used car if you get a license, too.

591
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,710
- And we can go on a trip together, too.
- Really?

592
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:42,820
Should I get a driver's license and go to the East Sea like we used to

593
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,590
and go to the grass field, too?

594
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:47,660
I can drive you there, you know.

595
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,180
I'm excited just thinking about it.

596
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,170
Soo Ryeon...

597
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,710
 This person... 

598
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:32,860
 probably never had anyone on his side from the beginning. 

599
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,290
 That's the impression I got. 

600
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,030
 

601
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,240
 

602
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,560
Yes.

603
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,420
It's true. It can be confusing.

604
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,590
It has to be confusing.

605
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:14,410
 Go Eun. 

606
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,620
I have a surprise gift for you.

607
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,670
 A gift? What is it? 

608
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,750
It wouldn't be a surprise if I told you.

609
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,180
All right...

610
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,600
All done.

611
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,750
 

612
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,480
 

613
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,300
Turn it off! Hurry!

614
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:56,550
Yes. I'll clarify everything

615
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,950
for everyone.

616
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:07,380
This isn't hard at all.

617
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,970
What are you doing here, Go Eun?

618
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,310
You scared me!

619
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:22,080
Why did you come here?

620
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,150
Great minds think alike.

621
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:30,850
 

622
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,670
Candies?

623
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:38,040
Wow!

624
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:43,200
It wakes me right up.

625
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,620
- I told you.
- Not bad!

626
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:49,010
Anyway, the client is trapped between the case and the accident right now.

627
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:50,640
That's what I'm saying.

628
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,980
Finding anything could be helpful. Don't you think?

629
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,650
I agree.

630
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:58,520
We can't just sit and watch.

631
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,330
Look at Go Eun. I can't see her fingers.

632
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:18,120
If everyone wants something clear-cut,

633
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,160
I should find it for them.

634
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,590
- Don't you think?
- You're right!

635
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,080
We want that! We want that!

636
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,980
Find it! Find it!

637
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,910
If I find out if any of them tampered with evidence,

638
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,070
- it's game over.
- Game over!

639
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,400
How dare they try to fool us?

640
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,970
Go Eun can never be fooled!

641
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,230
Dr. Ahn Young Sook.

642
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:11,470
I'll tell everyone that you tampered with the evidence!

643
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:14,160
- Tell everyone!
- Tell everyone!

644
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,670
 

645
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:40,830
I failed.

646
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:44,320
There's nothing at all. What's going on?

647
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,570
What is this?

648
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:49,670
What are we going to do?

649
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:52,470
 

650
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,180
Yes.

651
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,720
 Didn't you say you had a surprise gift for me earlier? 

652
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,650
Surprise!

653
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:07,670
There's nothing! What do you think?

654
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:11,010
Did I surprise you? I was surprised that there was nothing, too.

655
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:12,220
 Oh... 

656
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:16,800
I looked everywhere for a piece of evidence because everyone was dissatisfied.

657
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,400
But I failed. It was just a waste of time!

658
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,530
 Hold on a moment. I'll be there in a second. 

659
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,520
"In a second?"

660
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,520
Where are you right now?

661
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,210
 Nearby. 

662
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:31,050
Nearby?

663
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,200
 

664
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:43,940
 

665
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:48,680
I thought we agreed not to take this case.

666
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,470
They never listen, do they?

667
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:06,070
I want to find out if it was an accident or intentional, too.

668
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:12,120
 But we got all of Han Soo Ryeon's medical records from the data server. 

669
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:18,160
Yes. But Dr. Ahn takes handwritten notes when she sees patients.

670
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:23,030
 She digitizes that later. 

671
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:31,430
You're trying to find out of they omitted anything in the digitizing process?

672
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:43,680
 But if they did that, would they have kept that record? 

673
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,280
I would've gotten rid of it myself.

674
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:51,990
Medical records have to be kept for 10 years by law.

675
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,790
They couldn't have gotten rid of it easily.

676
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,500
 

677
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,230
 

678
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,840
 

679
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:33,540
I found Han Soo Ryeon's patient records.

680
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,280
You did?

681
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:39,040
But you were right.

682
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:48,440
We can't avoid not seeing it at this point.

683
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,730
See what?

684
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:54,930
You know what they say. "The crime scene

685
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:57,680
knows the truth."

686
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,580
 

687
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,620
 

688
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:16,560
 Is the OR the crime scene you were talking about? 

689
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:21,650
If we can't find anything, it's not a bad idea to begin where everything started.

690
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:23,210
Will you go in there yourself?

691
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,710
There's nothing we can do since there's no security camera inside.

692
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:27,920
I just need to go inside and find out.

693
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,200
How did you know that there was no camera in the OR?

694
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,360
If there were, you would've shown it to me already.

695
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,450
There's nothing you can't hack into in this world.

696
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,650
But how will you go in there?

697
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,510
They won't let outside people in.

698
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:47,220
That's for the better. I wasn't going to ring the doorbell anyway.

699
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,330
 

700
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:02,090
Let's move you to the OR.

701
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:04,080
You've been fasting, right?

702
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,030
Alright.

703
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:09,970
Are you okay?

704
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:12,660
You're going to the OR, right?

705
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,690
Well, yes.

706
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:17,480
But we can do it ourselves.

707
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,490
I was on the way, anyway.

708
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,090
You must be new here.

709
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:36,360
Have you not seen me before? I've seen you a few times.

710
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,950
Really?

711
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:40,850
I don't really remember.

712
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:42,860
Which department are you in?

713
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:45,760
I'm disappointed.

714
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,850
I'm upset. I won't tell you.

715
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:51,130
Here we go.

716
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:53,690
 

717
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:54,410
 

718
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:55,310
 

719
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:59,480
 

720
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,100
We'll take it from here. Thank you.

721
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,490
Thank you.

722
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,410
I remember!

723
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:15,660
NS. You're a neurosurgeon, right?

724
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:47,500
Mr. Kim, I think you need to get out of there now.

725
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,440
Did I trigger that somehow?

726
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,400
I think the OR has a detector.

727
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,270
You should get out of there first!

728
00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:00,010
 What's this about? Hurry up and take care of it. 

729
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:12,430
You two, guard the door and make sure no one goes in and out.

730
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:20,350
 

731
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:26,450
Gather around, everyone.

732
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:30,630
I think I've told you many times.

733
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:33,930
Who brought a camera inside the OR?

734
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:36,940
Imagine you were a patient.

735
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:40,790
Would you like someone to have a video of your operation?

736
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:48,230
Come forward! Who brought a camera inside the OR?

737
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:57,180
It turned off. I think it was a sensor error.

738
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,010
- Search everyone.
- Yes.

739
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:02,690
Empty out your pockets.

740
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,500
Check the lockers, too.

741
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,450
It's fine. I'll do it.

742
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:13,580
What's this? Why is it going off again?

743
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:21,620
I think it really is broken.

744
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:24,820
Let's wrap it up and get ready for the operation.

745
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,270
Yes.

746
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:30,140
Alright! Go back in. Get ready for operations.

747
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,780
 

748
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:01,300
Why do they have a camera detector, anyway?

749
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,670
They probably installed it because of me.

750
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:11,260
I used to go to the police officer for the case every day

751
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:13,220
and told him

752
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,340
that I was victimized.

753
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,970
But the officer told me that words don't do anything.

754
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,090
He said I needed a video, at least.

755
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:30,740
So I brought a camera to the OR once.

756
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:36,390
But, well, I got caught before I got to do anything.

757
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:40,390
Is it called trespassing?

758
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:44,710
The court put me on probation for that.

759
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:57,660
Even so, it detected your camera from pretty far away.

760
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,570
An advanced equipment like that

761
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:04,140
is ridiculously expensive.

762
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:07,890
Can't you tell that they're determined to

763
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:10,660
never let anyone film inside the OR?

764
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:13,940
 

765
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,620
By the way, what is this?

766
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:18,980
It's neither English nor Korean. I don't understand it at all.

767
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,230
This is Han Soo Ryeon's medical chart?

768
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:24,520
The person who wrote it probably can't read it, either, right?

769
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:29,330
She got surgery because where her left thighbone and hips meet was weak.

770
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:34,260
Why are you all looking at me like that?

771
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:37,800
Mr. Choi, I heard you were a good student. Did you go to medical school?

772
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,900
Hyungnim.

773
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,700
How did you read this? Did you really study medicine?

774
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:45,020
I find you guys even more strange.

775
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,480
There's a picture of a person here.

776
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,550
And it has an "X" on it, right? It means that's the problem area.

777
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:53,240
- Come on!
- Yes, of course.

778
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,050
It worked, it worked!

779
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:56,770
What is it? Did you find something?

780
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:59,110
Everyone, come and look at this.

781
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,370
It's the record of Han Soo Ryeon's medical bills.

782
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:05,990
Wow, that's a crazy amount.

783
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:09,870
You can feel the client's desperation by just looking at the bills, right?

784
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:12,340
All I can see is that it cost him a lot.

785
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,600
Aigoo.

786
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:20,340
According to medical law, you can't get medical insurance if there's a perpetrator.

787
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,580
As you all know,

788
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:28,220
medical costs vary a lot depending on whether you get insurance benefits.

789
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:32,100
If it were just an unfortunate accident without a perpetrator,

790
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,970
he could've gotten insurance benefits.

791
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:38,740
But he refused to give up until the end.

792
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,850
Even when he kept losing.

793
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:44,870
There must've been something more important than money.

794
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,210
Truth.

795
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:54,740
I should go back to the crime scene.

796
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:57,540
The crime scene? The OR?

797
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,260
Yes. I need to check something.

798
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:01,380
You already went in there once.

799
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,770
There wasn't even a place to hide.

800
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:06,240
I won't be hiding.

801
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,420
What would you do, then?

802
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,710
I'll...

803
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:12,620
just be lying down.

804
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:15,820
You'll be taken to the OR now.

805
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,830
 

806
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,890
You've been fasting, right?

807
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:29,410
Yes.

808
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:33,680
I'll have the same condition Han Soo Ryeon had.

809
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,170
What if they accidentally operate on you?

810
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:37,880
You'd be put to sleep first.

811
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,790
If that happens, you should watch over me for me.

812
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:47,210
Find out whether it's a crime scene or not.

813
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:55,950
I'll go easy on you. Don't worry.

814
00:58:57,830 --> 00:59:01,430
- I'll follow you.
- I'll be waiting for you.

815
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:11,140
The weather is nice, too!

816
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:14,770
I'm having another easy day...

817
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:28,340
Aigoo...

818
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:32,180
Aigoo!

819
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:34,320
Hey! Hey!

820
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,820
Aigoo, Aigoo!

821
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:39,030
Are you okay?

822
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,300
I upgraded it to a super-wide lens. It'd no longer have blind spots.

823
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,880
But the camera detector must still be there.

824
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,890
Turn it on three minutes after I go in.

825
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:58,420
If it goes off later, they'd think it's a malfunction.

826
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:01,470
You'd make them turn it off themselves?

827
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:05,430
Our first attempt wasn't a complete failure, after all.

828
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:08,230
 

829
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,560
 

830
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:30,310
 

831
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:41,540
 

832
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:51,500
Okay. Well...

833
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,960
What's the worst that could happen?

834
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,390
 

835
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,140
 

836
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,870
Try to relax, sir.

837
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:27,900
It'd smell a bit bad for a second.

838
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:48,910
 

839
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:00,750
Open your eyes, sir.

840
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:04,820
Anesthesia is complete.

841
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:22,210
No one noticed that the patient was wearing glasses?

842
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:23,930
I'm sorry.

843
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:34,800
Geez, what's going on? I waited long enough.

844
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,700
Why is that going off again?

845
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:59,040
I thought I was going to die.

846
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:02,460
I told them to get the expensive one.

847
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:05,790
Let's get started, Dr. Gong.

848
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:18,640
Dr. Gong?

849
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:28,770
What's this?

850
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:31,650
Where did this person come from?

851
01:03:50,970 --> 01:03:53,540
Is he performing the surgery?

852
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:08,300
 !

853
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:11,070
♫  I'll find out before I awake  ♫

854
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:14,000
♫  Take me away, take me away  ♫

855
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,570
♫  You don't have to tell me  ♫

856
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:24,740
♫  Your eyes already told me clearly  ♫

857
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:32,500
♫  Those painful nights were so cruel to me  ♫

858
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:37,070
♫  I remember clearly your cry  ♫

859
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:39,100
 

860
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:41,330
 Dr. Gong. Aren't you curious... 

861
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:43,840
 which doctor does most surgeries between 

862
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,830
 Dr. Ahn Young Sook or Dr. Gong Soo Ho? 

863
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:51,430
 There are surgery practice kits online, too. 

864
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:53,520
 Why are his blood vessels so ugly? 

865
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:58,100
 She put that weak old man in that state. How could she be so indifferent about it? 

866
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:59,690
 You know a patient named Han Soo Ryeon, right? 

867
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:03,490
 You kept quiet even though you saw him protesting for over a year. 

868
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:04,860
 Even though you knew everything. 

869
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,420
 It's a side effect of anesthesia. 

870
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:08,560
 Because it'd never happen to you, anyway. 

871
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,640
 It's an unfortunate event that could happen to anyone. 

872
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:15,230
 I want to make Dr. Ahn Young Sook of Jeil Chakhan Hospital famous. 

873
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:16,550
 Do you need help? 

874
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:17,930
 Dr. Ahn Young Sook... 

875
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:20,190
 - Help me.
- Help me! 

876
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:23,040
 I hope she enjoys her special day. 

877
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,740
 Mr. Jang, can you hear me? 

878
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:27,900
 Gong Shin. Gong Shin? 

879
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:31,080
 I told you that we'd take care of things in their style. 

880
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,230
 I know Kim Do Gi better than anyone. 

881
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:36,010
♫  Please don't collapse  ♫

882
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:38,300
♫  Even before I can touch...  ♫
