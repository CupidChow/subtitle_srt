1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,140
 

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,870
 

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,400
 

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,100
 Thanks for watching Taxi Driver 2 on Viki! 

5
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,550
♫  He has no name! He has no name!  ♫

6
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,640
♫  He has no name! He has no name!  ♫

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,520
♫  He has no name...  ♫

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,900
- How dare you try to fight me?
- I heard you don't even remember your name.

9
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,330
Aren't you lying that you don't remember?

10
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,370
You never had a name, did you?

11
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,910
You have no name! You have no name!

12
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,020
You have no name!

13
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,440
 Father! We're in trouble! 

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,040
 Please come over! 

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,140
Father! Ha Joon hyung won't wake up!

16
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,460
He pushed him because he suddenly ran over to him.

17
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,840
It's okay. It's okay.

18
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,460
Thank you.

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,650
Did someone get injured?

20
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:04,310
When a kid dies because he tripped while running around alone,

21
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,630
what should I say on paper?

22
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,480
I'll write exactly that.

23
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,680
Come over when you're done with work. Let's eat together.

24
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,370
Yes, sir.

25
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,530
 

26
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,380
What's your name?

27
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,790
I don't remember. I can't really-

28
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,300
You just won a fight.

29
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,550
What happened, and who was in the wrong

30
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,170
can only be told by the one who won the fight.

31
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,110
Do you think it was your fault?

32
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,260
I agree. You didn't do anything wrong.

33
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,760
Ha Joon died because he was weak.

34
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,750
It's bad to be weak.

35
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,930
You have to be stronger to win a kind fight.

36
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,060
You always have to win in fights.

37
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,870
You're Ohn Ha Joon starting today.

38
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:25,050
You'll fight the evil on behalf of Ha Joon, who just died.

39
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,460
You look weak when your clothes are dirty.

40
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,150
Should we go shopping for clothes, Ha Joon?

41
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,400
You grew quicker than I thought.

42
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,790
Today, I'll give you a present for becoming stronger.

43
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,270
The ones with the ring will help you.

44
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,290
I'm sorry, I'm late.

45
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,060
Long time no see.

46
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,080
How should I handle this case?

47
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,280
If the father who was looking for his child

48
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,650
killed himself by jumping off a building because he couldn't find him,

49
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,100
what should one say on paper?

50
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,370
Yes, got it.

51
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,990
I was promoted to team leader.

52
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,930
Thank you, Principal.

53
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,410
Come over when you're off work, Team Leader Park.

54
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,040
Let's have a meal together.

55
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,810
Yes, I'll finish off quickly and come by.

56
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,570
It's a ring.

57
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,870
It's a cross and... is that a snake or something?

58
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,860
It's the ring Black Sun's director was wearing.

59
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,810
We found Black Sun while following the ring.

60
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,270
We saw it in Kotaya, too.

61
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,730
I found something, too.

62
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,020
There was this symbol on the seal Mr. Kang was using, too.

63
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,520
They're the same.

64
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,450
They were all in on it together!

65
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:44,510
Why do they use a symbol like that, anyway?

66
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,410
It's to tell if someone is a friend or a foe.

67
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,100
It's useful when making connections when you don't know each other, too.

68
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,060
That means there are a lot more bad guys than we know of.

69
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,200
So many that they don't even know each other.

70
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,530
That could be.

71
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:03,850
The one who made this symbol must be the mastermind of everything.

72
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,240
 

73
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,670
Are they affiliated companies?

74
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,850
 

75
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,160
 

76
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,010
- I'm sorry.
- How annoying!

77
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,140
Hey, we both made a mistake. What do you mean by "annoying?"

78
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,520
How could you talk like that?

79
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,410
This is why I said, "annoying."

80
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,980
What are you doing right now?

81
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,100
Excuse me.

82
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,060
Wait...

83
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,450
H-Hey, a-are you okay?

84
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,030
You swung a knife at me? You crazy bastard.

85
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,070
What? When did I?

86
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,950
No! I didn't do it! I didn't do it!

87
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,250
Oh, boy...

88
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,150
Well, how...

89
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,300
I didn't do it!

90
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,950
I didn't do it.

91
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,780
 

92
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,220
 

93
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,220
 

94
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,450
He just got arrested, apparently.

95
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,600
 

96
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,120
Do I need to...

97
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,100
get on this taxi now?

98
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,940
 

99
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:58,950
Could you tell me what has happened?

100
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,760
Please save my son...

101
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,520
who is in prison.

102
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,690
I beg you.

103
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,920
It's unfair that he got locked up, but he's even getting death threats.

104
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,880
The father must be so upset.

105
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,520
If it happened in prison, the police can't protect him, either.

106
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,870
That's why the father asked us to save his son.

107
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,620
 

108
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,060
- I think there's another reason he is being threatened.
- Another reason?

109
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,970
Lee Shi Wan. He's a team leader of a currency trading team.

110
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,630
He will be attending a trial as a witness soon.

111
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,190
A trial?

112
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,910
Have a look at this.

113
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:57,750
He reported unusual currency trading activities to the Prosecutors' Office.

114
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,610
Aigoo, look at those numbers! I have no idea what I'm looking at.

115
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,830
Money has been being sent overseas steadily for trade fees,

116
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,330
but the fund suddenly skyrocketed recently.

117
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:12,900
By the way, the money has been through some people we know.

118
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,800
These people...

119
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:26,730
I think I know how we provoked them exactly.

120
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,390
Since Mr. Kim shook Black Sun to the core,

121
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,600
the money had to escape, not to mention the people.

122
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,330
That's why the money suddenly started moving around more than usual.

123
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,610
And Lee Shi Wan, who works for the currency trading team, caught it.

124
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:45,090
Because of Mr. Kim, their dirty money had to come up to the surface.

125
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,150
The death threats he's getting might end up being more than just threats.

126
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,370
I think so, too.

127
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,410
They'll try to stop him from attending the trial no matter what.

128
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,950
If the informant who submitted the evidence doesn't show up, the evidence will lose its power

129
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,210
and the trial might end due to a lack of evidence.

130
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,510
- What's the date of the trial?
- It's less than a week away.

131
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,730
He's an even bigger risk, then.

132
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,310
- I'm on board.
- Me, too.

133
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:17,390
Providing protection is key in this case. We'd better hurry.

134
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,310
 

135
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,540
 

136
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,890
 

137
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,490
No. 5283 is getting started.

138
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,130
This is Jang Sung Chul.

139
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,500
Who am I speaking to?

140
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,550
I only did it because they told me to!

141
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,600
What you saw is just the tip of the iceberg.

142
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,880
I'll help you catch all of them.

143
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,460
Instead, you need to save me.

144
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,750
I'm really innocent!

145
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,950
How could I trust you?

146
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:24,760
Check Da-2152 in the case file room at the Prosecutors' Office.

147
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,320
You'll find out the truth, then.

148
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,140
If you want to catch them, you have to save me!

149
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,720
- Mr. Ohn!
- What should I do, Hyun Jo?

150
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,430
You'll get a dishonorable discharge even before you become the police commissioner.

151
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,190
 

152
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,200
You're temporarily being transferred from another prison.

153
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,320
 Prosecutor Gang Ha Na helped us this time, too. 

154
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,940
Where's Lee Shi Wan?

155
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,840
He's in Cell No. 3.

156
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,710
Can you assign me to the same cell?

157
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,230
The guard assigns you to the cell immediately on site.

158
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,310
I won't be able to do it.

159
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:53,660
 By the way, why did you two follow him? 

160
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,720
 I don't think you can be helpful at all. 

161
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,100
We'll take care of things if something happens to Mr. Kim.

162
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,900
I'm so scared. This place must be filled with scary people!

163
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,370
Don't worry. I'm sure they'd be scared of you.

164
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,560
Can I really trust you?

165
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,160
This tattoo will prove it for you. No one could touch you.

166
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,950
I got chills! I got scared as soon as I saw it.

167
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,750
They've been staring at you this whole time.

168
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,180
They'll talk to you if you make eye contact.

169
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,120
You'd be safe if you kept looking at something else.

170
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,850
Okay, okay.

171
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,230
You'd better not be a burden to Mr. Kim.

172
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,850
Having three of us increases the chance of being assigned to the same cell as him.

173
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,300
I'm glad they joined me.

174
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,620
1672. 2235. Come out.

175
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,350
1672, Cell No. 5. 2235, Cell No. 8. Go in.

176
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:03,510
5283. 4196. 5256. Come out.

177
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,330
5283. Cell No. 6.

178
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,070
5256, Cell No. 3.

179
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:13,330
- 4196. Cell No. 5.
- No. 5.

180
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,140
- Go in.
- Go in!

181
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,060
Next!

182
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,080
 I'm glad Mr. Park got Cell No. 3 

183
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,000
3596. Cell No. 9.

184
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,370
5256. Cell No. 3.

185
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,920
5283. Cell No. 6.

186
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,370
I'm a scary person. I'm a scary person. No one can touch me.

187
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,370
I'm a scary person...

188
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Hey! Are you my roommate?

189
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,980
 

190
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,000
Boss, look at him!

191
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,890
I think he's in Gwangalli's Flame Gang, the gang Boss was in two years ago!

192
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,230
I'm not from Gwangalli. I'm from Seoul.

193
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,140
You bastard! Are you the one who stabbed Boss?

194
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,190
- I don't know-
- Don't answer!

195
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,780
You'll die today if you answer me or not!

196
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,020
Geez! What are you doing?

197
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,150
We'll stay up all night waiting for the hazing to start!

198
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,990
What's this...

199
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,140
How thoughtful! You even brought moving gifts.

200
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,050
Have you been going in and out of prison a lot?

201
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,290
My mother brought them to me.

202
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:07,290
You made your mother see you off going to prison?

203
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,620
Geez! What a son of a b****!

204
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,630
May I talk to you about my family?

205
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,400
Go ahead!

206
00:20:17,949 --> 00:20:22,730
My family has been poor since I was a kid.

207
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,966
We've never gone out to eat, something people do all the time.

208
00:20:56,174 --> 00:20:59,664
Why don't we get started if we're going to do something?

209
00:20:59,664 --> 00:21:04,164
What is he saying? He bothered us when we weren't doing anything.

210
00:21:04,164 --> 00:21:07,464
You can't meditate well if you sit so uncomfortably.

211
00:21:07,464 --> 00:21:11,934
You're sitting like that because you're hiding a tool in your pants.

212
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:17,604
Is water precious here? You're reorganizing the unwashed towels.

213
00:21:17,604 --> 00:21:23,054
You've been scratching a lot. You must be keeping something in your pants.

214
00:21:23,054 --> 00:21:25,564
Lastly, you.

215
00:21:25,564 --> 00:21:27,744
You're holding your book upside down.

216
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:32,424
You have a pretty good eye.

217
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:35,844
Did you see this? Aigoo, seriously...

218
00:21:38,704 --> 00:21:41,214
Newbie, why don't you introduce yourself?

219
00:21:41,214 --> 00:21:46,344
Yeah, and tell us how much you brought in your detention fund.

220
00:21:48,024 --> 00:21:50,554
I'm not planning to cause trouble here.

221
00:21:50,554 --> 00:21:54,874
Just keep doing what you've been doing. That's the most I can do for you.

222
00:21:54,874 --> 00:21:59,654
I feel like he's looking down on us. Don't you think, Cell Leader?

223
00:21:59,654 --> 00:22:02,274
You son of a bitch. You lost your mind!

224
00:22:02,274 --> 00:22:04,834
So what's your story?

225
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:08,174
Me?

226
00:22:09,814 --> 00:22:11,684
I was a taxi driver.

227
00:22:13,034 --> 00:22:16,844
- Mr. Driver!
- I'm a taxi driver, too!

228
00:22:32,504 --> 00:22:34,354
What are you doing?

229
00:22:37,104 --> 00:22:39,754
Where did the last one go?

230
00:22:39,754 --> 00:22:42,014
Huh? Why do you all look like that?

231
00:22:42,014 --> 00:22:45,574
Cell Leader! Did you have a fight?

232
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:49,224
The cell leader is over here...

233
00:22:49,224 --> 00:22:52,644
You're the cell leader!

234
00:22:52,644 --> 00:22:55,314
Well...

235
00:22:55,314 --> 00:22:58,704
Cell Leader, Guard is looking for you.

236
00:22:58,704 --> 00:23:00,464
Huh?

237
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:02,884
Well...

238
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:05,484
Is it time to eat already?

239
00:23:15,404 --> 00:23:22,064
♫  When I miss my mom  ♫

240
00:23:22,064 --> 00:23:26,494
♫  I take out a picture of her  ♫

241
00:23:26,494 --> 00:23:27,994
What's this noise?

242
00:23:27,994 --> 00:23:34,054
♫  Seeing Mom's face...  ♫

243
00:23:34,054 --> 00:23:40,914
♫  makes me cry  ♫

244
00:23:40,914 --> 00:23:41,944
♫  Mom...  ♫

245
00:23:41,944 --> 00:23:45,694
Who's singing? Be quiet!

246
00:23:45,694 --> 00:23:47,674
I'm sorry!

247
00:23:50,904 --> 00:23:52,354
Confirmed.

248
00:23:57,684 --> 00:24:01,244
 

249
00:24:06,214 --> 00:24:07,814
Thanks for your joining us.

250
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:09,254
- Mr. Jang.
- Yes.

251
00:24:09,254 --> 00:24:12,244
You came a long way. I'm sorry you couldn't get much out of it.

252
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:15,134
It's okay. In the next year's subsidy meeting,

253
00:24:15,134 --> 00:24:18,234
please consider our Bluebird Foundation. I'd be so grateful.

254
00:24:18,234 --> 00:24:19,634
Got it.

255
00:24:19,634 --> 00:24:22,354
- We'll always be here.
- Yes.

256
00:24:22,354 --> 00:24:25,634
Thank you, everyone. Let's go.

257
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:39,104
 

258
00:24:49,594 --> 00:24:54,294
 Check Da-2152 in the case file room at the Prosecutors' Office. 

259
00:24:54,294 --> 00:24:56,734
 You'll find out the truth, then. 

260
00:25:06,414 --> 00:25:07,194
 

261
00:25:07,194 --> 00:25:09,164
 

262
00:25:09,164 --> 00:25:10,424
 

263
00:25:12,324 --> 00:25:14,644
 

264
00:25:21,434 --> 00:25:25,974
 

265
00:25:25,974 --> 00:25:27,324
 

266
00:25:29,164 --> 00:25:32,844
 What you saw is just the tip of the iceberg. 

267
00:25:43,004 --> 00:25:45,874
- Have you been well?
- I'm okay, but...

268
00:25:45,874 --> 00:25:48,324
The side dish... Hey!

269
00:25:48,324 --> 00:25:50,494
Bring it over quickly!

270
00:25:50,494 --> 00:25:54,474
- I'm worried about him.
- Please enjoy!

271
00:25:54,474 --> 00:25:56,264
Eat a lot.

272
00:26:01,014 --> 00:26:05,034
I promised to be loyal to Boss.

273
00:26:05,034 --> 00:26:07,284
That's how I survived.

274
00:26:07,284 --> 00:26:11,144
- I said this will protect you-
- I almost died because of this!

275
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:15,964
How did it go with Shi Won?

276
00:26:15,964 --> 00:26:19,374
He wasn't in the cell. He's at the clinic because he got injured.

277
00:26:19,374 --> 00:26:21,524
There must've been an attacker.

278
00:26:22,704 --> 00:26:24,444
It was all of them.

279
00:26:27,814 --> 00:26:31,314
You mean everyone is after Lee Shi Wan? How does that make sense?

280
00:26:31,314 --> 00:26:33,844
You apparently get a reward.

281
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:35,794
Reward?

282
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:39,884
They're even betting money on whether he'll die within this week or not.

283
00:26:39,884 --> 00:26:41,224
They're out of their minds.

284
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:46,214
I don't know how long he could last, even if he comes back.

285
00:26:46,214 --> 00:26:47,934
This is not a simple case.

286
00:26:47,934 --> 00:26:51,184
We don't know who will attack him and when. How could we protect him?

287
00:26:51,184 --> 00:26:53,934
How much is the reward money?

288
00:26:53,934 --> 00:26:56,334
- One billion?
- One billion?

289
00:26:56,334 --> 00:26:57,804
- That's amazing!
- Amazing.

290
00:26:57,804 --> 00:27:01,444
We'll need a protective layer for Lee Shi Wan.

291
00:27:01,444 --> 00:27:03,774
Whether we'd be here or not.

292
00:27:05,594 --> 00:27:07,224
A protective layer?

293
00:27:07,224 --> 00:27:11,504
 You mean we should make the prisoners avoid him on their own? 

294
00:27:15,244 --> 00:27:20,054
Go Eun. I'll give you a quiz. Do you want to guess the answer?

295
00:27:20,054 --> 00:27:21,744
What is it?

296
00:27:21,744 --> 00:27:25,624
When will a crazy bastard show up, and where?

297
00:27:25,624 --> 00:27:27,774
A crazy bastard...

298
00:27:27,774 --> 00:27:29,504
When and where does he show up?

299
00:27:29,504 --> 00:27:31,054
Here.

300
00:27:31,054 --> 00:27:32,974
Right now.

301
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:46,044
The soup is too bland!

302
00:27:48,314 --> 00:27:50,464
Water! Water!

303
00:27:52,424 --> 00:27:53,894
How dare you!

304
00:27:54,484 --> 00:27:56,524
How dare you fight me?

305
00:27:56,524 --> 00:27:58,904
You bastard!

306
00:27:58,904 --> 00:28:01,524
You little!

307
00:28:01,524 --> 00:28:03,374
Hey, hey!

308
00:28:04,694 --> 00:28:06,424
You bastards!

309
00:28:06,424 --> 00:28:10,274
Why can't you say that the food tastes bad?

310
00:28:10,274 --> 00:28:13,934
- What's with him?
- Where did that crazy bastard come from?

311
00:28:13,934 --> 00:28:16,874
Stop him right now, you bastard!

312
00:28:19,974 --> 00:28:23,434
Hey, you have nowhere to run.

313
00:28:23,434 --> 00:28:26,064
We'll settle the bill right here!

314
00:28:26,064 --> 00:28:27,994
Bill?

315
00:28:27,994 --> 00:28:30,194
In cash? Do you accept cards, too?

316
00:28:30,194 --> 00:28:32,514
Crazy bastard.

317
00:28:32,514 --> 00:28:37,304
I'll fix up that pretty face of yours today!

318
00:28:37,304 --> 00:28:39,264
Come here!

319
00:28:39,264 --> 00:28:40,804
Okay.

320
00:28:42,224 --> 00:28:43,984
You'll pay in a lump sum.

321
00:28:43,984 --> 00:28:46,984
What is he saying?

322
00:28:46,984 --> 00:28:48,624
What's he doing?

323
00:28:48,624 --> 00:28:51,534
- Move!
- What are you doing?

324
00:28:51,534 --> 00:28:53,914
Move! Go away!

325
00:28:53,914 --> 00:28:57,214
- What's he doing?
- Hey, bastard!

326
00:29:03,444 --> 00:29:05,974
Do you see it?

327
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:07,434
Nice!

328
00:29:07,434 --> 00:29:08,494
See?

329
00:29:08,494 --> 00:29:11,144
You're unbelievably muscular.

330
00:29:11,144 --> 00:29:13,224
Your leg muscles are...

331
00:29:17,004 --> 00:29:19,854
I brought you the bread you ordered.

332
00:29:23,544 --> 00:29:28,394
- How did you pay?
- I-I paid in lump sum.

333
00:29:28,394 --> 00:29:31,894
You should've paid in the interest-free, three-month installment plan!

334
00:29:31,894 --> 00:29:34,574
I'm sorry. Here.

335
00:29:38,714 --> 00:29:40,524
- What do you think?
- It's incredible!

336
00:29:40,524 --> 00:29:42,214
Hey!

337
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:44,614
What are you doing right now?

338
00:29:45,634 --> 00:29:48,134
Is he talking to me?

339
00:29:52,354 --> 00:29:54,214
Why are you lifting heavy stuff?

340
00:29:54,214 --> 00:29:56,784
What's he saying right now?

341
00:29:56,784 --> 00:29:58,404
I asked you why you're lifting heavy stuff.

342
00:29:58,404 --> 00:30:01,514
L-L-Look at that bastard

343
00:30:05,524 --> 00:30:07,824
It's hard to lift heavy stuff.

344
00:30:07,824 --> 00:30:11,614
- It's not that bad...
- Let's lift lightly, okay?

345
00:30:11,614 --> 00:30:13,154
Yes.

346
00:30:13,994 --> 00:30:16,974
What are you supposed to say when someone asks that?

347
00:30:16,974 --> 00:30:21,054
Hey! He's just a damn lunatic! A lunatic!

348
00:30:21,054 --> 00:30:22,694
It's hard to lift heavy things!

349
00:30:22,694 --> 00:30:25,644
We can't get caught. Let's go, let's go! Be quiet!

350
00:30:34,464 --> 00:30:37,484
It's a ball. Whose is this?

351
00:30:37,484 --> 00:30:40,154
It's that lunatic! He's totally crazy...

352
00:30:40,154 --> 00:30:41,674
This?

353
00:30:42,714 --> 00:30:46,144
- Is it yours?
- Yes, it's mine.

354
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:48,944
This is mine!

355
00:30:48,944 --> 00:30:51,264
He's crazy. Let's just go.

356
00:30:51,264 --> 00:30:53,004
Just go!

357
00:31:01,344 --> 00:31:03,874
Shi Wan came out.

358
00:31:03,874 --> 00:31:05,824
Let go.

359
00:31:06,874 --> 00:31:10,324
Look how they're harassing him as soon as he comes out.

360
00:31:10,324 --> 00:31:12,174
They're really bastards.

361
00:31:12,174 --> 00:31:15,024
Please find out where they buy cigarettes.

362
00:31:15,024 --> 00:31:16,674
Cigarettes? Okay.

363
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:20,084
Everyone is talking about how 5283 is a lunatic.

364
00:31:20,084 --> 00:31:24,054
I know. Everyone is avoiding us because they heard the rumor.

365
00:31:24,054 --> 00:31:27,204
Of course, they should. They don't know what I'd do.

366
00:31:27,204 --> 00:31:29,554
 

367
00:31:30,804 --> 00:31:34,114
They should be careful of the lunatic's best friend, too.

368
00:31:34,114 --> 00:31:36,004
Best friend?

369
00:31:36,004 --> 00:31:38,684
Shi Wan!

370
00:31:42,754 --> 00:31:46,044
My best friend!

371
00:31:46,044 --> 00:31:50,494
- What's he saying?
- Hey, hey!

372
00:31:53,284 --> 00:31:55,334
Hey. What's this?

373
00:31:55,334 --> 00:31:58,374
What are you doing?

374
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:01,094
Are they friends?

375
00:32:01,094 --> 00:32:03,574
- I'll give this to you.
- I think they're really close, Hyungnim.

376
00:32:03,574 --> 00:32:05,894
I'll fight him!

377
00:32:05,894 --> 00:32:08,914
- Don't do it!
- What should we do?

378
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:12,554
What do I do...

379
00:32:12,554 --> 00:32:16,374
Tell people that the game is off.

380
00:32:16,374 --> 00:32:18,264
Shit!

381
00:32:19,764 --> 00:32:22,084
 

382
00:32:28,294 --> 00:32:30,924
It's 5,000 won per cigarette.

383
00:32:30,924 --> 00:32:34,214
If you buy a pack, you get 20% off. So it's 80,000 won.

384
00:32:34,214 --> 00:32:37,244
That's too expensive!

385
00:32:37,244 --> 00:32:39,234
I pay a fortune at the toll gate.

386
00:32:39,234 --> 00:32:42,694
Go somewhere else if you think it's too much.

387
00:32:45,574 --> 00:32:47,994
I don't smoke.

388
00:32:49,914 --> 00:32:53,774
You're that lunatic!

389
00:32:53,774 --> 00:32:56,684
Do you have a connection outside

390
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:59,024
or are you getting it through a guard?

391
00:32:59,024 --> 00:33:00,404
Pardon?

392
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:08,354
It'd be nice if you could bring this in, too, when you bring the cigarettes in.

393
00:33:15,864 --> 00:33:17,774
I can't!

394
00:33:17,774 --> 00:33:21,854
The guards will kill me if I get caught doing something else.

395
00:33:21,854 --> 00:33:24,604
Is that so? I once explained to someone about

396
00:33:24,604 --> 00:33:28,344
who they should consider as their boss.

397
00:33:28,344 --> 00:33:33,834
It cost him three molars and two fingers.

398
00:33:33,834 --> 00:33:36,764
I wonder what it'd be like this time.

399
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,644
Should I start with the front tooth?

400
00:33:45,644 --> 00:33:47,514
No!

401
00:33:58,814 --> 00:34:01,584
Hey! Broker No. 3!

402
00:34:04,034 --> 00:34:07,134
You're here to deliver this, right?

403
00:34:07,134 --> 00:34:10,964
Geez. You already looked really suspicious standing around like that!

404
00:34:10,964 --> 00:34:13,714
Why would you meet someone in front of a prison?

405
00:34:14,784 --> 00:34:17,494
Deliver it in time, okay?

406
00:34:18,814 --> 00:34:20,244
Bye!

407
00:34:30,614 --> 00:34:34,144
My best friend!

408
00:34:35,534 --> 00:34:38,264
Did you sleep well last night?

409
00:34:39,884 --> 00:34:43,744
Why are you doing this to me?

410
00:34:45,414 --> 00:34:47,444
It's a gas spray for self-defense.

411
00:34:47,444 --> 00:34:50,264
If someone attacks me while I'm gone,

412
00:34:50,264 --> 00:34:52,564
spray this on their face.

413
00:34:56,654 --> 00:34:59,274
And make sure to tell me about it.

414
00:34:59,274 --> 00:35:02,824
I'll kill the bastard.

415
00:35:10,224 --> 00:35:12,864
It's seasoned well today!

416
00:35:20,484 --> 00:35:23,344
It's strange. Things are going too well.

417
00:35:23,344 --> 00:35:25,274
What do you mean?

418
00:35:25,274 --> 00:35:27,954
There actually isn't that much threat toward Lee Shi Wan.

419
00:35:27,954 --> 00:35:31,844
It's like driving on an empty road.

420
00:35:31,844 --> 00:35:35,894
Isn't that a good thing? You won't get into an accident, either.

421
00:35:35,894 --> 00:35:37,624
That's the problem.

422
00:35:37,624 --> 00:35:41,424
It's going so well that it makes me want to speed.

423
00:36:06,274 --> 00:36:08,754
 

424
00:36:33,004 --> 00:36:34,984
Excuse me.

425
00:37:21,874 --> 00:37:22,624
 

426
00:37:48,754 --> 00:37:51,424
We're finally getting out.

427
00:37:51,424 --> 00:37:54,304
We cleared our mission for the day!

428
00:38:10,094 --> 00:38:12,504
I'm not sure why,

429
00:38:12,504 --> 00:38:16,274
but I was able to avoid danger because you treated me like a friend.

430
00:38:16,274 --> 00:38:17,924
Thank you.

431
00:38:19,324 --> 00:38:22,084
Please make sure to attend the trial.

432
00:38:22,084 --> 00:38:24,024
How did you know...

433
00:38:31,154 --> 00:38:35,154
5283. Go back to the prison cell.

434
00:38:35,154 --> 00:38:38,484
I thought the four of us were leaving together.

435
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:42,184
Excuse me. 5283 is supposed to leave with us.

436
00:38:42,184 --> 00:38:46,064
- Yes, he's right.
- I told you to go back to the prison cell!

437
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:51,914
Someone changed the date.

438
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:55,684
- Could you check one more time-
- Stay away.

439
00:38:57,954 --> 00:39:00,844
It's okay. Don't worry.

440
00:39:00,844 --> 00:39:02,544
What should we do?

441
00:39:03,714 --> 00:39:07,204
You guys are going with him. Nothing will happen.

442
00:39:07,204 --> 00:39:10,194
Okay. Leave it to us.

443
00:39:11,864 --> 00:39:14,514
What are you doing? Come on out!

444
00:39:28,374 --> 00:39:30,494
Yes.

445
00:39:30,494 --> 00:39:32,084
Got it.

446
00:39:36,104 --> 00:39:37,624
Come on in.

447
00:39:56,494 --> 00:40:03,214
I hope Hyungnim likes the gift I got him.

448
00:40:31,694 --> 00:40:34,734
 Lights out in ten minutes! 

449
00:41:00,414 --> 00:41:04,734
- Who made you do this?
- H-He said he'd pay us.

450
00:41:04,734 --> 00:41:08,974
The reward money for killing you is huge!

451
00:41:08,974 --> 00:41:10,094
What?

452
00:41:10,094 --> 00:41:13,714
You won't be able to leave here alive anyway!

453
00:41:13,714 --> 00:41:16,354
Please let us kill you if you're going to die anyway!

454
00:41:16,354 --> 00:41:21,644
You must've grown fond of us more than those bastards!

455
00:41:21,644 --> 00:41:24,594
I need to get out of here, too!

456
00:41:24,594 --> 00:41:28,464
I can have a fresh start if I have that money.

457
00:41:28,464 --> 00:41:32,264
Please let them do it! They're begging you!

458
00:41:43,174 --> 00:41:47,164
I finally know why I've been feeling uneasy all along.

459
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:56,134
Long time no see, Do Gi hyungnim.

460
00:41:56,134 --> 00:41:58,004
How have you been?

461
00:41:59,164 --> 00:42:03,254
This is yours. I set it aside for you.

462
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:15,004
There was a car accident before he could even attend court, unfortunately.

463
00:42:53,414 --> 00:42:58,594
I think there were two people we knew in the car, too.

464
00:42:58,594 --> 00:43:01,424
Mr. Park and Mr. Choi...

465
00:43:03,304 --> 00:43:07,104
Do you think they're dead or alive?

466
00:43:09,834 --> 00:43:13,164
You know, Go Eun was behind the prison wall.

467
00:43:15,754 --> 00:43:18,514
Isn't it so touching?

468
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:24,184
She's been looking out for you as if you're her husband in prison.

469
00:43:25,224 --> 00:43:30,374
She must mean a lot to you, too.

470
00:43:32,754 --> 00:43:34,644
Please just let them go.

471
00:43:35,704 --> 00:43:38,854
You and I can take care of this on our own.

472
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:41,764
That would be difficult.

473
00:43:41,764 --> 00:43:46,064
In order to give you back all the gross feelings I got,

474
00:43:46,064 --> 00:43:48,344
I need those people.

475
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:53,604
Whenever you destroyed the things I've been spending

476
00:43:53,604 --> 00:43:57,844
a lot of time on one by one,

477
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:00,214
do you know how I felt?

478
00:44:01,454 --> 00:44:04,454
You don't know, right?

479
00:44:04,454 --> 00:44:07,274
So I'm trying to let you know...

480
00:44:07,274 --> 00:44:12,424
how it feels when the things you love get destroyed.

481
00:44:15,584 --> 00:44:17,654
I warn you.

482
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:23,834
If you even lay a finger on them,

483
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,924
I'll kill you.

484
00:44:34,144 --> 00:44:37,254
I didn't know you had a side like this.

485
00:44:37,254 --> 00:44:42,354
I'm glad. I think you understand how I feel a bit.

486
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:50,374
Come to me later if you're curious about what happened to them. I'll tell you.

487
00:44:50,374 --> 00:44:56,444
But I heard the reward will double after midnight.

488
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:58,604
What should we do?

489
00:44:58,604 --> 00:45:03,764
You have to be alive for others to be alive.

490
00:45:16,154 --> 00:45:19,944
 

491
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:25,834
You!

492
00:46:46,704 --> 00:46:48,424
You!

493
00:47:37,534 --> 00:47:39,504
Asshole!

494
00:47:58,994 --> 00:48:01,094
You asshole!

495
00:50:29,564 --> 00:50:31,514
He's waiting.

496
00:50:50,044 --> 00:50:53,484
I would've waited if I knew you'd come so soon.

497
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:55,874
Let's eat together.

498
00:50:55,874 --> 00:50:58,174
I'll prepare another set.

499
00:51:11,654 --> 00:51:15,724
Where did you get this from?

500
00:51:15,724 --> 00:51:18,884
Compared to the evil things you people did,

501
00:51:18,884 --> 00:51:22,464
what's written there must be like the tip of the iceberg.

502
00:51:23,624 --> 00:51:26,574
You got the wrong idea about me.

503
00:51:26,574 --> 00:51:30,804
You pretended to be a priest, kidnapped people,

504
00:51:30,804 --> 00:51:35,644
and took their lives as the principal of a welfare center.

505
00:51:35,644 --> 00:51:38,754
Is that where everything started?

506
00:51:44,524 --> 00:51:47,834
Countless innocent children

507
00:51:47,834 --> 00:51:53,734
got kidnapped in their neighborhoods at the bus stop while waiting for their parents.

508
00:51:53,734 --> 00:51:57,324
They got assaulted, tortured, and killed

509
00:51:57,334 --> 00:52:03,534
at that hellish place you people ran.

510
00:52:07,684 --> 00:52:11,684
Did you know that this is the property the welfare center was in?

511
00:52:11,684 --> 00:52:17,344
The room you slept in was the crematorium where we burnt dead children.

512
00:52:19,644 --> 00:52:23,084
I'd like to explain this one thing to you.

513
00:52:23,084 --> 00:52:27,164
You call them innocent people right now,

514
00:52:27,164 --> 00:52:31,064
but they can be called different names depending on the time period.

515
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:36,054
You called those people wanderers.

516
00:52:36,054 --> 00:52:40,644
Someone had to do it to improve our society.

517
00:52:40,644 --> 00:52:44,364
And I volunteered to do it by taking the risk.

518
00:52:44,364 --> 00:52:48,144
I was awarded by the government for my contribution,

519
00:52:48,144 --> 00:52:50,904
and I've been to prison, too.

520
00:52:50,904 --> 00:52:53,704
Isn't that paradoxical?

521
00:52:53,704 --> 00:52:56,584
Paradoxical?

522
00:52:56,584 --> 00:53:01,124
The pictures hanging on the wall are paradoxical.

523
00:53:01,124 --> 00:53:05,034
- They're the children you killed.
- It's a way to pray for them.

524
00:53:05,034 --> 00:53:08,674
I'm praying for them to live the dream they couldn't in their next lives.

525
00:53:08,674 --> 00:53:10,834
I pray whenever I see their pictures.

526
00:53:10,834 --> 00:53:14,554
Quit talking nonsense, you crazy bastard.

527
00:53:14,554 --> 00:53:18,354
Does displaying the innocent victims like trophies

528
00:53:18,354 --> 00:53:22,644
make you feel like you're special or something?

529
00:53:25,274 --> 00:53:26,854
I'd better...

530
00:53:27,874 --> 00:53:33,584
not talk bullshit in front of you.

531
00:53:36,034 --> 00:53:40,364
The cases and the commissioner...

532
00:53:40,364 --> 00:53:42,194
Did you fabricate all that?

533
00:53:42,194 --> 00:53:45,354
Fabricate?

534
00:53:45,354 --> 00:53:47,914
Fabricate...

535
00:53:47,914 --> 00:53:49,964
Ha Joon told me...

536
00:53:49,964 --> 00:53:56,084
that we'll have to use a real person as bait since you guys research thoroughly.

537
00:53:56,084 --> 00:53:58,344
So did you bring your dirty money

538
00:53:58,344 --> 00:54:02,044
to surface to lure us in?

539
00:54:02,044 --> 00:54:04,374
People and money are leaving us.

540
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:08,524
Wouldn't it be weird if the room was all clean?

541
00:54:08,524 --> 00:54:12,864
Even if you find out, I just need to shut you up.

542
00:54:12,864 --> 00:54:16,594
I wondered if I needed to go this far,

543
00:54:16,594 --> 00:54:20,884
but Ha Joon begged me so much. So I did it the way he wanted.

544
00:54:20,884 --> 00:54:23,174
No parents can beat their children.

545
00:54:23,174 --> 00:54:27,934
- You're talking as if he's your real son.
- He's more than my real son.

546
00:54:27,934 --> 00:54:32,894
Ha Joon is such a good worker.

547
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:35,714
No one was a better worker than him.

548
00:54:35,714 --> 00:54:37,884
Until...

549
00:54:37,884 --> 00:54:40,884
Kim Do Gi showed up.

550
00:54:42,664 --> 00:54:44,864
So I'm hoping that

551
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:49,184
Ha Joon will grow and get stronger from this.

552
00:54:50,624 --> 00:54:52,704
You should wait and see

553
00:54:52,704 --> 00:54:57,554
how my child deals with your child.

554
00:55:04,584 --> 00:55:07,844
I thought we won't be able to eat together, but you came all the way here!

555
00:55:07,844 --> 00:55:10,634
Hyungnim, you're amazing!

556
00:55:11,614 --> 00:55:15,604
Thanks to you, I'll be able to give my last present to you.

557
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:17,974
You're curious what it might be, right?

558
00:55:34,424 --> 00:55:37,224
Do you want to play a game?

559
00:55:37,224 --> 00:55:43,114
Who's No. 1 in your heart among those three?

560
00:55:43,114 --> 00:55:46,564
Starting from left, they're No. 1, 2, and 3.

561
00:55:46,564 --> 00:55:50,714
If you say a number, I'll drop them first.

562
00:56:00,284 --> 00:56:02,954
Isn't everyone dying anyway?

563
00:56:02,954 --> 00:56:05,224
That won't be fun.

564
00:56:05,224 --> 00:56:07,654
There are variables.

565
00:56:07,654 --> 00:56:11,444
Someone might call the cops after one of them falls.

566
00:56:11,444 --> 00:56:15,604
And I might suddenly change my mind.

567
00:56:15,604 --> 00:56:21,584
The tiny bit of hope stays until the end.

568
00:56:23,244 --> 00:56:25,804
The hope that will disappear.

569
00:56:25,804 --> 00:56:28,764
Who do you want to give it to?

570
00:56:30,964 --> 00:56:32,864
Have you always been like this?

571
00:56:32,864 --> 00:56:36,334
I only want you to feel it!

572
00:56:36,334 --> 00:56:41,234
How the hope disappears and how it...

573
00:56:41,234 --> 00:56:44,164
gets forgotten.

574
00:56:44,164 --> 00:56:46,424
Remember this.

575
00:56:46,424 --> 00:56:48,784
Even if I...

576
00:56:48,784 --> 00:56:52,524
I mean, even if we stop now,

577
00:56:52,524 --> 00:56:56,934
someone else will show up and come to you.

578
00:56:56,934 --> 00:57:01,534
They'll remember you people until the end!

579
00:57:01,574 --> 00:57:03,594
How are you doing this now?

580
00:57:03,594 --> 00:57:06,354
That's what the powerless ones say all the time.

581
00:57:06,354 --> 00:57:09,034
They say they'd remember forever!

582
00:57:09,034 --> 00:57:10,744
Do you know why?

583
00:57:10,744 --> 00:57:14,214
That's the only thing they can do.

584
00:57:14,214 --> 00:57:16,034
You're wrong.

585
00:57:17,804 --> 00:57:21,034
There's something you can retrieve by remembering.

586
00:57:23,414 --> 00:57:25,694
 Dad! 

587
00:57:25,694 --> 00:57:27,634
 Dong Jae! 

588
00:57:32,554 --> 00:57:34,524
Because the father...

589
00:57:34,524 --> 00:57:37,974
didn't forget about the son who he lost contact with,

590
00:57:37,974 --> 00:57:41,634
they were able to be reunited.

591
00:57:41,634 --> 00:57:44,664
 A little girl who is less than 10 years old 

592
00:57:49,034 --> 00:57:51,754
didn't forget about her sister.

593
00:57:54,524 --> 00:57:57,684
 Please find So Mang. 

594
00:57:58,824 --> 00:58:02,354
 Should I get a driver's license and go to the East Sea like we used to 

595
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:05,124
 and go to the grass field, too? 

596
00:58:05,124 --> 00:58:08,204
 I'm excited just thinking about it. 

597
00:58:09,764 --> 00:58:13,264
 - Soo Ryeon! 
- Because he didn't

598
00:58:13,264 --> 00:58:15,824
forget that they promised

599
00:58:15,824 --> 00:58:18,224
to go to the ocean together...

600
00:58:25,364 --> 00:58:30,494
 Because he remembered the detective's unjust death without forgetting... 

601
00:58:32,714 --> 00:58:36,524
They were able to let the world know about the truth.

602
00:58:36,524 --> 00:58:38,844
Because they remembered,

603
00:58:40,814 --> 00:58:43,204
I was able to...

604
00:58:43,204 --> 00:58:45,454
come to you people.

605
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:52,644
But what should we do?

606
00:58:52,644 --> 00:58:56,964
You came all the way here, but you're about to get slaughtered.

607
00:58:56,964 --> 00:58:58,904
I'll give you five seconds.

608
00:59:01,374 --> 00:59:04,154
What's the meaning of all this to you?

609
00:59:04,154 --> 00:59:08,074
Five. Four. Three.

610
00:59:08,074 --> 00:59:11,334
What time is it right now?

611
00:59:11,334 --> 00:59:12,934
What?

612
00:59:12,934 --> 00:59:15,184
What time is it right now?

613
00:59:19,944 --> 00:59:22,014
1 p.m.

614
00:59:25,924 --> 00:59:27,684
I'm glad that...

615
00:59:28,804 --> 00:59:30,864
it's past 12 o'clock.

616
00:59:30,864 --> 00:59:34,414
Stop trying to be clever! Nothing will change.

617
00:59:34,414 --> 00:59:36,714
No. 4.

618
00:59:36,714 --> 00:59:39,954
I'd like to choose No. 4.

619
00:59:39,954 --> 00:59:41,974
There's no No. 4.

620
00:59:41,974 --> 00:59:43,884
I'm sure there is.

621
00:59:46,614 --> 00:59:47,854
It's you.

622
00:59:47,854 --> 00:59:52,084
Quit joking around! You're making me feel shitty!

623
00:59:52,084 --> 00:59:55,884
I think there's someone who feels shittier than you.

624
01:00:00,124 --> 01:00:04,914
 Today, there was the first trial for the branch manager and the assistant manager 

625
01:00:04,914 --> 01:00:09,314
 of a bank that allowed a large sum of money to be sent overseas for 

626
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:13,914
 money laundering and helped with avoiding regulations. 

627
01:00:13,914 --> 01:00:18,214
 Due to the prime witness's testimony, most of the prosecution's evidence was accepted, and 

628
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:23,204
 the branch manager and assistant manager who managed the funds were found guilty. 

629
01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:26,384
 Informant, Mr. Lee, who played a major role in today's trial, is 

630
01:00:26,384 --> 01:00:29,034
 currently employed by the bank. 

631
01:00:29,034 --> 01:00:33,304
 He discovered suspicious sources of funds while sending trading funds 

632
01:00:33,304 --> 01:00:35,374
- How...
 - and he made reports multiple times a day. 

633
01:00:35,374 --> 01:00:37,204
 But after his reports were ignored, 

634
01:00:37,204 --> 01:00:41,844
 he sent an anonymous letter to the Financial Supervisory Service. 

635
01:00:41,844 --> 01:00:44,774
 
 It's strange. Things are going too well. 

636
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:45,954
 What do you mean? 

637
01:00:45,954 --> 01:00:48,984
 There actually isn't that much threat toward Lee Shi Wan. 

638
01:00:48,984 --> 01:00:52,424
 It's like driving on an empty road. 

639
01:00:52,424 --> 01:00:56,544
 Isn't that a good thing? You won't get into an accident, either. 

640
01:00:56,544 --> 01:00:59,584
- Are you able to reach Mr. Kim?
- Mr. Jang!

641
01:01:00,604 --> 01:01:02,224
There's a trap.

642
01:01:02,224 --> 01:01:07,484
The prison warden and the guards were paid off by them.

643
01:01:07,484 --> 01:01:11,144
The whole prison is a huge trap set by them.

644
01:01:11,144 --> 01:01:15,084
If everything is a trap and fake...

645
01:01:15,084 --> 01:01:17,144
Shouldn't Mr. Kim get out of there right now?

646
01:01:17,144 --> 01:01:21,424
No, Mr. Lee Shi Wan, who Mr. Kim is protecting, is a real victim.

647
01:01:21,424 --> 01:01:24,374
 If they planned all of this situation, 

648
01:01:24,374 --> 01:01:29,994
Mr. Jang and Go Eun might be in greater danger than me.

649
01:01:29,994 --> 01:01:32,874
If you don't avoid, you might get kidnapped, too.

650
01:01:32,874 --> 01:01:36,344
I'm not going anywhere if you're staying! Don't tell me to run away somewhere!

651
01:01:36,344 --> 01:01:39,744
Mr. Lee Shi Wan's safety is the most important thing right now.

652
01:01:39,744 --> 01:01:41,914
Could there be a solution?

653
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:48,334
There's only one way Mr. Lee can be safe.

654
01:01:49,434 --> 01:01:53,314
Letting him attend the trial and testify safely.

655
01:01:53,314 --> 01:01:56,434
That's right. Threatening a witness who finished testifying

656
01:01:56,434 --> 01:01:59,624
won't get them anything.

657
01:01:59,624 --> 01:02:01,864
Until he finishes testifying in court,

658
01:02:01,864 --> 01:02:05,804
we need to make sure we get everyone's attention.

659
01:02:05,804 --> 01:02:09,564
Getting everyone's attention...

660
01:02:09,564 --> 01:02:13,854
We'll have to go inside a tiger's mouth or something.

661
01:02:13,854 --> 01:02:18,104
It might be more dangerous than we think. We might...

662
01:02:19,144 --> 01:02:22,134
need to risk our lives.

663
01:02:22,144 --> 01:02:23,144
 
We're finally getting out.

664
01:02:23,144 --> 01:02:25,274
We're finally getting out.

665
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:28,594
We cleared our mission for the day!

666
01:02:57,694 --> 01:02:59,924
Excuse me.

667
01:03:04,344 --> 01:03:07,704
I wondered if I needed to go this far,

668
01:03:07,704 --> 01:03:10,154
but Ha Joon begged me so much.

669
01:03:10,154 --> 01:03:13,474
No parents can beat their children.

670
01:03:15,014 --> 01:03:17,554
You're talking as if he's your real son.

671
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:30,114
- What's this?
- What's this?

672
01:03:30,114 --> 01:03:31,634
What?

673
01:03:34,064 --> 01:03:35,814
Aigoo!

674
01:03:35,814 --> 01:03:38,104
Look at all this! Aigoo!

675
01:03:38,104 --> 01:03:39,784
- Hurry up!
- Let me help!

676
01:03:39,784 --> 01:03:42,224
Are you okay, Shi Wan? Wake up!

677
01:03:42,224 --> 01:03:43,854
You have to wake up!

678
01:03:43,854 --> 01:03:47,114
Go Eun, hurry up! We have to get going!

679
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:49,524
I need to put it on replay. Tie yourselves up and sit down again.

680
01:03:49,524 --> 01:03:51,894
You should've told us earlier. Seriously...

681
01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:55,214
- Excuse me, excuse me. Let me put you back down.
- Make it look the same.

682
01:03:55,214 --> 01:03:58,094
Hurry up! Do as she says!

683
01:03:58,094 --> 01:04:00,044
 But after his reports were ignored, 

684
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:03,364
 he sent an anonymous letter to the Financial Supervisory Service. 

685
01:04:03,364 --> 01:04:07,884
 After this trial, how many more astronomical illegal funds will be found... 

686
01:04:07,884 --> 01:04:10,794
How did this...

687
01:04:18,464 --> 01:04:23,054
Yes, I'll do as you say, Bishop.

688
01:04:24,454 --> 01:04:27,554
Do you think you won this time, too?

689
01:04:34,934 --> 01:04:38,024
You'll still die by my hands!

690
01:04:46,434 --> 01:04:49,034
 

691
01:04:49,034 --> 01:04:52,334
 Thanks for watching Taxi Driver 2 on Viki! 

692
01:04:52,334 --> 01:04:54,934
Doesn't this feel like a housewarming party?

693
01:04:54,934 --> 01:04:56,534
For whom?

694
01:04:56,534 --> 01:04:58,334
For us!

695
01:05:00,314 --> 01:05:03,594
What are you doing? Bring alcohol quickly! You can't interrupt the flow! Don't you know?

696
01:05:03,594 --> 01:05:05,814
Okay! I'm already here!

697
01:05:05,814 --> 01:05:09,074
Mr. Jang, you must like the slippers. You keep wearing them without throwing them out.

698
01:05:09,074 --> 01:05:11,724
Why would I throw them away? They're pretty!

699
01:05:11,724 --> 01:05:14,064
I wonder who picked them. They're so pretty.

700
01:05:14,064 --> 01:05:15,634
You scared me!

701
01:05:15,634 --> 01:05:18,384
I barely touched it, and it just exploded.

702
01:05:18,384 --> 01:05:21,004
- Hurry, hurry!
- Yes!

703
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:23,584
Okay! Shall we all drink together, then?

704
01:05:23,584 --> 01:05:26,794
Hold on, hold on! Mr. Jang, please give a speech.

705
01:05:26,794 --> 01:05:29,254
We do this all the time! What's the speech for?

706
01:05:29,254 --> 01:05:33,114
Please do. This is our first work dinner at your house.

707
01:05:33,114 --> 01:05:35,564
Shall I? Okay.

708
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:39,984
Everyone, don't get hurt, and don't get sick.

709
01:05:39,984 --> 01:05:43,154
 Don't get hurt, and don't get sick! 

710
01:05:43,154 --> 01:05:45,284
Cheers!

711
01:05:50,544 --> 01:05:54,824
♫  Let me take a break for a moment.  ♫

712
01:05:54,824 --> 01:06:02,534
♫  I've been walking for too long.  ♫

713
01:06:02,534 --> 01:06:10,224
♫  I just need a minute to catch a breath  ♫

714
01:06:10,224 --> 01:06:17,094
♫  I just want to have a light snack  ♫

715
01:06:17,094 --> 01:06:24,964
 

716
01:06:24,964 --> 01:06:27,994
 I think I have you enough chances, don't you think? 

717
01:06:27,994 --> 01:06:32,164
 Once I get out, I'll kill everyone who's related to you! 

718
01:06:32,164 --> 01:06:33,994
 You won't get out of here. 

719
01:06:33,994 --> 01:06:36,904
 I think this is their hideout. 

720
01:06:36,904 --> 01:06:39,904
 This is the perfect timing. We need to push a little further. 

721
01:06:39,904 --> 01:06:42,774
 I didn't think I'd reunite with my passenger here. 

722
01:06:42,774 --> 01:06:45,134
 You will get killed by a gun today. 

723
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:46,484
 Please take care of all of them at once. 

724
01:06:46,484 --> 01:06:48,524
 Ready! Fire! 

725
01:06:48,524 --> 01:06:50,464
 Please let me kill him. 

726
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:53,614
 You have the right to know the truth, too. 

727
01:06:54,714 --> 01:06:57,404
 Say hello. This is our No. 1 premium taxi driver. 

728
01:06:57,404 --> 01:06:59,534
 Why are you accepting someone like me again? 

729
01:06:59,534 --> 01:07:01,674
 Let me collect the fee for the ride now. 

730
01:07:01,674 --> 01:07:03,064
 I'll charge you a lot. 

731
01:07:03,064 --> 01:07:07,600
♫  Your cry and devastating tears  ♫
