1
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,930
 

2
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,900
 

3
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:38,400


4
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,760
Is something wrong?

5
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,870
Dang, how did this happen?

6
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,770
Even the smoke is puttering.

7
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,890
Do you know any nearby car centers?

8
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,830
Of course, there's a place that can fix it.

9
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,290
- Where might that be?
- Well...

10
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,360
if you keep going straight, you'll run into a three-way intersection.

11
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,080
- A three-way intersection.
- Then, round the persimmon tree and go left for 20 meters,

12
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,270
right for 30 meters, and back around diagonally,

13
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,000
and you'll arrive in no time.

14
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,220
Well then, good luck.

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,920
Aigoo.

16
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,790
But how do we get there?

17
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,820
Should we have called a tow truck?

18
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,470
Hey, push from behind.

19
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,330
You want to stay here? Hurry and push, punk.

20
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,780
Hey! You push, too.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,690
Idiots.

22
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,790
Push faster.

23
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,380
 
- It's going. It's going!

24
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,160
Stop.

25
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,440
Anybody here?

26
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,820
Is anyone here?

27
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,590
Yes, welcome.

28
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,350
What? You run this place?

29
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,900
Can't you tell?

30
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,700
Then you could've towed our car here earlier.

31
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,010
You should've asked me to tow it, then.

32
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,000
We had to ask? Couldn't you tell by the situation?

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,660
Gosh,

34
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,610
then drag it back and ask me. I'll tow it, then.

35
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,430
Forget it...

36
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,960
Just repair that for us.

37
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,960
- I can't.
- You're the one who said we can!

38
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,100
Look at all this.

39
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,750
There's a whole line.

40
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,960
You people should wait your turn.

41
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,690
Repair costs.

42
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,190
Just give me 100,000 won.

43
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,800
Here! Let's speed it up.

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,690
It's 100,000 won. What's all that for?

45
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,340
And I can't rush it.

46
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,000
- Let's speed it up, please.
- I said, I can't.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,260
Shit, how much are you asking for?

48
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,960
100,000 won! 100,000 won!

49
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,400
How many times must I tell you?

50
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,560
Gosh...

51
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,380
Hey, start pushing!

52
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,330
We're going someplace else, so start pushing, idiots.

53
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,300
- Hyungnim-
- Let go!

54
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,100
Hyungnim!

55
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,980
We're in a rush. Can't we work something out?

56
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,000
In a rush?

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,680
We're on our way to perform for the elderly in the village.

58
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,380
Please do us a favor.

59
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,540
A performance? You should've said so sooner!

60
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,000
I told you money isn't the issue.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,780
Everything in this world is done by people and their feelings.

62
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,500
Don't you think so? Right?

63
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,330
I'll bring the parts, so leave the car all the way at the front, okay?

64
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,970
That bumpkin bastard. He didn't listen when I spoke.

65
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,970
Get off.

66
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,730
Everyone be prepared.

67
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,700
- We start right away in the afternoon.
 - All right. 

68
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,080
They're going to start in the afternoon.

69
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,260
 Then shall we get started, too? 

70
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,780
All right.

71
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,900
Belonging to you and Jangshil, my name is Yoo Sang Gi!

72
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,050
Mom and Dad, I love you!

73
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,190
I sent the text message.

74
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,600
I'm sorry, sir. I got too excited.

75
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,350
♫  Whether it's daytime or nighttime, I'll run to you  ♫

76
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,750
Now, the long-awaited first place.

77
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,800
Number 27!

78
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,320
Number 27!

79
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,930
 
Number 27!

80
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,720
Thank you, thank you!

81
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,360
I usually have bad luck with these.

82
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,880
Congratulations!

83
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,880
Go on. Yes.

84
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,120
Okay.

85
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,280
- You want more, right?
 - Yes! 

86
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,350
This is why I prepared part 2.

87
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,280
- We prepared a part 2!
- Part 2, part 2.

88
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,870
In part 2, we've prepared bigger prizes,

89
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,460
so please look forward to it!

90
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,450
Oh, yeah?

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,410
Mom, let's take a selfie.

92
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,390
Kimchi!

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,940
- This is fun.
- Exactly.

94
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,690
Now, the first prize this time goes to...

95
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,980
- Number 5!
 - Number 5! 

96
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,010
Number 5, number 5!

97
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,690
Wow, first prize!

98
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,740
Hurray, my hyung! Long live Korea!

99
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,770
You want to die?

100
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,230
Hey. Hey!

101
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,320
Can't you do your job? Huh?

102
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,340
I'll bring her directly from the marketplace, so have everything prepared.

103
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,980
If you bastards slack off again, I'm going to...

104
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,470
All right!

105
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,270
Sweet potatoes our Oh Bok grandpa dug up deep in the mountains!

106
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,500
Sweet potatoes!

107
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,540
Sweet potatoes! Sweet potatoes!

108
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,920
- Welcome!
- Sweet potatoes!

109
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,980
Sweet potatoes! Sweet potatoes!

110
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,060
Whoa...

111
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,310
they're trying really hard, huh?

112
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,970
We'll have to try harder, then.

113
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,580
Don't lose your energy.

114
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:12,600
And you mustn't skip meals even if you have no appetite.

115
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:19,500
Tomorrow's my son's memorial, so I'm going to offer a lot of delicious food.

116
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,800
You only get to meet him once a year,

117
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,440
of course, you should only offer the most delicious foods.

118
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,840
Wait a minute. I brought some wild vegetables.

119
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,850
Wait, Dad.

120
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:38,940
This is a free gift. You just have to pay a little bit of taxes, Dad.

121
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,290
I don't know what that means, even if you explain it to me.

122
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,950
You can take care of it for me!

123
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,560
I can?

124
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,570
Do you happen to have a tiny card?

125
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,220
Yeah, yeah, here.

126
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,630
Oh, here it is.

127
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,370
I'll put the cash back,

128
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,370
and I'll take care of this.

129
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,830
Pay in 12-month installments until you reach the limit.

130
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,610
What is all this?

131
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,830
You're selling stuff?

132
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,100
Whoa.

133
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,030
Wow.

134
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,380
This device blocks all electric signals. This will take care of it all.

135
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,320
But there's one thing to look out for.

136
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,250
What's that?

137
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,650
The distance is a bit short.

138
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,930
 

139
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,990
Hyungnim, this isn't working.

140
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,250
Dad's waiting. What are you doing?

141
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,040
Give it to me.

142
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,240
It's having trouble reading the signal.

143
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,460
Dad, give me a minute.

144
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,020
Oh, it works here.

145
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,690
I also wanted to try these. Are these effective?

146
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,000
What's wrong? Shit!

147
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,900
Damn it.

148
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,530
How would you stick this on your back?

149
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,970
I'm by myself.

150
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:26,720
Stick it on like this? Or like this? Or like this-

151
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,280
Why do you keep following me and bothering me? Or like this-

152
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,280
I'm not selling it to you, ahjussi. Go somewhere else!

153
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,840
- Whoa.
- Gosh!

154
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,190
Who are you calling ahjussi? I'm a bachelor who's never been married!

155
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,380
Apologize, got it?

156
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,620
Apologize!

157
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,750
Damn it!

158
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,210
I didn't do anything.

159
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,410
I'm going to leave now.

160
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,560
What the hell?

161
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,540
It's broken.

162
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,440
Hey, come here.

163
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,080
Come here. You need to fix this.

164
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,970
- Come here!
- Whoa, whoa!

165
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,510
Hyung-

166
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,080
Dad!

167
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,190
 

168
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,520
 The customer is not answering the phone. 

169
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,030
Gosh, how strange. Why isn't anyone picking up?

170
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,900
 

171
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,540
Excuse me.

172
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,470
You said you left behind a red wallet, right?

173
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,180
I'll just come back when the manager is here.

174
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,320
It's okay. You came all the way here, so I'll find it for you.

175
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,400
Okay.

176
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,690
- Have a seat for a moment.
- Okay.

177
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,810
The youngest staff should do these things.

178
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,180
Gosh, why are there so many?

179
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,650
Huh?

180
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
What's this?

181
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,180
- What are you doing there?
- What?

182
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,080
Oh, I...

183
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,540
I came in to find a lost item,

184
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,910
but this happened.

185
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,510
Oh, that? Yes, c-come here.

186
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,350
I should've nailed that sooner, but I forgot.

187
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,420
I'll find the lost item,

188
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,600
so you can go get ready to dispatch.

189
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,020
Okay...

190
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,050
- I'll be off.
- Okay.

191
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,140
I'll do the nailing later.

192
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,630
It's okay. I'll take care of it,

193
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,050
so no need to worry.

194
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,320
Okay.

195
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,600
 

196
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,840
You did a great job.

197
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,530
He always orders us to do this when we can just buy some.

198
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,070
It's not like he helps us.

199
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,560
Hey, have you ever seen Sang Gi hyungnim buy anything? I never did.

200
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,030
I'm so sick and tired of this. What am I doing?

201
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,250
Your stomach must be full since you're talking shit.

202
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,410
I wasn't talking shit. I was saying you're frugal.

203
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,150
My little lettuce, your hair grew out.

204
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,750
- I ought to pluck-
- Hyungnim!

205
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,150
Hey, did you find anything out?

206
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,680
Over there. The granny eating a leek pancake.

207
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,560
Her name's Bok Soon, and she became widowed recently.

208
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,680
She just got her husband's life insurance money.

209
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,090
- Any kids?
- They never visit and just send her money regularly.

210
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,650
Find out where she lives.

211
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,470
 Be more diligent, punk. 

212
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,770
 Instead of being lazy. 

213
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:55,350
Gosh, I searched everywhere, but they don't have any savings.

214
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,950
They haven't saved up any money, even in the bank.

215
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:03,960
They must spend it all each time they con someone.

216
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,340
Judging by their expenditures, I don't think so.

217
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,420
They definitely hid it somewhere.

218
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,880
 We'll go straight into working on Bok Soon grandma, who just got insurance money. 

219
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,950
 Get ready. 

220
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,640
Let's go for a walk.

221
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,030
Come on, what's wrong with this?

222
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,780
Why isn't it working?

223
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,860
It's really not my fault this time. We even had it repaired.

224
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,650
That bumpkin bastard didn't fix shit. I didn't like him from the start.

225
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,500
- Should I call that bumpkin?
- No!

226
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,260
Call the emergency dispatch service.

227
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:50,300
Yes, yes, I've confirmed your location. A driver will be dispatched.

228
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:55,010
Emergency dispatch, please move out.

229
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,830
 

230
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,160
Did you call for emergency dispatch service?

231
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,530
Why is it you again?

232
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,090
I'm doing all the emergency dispatches in this town.

233
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,970
I got here quickly enough, right?

234
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,420
What? Then when the car broke down,

235
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,810
we could've just called the insurance agency.

236
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,310
- Indeed.
- Well, why didn't you tell me?

237
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,640
- Tell you what?
- To call the insurance agency!

238
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,080
Why?

239
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,550
That's the car, right?

240
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:58,090
Aigoo, a grown adult should fix his own problems.

241
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,870
Why does he keep asking for help?

242
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,920
- Hyung, Hyung.
- Calm down.

243
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,570
H-Hyungnim, calm down, calm down!

244
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,290
- Hyungnim, calm down!
- Just one hit!

245
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,900
- Just one hit!
- No, relax!

246
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,700
- Don't, Hyung.
- Hey!

247
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:35,960
Hey, be more careful, will you!

248
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,340
Grandpa, you came all the way out here?

249
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,330
Hold on. Let's give the grandpa a ride, too.

250
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:01,390
Grandpa, I told you not to come this far out.

251
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:06,220
You need to eat well since you're alone.

252
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,920
 One hundred dollars. 

253
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,690
Forget it.

254
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:17,550
Why do you keep trying to give me money when I give you a ride on the tractor?

255
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,530
Grandpa, when you lived abroad,

256
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:24,320
you must've only taken taxis, huh?

257
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:30,690
Oh, these gentlemen are performing in the village.

258
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,650
You should go and watch them.

259
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,890
You don't need to give anyone money!

260
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,430
It's free. Free.

261
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,450
Get on.

262
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,060
What are you doing? Help him.

263
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,390
Aigoo!

264
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,130
Aigoo! Help him.

265
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,040
Hyungnim, that old geezer's shoes are a designer brand, right?

266
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,620
 Gucci. 

267
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:17,130
No way an old geezer has the real thing in a place like this.

268
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,970
That is a designer brand.

269
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,940
I have those, too.

270
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,740
They're expensive...

271
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,490
but he cut off the heels.

272
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,050
Hey, those shoes are originally like that.

273
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:31,550
Now, let's continue on our way.

274
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,440
Hyungnim, are we going straight to Bok Soon's?

275
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,150
Okay, hang on tight!

276
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,360
Let go. It's hot.

277
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,650
Geez.

278
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,410
Anybody home?

279
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,580
Excuse me!

280
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,400
Anyone home?

281
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,110
Hey, hey.

282
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,730
 Porsche. 

283
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,480
What's this doing...

284
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,010
H-Hyungnim!

285
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,530
Hyungnim, come here!

286
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,960
He's using this as a furnace poker.

287
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,610
Number 7 iron.

288
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:44,550
This is better than mine. He's using it as a poker?

289
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,140
Is this geezer nuts or what?

290
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,540
- Hyungnim!
- Hey!

291
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,840
Come here!

292
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,290
Look at this.

293
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,370
What is all this?

294
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,040
This is...

295
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,110
Is it expensive?

296
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,390
Yeah.

297
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,220
Hey, hey!

298
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,140
Wait, that's-

299
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,320
Heed my words.

300
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,710
Humans will die, but money won't.

301
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,190
Even if you die, the money you owe...

302
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,390
will be paid by your wife and kids...

303
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,910
and...

304
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,490
your cousins, in-laws, and relatives...

305
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,020
- Who's he talking to?
- The tree.

306
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:06,320
You must be aware of what you're taking.

307
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,120
 

308
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,660
 

309
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,000
Huh?

310
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,000
What the?

311
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,100
 

312
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,720
There was a big catch right in front of us.

313
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,050
I didn't know where to leave the nameplate, so I just left it standing.

314
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,960
He found it on his own.

315
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,290
We should've left it anywhere if we knew they'd rummage through everything.

316
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,190
No need to stress. We think too hard.

317
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,190
- We need to become simpler. Right?
- Geez.

318
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,790
You're on another walk?

319
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:24,480
Grandpa, you want to go someplace fun?

320
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:44,640
I love you, Mom and Dad!

321
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,480
♫  Real, real, real, real  ♫

322

♫  You are my everything  ♫

331
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,300
Hyungnim.

332
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,050
How did the performance go?

333
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,480
Shut it.

334
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,510
Did you find it?

335
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:58,270
I searched his entire house, but it wasn't there.

336
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,860
Are you sure you searched everywhere?

337
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,060
We searched twice but couldn't find it.

338
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,800
But Hyungnim,

339
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,880
I think he definitely hid it in the fields like you said.

340
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:14,090
That geezer disappeared, so we went to his house, and he returned with another bundle.

341
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,230
We're going to tail him together tomorrow.

342
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,500
Let's search, too.

343
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,390
 

344
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:22,260
Oh, gosh. Are they fermenting their laundry? Shit...

345
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,710
Did they spill soy sauce crabs in here? The stench is-

346
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,520
I don't think it's in here. Geez!

347
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,290
I just touched underwear. It's not here.

348
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,050
Nothing here, either.

349
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,680
He came to dig up wild vegetables.

350
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,550
Wild vegetables.

351
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:59,260
Hyungnim, should we just get him and mug him?

352
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,800
Stomping around in the water to catch fish will only create muddy water.

353
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,700
That only works on people without dementia.

354
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,570
Hey, don't be reckless.

355
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,070
Wait...

356
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,580
wasn't that bumpkin bastard close to that old geezer?

357
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,910
 They don't have a safe, let alone a single bill. 

358
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,770
What should we do now?

359
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,620
I didn't think they would be this meticulous.

360
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,070
I should meet them one more time.

361
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,120
Good golly.

362
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,570
They're here. Okay.

363
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,310
Did it break down again?

364
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,030
I'd like a car inspection.

365
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,960
Will this do?

366
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,770
Why are you giving me so much for a car inspection?

367
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,210
A tip!

368
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,060
Since you work so hard.

369
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,970
You can tip me with affection.

370
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,740
We all live by affection.

371
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:12,360
You know that sick grandpa we met last time?

372
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,060
Are you close to him?

373
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,900
He's an elderly neighbor,

374
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,940
so I just stop by sometimes and give him side dishes.

375
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,720
Do you know what that grandpa did for a living?

376
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,410
How should I know what he did in the past?

377
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:29,980
But whatever he did in the past, he's lonely now,

378
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,480
and he's an old man who needs help.

379
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,500
Does he have any farming land?

380
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,970
Land?

381
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,190
I thought I could befriend him if I went to help him out sometime.

382
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,500
Grandpa doesn't have any land.

383
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,430
Well, he came back covered in dirt.

384
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,530
Am I wrong?

385
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:53,260
Did grandpa have some land?

386
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,000
He did carry red sticks somewhere last time.

387
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,360
Red sticks?

388
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,730
You know, those sticks to mark land with?

389
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:06,360
"This is my land, so trespassers, keep out." Something like that.

390
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

391
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,000
Red sticks...

392
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,950
It's over here!

393
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,980
This is it, right?

394
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,250
Hey.

395
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,150
Start digging.

396
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,620
- Not the same spot! Spread out, you idiots.
- I told you.

397
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,880
You little...

398
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,000
Hey!

399
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,700
- Come here.
- Did you find it?

400
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,010
Do you see the red flag over there?

401
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,730
Try digging there, too.

402
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:00,980
Hyungnim, we were digging all this time.

403
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,700
And? Did you find anything?

404
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,610
Stop whining and start digging.

405
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:09,410
Let us eat first. I'm going to starve to death.

406
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,430
You won't die from skipping a meal.

407
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,680
Hurry up and start digging. Hurry, hurry!

408
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,570
Hey, come on.

409
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,280
That's hot.

410
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,680
The red flags or sticks or whatever.

411
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,270
They're not grandpa's land.

412
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,570
When did I say he owned land?

413
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,450
I just said he borrowed red sticks.

414
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:47,140
Why would you tell me something you're not sure of?

415
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,880
But...

416
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,880
why do you keep asking about his land?

417
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:55,500
I'm just worried about him. Just worried.

418
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,480
It would be bad if grandpa collapsed under the blazing sun while working the land!

419
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,780
What the heck?

420
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:08,350
If that's what you're worried about, don't be. Grandpa doesn't work in the field.

421
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:11,160
He doesn't? How do you know that?

422
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,150
- Did you see him?
- I did.

423
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:17,860
Grandpa might be like that now, but he was clear-minded in the past.

424
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,190
- He even drove tractors.
- Tractors?

425
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,140
I wonder if he had to do something. He borrowed a tractor and a plow from me.

426
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,980
Grandpa...

427
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,320
borrowed a tractor for the fields from you?

428
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:35,070
I even personally drove the tractor to the place he designated.

429
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:39,990
I asked, "Grandpa, what do you need such a long plow for?"

430
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,870
and he...

431
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,380
He wouldn't answer me.

432
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,360
Mr. Kim Do Gi.

433
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,040
Let me borrow that tractor, too.

434
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,550
To the same place Grandpa had it sent.

435
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:10,670
Aigoo, how could you eat gukbap* without pickled radishes?
(Hot soup with rice.)

436
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,360
Here, out of...

437
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,240
affection.

438
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,560
That's right.

439
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,300
We need to all live by affection.

440
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,800
Yes.

441
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:44,870
He wouldn't ask you to do it for him, would he?

442
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:47,780
He didn't look kind enough to share the money with me.

443
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,330
Anyhow, he got money he didn't have before.

444
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,680
Money?

445
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,600
He didn't have much money in his wallet before. But...

446
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,360
 Let me borrow that tractor, too. 

447
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,620
Was there an ATM machine nearby?

448
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,570
No, there are none.

449
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,490
I have a hunch about a place.

450
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,890
We'll know when we check later.

451
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:25,290
The land that bumpkin delivered the tractor to is the geezer's land?

452
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:31,000
Hyungnim, I have no feeling in my arms.

453
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,610
How about asking him to dig for us?

454
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,970
You idiot.

455
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:37,760
Will you take responsibility if he finds money while digging?

456
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,190
No.

457
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:56,150
By the way, who's going to drive this?

458
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:59,650
Don't worry about that, and go about your business.

459
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:04,310
If no one can drive it, I was thinking I'd have to step in.

460
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,690
It's okay, so go on back.

461
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,580
Okay, all right.

462
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,600
I'll get going now.

463
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,180
Aigoo...

464
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,630
Hey, start digging.

465
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,690
 

466
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,900
Hey, stop! Stop!

467
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,750
- Hey, hey.
- I see something.

468
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,270
- It's the bundle.
- You found it?

469
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,670
- Look! Look at this!
- Hey, come here!

470
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:58,470
 It's the real deal. 

471
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,930
The real deal has appeared right now.

472
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,430
- Wow!
- Whoa.

473
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:06,450
There's one more.

474
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,720
 Poop. 

475
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,950
Why is there poop... in here...

476
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,060
- Aigoo.
- Hey.

477
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,470
Clean this up.

478
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,910
Hey, Tough guy. Start digging somewhere else.

479
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,040
Get rid of that!

480
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,630
What the?

481
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,440
What the hell?

482
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,820
- Hyungnim!
- What?

483
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,360
- This won't start.
- What?

484
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,100
Get down, get down.

485
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,230
Get down, damn it.

486
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,520
Hey! You need to start the engine first.

487
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,010
Aigoo.

488
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,290
Why won't it start? From low to high.

489
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:57,620
N-Neutral... Shit!

490
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,290
That bumpkin gave a piece of crap.

491
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:02,060
Damn it!

492
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,000
- Hyungnim.
- Hyungnim!

493
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,700
Hyungnim, are you all right?

494
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,620
Hyungnim.

495
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,270
Hyungnim, what...

496
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,480
Your expensive clothes.

497
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,440
What?

498
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,820
Over there.

499
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,490
The bundle's right there.

500
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,520
Hey!

501
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,140
Hey...

502
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,180
we're changing our method.

503
00:38:01,188 --> 00:38:03,038
What are you doing right now?

504
00:38:03,038 --> 00:38:05,738
We'll take care of Grandpa now,

505
00:38:06,658 --> 00:38:07,578
so go back.

506
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:10,208
I need to feed Grandpa.

507
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:14,408
We'll take care of dinner for...

508
00:38:14,408 --> 00:38:16,778
lonely and helpless Grandpa.

509
00:38:16,778 --> 00:38:18,268
So just go back.

510
00:38:19,228 --> 00:38:21,658
Oh, okay.

511
00:38:23,898 --> 00:38:26,228
Take good care of him!

512
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:37,958
Will Mr. Jang be all right?

513
00:38:38,888 --> 00:38:40,738
Old Man,

514
00:38:40,738 --> 00:38:43,508
where did you get this?

515
00:38:43,508 --> 00:38:47,538
I know you visited somewhere during the day! Where is it?

516
00:38:47,538 --> 00:38:52,728
Stop, you bastards. Let Grandpa eat in peace.

517
00:38:52,728 --> 00:38:54,078
Move.

518
00:38:59,178 --> 00:39:01,018
Grandpa,

519
00:39:02,138 --> 00:39:07,198
you want to go for a walk near your fields after you eat?

520
00:39:07,198 --> 00:39:09,598
We'll take care of you from now on,

521
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:11,648
so don't worry.

522
00:39:20,448 --> 00:39:22,258
Shit, I ate it.

523
00:39:22,258 --> 00:39:24,388
I ate it, damn it.

524
00:39:46,648 --> 00:39:50,018
Dementia comes in a variety of forms.

525
00:39:52,138 --> 00:39:53,808
Nothing special happened, right?

526
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,808
Do something.

527
00:39:55,808 --> 00:39:58,388
These people follow me around 24/7.

528
00:39:58,388 --> 00:40:00,908
Even into the bathroom.

529
00:40:00,908 --> 00:40:02,778
Tell them you want to see a performance.

530
00:40:02,778 --> 00:40:04,468
I'll resolve this for you.

531
00:40:05,998 --> 00:40:07,758
No, no. I can't.

532
00:40:07,758 --> 00:40:11,078
Mr. Kim Do Gi asked one of us to stand onstage.

533
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:14,488
Mr. Park, you can do it. Or Mr. Choi can do it.

534
00:40:14,488 --> 00:40:17,888
Our faces have already been exposed. You're the only new face.

535
00:40:17,888 --> 00:40:20,768
Are you nuts? How can I- Just thinking about it is humiliating.

536
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:24,008
How long will you stay inside? You need to breathe fresh air from time to time.

537
00:40:24,008 --> 00:40:26,748
No, I can't. I can't do it.

538
00:40:26,748 --> 00:40:29,158
- I can't!
- You'll do well.

539
00:40:29,158 --> 00:40:31,338
I can't!

540
00:40:40,848 --> 00:40:44,738
Why did that old geezer suddenly want to watch a performance?

541
00:40:44,738 --> 00:40:48,538
He didn't even pretend to listen to you sing, right?

542
00:40:48,538 --> 00:40:50,288
That's why we hired a part-timer, you punk!

543
00:40:50,288 --> 00:40:52,358
Why isn't she here? Did you really hire one?

544
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:56,248
I did. I even called the closest agency.

545
00:40:59,408 --> 00:41:02,368
My gosh! I'm sorry for being late.

546
00:41:02,368 --> 00:41:05,298
Hello, my name is Eun.

547
00:41:07,378 --> 00:41:09,178
Wh-Why did you come so late?

548
00:41:09,238 --> 00:41:11,328
Aigoo. I'm sorry.

549
00:41:11,328 --> 00:41:13,338
Hey. Go.

550
00:41:13,368 --> 00:41:16,018
- Hurry to the stage, please.
- Gosh, okay, okay.

551
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:17,838
I'll go, then.

552
00:41:22,748 --> 00:41:24,378
What are you doing, you punk?

553
00:41:25,488 --> 00:41:27,528
How do you do?

554
00:41:30,998 --> 00:41:35,368
Hello, my name is Eun. Nice to meet you!

555
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:43,838
♫  My great friend, dear my old friend  ♫

556
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:51,048
♫  One who used to laugh out loud there all the time  ♫

557
00:41:51,048 --> 00:41:56,578
♫  My great friend, dear my old friend  ♫

558
00:41:56,578 --> 00:41:59,408
Why did she hate the idea when she's so good at it?

559
00:41:59,408 --> 00:42:02,598
I know! It would've been bad if we didn't make her do it.

560
00:42:02,598 --> 00:42:05,628
As expected of Mr. Kim Do Gi. I admit he's the best.

561
00:42:08,768 --> 00:42:12,628
It's embarrassing, and I'm also bad at singing.

562
00:42:12,628 --> 00:42:14,368
That's fine, even if you're bad.

563
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:18,628
 However, you're all we have right now, Go Eun. 

564
00:42:19,628 --> 00:42:22,778
Well, what can I do, then...

565
00:42:22,778 --> 00:42:24,048
There's only me.

566
00:42:24,048 --> 00:42:29,408
♫  Just like that, let's sit face to face  ♫

567
00:42:29,408 --> 00:42:36,658
♫  Yes, just like that, let's clink our glasses  ♫

568
00:42:36,658 --> 00:42:43,868
♫  Please pray for me with the best voice  ♫

569
00:42:43,868 --> 00:42:46,768
♫  I'll respond to you  ♫

570
00:42:46,768 --> 00:42:47,918
When did she come up with the choreography?

571
00:42:47,938 --> 00:42:50,208
Seriously, she didn't even have time.

572
00:42:51,238 --> 00:42:58,348
♫  Today, on the windy dirt wall of Mokro Bar  ♫

573
00:42:58,348 --> 00:43:06,308
♫  The three-headed incandescent lamp swings again  ♫

574
00:43:08,268 --> 00:43:11,628
- Thank you! Thank you.
- Sure, sure.

575
00:43:13,988 --> 00:43:15,818
Thank you!

576
00:43:16,818 --> 00:43:18,528
Thank you!

577
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:26,758
- You're pretty good.
- Thank you!

578
00:43:26,758 --> 00:43:28,228
Hey, it's mine.

579
00:43:28,228 --> 00:43:30,748
The grandpa gave it to me for being lovely.

580
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:36,678
Why don't you take one more job?

581
00:43:40,858 --> 00:43:43,408
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

582
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:46,368
Hey, by the way,

583
00:43:46,368 --> 00:43:49,448
it was the best performance I've seen in my life.

584
00:43:49,448 --> 00:43:51,968
Stop talking about it!

585
00:43:51,968 --> 00:43:54,948
I keep imagining it because of you, Mr. Jang.

586
00:43:54,948 --> 00:43:56,768
It's making me blush.

587
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:58,938
What's Mr. Kim's next plan?

588
00:43:58,938 --> 00:44:03,798
He said he'll present them with time for self-reflection.

589
00:44:03,798 --> 00:44:05,978
Self-reflection?

590
00:44:08,498 --> 00:44:10,738
Whoa.

591
00:44:11,678 --> 00:44:16,588
Will that old geezer tell her, as you said, Hyungnim?

592
00:44:16,588 --> 00:44:20,778
He clearly treated her differently than us.

593
00:44:22,188 --> 00:44:25,648
Hyungnim, isn't that the old geezer's car?

594
00:44:28,008 --> 00:44:30,288
 Wh-Whoa! 

595
00:44:37,328 --> 00:44:40,478
- What's this?
- Grandpa gave it to me for being lovely.

596
00:44:40,478 --> 00:44:43,638
Also, I'm not taking any more jobs.

597
00:44:45,888 --> 00:44:48,488
Hey, turn off the engine and get off.

598
00:44:51,718 --> 00:44:53,158
Get off while I'm talking nicely.

599
00:44:53,158 --> 00:44:55,748
You think I don't know what you're thinking?

600
00:44:55,748 --> 00:45:00,218
Grandpa told me everything.

601
00:45:05,498 --> 00:45:08,278
For being lovely.

602
00:45:13,298 --> 00:45:15,888
Shit! Hurry up and get her!

603
00:45:15,888 --> 00:45:17,708
Damn!

604
00:45:22,898 --> 00:45:25,438
They're coming.

605
00:45:25,438 --> 00:45:27,188
H-Hyungnim, o-over there!

606
00:45:27,188 --> 00:45:29,098
Shit, you're dead.

607
00:45:29,098 --> 00:45:30,648
I'll kill you!

608
00:45:30,648 --> 00:45:34,448
Whoa, chasing me as if he wants to kill me.

609
00:45:40,008 --> 00:45:42,198
- Hey, hey!
- Hey!

610
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:44,028
- Stop the car!
- Why would I stop!

611
00:45:44,028 --> 00:45:47,378
How ridiculous. You'll get hurt.

612
00:45:47,378 --> 00:45:49,768
- I see the second bridge.
- Make a right turn there.

613
00:45:49,768 --> 00:45:53,528
- Don't be nervous.
- Who said I'm nervous?

614
00:45:56,668 --> 00:45:58,428
Hyungnim! She's exiting that way.

615
00:45:58,428 --> 00:46:01,458
- I can tell, too, you asshole!
- Hyungnim, hurry up!

616
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:10,098
That part-timer bitch, I'll get her.

617
00:46:10,098 --> 00:46:12,388
- Aigoo!
- Yes.

618
00:46:19,578 --> 00:46:21,818
- The tractor.
- That bumpkin-

619
00:46:21,818 --> 00:46:24,068
- Gosh, that bastard.
- That bumpkin...

620
00:46:24,068 --> 00:46:26,548
- Hey, move aside!
- Get out of the way!

621
00:46:26,548 --> 00:46:29,648
- What are you doing?
- Move aside!

622
00:46:29,648 --> 00:46:33,118
- What's he doing?
- I said, move aside!

623
00:46:34,498 --> 00:46:38,158
You f***ing bumpkin!

624
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:42,678
Aigoo, how short-tempered.

625
00:46:42,678 --> 00:46:44,798
I'm going, I'm going.

626
00:46:44,798 --> 00:46:47,588
Whoa- Shit! Hey!

627
00:46:47,588 --> 00:46:51,198
- Hey, move aside. Get out!
- Hey, you f***ing bumpkin!

628
00:46:51,198 --> 00:46:54,648
- H-Hyungnim, it's that way! She went that way!
- Over there!

629
00:46:54,648 --> 00:46:57,378
- Hurry up and go!
- I'm trying to go, you punk!

630
00:46:57,378 --> 00:46:59,688
- Hey, move aside!
- Move out!

631
00:46:59,688 --> 00:47:02,088
- H-Hyung he's pulling over!
- Get past him!

632
00:47:02,088 --> 00:47:05,838
You f***ing bumpkin!

633
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:08,908
Sure. Go on ahead.

634
00:47:09,948 --> 00:47:11,388
 

635
00:47:33,828 --> 00:47:35,558
Where did she go?

636
00:47:37,298 --> 00:47:39,718
Gosh, she must've gotten scared of us following her.

637
00:47:39,718 --> 00:47:42,408
She left everything and ran away.

638
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:46,438
Hyungnim! Look at this.

639
00:47:57,348 --> 00:47:59,118
Hyungnim...

640
00:47:59,118 --> 00:48:01,138
Our truck.

641
00:48:03,938 --> 00:48:06,128
Hey, stop our truck!

642
00:48:06,128 --> 00:48:09,518
- Aigoo, shit-
- H-Hey, go hold the truck!

643
00:48:14,338 --> 00:48:17,708
No! N-No! No-

644
00:48:19,738 --> 00:48:23,058
- H-Hey, don't go closer. Approach slowly.
- Wh-Whoa, whoa.

645
00:48:28,788 --> 00:48:31,208
- It's a bird.
- Stay still, okay?

646
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:33,188
Yes, you look cute.

647
00:48:39,038 --> 00:48:42,368
- No!
- W-Wait-

648
00:48:42,368 --> 00:48:45,328
No!

649
00:48:48,788 --> 00:48:52,698
 No! 

650
00:49:04,428 --> 00:49:06,498
God, no...

651
00:49:06,498 --> 00:49:09,098
This can't be!

652
00:49:13,578 --> 00:49:16,298
No way!

653
00:49:16,298 --> 00:49:19,718
No, no, no...

654
00:49:23,548 --> 00:49:25,638
 Let me borrow that tractor, too. 

655
00:49:25,638 --> 00:49:28,178
 To the same place Grandpa had it sent. 

656
00:49:28,178 --> 00:49:31,068
 Was there an ATM machine nearby? 

657
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:33,108
 I have a hunch about a place. 

658
00:49:33,108 --> 00:49:35,538
 We'll know when we check later. 

659
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:05,858
Mr. Kim Do Gi...

660
00:50:42,508 --> 00:50:44,278
 Our truck... 

661
00:50:45,748 --> 00:50:47,738
 Hey, stop our truck! 

662
00:50:47,738 --> 00:50:50,498
 - No!
- W-Wait- 

663
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:01,218
No...

664
00:51:01,218 --> 00:51:03,248
No, no!

665
00:51:04,358 --> 00:51:07,638
No, no...

666
00:51:07,638 --> 00:51:10,118
How could this...

667
00:51:16,548 --> 00:51:18,288
No!

668
00:51:21,528 --> 00:51:24,398
Why are you crying? What's wrong-

669
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:29,068
- My truck...
- Aigoo.

670
00:51:29,068 --> 00:51:32,078
It's totally destroyed.

671
00:51:32,078 --> 00:51:35,408
That's beyond repair.

672
00:51:40,418 --> 00:51:41,658
Aigoo.

673
00:51:41,658 --> 00:51:44,588
That's all I had...

674
00:51:44,588 --> 00:51:49,678
Call Mr. Jang and tell him it's time for his last walk.

675
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:20,208
You know...

676
00:52:21,508 --> 00:52:23,348
I know people like you very well.

677
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:26,448
I can understand you better than anyone else can.

678
00:52:27,448 --> 00:52:29,518
Because we're the same type of people.

679
00:52:29,518 --> 00:52:35,568
That dirty feeling of anxiety, afraid that someone might steal what's yours.

680
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:39,128
I know that very well.

681
00:52:39,128 --> 00:52:40,618
Now...

682
00:52:41,418 --> 00:52:46,178
tell me where it is. Then everything will work out.

683
00:52:48,838 --> 00:52:51,498
Hyungnim, should we catch him?

684
00:52:51,498 --> 00:52:52,898
Leave him be.

685
00:52:52,898 --> 00:52:56,788
An old geezer with dementia can only run so far.

686
00:52:56,788 --> 00:53:02,128
If he doesn't want to croak, he'll lead us to where the money is buried.

687
00:53:09,598 --> 00:53:12,488
Hyungnim, isn't that a cliff?

688
00:53:12,488 --> 00:53:15,298
Hey, catch him.

689
00:53:49,728 --> 00:53:51,948
H-Hyungnim!

690
00:53:51,948 --> 00:53:55,418
He died. We killed him...

691
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:04,818
Hyungnim, someone just died!

692
00:54:04,818 --> 00:54:07,538
Hey, you idiots.

693
00:54:07,538 --> 00:54:09,818
Can't you tell what's going on?

694
00:54:09,818 --> 00:54:13,308
The only people who know about...

695
00:54:13,308 --> 00:54:15,478
that geezer's money...

696
00:54:17,378 --> 00:54:18,978
is you...

697
00:54:18,978 --> 00:54:20,298
you...

698
00:54:21,108 --> 00:54:23,138
and me.

699
00:54:23,138 --> 00:54:25,328
Just the three of us.

700
00:54:26,848 --> 00:54:28,258
Come.

701
00:54:28,258 --> 00:54:31,018
Come here. Hey!

702
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:32,418
Hey!

703
00:54:33,198 --> 00:54:36,748
Those f***ing idiots until the end!

704
00:54:36,748 --> 00:54:42,678
Hey, you idiots. This is why you can never get out of this countryside!

705
00:54:57,248 --> 00:54:59,798
The money is mine now.

706
00:55:06,758 --> 00:55:08,408
Here we go.

707
00:55:13,888 --> 00:55:16,058
Aigoo.

708
00:55:16,058 --> 00:55:17,808
Aigoo, Mr. Jang.

709
00:55:17,808 --> 00:55:22,178
You're incredible. How did you think to jump from there?

710
00:55:22,178 --> 00:55:25,718
Next time, let's have the younger people take a walk.

711
00:55:25,718 --> 00:55:29,158
- All right!
- Hyungnim! Hyungnim, help me.

712
00:55:29,158 --> 00:55:30,838
All right. Follow closely!

713
00:55:30,838 --> 00:55:33,518
What? Hyungnim! No!

714
00:55:33,518 --> 00:55:37,318
Don't start! Hyungnim!

715
00:55:37,328 --> 00:55:39,148
Hurry!

716
00:55:41,548 --> 00:55:44,468
- Oh, taxi!
- Hurry, hurry!

717
00:55:48,368 --> 00:55:50,608
Start driving.

718
00:55:50,608 --> 00:55:52,858
Start driving! Anywhere is fine.

719
00:56:05,928 --> 00:56:07,498
I'm sorry...

720
00:56:08,548 --> 00:56:11,898
Please help us!

721
00:56:12,808 --> 00:56:15,368
I'm sorry. Please help us...

722
00:56:15,368 --> 00:56:18,108
Hyung, wake up!

723
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,812
 

724
00:56:56,100 --> 00:57:06,300


725
00:57:16,972 --> 00:57:19,062
Just leave him?

726
00:57:19,062 --> 00:57:21,932
We shouldn't interrupt while he's treasure hunting.

727
00:57:21,932 --> 00:57:23,572
Until when?

728
00:57:23,572 --> 00:57:28,182
It'll be over once he finds the treasure buried in the ground.

729
00:57:28,182 --> 00:57:30,342
That never existed, though.

730
00:57:30,342 --> 00:57:33,192
To us, yes. But not to him.

731
00:57:33,192 --> 00:57:37,712
Since he saw it, touched it, and felt it.

732
00:57:45,262 --> 00:57:48,752
Today is a day he'll never forget.

733
00:57:51,222 --> 00:57:54,572
 He lost his entire fortune in a fire, 

734
00:57:55,902 --> 00:57:58,442
 and his partners left him, too. 

735
00:57:58,442 --> 00:58:00,902
And someone even died.

736
00:58:00,902 --> 00:58:05,742
It'll be a devastating reality for him to face.

737
00:58:11,622 --> 00:58:15,022
 Finding the fortune buried underground, 

738
00:58:15,022 --> 00:58:18,552
will be the only way for him to escape reality.

739
00:58:33,482 --> 00:58:35,622
 The more devastating reality is, 

740
00:58:35,622 --> 00:58:38,352
the stronger the temptation and desire...

741
00:58:38,352 --> 00:58:40,522
of the treasure will become.

742
00:58:41,572 --> 00:58:44,642
But why did you say self-reflection?

743
00:58:44,642 --> 00:58:49,842
He should also experience the twisted intention of choosing only the good people

744
00:58:49,842 --> 00:58:52,652
and causing them damage.

745
00:58:54,502 --> 00:58:56,922
 It's like prison. 

746
00:58:56,922 --> 00:59:00,122
 A prison created by his own greed. 

747
00:59:00,122 --> 00:59:02,692
But when will he leave that prison?

748
00:59:02,692 --> 00:59:05,652
Once he comes to a realization, he'll open the door and leave on his own.

749
00:59:05,652 --> 00:59:07,842
But that won't be easy.

750
00:59:07,842 --> 00:59:11,002
There's no treasure, but there is a dud.

751
00:59:11,002 --> 00:59:12,422
- Huh?
- Dud?

752
00:59:12,422 --> 00:59:13,902
What?

753
00:59:15,122 --> 00:59:19,322
That area already had many red flags planted there.

754
00:59:27,172 --> 00:59:32,772
In the military, red flags usually indicate minefield territory.

755
00:59:47,682 --> 00:59:49,602
Aigoo...

756
01:00:03,172 --> 01:00:05,482
- Thank you.
- Take care.

757
01:00:05,482 --> 01:00:08,502
You can give me that garbage.

758
01:00:08,502 --> 01:00:12,482
- You're sure this will work, right?
- It works well.

759
01:00:12,482 --> 01:00:14,232
Here you go.

760
01:00:20,212 --> 01:00:22,332
 All the people who've been conned 

761
01:00:22,332 --> 01:00:25,312
 and the money you owe has been taken care of, 

762
01:00:25,312 --> 01:00:28,062
 so there's no need to worry now. 

763
01:00:28,062 --> 01:00:32,182
 How can I repay you? 

764
01:00:32,182 --> 01:00:38,062
 For you to live a long, healthy life will be the best way to pay us back. 

765
01:00:38,062 --> 01:00:40,022
Grandma!

766
01:00:40,022 --> 01:00:41,352
Mother, we're here.

767
01:00:41,352 --> 01:00:42,822
Grandma!

768
01:00:42,822 --> 01:00:45,462
Yes. Aigoo.

769
01:00:45,462 --> 01:00:47,582
Aigoo, how did you come all this way?

770
01:00:47,582 --> 01:00:49,862
It's not like we come often.

771
01:00:49,862 --> 01:00:51,802
- You're all better now?
- Yes.

772
01:00:51,802 --> 01:00:54,272
You're healthy, right?

773
01:00:58,852 --> 01:01:01,572
I'll make you something delicious.

774
01:01:04,122 --> 01:01:07,022
Dispatch complete.

775
01:01:07,022 --> 01:01:08,622
Great job.

776
01:01:08,622 --> 01:01:11,232
 Everyone did a great job. 

777
01:01:33,702 --> 01:01:36,642
All right...

778
01:01:47,072 --> 01:01:48,352
 

779
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,642
Just like that. Straight back.

780
01:02:46,642 --> 01:02:48,832
Straight back.

781
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:50,022
It sounds a bit weird.

782
01:02:50,022 --> 01:02:52,802
Huh? The sound?

783
01:02:56,592 --> 01:02:58,572
Go Eun, Go Eun!

784
01:02:58,572 --> 01:03:00,842
Where is the case file on Jang?

785
01:03:10,342 --> 01:03:11,932
I found them.

786
01:03:11,972 --> 01:03:13,972
 

787
01:03:29,162 --> 01:03:32,832

 If we alert the police, her parents will be informed right away. 

795
01:04:07,272 --> 01:04:10,152
 To parents who don't even know who Seo Yeon is? That won't do. 

796
01:04:10,152 --> 01:04:13,102
 - Please don't tell Uncle.
- Uncle? 

797
01:04:13,102 --> 01:04:16,382
 Our Pro Kang's full name is Kang Pil Seung. 

798
01:04:16,382 --> 01:04:18,272
 Is that why the company's called Pil Consulting? 

799
01:04:18,272 --> 01:04:19,972
 You don't know who our Pro Kang is? 

800
01:04:19,972 --> 01:04:22,652
 He's the top lecturer in the real estate consulting world.

 You can't enter without a ticket.

01:04:23,982 --> 01:04:26,382
 It doesn't seem like he consults just anyone.

01:04:26,382 --> 01:04:27,702
 But is there really no way?

- A house for the two of us.

01:04:34,602 --> 01:04:36,992
 - That tiny kid is really quick.
- What should we do? 

808
01:04:36,992 --> 01:04:40,922
 Go Eun, will you marry me? 

809
01:04:40,922 --> 01:04:42,492
