1
00:00:27,164 --> 00:00:32,964
 

2
00:00:34,104 --> 00:00:38,914
 Today, there was the first trial for the branch manager and the assistant manager 

3
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:43,314
 of a bank that allowed a large sum of money to be sent overseas for 

4
00:00:43,314 --> 00:00:47,814
 money laundering and helped with avoiding regulations. 

5
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:50,764
 Due to the prime witness's testimony, most of the 

6
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:53,264
 prosecution's evidence was accepted, 

7
00:00:53,264 --> 00:00:55,834
- How did this...
 - and the branch manager and assistant manager 

8
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:58,134
 who managed the funds were found guilty. 

9
00:01:02,154 --> 00:01:03,854
Yes.

10
00:01:03,854 --> 00:01:07,274
I'll do as you say, Bishop.

11
00:01:07,274 --> 00:01:10,454
Do you think you won this time, too?

12
00:01:13,744 --> 00:01:16,724
You'll still die by my hands!

13
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:24,024
Let go!

14
00:01:24,024 --> 00:01:25,874
Shit!

15
00:01:29,754 --> 00:01:32,654
Bishop has made an order.

16
00:01:33,514 --> 00:01:37,024
He wants you confined to the punishment room.

17
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:29,124
There's only one way Mr. Lee can be safe.

18
00:02:29,124 --> 00:02:33,224
Letting him attend the trial and testify safely.

19
00:02:33,224 --> 00:02:35,514
Until he finishes testifying in court,

20
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:39,004
we need to make sure we get everyone's attention.

21
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:41,534
Getting everyone's attention...

22
00:02:41,534 --> 00:02:45,304
We'll have to go inside a tiger's mouth or something.

23
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:47,094
It might be more dangerous than we think.

24
00:02:47,094 --> 00:02:49,744
Aren't you the one who's most in danger right now?

25
00:02:49,744 --> 00:02:51,394
Go Eun is right.

26
00:02:51,394 --> 00:02:55,314
Once they find everything out, there's no way they'll just leave you alone.

27
00:02:55,314 --> 00:03:00,514
Once Mr. Lee's safety is secured, I'll think about how to escape.

28
00:03:10,134 --> 00:03:12,624
There's no way to escape.

29
00:03:15,644 --> 00:03:18,414
 

30
00:03:19,894 --> 00:03:23,994
 

31
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,600
 

32
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,700
 !

33
00:03:51,214 --> 00:03:52,994
Congratulations on your release.

34
00:03:52,994 --> 00:03:56,564
You've been through a lot for the past two years.

35
00:03:57,624 --> 00:04:00,584
Ha Joon, you must've been through a lot.

36
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:03,624
We're arranging a chapel in the backyard.

37
00:04:03,624 --> 00:04:07,404
No, there's a place I have in mind.

38
00:04:07,404 --> 00:04:11,274
A place where ignorant people can't recklessly enter.

39
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:13,764
so I could discover this place.

40
00:04:13,764 --> 00:04:17,324
The Lord may have intentionally given me this period of authority,

41
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:22,064
Thus, you will have absolutely no authority.

42
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:26,714
Since the Lord said, he will sit you upon a higher position.

43
00:04:26,714 --> 00:04:28,864
The highest position

44
00:04:28,864 --> 00:04:32,564
from which you can manipulate the world from each of your places.

45
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:35,714
So please bear in mind one thing.

46
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:38,364
Where you all came from...

47
00:04:39,984 --> 00:04:42,894
Who placed you...

48
00:04:42,894 --> 00:04:46,594
in that position and why...

49
00:04:53,474 --> 00:04:55,064
Amen.

50
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:58,034
 - Amen.
 - Amen.

51
00:05:01,214 --> 00:05:04,434
 

52
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:08,914
I gave you enough chances, didn't I?

53
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:14,204
Bishop, please give me one more chance.

54
00:05:19,874 --> 00:05:24,954
Pray quietly and wait for an answer.

55
00:06:03,194 --> 00:06:05,644
You weak little thing.

56
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:27,774
Even the great Mr. On is sent to the punishment room in the end.

57
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,084
I'll make you a promise.

58
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:44,504
If I get out of here,

59
00:06:45,564 --> 00:06:49,784
I'll kill you and anyone related to you.

60
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,154
I'll find every single person who received help from you

61
00:06:53,154 --> 00:06:56,614
and I'll kill them myself.

62
00:06:56,614 --> 00:06:58,614
The outfit suits you.

63
00:07:29,384 --> 00:07:31,244
Excuse me.

64
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:36,704
Could you cut the meat for me?

65
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:39,444
I don't have the strength to lift my arms.

66
00:07:39,444 --> 00:07:41,874
It's because I'm old.

67
00:07:45,554 --> 00:07:47,254
Thank you.

68
00:07:56,154 --> 00:07:58,054
That rattled me.

69
00:08:40,024 --> 00:08:42,594
Nine are too many.

70
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:48,674
Yes, I enjoyed your hospitality.

71
00:08:48,674 --> 00:08:51,824
I'll invite you to my house next time. Yes, yes.

72
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:54,644
Keep up the good work.

73
00:09:04,164 --> 00:09:06,374
What are you doing? Catch him!

74
00:09:23,254 --> 00:09:26,114
- Mr. Jang!
- Why couldn't we reach you?

75
00:09:26,114 --> 00:09:27,304
My battery died.

76
00:09:27,304 --> 00:09:31,424
These punks should've at least charged your battery when they abducted you.

77
00:09:31,424 --> 00:09:33,434
What about Mr. Kim? Can you reach him?

78
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:34,734
There's no signal yet.

79
00:09:34,734 --> 00:09:36,374
Maybe Mr. Kim Do Gi also has a battery issue?

80
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:41,344
We need to be able to communicate if we want to save him.

81
00:09:41,344 --> 00:09:43,024
- I'll go.
- Go where?

82
00:09:43,024 --> 00:09:45,804
- To give him his battery.
- But you'll get caught.

83
00:09:45,804 --> 00:09:47,924
There's a way I won't get caught.

84
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:54,654
Do you see anything?

85
00:09:54,654 --> 00:09:56,934
How are you? What is it today?

86
00:09:56,934 --> 00:09:58,994
What are you smuggling in today?

87
00:09:58,994 --> 00:10:01,084
Please!

88
00:10:01,084 --> 00:10:03,964
It's okay!

89
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:07,274
I'd like you to deliver this, too.

90
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:10,994
Thanks!

91
00:10:10,994 --> 00:10:14,024
You're good at this. Keep it up!

92
00:10:14,024 --> 00:10:18,254
Snacks have arrived! Don't eat them all at once.

93
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:21,514
Make sure to chew carefully.

94
00:10:28,364 --> 00:10:31,864
The things they make me deliver...

95
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,994
Today's snack is sweet red bean bread!

96
00:10:57,894 --> 00:10:59,504
 Go Eun. 

97
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:06,264
- Mr. Kim Do Gi.
- You're safe, right? Not hurt anywhere?

98
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:09,554
I'm not safe, and I'm hurt everywhere.

99
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:13,614
Gosh, I was really worried. Me, especially.

100
00:11:13,614 --> 00:11:16,244
It's a good thing we got in contact with you.

101
00:11:16,244 --> 00:11:19,474
 We were formulating your escape plan. 

102
00:11:19,474 --> 00:11:22,414
No, don't do that.

103
00:11:22,414 --> 00:11:25,044
What do you mean, don't?

104
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:27,244
I won't leave this place.

105
00:11:27,244 --> 00:11:29,694
- What?
- I'll stay here.

106
00:11:29,694 --> 00:11:32,854
What the heck are you saying? Don't you know how dangerous it is in there?

107
00:11:32,854 --> 00:11:34,174
My thoughts exactly.

108
00:11:34,174 --> 00:11:36,984
It's urgent that you escape from there as soon as possible.

109
00:11:36,984 --> 00:11:40,824
You know the prison guards and warden are all on the same side.

110
00:11:40,824 --> 00:11:42,374
Exactly, that's a good thing.

111
00:11:42,374 --> 00:11:44,944
How could that be a good thing?

112
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:47,494
A place where one can't just barge in from the outside.

113
00:11:47,494 --> 00:11:49,344
Since the insiders have been bought out,

114
00:11:49,344 --> 00:11:53,594
it's ironically the safest place where you're protected by the law and public authorities.

115
00:11:53,594 --> 00:11:55,534
I think this place...

116
00:11:56,954 --> 00:11:59,444
just might be their secret hideout.

117
00:11:59,444 --> 00:12:01,074
Secret hide...

118
00:12:01,984 --> 00:12:03,774
Mr. Kim, don't tell me...

119
00:12:03,774 --> 00:12:08,084
Now is the best time since their source of funding has been damaged by Mr. Lee's testimony.

120
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:11,074
We must corner them.

121
00:12:11,074 --> 00:12:13,374
How will you corner them?

122
00:12:13,374 --> 00:12:16,514
Mr. Choi, Mr. Park, Go Eun...

123
00:12:16,514 --> 00:12:20,384
I'd like the three of you to become my hands and feet.

124
00:12:20,384 --> 00:12:24,434
Please share the foreign market exchange Mr. Lee submitted to the prosecution first.

125
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:28,364
We're going to block their alternate sources of income.

126
00:12:28,364 --> 00:12:31,134
You're saying you'll throttle their main sources of income

127
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:36,794
to make the ones in the waters come up to the surface?

128
00:12:36,794 --> 00:12:40,154
If their breathing hole is blocked, they'll come up for air.

129
00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:44,894
While you're blocking their breathing hole, I'm going to tend to another business.

130
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:48,064
- There's something I need to look into.
- All right.

131
00:12:49,814 --> 00:12:50,624
What?

132
00:12:50,624 --> 00:12:53,694
We're all gathered here to formulate an escape plan for Mr. Kim,

133
00:12:53,694 --> 00:12:57,514
but all he's thinking about in there is catching the bad guys.

134
00:12:57,514 --> 00:13:00,704
You really don't take care of yourself.

135
00:13:00,704 --> 00:13:02,184
 Then... 

136
00:13:04,474 --> 00:13:06,414
shall we begin?

137
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:14,754
 

138
00:13:16,114 --> 00:13:17,824
 

139
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:26,784
 

140
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:33,004
 

141
00:13:33,004 --> 00:13:34,344
 

142
00:13:35,674 --> 00:13:37,474
 

143
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:47,824
 

144
00:13:47,824 --> 00:13:49,624
 

145
00:13:49,624 --> 00:13:50,734
 

146
00:13:58,674 --> 00:14:02,314
We excluded the clients Mr. Lee submitted to the prosecution,

147
00:14:02,314 --> 00:14:05,644
but they still have too many intact sources of income.

148
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:08,124
There's no need to block all sources of income.

149
00:14:08,124 --> 00:14:12,854
Blocking one or two main sources will be more than enough.

150
00:14:16,514 --> 00:14:17,994
The antique exchange,

151
00:14:17,994 --> 00:14:23,114
they have many foreign clients in contrast with their small scale.

152
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:25,064
Antique...

153
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,424
Antique... antique...

154
00:14:28,424 --> 00:14:32,254
They also have extremely high operating funds.

155
00:14:32,254 --> 00:14:34,504
They'll have heavy security, too. Won't it be too dangerous?

156
00:14:34,504 --> 00:14:37,754
If we intend to siphon their funds, that may be the case, but our intention

157
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:41,194
is to block their transfers, so that shouldn't be too hard.

158
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:42,964
For example?

159
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:47,514
Having one of the auction pieces stolen

160
00:14:47,514 --> 00:14:49,434
will be major enough trouble for them.

161
00:14:49,434 --> 00:14:52,674
- Theft? You want us to steal?
- Hey, like we haven't before?

162
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:56,404
That means we need to infiltrate, but they have high security, and we don't have Mr. Kim.

163
00:14:56,404 --> 00:14:59,144
Then don't infiltrate and just wait outside.

164
00:14:59,144 --> 00:15:00,834
Outside?

165
00:15:03,514 --> 00:15:06,374
There's an item up for auction today.

166
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:10,864
Mr. Choi, Mr. Park, may I ask you this favor?

167
00:15:10,864 --> 00:15:13,604
Of course. Leave it to us.

168
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:15,124
Us?

169
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:18,044
What are you doing? Hurry up. Come on.

170
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:24,504
Have a safe trip.

171
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:26,014
 

172
00:15:26,014 --> 00:15:28,614
No need to rush. Just be careful.

173
00:15:35,244 --> 00:15:38,214
- I got your contact and came.
- That was quick.

174
00:15:43,524 --> 00:15:46,484
Thank you.

175
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:48,334
Watch your head.

176
00:15:51,904 --> 00:15:54,344
All right.

177
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:56,024
- Keep up the good work.
- Keep it up.

178
00:15:56,024 --> 00:15:57,934
Take care.

179
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:04,494
It's important we transfer it slowly and safely.

180
00:16:09,684 --> 00:16:11,574
Let's go in. Good job, everyone.

181
00:16:11,574 --> 00:16:13,564
- Good job.
- Let's go.

182
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:19,144
I got your contact and came.

183
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:23,354
- Contact?
- Y-Yes, I got your contact...

184
00:16:23,354 --> 00:16:25,044
Your contact...

185
00:16:25,044 --> 00:16:26,434
 

186
00:16:28,274 --> 00:16:30,244
All of them have many exchanges with this company.

187
00:16:30,244 --> 00:16:34,574
It's a good source when they need to transfer funds overseas but can't use the bank.

188
00:16:34,574 --> 00:16:36,854
An illegal foreign exchange.

189
00:16:36,854 --> 00:16:39,734
They're mostly illegal, so their client management is meticulous.

190
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:41,284
That's right.

191
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:46,194
Even at Nakwon Credit Office, they didn't use an external server for the computer managing the list of clients.

192
00:16:46,194 --> 00:16:48,224
To prevent hacking.

193
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:51,814
If the client list were to disappear from that computer...

194
00:16:51,814 --> 00:16:55,234
they would have a mental breakdown.

195
00:16:55,234 --> 00:16:57,184
I'll take a trip there.

196
00:17:08,924 --> 00:17:12,564
There's a good girl. Such a good girl.

197
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:15,384
You seem well-distinguished. What brings you here?

198
00:17:15,384 --> 00:17:19,044
I came to borrow money. This place lends money, right?

199
00:17:19,044 --> 00:17:21,814
You came to the right place. How much do you need?

200
00:17:21,814 --> 00:17:24,674
- 100 thousand won.
- 100 t-thousand won?

201
00:17:24,674 --> 00:17:26,134
- 100 thousand won.
- Why?

202
00:17:26,134 --> 00:17:30,794
I'll borrow 100 thousand won and buy you tasty snacks.

203
00:17:30,794 --> 00:17:33,744
I think one of your clothes alone might sell for more than 100 thousand won.

204
00:17:33,744 --> 00:17:37,214
Oh, my. Oh, my, not my babies.

205
00:17:37,214 --> 00:17:39,354
Hurry and lend it to me.

206
00:17:39,354 --> 00:17:42,814
I'll borrow 100 thousand won and buy you snacks.

207
00:17:44,084 --> 00:17:46,234
We need to sign a contract, right?

208
00:17:50,864 --> 00:17:53,124
I need to stamp it, don't I?

209
00:17:53,124 --> 00:17:55,904
Where's my stamp?

210
00:17:55,904 --> 00:17:59,264
I just want to sign it. Never mind, I'll just stamp it.

211
00:17:59,264 --> 00:18:01,914
I just want to sign it. Never mind, I'll just stamp it.

212
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,054
Such a good girl. Hold on a minute.

213
00:18:05,054 --> 00:18:07,234
It's too cramped here.

214
00:18:07,234 --> 00:18:10,004
Dalbong, we should go for a walk.

215
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:13,814
Baby, where did I put my stamp? Oh, my. I didn't bring it?

216
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:18,004
How could I not bring it? Forget the loan.

217
00:18:18,004 --> 00:18:20,734
Take care. Let's go, Dalbong.

218
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:23,884
Bye.

219
00:18:23,884 --> 00:18:26,294
What just happened?

220
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:35,394
Aigoo. Aigoo...

221
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:37,174
Aigoo.

222
00:18:37,174 --> 00:18:39,854
This is too heavy.

223
00:18:39,854 --> 00:18:43,474
It's as condensed as can be with just the degaussing function. Doesn't get lighter than that.

224
00:18:43,474 --> 00:18:45,414
Gosh, Dalbong is heavy, too.

225
00:18:45,414 --> 00:18:48,004
Come here, Dalbong. Stay put.

226
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:51,394
Hey, what's wrong with this? Why isn't anything working?

227
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,954
All the data on the hard drive has been erased!

228
00:18:54,954 --> 00:18:56,434
What?

229
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,444
What do you mean?

230
00:19:08,444 --> 00:19:12,054
None of the funds could be executed?

231
00:19:24,134 --> 00:19:25,954
Go and...

232
00:19:27,314 --> 00:19:29,744
Yes, Bishop.

233
00:19:29,744 --> 00:19:34,424
bring me Kim Do Gi.

234
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:05,384
I think I should personally visit him.

235
00:20:05,384 --> 00:20:07,364
 Visit Mr. Kim, right now? 

236
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:09,344
Those bastards will catch you right away.

237
00:20:09,344 --> 00:20:11,494
They wouldn't kill me, would they?

238
00:20:11,494 --> 00:20:14,464
Oh, and I'm not on my way to meet Mr. Kim.

239
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:15,694
Then who?

240
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:20,114
Don't be too worried even if you can't contact me for a while. I'll be fine.

241
00:20:20,114 --> 00:20:22,174
Mr. Jang! Mr. Jang-

242
00:20:57,784 --> 00:21:02,014
5283, you have a special interview.

243
00:21:04,574 --> 00:21:06,654
Do you have milk?

244
00:21:31,634 --> 00:21:36,214
Did you make the wrong visitation request for Kim Do Gi?

245
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:41,824
Whatever the case,

246
00:21:41,824 --> 00:21:45,954
I'm flattered you came to me on your own when I needed you.

247
00:21:45,954 --> 00:21:49,194
I'm in a situation where I can't bear to face my superiors.

248
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,364
I saved face, thanks to you.

249
00:22:07,154 --> 00:22:12,304
Even taking that into consideration, I had to come.

250
00:22:12,304 --> 00:22:14,474
You had to come?

251
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,824
You deserve to know the truth.

252
00:22:35,324 --> 00:22:38,514
 

253
00:22:44,594 --> 00:22:46,764
Mr. Kim Do Gi's prediction was right.

254
00:22:46,764 --> 00:22:50,184
Their breathing hole really must've been blocked.

255
00:22:56,684 --> 00:22:59,114
You're capturing all the cars going inside now, right?

256
00:22:59,114 --> 00:23:03,574
Of course. I'm not missing a single one.

257
00:23:04,844 --> 00:23:08,464
What are you doing? Hurry and eat it.

258
00:23:08,464 --> 00:23:10,384
Must I eat this?

259
00:23:10,384 --> 00:23:13,084
You must eat this, so they don't suspect you.

260
00:23:13,084 --> 00:23:16,454
Tell me when you're done. I'll give you one more.

261
00:23:18,154 --> 00:23:21,374
Hey, you. Do you want some tofu?

262
00:23:21,374 --> 00:23:23,564
Come on.

263
00:23:23,564 --> 00:23:26,074
Dig in, will you?

264
00:24:01,104 --> 00:24:04,824
I didn't think I'd meet a customer here.

265
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:07,744
I underestimated you too much.

266
00:24:07,744 --> 00:24:11,704
If I'd known you were this kind of guy, I would've gotten rid of you early on.

267
00:24:11,704 --> 00:24:14,684
The consequence of letting my guard down wasn't small.

268
00:24:14,684 --> 00:24:17,704
I'm not sure how to charge a customer

269
00:24:17,704 --> 00:24:20,314
who intentionally told me the wrong destination.

270
00:24:20,314 --> 00:24:22,684
This is the first time that has happened.

271
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:31,194
I'll tell you what your final minutes will look like.

272
00:24:31,194 --> 00:24:33,834
I know how to tell fortune myself.

273
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:36,874
I had my fair share of experience as a shaman.

274
00:24:37,994 --> 00:24:40,154
According to my fortune-telling,

275
00:24:40,154 --> 00:24:44,944
you'll pay a hefty price for the taxi ride.

276
00:24:44,944 --> 00:24:46,824
A very hefty price.

277
00:24:46,824 --> 00:24:51,744
Today, you broke out because you couldn't handle prison life.

278
00:24:51,744 --> 00:24:55,034
You hid in a secluded place and were looking for a way to survive

279
00:24:55,034 --> 00:24:58,114
when you were discovered by armed prison guards...

280
00:24:58,114 --> 00:25:01,474
and died of gunshot wounds.

281
00:25:01,474 --> 00:25:06,494
A completely wretched and unnecessary way to die...

282
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:09,634
like your mom.

283
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,914
I'll collect that taxi fare now...

284
00:25:26,474 --> 00:25:29,104
with your life.

285
00:25:29,104 --> 00:25:30,614
Hey!

286
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:27,084
This small thing...

287
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:32,914
Who can you save when you can't even overcome this tiny thing?

288
00:26:37,394 --> 00:26:39,954
I'll take care of him as you asked.

289
00:26:39,954 --> 00:26:44,344
As well as the taxi company CEO, who came on his own two feet.

290
00:27:05,144 --> 00:27:07,094
 

291
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:18,444
 

292
00:27:28,624 --> 00:27:30,344
Isn't that Mr. Kim Do Gi?

293
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:33,354
Was it? I think I saw Mr. Jang.

294
00:27:33,354 --> 00:27:35,084
Huh?

295
00:27:35,084 --> 00:27:37,214
I think Mr. Kim Do Gi left prison.

296
00:27:37,214 --> 00:27:39,674
It is Mr. Kim Do Gi!

297
00:27:45,184 --> 00:27:48,684
A full-scale investigation started, and our sources of income are blocked.

298
00:27:48,684 --> 00:27:51,354
Our losses are out of control!

299
00:27:51,354 --> 00:27:55,614
We must do whatever it takes to fix this immediately, Bishop.

300
00:27:55,614 --> 00:27:58,484
Please provide us with a plan!

301
00:27:58,484 --> 00:28:01,524
- We need form a plan.
- We should for a plan!

302
00:28:01,524 --> 00:28:03,804
- This is a serious problem.
- Our hands are tied!

303
00:28:03,804 --> 00:28:06,574
Quiet.

304
00:28:08,224 --> 00:28:11,524
You think you're the bosses...

305
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:14,474
sitting in your high positions.

306
00:28:19,404 --> 00:28:24,824
The person who sat you in those seats was me, and the one to drag you off is also me.

307
00:28:24,824 --> 00:28:27,634
Watch your words and actions.

308
00:28:30,884 --> 00:28:35,174
And don't be nervous or anxious.

309
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:38,294
No loss will befall you.

310
00:28:38,294 --> 00:28:44,534
I've prepared a sacrifice to pay off your sins.

311
00:28:44,534 --> 00:28:46,934
 Amen. 

312
00:28:52,014 --> 00:28:55,104
A car is on their tail.

313
00:28:56,224 --> 00:28:58,744
Those moth-like people.

314
00:28:58,744 --> 00:29:00,704
Take care of them all at once.

315
00:29:29,074 --> 00:29:30,064
 

316
00:29:36,244 --> 00:29:40,114
 

317
00:29:42,164 --> 00:29:43,034
 

318
00:30:00,444 --> 00:30:02,884
Where the heck are they going?

319
00:30:11,814 --> 00:30:14,084
 

320
00:30:16,474 --> 00:30:18,784
I have a bad feeling.

321
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:20,994
They're all dead.

322
00:30:41,774 --> 00:30:45,184
Huh? Strategic retreat, for now.

323
00:30:46,174 --> 00:30:49,044
Whoa! Huh?

324
00:31:02,514 --> 00:31:04,534
Get out of the car.

325
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,814
Right now!

326
00:31:39,524 --> 00:31:42,754
 

327
00:31:42,754 --> 00:31:48,184
 Even taking that into consideration, I had to come. 

328
00:31:48,184 --> 00:31:51,464
You deserve to know the truth.

329
00:32:09,634 --> 00:32:13,104
Well over 10 years ago,

330
00:32:13,104 --> 00:32:18,114
I once met your parents through Bluebird.

331
00:32:20,484 --> 00:32:23,854
Their child was playing in the park in front of their house

332
00:32:23,854 --> 00:32:29,004
when he disappeared one day, holding someone's hand.

333
00:32:31,804 --> 00:32:34,214
 

334
00:32:34,214 --> 00:32:35,604
 

335
00:32:37,254 --> 00:32:39,254
 

336
00:32:41,284 --> 00:32:45,454
 Hey, I heard you can't even remember your name. 

337
00:32:45,454 --> 00:32:51,774
 When a kid dies because he tripped while running around alone, what should I say on paper? 

338
00:32:51,774 --> 00:32:54,954
 You always have to win in fights. 

339
00:32:54,954 --> 00:33:00,324
 Or else your enemy will claim you are the evil person. 

340
00:33:00,324 --> 00:33:03,044
 You're Ohn Ha Joon starting today. 

341
00:33:03,044 --> 00:33:08,954
 You'll fight the evil on behalf of Ha Joon, who just died. 

342
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:10,544
 Ha Joon. 

343
00:33:12,084 --> 00:33:16,814
Your parents quit everything

344
00:33:16,814 --> 00:33:19,304
and searched for you...

345
00:33:22,054 --> 00:33:23,754
 

346
00:33:26,184 --> 00:33:28,074
for a very long time.

347
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:29,724
 

348
00:33:30,654 --> 00:33:33,794
 

349
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:34,474
 

350
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:41,924
You were never abandoned.

351
00:33:41,924 --> 00:33:45,264
 
 

352
00:33:46,474 --> 00:33:49,144
 

353
00:34:06,284 --> 00:34:10,294
The father who searched for his son his entire life...

354
00:34:10,294 --> 00:34:13,534
lost his life in a mysterious accident.

355
00:34:17,134 --> 00:34:18,404
 I found him. 

356
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:21,794
 I'll meet you on the roof of Moji Center this Saturday at 10:00 p.m. 

357
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:25,274
 Your son will be waiting there. 

358
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:27,234
 

359
00:35:07,404 --> 00:35:12,064
I heard there was a child here who looked similar to my Dan Woo.

360
00:35:17,714 --> 00:35:20,004
 

361
00:35:59,534 --> 00:36:03,554
 You grew quicker than I thought. 

362
00:36:03,554 --> 00:36:08,904
 Today, I'll give you a present for becoming stronger. 

363
00:36:11,214 --> 00:36:15,574
 The ones with the ring will help you. 

364
00:36:21,844 --> 00:36:24,294
 I'm sorry, I'm late. 

365
00:36:24,294 --> 00:36:26,664
 How should I handle this case? 

366
00:36:26,664 --> 00:36:28,784
 If the father who was looking for his child 

367
00:36:28,784 --> 00:36:32,394
 killed himself by jumping off a building because he couldn't find him, 

368
00:36:34,104 --> 00:36:36,734
 what should one say on paper? 

369
00:36:48,224 --> 00:36:51,034
 

370
00:37:04,954 --> 00:37:09,464
 

371
00:37:29,474 --> 00:37:32,024
So what do you want me to do?

372
00:37:34,344 --> 00:37:37,334
What can I do after all this time?

373
00:37:56,404 --> 00:37:58,314
Mr. Kim Do Gi!

374
00:38:00,274 --> 00:38:03,634
Mr. Jang, are you okay?

375
00:38:03,634 --> 00:38:05,344
There are five of them.

376
00:38:06,554 --> 00:38:10,114
He says five is all of them.

377
00:38:10,114 --> 00:38:11,754
Ready...

378
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:16,844
- I didn't think this would be our ending.
- Hyungnim...

379
00:38:16,844 --> 00:38:18,404
Everyone...

380
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:20,974
I enjoyed my time with you all.

381
00:38:20,974 --> 00:38:24,674
- No, there's still a way...
- Get it together!

382
00:38:24,674 --> 00:38:27,824
Think about how to escape from here.

383
00:38:27,824 --> 00:38:31,644
- How can we in this situation?
- Hyungnim!

384
00:38:31,644 --> 00:38:33,904
Listen to me...

385
00:38:33,904 --> 00:38:34,994
Fire!

386
00:38:34,994 --> 00:38:38,074
I love you all!

387
00:39:11,664 --> 00:39:13,574
Mr. Kim!

388
00:39:35,364 --> 00:39:36,594
What happened?

389
00:39:36,594 --> 00:39:38,474
Who drove that when all of us are here?

390
00:39:38,474 --> 00:39:41,564
Why don't you listen to me?

391
00:39:57,514 --> 00:39:59,404
 

392
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,530
Mrs. Driver.

393
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:32,800
Does the pager really work?

394
00:40:32,804 --> 00:40:34,544
Seriously?

395
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,690
Come again!

396
00:40:41,694 --> 00:40:44,294
You acted like you'd never contact me again.

397
00:40:44,294 --> 00:40:46,674
I knew you'd be alive and well.

398
00:40:46,674 --> 00:40:48,794
Thanks for coming all this way.

399
00:40:50,074 --> 00:40:53,564
Do you still live in apprehension that someone might die?

400
00:40:56,504 --> 00:40:58,284
Say hello.

401
00:40:58,284 --> 00:41:02,014
This is our Premium Taxi Driver No.1.

402
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:15,094
Thank you for helping us.

403
00:41:34,444 --> 00:41:36,734
I don't wish to reprimand you.

404
00:41:36,734 --> 00:41:40,734
Since you've never once disappointed me until now.

405
00:41:40,734 --> 00:41:45,414
You've never failed me, so it's only natural you don't know how to take responsibility.

406
00:41:46,584 --> 00:41:48,894
I recall the bright smile on your face when we demolished

407
00:41:48,894 --> 00:41:52,674
the welfare center and built a new house.

408
00:41:57,044 --> 00:42:00,414
The damages were big this time, so there were a lot of complaints.

409
00:42:00,414 --> 00:42:01,834
Several domestic corporations are

410
00:42:01,834 --> 00:42:05,114
under the spotlight because they're on the investigation queue.

411
00:42:05,114 --> 00:42:07,274
I hope you learn

412
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:11,254
how to take responsibility through this opportunity.

413
00:42:12,424 --> 00:42:16,334
I've prepared everything you should tell the prosecution.

414
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:20,694
If you pray quietly, He will answer.

415
00:42:23,484 --> 00:42:27,664
Bishop, I think things went haywire.

416
00:42:39,074 --> 00:42:41,704
P-Please save me.

417
00:42:41,704 --> 00:42:47,294
Save you? Tell me a reason why you should be alive.

418
00:42:47,294 --> 00:42:48,974
I'll...

419
00:42:56,274 --> 00:43:00,194
take whatever punishment you give me.

420
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:04,404
I'll take full responsibility for everything

421
00:43:04,404 --> 00:43:10,344
in your stead, so all the blame is focused on me.

422
00:43:10,344 --> 00:43:12,494
But I have one favor to ask.

423
00:43:15,114 --> 00:43:20,124
Please allow me to kill that bastard, Kim Do Gi.

424
00:43:21,244 --> 00:43:24,154
I'll put an end to the fight...

425
00:43:24,154 --> 00:43:26,614
I started with him.

426
00:43:30,224 --> 00:43:32,284
I once heard from Mr. Jang

427
00:43:32,284 --> 00:43:35,184
that there's someone who drives more recklessly than I do.

428
00:43:35,184 --> 00:43:40,134
I also heard a lot about you, Premium Taxi Driver No. 1.

429
00:43:40,134 --> 00:43:43,384
Thank you for rescuing us.

430
00:43:51,064 --> 00:43:51,974
 

431
00:44:07,094 --> 00:44:09,684
Do you take commissions from someone like me, too?

432
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:23,784
What did he say?

433
00:44:23,784 --> 00:44:26,324
He wants to end this fight.

434
00:44:26,324 --> 00:44:28,164
Take this.

435
00:44:30,274 --> 00:44:32,724
I was going to drive you home since you looked exhausted,

436
00:44:32,724 --> 00:44:35,184
but it doesn't look like you'll head home.

437
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:38,424
I have to put an end to this fight.

438
00:44:38,424 --> 00:44:41,014
- Don't insist on going alone this time.
- Go Eun is right.

439
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:44,344
It'll make me too anxious to send you alone.

440
00:44:44,344 --> 00:44:48,404
All right. Let's all go together.

441
00:44:50,024 --> 00:44:52,364
Mr. Jang, you must feel reassured.

442
00:44:52,364 --> 00:44:55,484
I'm the one who should be reassuring them.

443
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:58,624
Thanks for coming all this way.

444
00:44:58,624 --> 00:45:00,104
What are you saying?

445
00:45:00,104 --> 00:45:03,294
You should be with them, too.

446
00:45:03,294 --> 00:45:05,824
They're putting an end to this.

447
00:45:05,824 --> 00:45:09,224
Go ahead first. I'll take care of the mess here.

448
00:45:09,224 --> 00:45:12,274
All right. I'll leave it to you.

449
00:45:12,274 --> 00:45:14,704
Now, shall we get going?

450
00:45:14,704 --> 00:45:16,284
Yes.

451
00:45:16,284 --> 00:45:17,864
Let's go.

452
00:46:25,924 --> 00:46:27,524
Follow me.

453
00:47:08,084 --> 00:47:11,644
 

454
00:47:13,994 --> 00:47:16,274
I was worried you wouldn't come.

455
00:47:16,274 --> 00:47:18,264
This needs to end.

456
00:47:19,904 --> 00:47:21,704
Give it your all.

457
00:47:21,704 --> 00:47:23,764
I'll do the same.

458
00:47:36,394 --> 00:47:39,404
The night is cold. Why don't you head inside-

459
00:47:39,404 --> 00:47:42,984
There are deaths I'd like to witness in person.

460
00:47:42,984 --> 00:47:45,864
You can go inside. It's cold.

461
00:49:28,954 --> 00:49:32,934
Is this what you wanted?

462
00:49:35,144 --> 00:49:37,654
You were right.

463
00:49:38,764 --> 00:49:42,074
There was something I retrieved by remembering.

464
00:49:46,064 --> 00:49:49,094
If I had met you, people, first,

465
00:49:50,634 --> 00:49:53,134
would my life have been different?

466
00:49:58,504 --> 00:50:00,394
What could have been...

467
00:50:01,564 --> 00:50:04,014
would've been better than this.

468
00:50:11,264 --> 00:50:13,034
Kim Dan Woo.

469
00:50:15,174 --> 00:50:18,864
Is that your true name?

470
00:50:18,864 --> 00:50:20,844
It's a nice name.

471
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:48,634
Thank you for accepting my commission, Do Gi hyungnim.

472
00:50:51,614 --> 00:50:54,204
Do you take commissions from someone like me, too?

473
00:50:58,404 --> 00:51:00,394
Please end this fight...

474
00:51:01,804 --> 00:51:04,084
and allow me to recover my name.

475
00:51:13,844 --> 00:51:16,074
That weak bastard.

476
00:51:19,054 --> 00:51:21,974
I'll end this fight with my own hands.

477
00:52:22,344 --> 00:52:24,004
Ha Joon...

478
00:52:25,284 --> 00:52:27,044
you dare...

479
00:52:28,284 --> 00:52:30,704
to kill...

480
00:52:34,394 --> 00:52:36,264
 Mr. On! 

481
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:53,254
 Go to the hospital first from now on, even if you're okay. 

482
00:52:55,514 --> 00:52:57,544
 Thank you. 

483
00:53:21,624 --> 00:53:24,914
- Bishop...
- What should we do?

484
00:53:30,194 --> 00:53:31,964
Warden!

485
00:53:40,034 --> 00:53:41,914
 

486
00:53:41,914 --> 00:53:44,354
What the hell is this?

487
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:47,004
What do you mean Bishop died? What's going on?

488
00:53:49,024 --> 00:53:51,214
Why would he die?

489
00:53:51,214 --> 00:53:54,364
Let's get out of here for now.

490
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:14,424
The door won't open!

491
00:54:16,134 --> 00:54:18,214
It won't open!

492
00:54:18,214 --> 00:54:21,424
- Aigoo!
- Is anybody there?

493
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:24,214
Please save us!

494
00:54:24,214 --> 00:54:26,734
Please save us!

495
00:54:37,344 --> 00:54:40,364
What the hell? Why won't this open?

496
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:42,674
Go through the cookhouse.

497
00:54:42,674 --> 00:54:46,144
- Move!
- Move aside.

498
00:54:46,144 --> 00:54:49,674
Yeah, they're heading toward the cookhouse.

499
00:54:49,674 --> 00:54:52,064
Was there an exit there, too?

500
00:55:05,064 --> 00:55:08,184
There was, but not anymore.

501
00:55:11,134 --> 00:55:14,344
Why is this closed?

502
00:55:38,814 --> 00:55:41,824
 

503
00:55:41,824 --> 00:55:44,924
Let's use our words.

504
00:55:51,834 --> 00:55:53,984
Save me!

505
00:56:16,424 --> 00:56:20,124

You should've hurried up a bit.

509

What about the other guys?

510
00:57:05,574 --> 00:57:08,804
We left them how you asked us to.

Get me out of here!

515
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:27,924
- Get me out!
- Open this door!

516
00:57:27,924 --> 00:57:30,184
- I said, get me out!
- Open this door!

517
00:57:30,184 --> 00:57:32,864
- Warden!
- Get me out!

There's someone trapped in here!

520
00:57:40,644 --> 00:57:43,674
I'll drive. Get in the back.

521
00:57:43,674 --> 00:57:45,454
I get shotgun.

Please take me to the place where we were happy.

526
00:58:13,204 --> 00:58:15,744
Do you know where that is?

527
00:58:19,404 --> 00:58:21,804
I'll escort you safely to your destination.

528
00:58:21,804 --> 00:58:24,154

- Okay.

536
00:59:09,774 --> 00:59:12,284
There's nothing wrong. All good.

537
00:59:12,284 --> 00:59:14,244
Okay, all good.

538
00:59:14,244 --> 00:59:18,704
Gosh, lying down the entire day hurt my knee.

539
00:59:18,704 --> 00:59:20,184
Open one of those for me.

540
00:59:20,184 --> 00:59:23,754
- Do you not have hands?
- I don't, I don't.

541
00:59:23,754 --> 00:59:26,804
All right. I'll share the last one I have.

542
00:59:27,874 --> 00:59:29,714
There was one left.

543
00:59:37,384 --> 00:59:41,024
- What are you stalling for?
- It's not here.

544
00:59:41,024 --> 00:59:43,144
Where did it go?

545
00:59:45,514 --> 00:59:47,664
It was here, but it's not.

546
00:59:47,664 --> 00:59:48,824
Gosh...

547
00:59:48,824 --> 00:59:52,424
- Hey.
- I didn't eat it. I really didn't!

548
00:59:52,424 --> 00:59:54,914
- Gosh.
- Geez...

549
01:00:04,774 --> 01:00:06,534
What are you doing here?

550
01:00:07,594 --> 01:00:09,454
Got off work now?

551
01:00:09,454 --> 01:00:12,514
- Aren't you cold?
- It's nice and refreshing.

552
01:00:13,884 --> 01:00:16,974
Do you know what I missed the most after moving out of here?

553
01:00:16,974 --> 01:00:21,864
Sitting here after work, enjoying the night view and having a beer.

554
01:00:23,334 --> 01:00:25,674
It's nice to be back here.

555
01:00:25,674 --> 01:00:28,094
Enough to want to come every day.

556
01:00:28,094 --> 01:00:29,704
Really?

557
01:00:34,204 --> 01:00:36,704
One for you, too.

558
01:00:42,594 --> 01:00:43,904
Cheers.

559
01:00:54,134 --> 01:00:56,484
You know what?

560
01:00:56,484 --> 01:01:00,254
30 cm is the distance I can maintain with others

561
01:01:00,254 --> 01:01:04,674
while still being able to feel socially intimate.

562
01:01:04,674 --> 01:01:07,674
If it's farther than 30 cm, you seem indifferent.

563
01:01:07,674 --> 01:01:11,514
And if it's closer than that, it's overwhelming.

564
01:01:11,514 --> 01:01:14,824
Sometimes, it's a scary distance.

565
01:01:14,824 --> 01:01:18,314
You came back after moving way farther than 30 cm.

566
01:01:18,314 --> 01:01:20,584
You must have become very indifferent.

567
01:01:23,584 --> 01:01:26,764
When you and I clinked beers just now,

568
01:01:26,764 --> 01:01:31,504
we were a bit closer than 30 cm.

569
01:01:31,504 --> 01:01:34,284
It was about 25 cm.

570
01:01:37,624 --> 01:01:39,884
But it wasn't overwhelming

571
01:01:41,024 --> 01:01:43,174
nor was it scary.

572
01:01:51,894 --> 01:01:55,144
I'm just saying.

573
01:02:07,704 --> 01:02:09,044
 Following news. 

574
01:02:09,044 --> 01:02:13,064
 This past May, the late Sergeant Hwang in the 2nd infantry division of the army 

575
01:02:13,064 --> 01:02:16,844
 filed a report after being victimized by sexual violence in Korea, 

576
01:02:16,844 --> 01:02:20,994
 but ended up suffering secondary assault, including intimidation and conciliation, 

577
01:02:20,994 --> 01:02:23,234
 leading him to make an unfortunate decision. 

578
01:02:23,234 --> 01:02:26,154
 It has been revealed that the involved unit 

579
01:02:26,154 --> 01:02:30,974
 tried to cover up the incident and fabricate evidence, causing a stir. 

580
01:02:42,334 --> 01:02:47,034
Reporting for duty! As of December 8, 2023, Captain Kim Do Gi

581
01:02:47,034 --> 01:02:51,524
has been transferred to the 29th Infantry Division Headquarters Military Inspectorate.

582
01:02:51,524 --> 01:02:53,744
End of report.

583
01:02:53,744 --> 01:02:55,814
Loyalty!

584
01:02:58,024 --> 01:02:59,954
You think he knows?

585
01:02:59,954 --> 01:03:02,484
What can he do after all this time?

586
01:03:02,484 --> 01:03:07,074
Even if he knows, he'll just become another corpse.

587
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:08,704
That's right.
