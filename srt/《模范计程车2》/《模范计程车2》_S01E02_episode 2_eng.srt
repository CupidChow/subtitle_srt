1
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:31,082
 

2
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:34,992
 An adult over 18 without criminal record 

3
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:37,562
 is considered a runaway, not a missing person. 

4
00:00:37,562 --> 00:00:40,582
He did it because he studied!

5
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:44,092
Your son called the embassy himself.

6
00:00:44,092 --> 00:00:45,622
He asked us not to look for him anymore.

7
00:00:45,622 --> 00:00:48,322
 I sent a resume with the same qualifications as Lee Dong Jae. 

8
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:49,622
 And they responded within a day. 

9
00:00:49,622 --> 00:00:54,192
 Did he wander around with this in a foreign country looking for his son for over 10 months? 

10
00:00:54,192 --> 00:00:58,242
I'm sure Mr. Jang and Mr. Kim are onto something together.

11
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:03,402
Are you telling us...

12
00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:05,692
to make illegal gambling programs, by chance?

13
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:06,962
Shit!

14
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:12,692
Okay, let's go to your rooms

15
00:01:12,692 --> 00:01:15,812
and start studying!

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,800


17
00:01:43,582 --> 00:01:45,122
Gosh.

18
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:50,802
 

19
00:01:52,832 --> 00:01:55,122
 

20
00:01:56,522 --> 00:01:57,812
 Mr. Jang. 

21
00:01:57,812 --> 00:01:59,872
I'm sure I told you not to call me.

22
00:01:59,872 --> 00:02:02,172
 Do you see the white button next to the monitor? 

23
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:04,512
 - You just need to press that.
 - Huh?

24
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:08,092
The white button. You need to press that to properly operate it.

25
00:02:10,282 --> 00:02:11,502
 Did you press it? 

26
00:02:11,502 --> 00:02:14,242
Yeah, but it's not working.

27
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:16,642
What are you doing in my seat, Mr. Jang?

28
00:02:16,642 --> 00:02:20,572
Huh? Oh, I'm in the office right now.

29
00:02:20,572 --> 00:02:21,792
You're not in the office.

30
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:24,212
You're sitting in my seat right now-

31
00:02:36,012 --> 00:02:38,392
 

32
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:41,892
 
We are in charge of Lee Dong Jae's case,

33
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:43,712
but why do you ask?

34
00:02:43,712 --> 00:02:45,922
Could we make copies of the documents?

35
00:02:45,922 --> 00:02:48,032
That's going to be difficult.

36
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:54,322
Then please briefly show it to us here.

37
00:02:54,322 --> 00:02:57,452
I'm sorry, but I can't do that without the Chief's permission.

38
00:02:57,452 --> 00:03:00,122
- When will the Chief be back?
- He's on vacation.

39
00:03:00,122 --> 00:03:03,422
Oh, we just need to confirm something. We implore you.

40
00:03:03,422 --> 00:03:04,842
Who are you two?

41
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:07,262
Are you lawyers or something?

42
00:03:07,262 --> 00:03:09,202
Oh, well...

43
00:03:13,602 --> 00:03:16,742
If I were a lawyer, would I be able to see them?

44
00:03:16,742 --> 00:03:19,472
Think of me as a lawyer, and let me see them for a moment.

45
00:03:19,472 --> 00:03:21,462
Geez, what the hell?

46
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:23,412
Excuse me, Ahjussi!

47
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,582
Just show it to us. I'll permit it.

48
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:28,802
And who are you?

49
00:03:28,802 --> 00:03:29,872
Who...

50
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:30,872
Me...

51
00:03:30,872 --> 00:03:32,682
Who am I?

52
00:03:32,682 --> 00:03:34,752
You're asking who I am?

53
00:03:34,752 --> 00:03:37,022
Huh? Haeundae...

54
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:39,682
- You're making trouble for yourself!
- Hyungnim.

55
00:03:39,682 --> 00:03:43,752
I had a meal with your Head Chief just last week!

56
00:03:43,752 --> 00:03:46,112
How dare you not recognize the Haeundae Dolphin?

57
00:03:46,112 --> 00:03:48,092
Come out, Head Chief!

58
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:51,222
Come out, Head Chief!

59
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:57,282
I also eat with the Head Chief every day.

60
00:03:57,282 --> 00:03:59,482
In the cafeteria.

61
00:04:03,092 --> 00:04:04,462
Hyungnim...

62
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:06,972
You snatched it, right?

63
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:10,332
You did all that for this?

64
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:11,762
Take good care of it.

65
00:04:11,762 --> 00:04:14,052
May my sacrifice not be in vain.

66
00:04:14,052 --> 00:04:15,982
All right?

67
00:04:17,192 --> 00:04:20,132
When did you manage to snatch this? Gosh.

68
00:04:20,132 --> 00:04:23,512
Wait, Detective... Wait, wait... please...

69
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:32,142
Don't worry. You'll be released in a few days.

70
00:04:32,202 --> 00:04:36,402
And I already took photos of everything inside.

71
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:40,792
When did you take these?

72
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:42,362
While you were talking to that detective.

73
00:04:42,362 --> 00:04:44,192
Why are you telling me this now?

74
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:48,802
I-If you had stopped me from causing a scene, I wouldn't be in here right now...

75
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,582
I didn't know you'd go that far.

76
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,342
Go, you jerk. Let's break up.

77
00:04:53,342 --> 00:04:55,512
You're worse than them, jerk.

78
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:57,792
- Hyungnim.
- Go!

79
00:04:57,792 --> 00:04:59,292
Call me when you're released.

80
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:02,112
Should I buy you some sashik*?
(Food brought for an inmate from outside)

81
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:12,572
Read the book and work hard.

82
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,092
This is basically prison.

83
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,692
 
 

84
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:44,962
 

85
00:05:45,602 --> 00:05:47,342
 Help me. 

86
00:05:47,342 --> 00:05:49,782
 I want to live. 

87
00:05:50,732 --> 00:05:54,282
 I want to go home. 

88
00:05:55,882 --> 00:05:57,792
 
 

89
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:08,352
 

90
00:06:27,422 --> 00:06:29,412
 Please don't kill me. 

91
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:32,142
 Help me... 

92
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,782
 Don't kill me... 

93
00:06:34,842 --> 00:06:37,062
- Please don't kill me.
- Walk properly-

94
00:06:40,522 --> 00:06:43,552
Gosh, a big guy like you...

95
00:06:43,552 --> 00:06:45,322
What are you doing?

96
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,792
- Hey!
- Did he leave?

97
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:52,572
 He ran away, but they're not chasing him. 

98
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:22,612
 

99
00:07:23,802 --> 00:07:25,602
Excuse me!

100
00:07:25,602 --> 00:07:27,362
 
Excuse me!

101
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:30,162
Please contact the Korean Embassy for me.

102
00:07:30,162 --> 00:07:31,872
Korean Embassy, Korean Embassy.

103
00:07:31,872 --> 00:07:33,642
Dad!

104
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:36,232
What? What is it?

105
00:07:36,232 --> 00:07:37,292
Who are you?

106
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:38,992
- Please help me!
- Who are you?

107
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:42,032
I've been abducted. Please contact the Korean Embassy for me.

108
00:07:42,032 --> 00:07:43,362
- Abducted?
- Yes.

109
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,002
Calm down and have a seat.

110
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:48,322
I'll call the embassy right away.

111
00:07:48,322 --> 00:07:50,102
Some water. Water!

112
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:53,232
You could've been in big trouble.

113
00:07:56,702 --> 00:08:00,262
Why are the monitors frozen now?

114
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:02,042
Geez!

115
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:17,822
Geez!

116
00:08:19,422 --> 00:08:21,122
Gosh...

117
00:08:24,102 --> 00:08:26,682
What's going on?

118
00:08:26,682 --> 00:08:28,512
Go Eun.

119
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:36,642
It's almost time for our flight. Where is this guy?

120
00:08:39,342 --> 00:08:42,542
Hyungnim! You should've told me you were here.

121
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:44,212
I was worried something had happened to you.

122
00:08:44,212 --> 00:08:46,802
Shut it. You didn't tell me, either. I'm getting revenge.

123
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:48,362
All right, whatever.

124
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,252
You brought all the files, right?

125
00:08:52,102 --> 00:08:54,842
But is it right for us to go?

126
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:57,652
Can't you tell by now?

127
00:08:57,652 --> 00:09:00,002
Mr. Kim Do Gi is over there by himself.

128
00:09:00,002 --> 00:09:01,942
No one knows what might happen to him.

129
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,842
Will we be able to find Mr. Kim Do Gi?

130
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:06,252
We must find him!

131
00:09:06,252 --> 00:09:08,302
Think about him being abducted by the bad guys,

132
00:09:08,302 --> 00:09:10,682
getting his things stolen and starving.

133
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:13,842
You'd want to hurry and go help him, right?

134
00:09:13,842 --> 00:09:15,062
You have a plan, right?

135
00:09:15,062 --> 00:09:18,862
We'll discuss the details on the plane. Let's go.

136
00:10:06,302 --> 00:10:07,922
Get up.

137
00:10:07,922 --> 00:10:09,082
You little shit.

138
00:10:09,082 --> 00:10:11,582
- Get up, you bastard!
- I don't have anything.

139
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:13,722
Hey, you get up, too.

140
00:10:14,802 --> 00:10:17,462
You always tell us to get up when we play poker.

141
00:10:18,432 --> 00:10:21,162
Shit, these damn beers are always lukewarm.

142
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,532
Hey, bring back some soju the next time you go to Korea.

143
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:27,112
Soju? Man, I'm getting homesick.

144
00:10:27,112 --> 00:10:29,672
Hyungnim, can't we just return to Korea?

145
00:10:29,702 --> 00:10:34,402
From what I hear, a lot of the voice phishing guys are returning to Korea.

146
00:10:34,412 --> 00:10:36,112
You think we're the same as them?

147
00:10:36,112 --> 00:10:39,002
The guys who phish just need to make a hit-and-run,

148
00:10:39,002 --> 00:10:41,042
but we operate all day.

149
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:42,932
You want to hand yourself in?

150
00:10:42,932 --> 00:10:45,322
Hyungnim, have you heard the news?

151
00:10:45,322 --> 00:10:48,452
The website Hyung Tae hyung's people made was a huge hit.

152
00:10:48,452 --> 00:10:49,982
They easily hit 300.

153
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,172
Gosh, 300? I'm jealous.

154
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:57,472
Only if Hyungnim hadn't blown over what we almost finished, we'd also be-

155
00:10:57,472 --> 00:10:59,472
Why are you bringing that up again, you bastard?

156
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:01,802
I'm just upset about it. So upset...

157
00:11:01,802 --> 00:11:05,232
- Come on, your turn.
- Hey, come here.

158
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,572
- You're upset, huh?
- I'm sorry.

159
00:11:07,572 --> 00:11:10,472
- I feel so f***ing bad. What to do?
- Aigoo, Hyungnim.

160
00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:11,832
In regards to the guide,

161
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:15,492
shouldn't we at least give that asshole some side money?

162
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:18,602
I feel like he's only delivering losers to us.

163
00:11:18,602 --> 00:11:21,512
Whatever! I have a full house!

164
00:11:24,882 --> 00:11:27,602
That must be Doo Shik hyungnim.

165
00:11:27,602 --> 00:11:29,532
Hey, let's go!

166
00:11:41,382 --> 00:11:44,572
Who left the window open?

167
00:11:52,932 --> 00:11:53,972
You're here, Hyungnim?

168
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:55,272
What took you so long?

169
00:11:55,272 --> 00:11:58,612
Take better care of the newbies, Sang Man, you bastard!

170
00:12:22,772 --> 00:12:25,952
Tomorrow, make sure he can never use one of his ankles again.

171
00:12:26,852 --> 00:12:28,852
Make an example out of him.

172
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:30,942
Sleep tight.

173
00:12:31,002 --> 00:12:35,402
You should sleep like this, so you'll hurt less from lack of circulation tomorrow.

174
00:12:47,202 --> 00:12:49,552
- Mr. Jang, can you hear me?
 - Oh, no. 

175
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:53,272
 Mr. Jang isn't here right now. He ran away earlier. 

176
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,032
Go Eun?

177
00:12:55,032 --> 00:12:57,562
It's been a while since I heard your voice.

178
00:12:57,562 --> 00:13:01,142
What happened? I heard he couldn't reach you.

179
00:13:01,142 --> 00:13:02,542
I'm okay now.

180
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:05,982
You went there because of Lee Dong Jae, right?

181
00:13:05,982 --> 00:13:10,082
There's no fooling you, Go Eun.

182
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:12,592
You're sure you're all right?

183
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:17,402
 You confirmed I'm fine, right? 

184
00:13:19,942 --> 00:13:22,592
But where exactly are you, Mr. Kim?

185
00:13:22,592 --> 00:13:24,222
You were able to reach Mr. Kim?

186
00:13:24,222 --> 00:13:25,732
Yes.

187
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:30,862
From the start, their objective was to create illegal gambling programs.

188
00:13:30,862 --> 00:13:33,222
Since it's not easy to do in Korea.

189
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:34,682
Using employment as bait,

190
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:37,692
they were luring engineering students abroad.

191
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,662
If these guys are making illegal gambling programs,

192
00:13:40,662 --> 00:13:43,722
it's likely they're working as a branched organization.

193
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:47,162
 What you saw so far isn't all there is to it. 

194
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:50,272
 The website Hyung Tae hyung's people made was a huge hit. 

195
00:13:50,272 --> 00:13:52,852
 They easily hit 300. 

196
00:13:52,902 --> 00:13:56,792
Right, were you able to obtain information about Mr. Lee Dong Jae?

197
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:59,102
Not yet. I'll look into it further.

198
00:13:59,102 --> 00:14:01,172
 It'll be more dangerous than we think. 

199
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:04,152
How about returning for now and going back fully equipped?

200
00:14:04,152 --> 00:14:05,502
I also agree with that.

201
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:07,832
The situation is more grisly than expected.

202
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:11,392
I can't just leave behind the people I came here with.

203
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:15,622
If I do that, the people here will be in greater danger.

204
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:18,842
What are you planning to do by yourself?

205
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:22,082
Can you send me a program source?

206
00:14:22,082 --> 00:14:24,422
That's not difficult.

207
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:27,362
Give me a moment.

208
00:14:27,362 --> 00:14:29,302
 I think we need to hurry. 

209
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:34,472
I can't guarantee how much longer Mr. Lee Dong Jae can last...

210
00:14:34,472 --> 00:14:37,292
in a place like this.

211
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:49,902
 

212
00:15:10,632 --> 00:15:12,422
It's here.

213
00:15:13,772 --> 00:15:15,432
Are you sure?

214
00:15:16,322 --> 00:15:20,242
Look at the map. The name is the same.

215
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:24,082
Whoa, Hyungnim. You know Vietnamese?

216
00:15:24,082 --> 00:15:26,252
Isn't that English?

217
00:15:26,252 --> 00:15:27,692
Let's go in.

218
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:30,572
Something's bound to come up.

219
00:16:05,142 --> 00:16:06,982
Did that bastard arrive?

220
00:16:06,982 --> 00:16:09,362
Yes, he's on his way.

221
00:16:22,302 --> 00:16:24,282
Please don't kill me, Madam Lim.

222
00:16:24,282 --> 00:16:26,172
Madam Lim!

223
00:16:26,172 --> 00:16:28,212
You bumbling dumbass,

224
00:16:28,212 --> 00:16:30,242
did you think you could deceive me?

225
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:32,182
I won't do it ever again.

226
00:16:32,182 --> 00:16:35,532
I'll... never...

227
00:16:35,532 --> 00:16:37,822
trust a f***ing man.

228
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:41,482
Go to his house and take anything worth money.

229
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:42,952
And...

230
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:44,432
get rid of him.

231
00:16:44,432 --> 00:16:45,982
Understood.

232
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:56,742
Hyungnim, what have we gotten ourselves into?

233
00:16:56,742 --> 00:16:58,192
What's that woman doing here?

234
00:16:58,192 --> 00:16:59,742
I don't know, either.

235
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:02,582
Give me the map. I'll take a look.

236
00:17:02,582 --> 00:17:04,392
Good idea.

237
00:17:04,392 --> 00:17:05,882
That's a good idea...

238
00:17:05,882 --> 00:17:08,702
but I left everything over there.

239
00:17:08,702 --> 00:17:09,882
Our belongings?

240
00:17:09,882 --> 00:17:12,532
- Everything?
- Yeah, money and everything else.

241
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,182
- You should go and retrieve-
- You're crazy!

242
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:20,012
Let's just go. The map is in my head, so...

243
00:17:20,012 --> 00:17:21,572
let's go as soon as possible.

244
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:24,262
Wait, Hyungnim. Can I really trust you?

245
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:27,852
Hurry! Mr. Kim Do Gi is in danger.

246
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:33,392
Hurry!

247
00:17:43,682 --> 00:17:45,242
Good morning.

248
00:17:45,242 --> 00:17:47,972
Did you do your homework?

249
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:52,702
The atmosphere in this room is quite different.

250
00:17:52,702 --> 00:17:54,772
What are you doing?

251
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:57,202
The air quality here is quite nice.

252
00:17:57,202 --> 00:18:00,042
Perhaps that's why I slept like a baby.

253
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,302
I think this asshole is making fun of me.

254
00:18:02,302 --> 00:18:03,712
I'm not imagining it, right?

255
00:18:03,712 --> 00:18:05,972
Hyungnim, look at this.

256
00:18:05,972 --> 00:18:08,042
- What?
- This...

257
00:18:10,402 --> 00:18:13,292
 

258
00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:16,282
Whoa!

259
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:17,592
Did you...

260
00:18:17,592 --> 00:18:20,022
Did you make this?

261
00:18:20,022 --> 00:18:23,352
It's still incomplete, so you shouldn't just touch any keys.

262
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:27,062
Whoa, H-Hyungnim, this is daebak. We should tell Doo Shik h-hyungnim.

263
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:29,242
This bastard!

264
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:32,562
Holy shit! Don't touch it, you punk.

265
00:18:32,562 --> 00:18:35,332
- Look at the colors.
- Your eyes...

266
00:18:35,332 --> 00:18:38,572
- Wow.
- Look at those colors.

267
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:40,482
 

268
00:18:40,482 --> 00:18:43,502
It's a huge hit, Hyungnim!

269
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:52,142
Looks good.

270
00:18:52,142 --> 00:18:53,602
 

271
00:18:54,692 --> 00:18:56,622
You programmed this?

272
00:18:56,622 --> 00:18:58,712
You think I bought it from the deli?

273
00:18:58,712 --> 00:19:01,262
You didn't even let me leave.

274
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,772
What a funny bastard.

275
00:19:04,772 --> 00:19:07,342
I came here because I didn't want to do stuff like this.

276
00:19:07,342 --> 00:19:09,782
But here I am again. Gosh!

277
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,042
Just my luck.

278
00:19:11,042 --> 00:19:12,832
You've made something like this before?

279
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:15,242
Yes, briefly at my previous company.

280
00:19:15,242 --> 00:19:16,272
Previously where?

281
00:19:16,272 --> 00:19:18,312
Someplace called U Data.

282
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:19,952
U Data?

283
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:22,322
U-U... Oh!

284
00:19:22,322 --> 00:19:23,912
U Data!

285
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:27,682
The CEO died in an explosion, though.

286
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:30,182
Hey.

287
00:19:30,182 --> 00:19:32,182
It's not working.

288
00:19:33,182 --> 00:19:34,872
Huh?

289
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:38,682
That's weird. It was working fine just now.

290
00:19:38,682 --> 00:19:40,352
F... F... Hey!

291
00:19:40,352 --> 00:19:41,792
Refresh...

292
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:44,132
Hey! Why isn't it working?

293
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:47,142
What are you saying? It has been working fine until now.

294
00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:48,592
Look!

295
00:19:48,592 --> 00:19:50,552
It's not working.

296
00:19:55,642 --> 00:19:57,772
What did you touch?

297
00:19:57,772 --> 00:20:01,632
I didn't touch anything, you bastard.

298
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:04,372
A couple of the key codes have been erased.

299
00:20:04,372 --> 00:20:07,222
D-Did you intentionally erase them?

300
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:08,282
This asshole!

301
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:10,662
Why would I erase it, asshole?

302
00:20:10,662 --> 00:20:13,342
Gosh, I poured my heart and soul into this!

303
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:14,532
Honestly...

304
00:20:14,532 --> 00:20:17,632
We're not lying. This was working just fine until now, Hyungnim.

305
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:19,002
Yes, I also saw it myself.

306
00:20:19,002 --> 00:20:20,902
You erased this on purpose!

307
00:20:20,902 --> 00:20:22,002
Compensate me!

308
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:23,432
Compensate me, damn it!

309
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:24,962
How dare you talk back?

310
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:27,352
I ought to-

311
00:20:34,472 --> 00:20:37,032
Look here, funny buddy.

312
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:39,572
Remake the program.

313
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,102
Okay.

314
00:20:42,102 --> 00:20:44,902
What did I tell you to do?

315
00:20:44,902 --> 00:20:46,352
Sorry? Oh.

316
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:52,012
I'll prepare the example case.

317
00:20:53,142 --> 00:20:55,292
Move, asshole.

318
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:01,802
Sit him down.

319
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,392
Why are you doing this?

320
00:21:05,802 --> 00:21:07,902
I'm sorry.

321
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:09,782
Hey, hold him still.

322
00:21:09,782 --> 00:21:10,712
Watch your head.

323
00:21:10,712 --> 00:21:12,492
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

324
00:21:12,502 --> 00:21:16,302
We're doing this to teach you not to run away and work diligently.

325
00:21:16,322 --> 00:21:17,662
Got it?

326
00:21:17,662 --> 00:21:19,662
Let me know if you need anything.

327
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:23,032
I won't run away again. Please forgive me! I'm sorry!

328
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:26,422
In one blow!

329
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,012
Shit.

330
00:21:32,012 --> 00:21:34,392
You want to die, asshole?

331
00:21:34,392 --> 00:21:37,232
You said to ask if I need anything.

332
00:21:38,602 --> 00:21:42,092
These two people! They are graphic designers.

333
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:45,742
It'll take me forever to complete it on my own.

334
00:21:45,742 --> 00:21:48,322
I can't do this. With what time?

335
00:21:48,322 --> 00:21:50,952
No, I won't do it. I mean, that's...

336
00:21:50,952 --> 00:21:52,652
I can't do it even if you beat me to a pulp!

337
00:21:52,652 --> 00:21:54,362
What a rude bastard.

338
00:21:54,362 --> 00:21:55,672
Hey!

339
00:21:56,612 --> 00:21:58,652
Forget it. Let him go.

340
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:00,062
Hyungnim!

341
00:22:00,062 --> 00:22:02,292
Give him everything he needs.

342
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:04,972
I must keep my promise, too.

343
00:22:04,972 --> 00:22:06,502
Shit!

344
00:22:07,912 --> 00:22:10,562
Everyone, go do what you need to do.

345
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:13,232
And you stay behind.

346
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:14,812
Just me?

347
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,312
Get up.

348
00:22:18,312 --> 00:22:19,702
Follow them.

349
00:22:19,702 --> 00:22:22,232
Go on. Hurry up!

350
00:22:30,952 --> 00:22:34,452
There was that last incident, too.

351
00:22:34,502 --> 00:22:37,202
- Are you trying to be funny?
- I'm not, Hyungnim.

352
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:39,402
I wasn't doing anything funny, Hyungnim!

353
00:22:39,402 --> 00:22:41,702
- Why did you do it?
- I didn't, Hyungnim!

354
00:22:41,712 --> 00:22:44,102
It's a misunderstanding, Hyungnim!

355
00:22:47,302 --> 00:22:48,572
This way.

356
00:22:48,572 --> 00:22:49,932
Go inside.

357
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:53,592
- Go in.
- Thank you.

358
00:22:54,622 --> 00:22:56,962
Aigoo, you're going home now?

359
00:22:56,962 --> 00:22:58,882
Good for you.

360
00:22:58,882 --> 00:23:00,872
You can go back to Korea like them, too.

361
00:23:00,872 --> 00:23:02,762
So keep at it, okay?

362
00:23:02,762 --> 00:23:03,702
Go on.

363
00:23:04,502 --> 00:23:08,002
Take care. Hey, don't forget your stuff.

364
00:23:08,002 --> 00:23:09,242
Someone's really excited.

365
00:23:09,242 --> 00:23:12,142
All right, let's go inside.

366
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:15,202
Everyone will eat, sleep, and program here together.

367
00:23:15,202 --> 00:23:16,102
Fighting!

368
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:16,892
Fighting!

369
00:23:16,892 --> 00:23:18,572
Good, good.

370
00:23:23,412 --> 00:23:25,132
Are you okay?

371
00:23:25,132 --> 00:23:26,852
I just...

372
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:29,892
came because I got employed.

373
00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:33,462
Don't worry.

374
00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:36,082
We can all safely return home.

375
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:37,572
For that to happen,

376
00:23:37,572 --> 00:23:41,032
you two need to help me.

377
00:23:46,352 --> 00:23:48,742
- I'll go and bring my equipment.
- Wait, wait!

378
00:23:48,742 --> 00:23:51,122
Have a cup of coffee first.

379
00:23:53,102 --> 00:23:55,652
- Thank you.
- Sure.

380
00:23:55,652 --> 00:23:57,222
Now that I think about it,

381
00:23:57,222 --> 00:24:02,512
it's been a while, and I didn't even ask how you've been.

382
00:24:02,512 --> 00:24:04,612
You've been at this with Mr. Kim Do Gi all this time.

383
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:07,512
Why didn't you contact me?

384
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,042
Well,

385
00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:11,782
I thought you were living a good life.

386
00:24:11,782 --> 00:24:13,222
No...

387
00:24:13,222 --> 00:24:15,382
I wanted you to.

388
00:24:15,382 --> 00:24:17,982
It's been a while since I drank your coffee.

389
00:24:17,982 --> 00:24:19,452
It's good, huh?

390
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,132
It's delicious.

391
00:24:24,802 --> 00:24:29,582
I wonder what Mr. Park and Mr. Choi are up to that I can't reach them.

392
00:24:29,582 --> 00:24:31,952
Aigoo, don't contact them.

393
00:24:31,952 --> 00:24:35,012
They're probably living their lives, clueless about all this.

394
00:24:35,012 --> 00:24:36,952
They both knew.

395
00:24:36,952 --> 00:24:38,922
They came to see me recently.

396
00:24:38,922 --> 00:24:40,232
Oh, really?

397
00:24:40,232 --> 00:24:43,242
Then where are those two right now?

398
00:24:45,072 --> 00:24:46,362
Hyungnim,

399
00:24:47,192 --> 00:24:49,552
where are we going?

400
00:24:49,552 --> 00:24:52,482
Are you sure we're going to meet Mr. Kim Do Gi?

401
00:24:52,482 --> 00:24:54,682
To be honest, I don't know either.

402
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,702
Let's get off at the next stop.

403
00:24:59,102 --> 00:25:00,892
- Hyungnim.
- Yeah.

404
00:25:00,892 --> 00:25:03,232
I'm hungry.

405
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,502
I've been hungry since earlier.

406
00:25:05,502 --> 00:25:07,882
We only have oranges. Are you okay with that?

407
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:10,742
Let's be sure to get off this time when it stops.

408
00:25:53,002 --> 00:25:56,302
That's strange. I'm sure it was working.

409
00:25:57,412 --> 00:26:00,962
Gosh, did I really touch something?

410
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:08,812
Doo Shik, that f***ing thug.

411
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:12,312
 

412
00:26:12,312 --> 00:26:15,092
You just wait until the program is recovered.

413
00:26:18,322 --> 00:26:21,542
Mr. Kim Do Gi, the information is being transferred.

414
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:23,702
Good.

415
00:26:23,702 --> 00:26:27,172
Please look for any information relating to Mr. Lee Dong Jae.

416
00:26:27,172 --> 00:26:29,002
All right.

417
00:26:30,282 --> 00:26:33,102
 And their leader seems to be someone named Kwon Doo Shik. 

418
00:26:33,102 --> 00:26:35,992
 An ex-gang member. 

419
00:26:35,992 --> 00:26:39,282
He's wanted on Interpol for murder charges.

420
00:26:39,282 --> 00:26:40,902
No wonder.

421
00:26:40,902 --> 00:26:44,902
He seemed a bit different from the other guys.

422
00:26:47,162 --> 00:26:50,442
I think the taxi meter is broken.

423
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,862
It's weird.

424
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:54,582
- Where are you from?
- Korean. South.

425
00:26:54,582 --> 00:26:56,432
Oh, Korea.

426
00:26:56,432 --> 00:26:59,382
I know some Korean.

427
00:26:59,382 --> 00:27:02,162
This isn't broken.

428
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,532
This is a premium taxi.

429
00:27:04,532 --> 00:27:07,972
Premium taxis have higher fares.

430
00:27:08,952 --> 00:27:11,502
This is a premium taxi?

431
00:27:11,502 --> 00:27:13,712
I don't think so.

432
00:27:13,712 --> 00:27:16,962
It looks like the driver is different, too.

433
00:27:16,962 --> 00:27:19,532
The fare came out to six million won.

434
00:27:19,532 --> 00:27:22,882
- Pay the fare, you bastard!
- Give it to me!

435
00:28:17,492 --> 00:28:20,362
Mr. Kim Do Gi, is something wrong?

436
00:28:21,272 --> 00:28:22,902
Nothing much.

437
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:25,612
Did you find anything relating to Mr. Lee Dong Jae?

438
00:28:25,612 --> 00:28:27,542
Not yet.

439
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:30,092
Most of the data were just programs.

440
00:28:30,092 --> 00:28:33,272
Programs that are incomplete.

441
00:28:33,272 --> 00:28:36,762
Where do you think all these people went?

442
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:38,722
I don't know where they went,

443
00:28:38,722 --> 00:28:41,012
but they all came here for one reason.

444
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:43,982
"Congratulations on your final acceptance."

445
00:28:43,982 --> 00:28:46,432
 They all came here after receiving that text. 

446
00:28:46,432 --> 00:28:49,232
Young men who came here with dreams.

447
00:28:49,232 --> 00:28:53,052
Who wanted to become sons their parents could be proud of...

448
00:28:53,052 --> 00:28:56,212
Who wanted to have decent jobs.

449
00:28:58,532 --> 00:29:03,492
Were you able to identify the guide from the airport?

450
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,332
That's old news.

451
00:29:05,332 --> 00:29:07,342
He even has two jobs.

452
00:29:07,342 --> 00:29:09,332
I'm from Happy Travels.

453
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:10,912
Have a good rest.

454
00:29:10,912 --> 00:29:12,662
 Thank you. 

455
00:29:26,562 --> 00:29:29,112
Let's go downtown.
(In Vietnamese)

456
00:29:34,612 --> 00:29:36,012
 

457
00:29:41,022 --> 00:29:43,552
Yes, is this the Korean Embassy?

458
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,402
I'm calling you regarding a missing persons report.

459
00:29:46,402 --> 00:29:49,042
My name is Choi Young Jin,

460
00:29:49,042 --> 00:29:51,202
and my identification number is 9-9...

461
00:29:51,202 --> 00:29:53,852
0-5-2-4.

462
00:29:55,862 --> 00:30:00,002
Well, they keep hitting me at home,

463
00:30:00,002 --> 00:30:02,262
so I ran away.

464
00:30:02,262 --> 00:30:04,742
That's right. Domestic violence.

465
00:30:04,742 --> 00:30:07,002
H-Hold on.

466
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:10,022
I don't think this is the right way.

467
00:30:10,022 --> 00:30:11,642
So...

468
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:15,192
I'd rather you not alert my family.

469
00:30:15,192 --> 00:30:18,752
I can now escape from domestic violence,

470
00:30:18,752 --> 00:30:21,542
and leave on a journey to find freedom.

471
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:23,542
Yes, adios.

472
00:30:25,092 --> 00:30:27,412
Hey, is the game still going?

473
00:30:28,512 --> 00:30:31,512
I said I'll be there soon. Wait for me.

474
00:30:32,752 --> 00:30:35,282
I told you, this isn't the right way.

475
00:30:35,282 --> 00:30:37,002
Hey, you want a good beating?

476
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:40,772
Stop, stop! Hey! Please, stop!

477
00:30:51,302 --> 00:30:53,242
What the hell is he doing to me...

478
00:30:55,872 --> 00:30:58,732
This is how you turned missing person reports into runaway cases.

479
00:30:58,802 --> 00:31:02,102
Hey, who the hell are you?

480
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:03,882
Untie me right now!

481
00:31:03,882 --> 00:31:06,392
Where did this person go?

482
00:31:08,632 --> 00:31:10,052
I don't know.

483
00:31:10,052 --> 00:31:12,542
Who is that? Shit...

484
00:31:12,542 --> 00:31:14,332
- Where did you send him?
- Hey.

485
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:17,782
You can't fathom what a scary person I am, can you?

486
00:31:17,782 --> 00:31:19,922
Untie me while I'm telling you nicely.

487
00:31:20,882 --> 00:31:22,232
Hold on.

488
00:31:24,102 --> 00:31:26,002
What the? Where are you going?

489
00:31:27,132 --> 00:31:29,522
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?

490
00:31:38,662 --> 00:31:41,392
Hold on, hold on. I-I-I'll tell you. All right?

491
00:31:41,392 --> 00:31:44,962
All right, sir? Driver, Driver, sir.

492
00:31:46,262 --> 00:31:48,622
Where did you send Lee Dong Jae?

493
00:31:48,622 --> 00:31:50,442
Well, I don't know that.

494
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:54,132
I only delivered the guys to the halfway point. Really.

495
00:31:54,132 --> 00:31:56,452
How many teams are operating here?

496
00:31:56,452 --> 00:31:57,962
About four teams?

497
00:31:57,962 --> 00:31:59,352
F-Five teams?

498
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:01,492
Four teams... wait...

499
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:05,702
They keep expanding and shrinking as they want.

500
00:32:05,702 --> 00:32:09,402
We're only doing as we're ordered by HQ.

501
00:32:09,462 --> 00:32:11,062
- HQ?
- Please let me go.

502
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,002
I'll only tell the truth. I'll be good, sir.

503
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:15,612
Where is the HQ you just spoke of?

504
00:32:15,612 --> 00:32:18,552
How should I know that?

505
00:32:18,552 --> 00:32:21,212
I just get the calls.

506
00:32:21,212 --> 00:32:24,272
I guess I'll have to look into it myself.

507
00:32:24,272 --> 00:32:25,432
Thank you.
(In Vietnamese)

508
00:32:26,142 --> 00:32:27,262
Adios.

509
00:32:28,102 --> 00:32:31,102
Hey... Hey! Hey!

510
00:32:34,392 --> 00:32:35,712
Hey!

511
00:32:35,712 --> 00:32:37,252
You're not really leaving, are you?

512
00:32:37,252 --> 00:32:38,812
Hey! Save me!

513
00:32:38,812 --> 00:32:41,502
Save me!

514
00:32:48,562 --> 00:32:49,972
It's prickly.

515
00:33:07,662 --> 00:33:09,092
Hyungnim,

516
00:33:09,092 --> 00:33:12,142
I think I'm hallucinating now.

517
00:33:12,142 --> 00:33:13,342
Huh?

518
00:33:13,342 --> 00:33:15,362
I think I am, too.

519
00:33:16,212 --> 00:33:18,772
- Whoa, Kim Do Gi hyungnim!
- Mr. Kim Do Gi!

520
00:33:18,772 --> 00:33:20,632
It's Kim Do Gi!

521
00:33:34,948 --> 00:33:36,228
Are you okay?

522
00:33:37,108 --> 00:33:38,778
Are you hurt anywhere?

523
00:33:38,778 --> 00:33:41,468
Have you been eating well?

524
00:33:41,468 --> 00:33:44,048
We came all the way here

525
00:33:44,048 --> 00:33:47,608
just in case something happened to you.

526
00:33:48,508 --> 00:33:52,348
We're here now, so don't worry about a thing!

527
00:33:52,348 --> 00:33:54,158
Don't worry!

528
00:33:58,878 --> 00:34:02,638
 - Too sour. 
- No wonder I couldn't get in touch with them.

529
00:34:02,638 --> 00:34:05,658
When the hell did they go all the way there?

530
00:34:07,008 --> 00:34:08,218
Oh, yeah!

531
00:34:08,218 --> 00:34:11,768
We met Madam Lim on the way here and almost died.

532
00:34:11,768 --> 00:34:15,088
Gosh, just thinking about it gives me the creeps.

533
00:34:15,088 --> 00:34:16,118
Geez.

534
00:34:16,118 --> 00:34:19,538
What the hell is that woman doing here?

535
00:34:19,538 --> 00:34:21,148
Gosh!

536
00:34:31,748 --> 00:34:36,048
It's highly likely Lee Dong Jae is in one of the places they're operating.

537
00:34:36,048 --> 00:34:38,658
We don't know where he's located.

538
00:34:38,658 --> 00:34:41,548
If they keep expanding and shrinking in numbers,

539
00:34:41,548 --> 00:34:44,328
how can we ever find him?

540
00:34:44,328 --> 00:34:45,478
We can't.

541
00:34:45,478 --> 00:34:47,538
We don't even know where he is.

542
00:34:47,538 --> 00:34:49,368
Then?

543
00:34:49,368 --> 00:34:51,148
We need to make them gather in one place.

544
00:34:51,148 --> 00:34:53,618
It's Lady Lim, you scumbags!

545
00:34:53,618 --> 00:34:56,798
You want to fold your business, huh?

546
00:34:56,798 --> 00:35:01,038
Gather all those bastards who are scattered all over in one place?

547
00:35:01,038 --> 00:35:03,648
 Of their own accord? 

548
00:35:03,648 --> 00:35:04,628
Yes.

549
00:35:04,628 --> 00:35:06,628
Are they having a get-together?

550
00:35:06,628 --> 00:35:08,548
How will that be possible?

551
00:35:08,548 --> 00:35:09,928
I'll make it possible.

552
00:35:09,928 --> 00:35:12,058
How will you do that alone?

553
00:35:12,058 --> 00:35:16,008
- I can't do it alone.
 - But you're there alone! 

554
00:35:16,998 --> 00:35:19,468
That's what I thought, too.

555
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:21,148
But I had a reliable helper all along.

556
00:35:21,148 --> 00:35:23,118
Mr. Park and Mr. Choi?

557
00:35:23,138 --> 00:35:28,338
Well, they could be helpful, but...

558
00:36:48,798 --> 00:36:50,378
Hey.

559
00:37:00,948 --> 00:37:02,688
 Who is he? 

560
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:04,448
 Oh, my... 

561
00:37:29,168 --> 00:37:32,908
Wang Tao Chi!

562
00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:54,538
Look into what that man was doing here.

563
00:37:54,548 --> 00:37:56,118
Understood.

564
00:38:00,098 --> 00:38:01,528
Look here.

565
00:38:02,318 --> 00:38:04,108
What was that man doing here just now?

566
00:38:04,108 --> 00:38:07,128
He asked for two cases of alcohol to this location.

567
00:38:09,738 --> 00:38:13,938
He asked for two cases of alcohol to be delivered to this address.

568
00:38:24,108 --> 00:38:27,388
 

569
00:38:31,868 --> 00:38:34,778
 

570
00:38:35,908 --> 00:38:37,678
That scared me.

571
00:39:00,888 --> 00:39:03,918
You stupid thug.

572
00:39:24,938 --> 00:39:26,418
Shit.

573
00:39:28,828 --> 00:39:32,128
Damn it, why isn't the f***ing guide picking up?

574
00:39:32,128 --> 00:39:34,228
Hey, aren't the newbies supposed to arrive today?

575
00:39:34,228 --> 00:39:36,768
I wonder if he got drunk and passed out somewhere again.

576
00:39:36,768 --> 00:39:39,038
He didn't show up at the airport and can't be reached, either.

577
00:39:39,038 --> 00:39:42,158
Gosh, he's pissing me off.

578
00:39:55,138 --> 00:39:56,728
Wait.

579
00:39:59,578 --> 00:40:00,488
Hey.

580
00:40:00,488 --> 00:40:03,028
Binoculars, binoculars, binoculars.

581
00:40:03,028 --> 00:40:05,218
Who the hell are they?

582
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:08,588
Shit.

583
00:40:15,608 --> 00:40:17,918
I think they're heading this way, Hyungnim.

584
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:19,838
Hey, go down and lock the front door!

585
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:21,398
A-All right.

586
00:40:29,238 --> 00:40:31,548
I wonder what Lady Lim...

587
00:40:31,548 --> 00:40:34,198
will think of me.

588
00:40:40,668 --> 00:40:42,778
Wang Tao Chi.

589
00:40:42,778 --> 00:40:47,088
I'm going to rip you into shreds today.

590
00:40:47,088 --> 00:40:48,588
Go!

591
00:40:59,738 --> 00:41:02,028
 

592
00:41:02,678 --> 00:41:05,198
This f***ing...

593
00:41:05,198 --> 00:41:08,038
He definitely got blindsided by those guys before he disappeared.

594
00:41:08,038 --> 00:41:09,078
What should we do, Hyungnim?

595
00:41:09,078 --> 00:41:11,238
Going to HQ. Contact the other teams, too!

596
00:41:11,238 --> 00:41:12,478
The other teams?

597
00:41:12,478 --> 00:41:14,048
If they got the guide,

598
00:41:14,048 --> 00:41:17,018
it's only a matter of time before our organization is exposed!

599
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:21,068
Come on!

600
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:32,708
Hyungnim!

601
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:34,718
Is it okay to head to HQ without the Chairman's permission?

602
00:41:34,718 --> 00:41:36,038
I think we'll get in trouble.

603
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:38,838
It's a hundred times better to get in trouble than get caught by those bastards.

604
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:41,618
Grab the guys and hurry out the back door!

605
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:51,018
By the way, which bastard are we looking for here?

606
00:41:51,038 --> 00:41:55,218
Look for the most handsome bastard here.

607
00:41:55,238 --> 00:41:58,308
Everyone! Look for the most handsome bastard here!

608
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:01,568
 Look for the most handsome bastard here! 

609
00:42:03,118 --> 00:42:05,358
Everyone get out now!

610
00:42:23,808 --> 00:42:25,178
Damn it!

611
00:42:31,918 --> 00:42:33,368
Damn it!

612
00:42:34,778 --> 00:42:35,588
He's not here.

613
00:42:35,588 --> 00:42:37,358
You bastard!

614
00:42:38,438 --> 00:42:43,338
- I think they all fled-
- You useless dumbass!

615
00:43:16,578 --> 00:43:18,118
There was...

616
00:43:19,248 --> 00:43:22,688
something I absolutely needed to ask you.

617
00:43:33,078 --> 00:43:39,438
Wang Tao Chi!

618
00:44:25,808 --> 00:44:28,568
All right, hurry and get off. Hurry and get off!

619
00:44:28,568 --> 00:44:30,218
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

620
00:44:30,218 --> 00:44:32,938
Hurry, hurry, hurry, gosh.

621
00:44:32,938 --> 00:44:34,818
 
Get off.

622
00:44:34,818 --> 00:44:37,888
 I think the other teams have arrived, too. 

623
00:44:40,468 --> 00:44:43,418
Everyone has severe injuries.

624
00:44:43,418 --> 00:44:46,738
What are you looking at, dumbass? Hurry up.

625
00:45:01,348 --> 00:45:03,488
- You slow bastards!
- Hurry up.

626
00:45:03,488 --> 00:45:06,468
Hurry up! Hurry.

627
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,438
 Over here. This is it. 

628
00:45:08,438 --> 00:45:10,278
Round the corner. Get on your knees.

629
00:45:10,278 --> 00:45:13,148
Get on your knees, you bastards! Are you deaf?

630
00:45:13,148 --> 00:45:15,498
Aren't you Korean?

631
00:45:15,498 --> 00:45:18,428
Damn it, it's f***ing hot.

632
00:45:27,528 --> 00:45:29,888
I told you not to come here without permission.

633
00:45:29,888 --> 00:45:32,288
And you even called over the other teams?

634
00:45:32,288 --> 00:45:33,798
I'm sorry.

635
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:35,778
The situation was too urgent.

636
00:45:35,778 --> 00:45:38,608
- You dumbass.
- I'm sorry.

637
00:45:38,608 --> 00:45:41,538
The situation was urgent?

638
00:45:50,728 --> 00:45:54,438
There are so many bad guys in the world.

639
00:46:07,868 --> 00:46:10,998
 It's because that's the rule. 

640
00:46:10,998 --> 00:46:14,738
 If you ignore the rule and cross the line just because you can, 

641
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:18,638
 that makes you a criminal, not an officer. 

642
00:46:21,148 --> 00:46:23,828
I'm sorry for causing such a commotion.

643
00:46:23,828 --> 00:46:26,608
In my opinion,

644
00:46:27,578 --> 00:46:30,728
I think someone set this all up.

645
00:46:31,738 --> 00:46:33,538
To come here.

646
00:46:34,688 --> 00:46:36,628
 Mr. Kim, 

647
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:39,018
that Chairman...

648
00:46:39,018 --> 00:46:41,168
is a policeman.

649
00:46:41,168 --> 00:46:44,418
The chief police assigned to Mr. Lee Dong Jae's case.

650
00:46:46,588 --> 00:46:49,708
 Since he's an adult and refused to be in touch, 

651
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:52,408
 I don't think there's anything more we can do for you. 

652
00:46:52,408 --> 00:46:56,168
 The handwriting analysis says it's the same person. 

653
00:46:58,588 --> 00:47:01,098
There's no harm in being cautious.

654
00:47:01,098 --> 00:47:05,158
If anyone hasn't written a suicide note yet, get one from them...

655
00:47:05,158 --> 00:47:06,988
and get rid of them.

656
00:47:06,988 --> 00:47:09,838
- Understood.
- Bring me something refreshing.

657
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:11,318
Take care, sir!

658
00:47:12,148 --> 00:47:13,328
What are you waiting for?

659
00:47:13,328 --> 00:47:16,138
Hurry up and drag them over! Come on!

660
00:47:16,138 --> 00:47:17,408
Hurry, hurry up.

661
00:47:17,408 --> 00:47:19,048
Can't you hear me? Hurry up!

662
00:47:19,048 --> 00:47:21,868
Shit. What should we do?

663
00:47:27,568 --> 00:47:31,258
Okay, start writing down what I dictate to you.

664
00:47:31,258 --> 00:47:33,658
"I'm miserable."

665
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:38,238
"Goodbye, everyone."

666
00:47:44,348 --> 00:47:46,838
Hey, you're here?

667
00:47:46,838 --> 00:47:49,068
Lucky seven.

668
00:47:49,068 --> 00:47:52,768
Let's take care of seven for now. We can do the rest after dinner.

669
00:47:52,768 --> 00:47:53,818
 Yes, sir. 

670
00:47:53,818 --> 00:47:57,058
Right, the previous ones are still alive, right?

671
00:47:57,058 --> 00:47:59,498
- Yes.
- Get them ready.

672
00:48:01,118 --> 00:48:02,868
Shit...

673
00:48:02,868 --> 00:48:05,008
You call that shoveling?

674
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:06,678
You're not getting anywhere.

675
00:48:06,678 --> 00:48:08,828
Should I take over?

676
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:17,898
 You can't always say you don't know. 

677
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:21,138
 You should learn and figure it out. 

678
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:27,528
Hurry up and write, you bastards!

679
00:48:27,528 --> 00:48:32,338
You came all the way here abroad to live luxurious lives all by yourself!

680
00:48:32,338 --> 00:48:35,718
If you have a conscience, you should at least leave a letter.

681
00:48:35,718 --> 00:48:38,148
Hurry up and write! Damn it!

682
00:48:42,718 --> 00:48:45,348
You selfish pricks.

683
00:48:46,518 --> 00:48:48,508
You're wrong.

684
00:48:50,168 --> 00:48:51,918
What the hell?

685
00:48:53,618 --> 00:48:56,768
Which one of you just talked back?

686
00:49:11,088 --> 00:49:14,218
They didn't come here to live luxurious lives by themselves.

687
00:49:14,218 --> 00:49:16,718
It was because they got employed.

688
00:49:16,718 --> 00:49:20,418
There are many things they want to do for their families when they get paid.

689
00:49:20,418 --> 00:49:21,868
You bastard.

690
00:49:21,868 --> 00:49:23,198
Are you nuts?

691
00:49:24,278 --> 00:49:25,718
There's something like that.

692
00:49:25,718 --> 00:49:27,278
When did you untie...

693
00:49:27,278 --> 00:49:30,018
Bastards like you...

694
00:49:30,018 --> 00:49:33,078
will probably never understand.

695
00:50:18,225 --> 00:50:22,405
What are you waiting for? Kill him!

696
00:50:39,435 --> 00:50:41,875
He's getting away!

697
00:50:47,535 --> 00:50:49,065
Damn it.

698
00:50:50,365 --> 00:50:52,435
Calm down, calm down. I acted on orders.

699
00:50:52,435 --> 00:50:54,325
I only acted on orders.

700
00:51:05,985 --> 00:51:08,425
 

701
00:51:18,415 --> 00:51:21,285
 Aigoo, you're going home now? 

702
00:51:21,285 --> 00:51:23,175
 Good for you. 

703
00:51:28,805 --> 00:51:30,575
Are you all right?

704
00:51:34,795 --> 00:51:37,125
Please take care of the rest.

705
00:51:43,015 --> 00:51:45,485
There's big trouble, Chairman.

706
00:51:46,845 --> 00:51:50,425
All those dumbasses couldn't take care of one guy?

707
00:51:50,425 --> 00:51:52,195
Does that make sense?

708
00:51:53,205 --> 00:51:54,365
Yes, sir.

709
00:51:54,365 --> 00:51:55,805
Move!

710
00:52:46,675 --> 00:52:49,825
Yes, I stashed the money.

711
00:52:49,905 --> 00:52:52,405
Yes, I'll hurry.

712
00:53:10,215 --> 00:53:12,765
Put your hands up! Hands up!

713
00:53:13,745 --> 00:53:15,145
Leave this to us.

714
00:53:15,145 --> 00:53:17,005
Go on!

715
00:53:17,005 --> 00:53:18,685
Thank you.

716
00:53:20,185 --> 00:53:22,005
Hands up!

717
00:53:32,655 --> 00:53:34,185
Hyungnim, what do we do now?

718
00:53:34,185 --> 00:53:36,125
These are just BB guns.

719
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:37,505
Don't shoot.

720
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:38,855
Whatever you do, don't shoot.

721
00:53:38,855 --> 00:53:40,505
- Okay.
- Hands up!

722
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:44,515
 Go Eun, can you hear me? 

723
00:53:44,515 --> 00:53:46,845
 Yes, Mr. Kim Do Gi. 

724
00:53:46,845 --> 00:53:49,505
 We need to figure out where the Chairman went. 

725
00:54:19,805 --> 00:54:21,745
The Chief has been located, Mr. Kim.

726
00:54:21,745 --> 00:54:24,565
He's going toward the amusement park by the end of the river.

727
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:42,245
It's still too far.

728
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:50,245
I'll buy you some time. I think there's a way.

729
00:55:11,855 --> 00:55:13,665
 Mr. Kim Do Gi, 

730
00:55:13,665 --> 00:55:16,135
there's a shortcut to your right.

731
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:30,535
 You're almost there. 

732
00:56:31,525 --> 00:56:33,995
There's nowhere to run on the rooftop.

733
00:56:46,845 --> 00:56:49,045
Who the hell are you, bastard?

734
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:52,615
You must've been very busy. Doing this shit

735
00:56:52,615 --> 00:56:54,545
and carrying out police duties.

736
00:56:54,545 --> 00:56:55,965
You know me?

737
00:56:55,965 --> 00:56:59,815
Don't you feel ashamed of yourself as police?

738
00:57:00,765 --> 00:57:02,485
In Korea,

739
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:06,915
no matter how many criminals you catch, there's utterly no use.

740
00:57:07,815 --> 00:57:09,505
Why?

741
00:57:09,505 --> 00:57:12,995
Because in the end, those criminal bastards live better lives.

742
00:57:12,995 --> 00:57:14,975
What choice does that leave me?

743
00:57:14,975 --> 00:57:18,325
I must take care of my own meal ticket. Don't you agree?

744
00:57:18,405 --> 00:57:23,305
So did you take a look at what comes with your meal ticket?

745
00:57:25,105 --> 00:57:29,205
I can see it contains a corrupt police officer

746
00:57:29,215 --> 00:57:33,385
who committed a crime, concealed the truth, and aged hideously.

747
00:57:33,385 --> 00:57:34,955
Shit.

748
00:57:38,335 --> 00:57:40,675
An old corrupt police officer...

749
00:57:40,675 --> 00:57:42,565
But what to do?

750
00:57:42,565 --> 00:57:44,395
It seems...

751
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:49,105
you will die before I do, even though you're younger.

752
00:58:10,545 --> 00:58:12,465
Mr. Kim Do Gi!

753
00:58:12,465 --> 00:58:14,755
Mr. Kim, are you all right?

754
00:59:09,505 --> 00:59:12,715
 An organization operating a large-scale illegal gambling website overseas 

755
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:15,295
 was arrested locally and transported back to Korea. 

756
00:59:15,295 --> 00:59:18,435
 A considerable number of members were previously active as gang members, 

757
00:59:18,435 --> 00:59:20,945
 who fled abroad to escape murder charges 

758
00:59:20,945 --> 00:59:23,445
 
 and were on the wanted list by Interpol. 

759
00:59:23,445 --> 00:59:25,555
 To operate the illegal gambling websites, 

760
00:59:25,555 --> 00:59:28,285
 they lured young men in their twenties using employment abroad as bait. 

761
00:59:28,305 --> 00:59:29,735
 It is sending quite a shockwave as 

762
00:59:29,735 --> 00:59:33,095
 they were found to abduct, confine, and force them into creating illegal gambling websites. 

763
00:59:33,095 --> 00:59:37,305
 The police have charged these criminals with murder, abduction, assault, and confinement 

764
00:59:37,305 --> 00:59:40,965
 and are currently investigating the details of the case. 

765
00:59:51,985 --> 00:59:53,895
 

766
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:01,255
 

767
01:00:23,685 --> 01:00:25,155
Dad!

768
01:00:30,595 --> 01:00:32,175

769
01:00:32,175 --> 01:00:33,615
Dong Jae!

770
01:00:34,645 --> 01:00:35,685
Dong Jae!

771
01:00:35,685 --> 01:00:38,005

You did great, Go Eun.

Not those words.

Do you have a plan?

I'm going to return to where I belong.

And where is it you belong?

796

Resignation process at work, complete.

- Whoa, what in the world?

- Same here.
- What?

799
01:03:05,055 --> 01:03:06,125
Welcome back.

- You're here?
- You're here.

801
01:03:07,925 --> 01:03:10,485
You should be more timely.

802
01:03:21,775 --> 01:03:23,595
Hello.

803
01:03:23,595 --> 01:03:25,495
Do you know where the office is?

804
01:03:25,495 --> 01:03:26,795
Go up to the second floor.

805
01:03:26,805 --> 01:03:29,405
The second floor? Thank you.

806
01:03:43,485 --> 01:03:47,735
Hello, I'm On Ha Joon, here for my first day at work.

807
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,600
Is anybody there?

808
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,700
Okay, is everyone here?

809
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:55,100
Shall we get started once again?

810
01:03:55,100 --> 01:04:02,700


811
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:06,525
 

812
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:22,055
 Successfully taken care of. 

813
01:04:28,015 --> 01:04:31,275
 I'll look into his identity. 

814

818
01:04:56,005 --> 01:04:58,555
 This time, our client is a bit older. 

819
01:04:58,555 --> 01:05:02,145
 He's doing all kinds of wicked things to grandmas and grandpas. 

820
01:05:02,145 --> 01:05:04,575
 But Grandma thinks of that bastard like her own grandson. 

821
01:05:04,575 --> 01:05:05,685
 Not knowing what a bad guy he is. 

822
01:05:05,685 --> 01:05:07,295
 Can I ask you a different favor? 

823
01:05:07,295 --> 01:05:10,505
 Just by getting this issued, I get tons in commission. 

824
01:05:10,505 --> 01:05:12,695
 - The damage costs are quite a lot.
- Bastards. 

825
01:05:12,695 --> 01:05:16,605
 You have a customer. You're not even going to greet me? 

826
01:05:16,605 --> 01:05:18,995
 Mom, you just need to take it over and die. 

827
01:05:18,995 --> 01:05:19,885
 Number nine! 

828
01:05:19,885 --> 01:05:21,295
 What should we do about these bastards? 

829
01:05:21,295 --> 01:05:23,605
