1
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:30,944
 

2
00:00:34,584 --> 00:00:38,844
 I will not give up! 

3
00:00:38,844 --> 00:00:41,704
 The operating system I built for the Cotaya case was perfect. 

4
00:00:41,704 --> 00:00:42,794
No, don't do that.

5
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:44,904
 It's not a system you can easily crack. 

6
00:00:44,904 --> 00:00:46,774
 But they cracked it and came in. 

7
00:00:46,774 --> 00:00:47,994
What do you know, anyway?

8
00:00:47,994 --> 00:00:49,224
Have you been giving them the money for the treatment all this time?

9
00:00:49,224 --> 00:00:53,054
They're the ones who'll heal me, not the hospital!

10
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:57,284
I hold onto your words of strength. Father...

11
00:00:57,284 --> 00:00:59,504
You want me to pay for what you ate?

12
00:00:59,504 --> 00:01:00,594
Are you kidding right now?

13
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,684
Always watch above your head.

14
00:01:02,684 --> 00:01:04,154
Whoa!

15
00:01:04,154 --> 00:01:06,324
The land is up in the sky.

16
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:13,584
What the?

17
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:15,024
Was there a folk village here?

18
00:01:15,024 --> 00:01:16,934
What's this? What's wrong?

19
00:01:16,934 --> 00:01:19,114
Shit!

20
00:01:19,114 --> 00:01:21,924
Why did the car shut down all of a sudden?

21
00:01:21,924 --> 00:01:23,924
Huh? Now the phone is...
 

22
00:01:29,844 --> 00:01:32,504
Hey, let me use your phone if you have one.

23
00:01:32,504 --> 00:01:35,024
You managed to survive until now.

24
00:01:35,024 --> 00:01:36,404
What?

25
00:01:43,664 --> 00:01:44,774
Hold on. You're that...

26
00:01:44,774 --> 00:01:46,944
You bastard!

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,100
Get lost immediately!

28
00:01:51,100 --> 00:02:03,800


29
00:02:03,854 --> 00:02:07,334
That crafty thing got scared and ran away for now,

30
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:10,094
but I'm sure it'll come back soon...

31
00:02:10,974 --> 00:02:13,714
to take your life away.

32
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:18,044
 

33
00:02:22,854 --> 00:02:25,334
What a crazy cult bastard.

34
00:02:25,334 --> 00:02:27,174
What kind of concept is that?

35
00:02:27,174 --> 00:02:30,604
How will you sell it like that? Geez...

36
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:37,654
He called you a cult, Mr. Kim!

37
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:42,434
Looks like he's lacking faith a lot.

38
00:02:42,434 --> 00:02:44,944
If you lack faith...

39
00:02:44,944 --> 00:02:46,714
you should strengthen it.

40
00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:52,184
 

41
00:02:52,184 --> 00:02:55,394
 

42
00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:06,264
Father.

43
00:03:06,264 --> 00:03:09,644
All done, all done, all done.

44
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:15,454
When?

45
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:18,764
He died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.

46
00:03:18,764 --> 00:03:20,264
How many people witnessed it?

47
00:03:20,264 --> 00:03:21,964
Quite a number of members saw him,

48
00:03:21,964 --> 00:03:24,444
since he collapsed during the service.

49
00:03:24,444 --> 00:03:27,364
All right. You may leave.

50
00:03:30,424 --> 00:03:33,054
You ironed the gown quite well.

51
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:34,804
 Thank you, Father. 

52
00:03:34,804 --> 00:03:37,124
I feel refreshed, thanks to you.

53
00:03:37,124 --> 00:03:42,044
Let's do our best with the power of Pure White.

54
00:03:48,724 --> 00:03:54,974
Brother Lee Jung Joo was a very warm person.

55
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:56,794
Ok Joo Man, you bastard!

56
00:03:56,794 --> 00:03:58,684
You killed my father!

57
00:03:58,684 --> 00:04:00,914
You murderer!

58
00:04:00,914 --> 00:04:02,734
- Ok Joo Man, you killed him!
- I told him...

59
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:07,494
to return home and spend his remaining time with his family so many times,

60
00:04:07,494 --> 00:04:13,354
but he said he would stay by my side until the end.

61
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:16,254
What have you done?

62
00:04:16,254 --> 00:04:19,844
I prayed for him to get better.

63
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:22,764
To become healthy again.

64
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:27,314
The beneficiary of the late Mr. Lee's life insurance was Pure White Church, not his family.

65
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:28,744
Did you know about this?

66
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:30,894
No.

67
00:04:30,894 --> 00:04:35,754
But the late Mr. Lee did often say this.

68
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:37,994
That he trusts me...

69
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:40,334
more than his family.

70
00:04:40,334 --> 00:04:43,474
Don't lie! You ordered him to!

71
00:04:43,474 --> 00:04:46,844
The late Mr. Lee said...

72
00:04:46,844 --> 00:04:50,474
- that he forgives his children.
- Shut up, you murderer!

73
00:04:51,864 --> 00:04:54,844
Hey, hey, that's enough!

74
00:04:54,844 --> 00:04:57,184
Please calm down.

75
00:04:57,184 --> 00:04:59,864
Those vulgar nobodies.

76
00:05:06,994 --> 00:05:08,734
These are rice cakes.

77
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:23,674
 

78
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:26,804
We should catch that bastard immediately and give him a beating.

79
00:05:26,804 --> 00:05:29,174
Hyungnim is right. Let's teach him a lesson this instant!

80
00:05:29,174 --> 00:05:31,214
Gosh, calm down, you guys.

81
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:33,614
Didn't you hear what Mr. Kim Do Gi said?

82
00:05:33,614 --> 00:05:36,254
This time, Ok Joo Man must step up himself.

83
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:37,814
I don't know. I don't remember.

84
00:05:37,814 --> 00:05:40,124
Come on.

85
00:05:40,124 --> 00:05:41,774
Hold on.

86
00:05:45,164 --> 00:05:47,894
Even if we teach that cult leader a lesson now,

87
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:51,804
as long as the member's faith remains strong, nothing will change.

88
00:05:51,804 --> 00:05:56,084
Mr. Kim's right. We need to shake the roots of their faith.

89
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:59,864
 So calm yourselves down, okay? 

90
00:06:01,504 --> 00:06:03,734
You heard Mr. Jang, right?

91
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:07,844
And the success or failure of this entire case depends on both of your shoulders.

92
00:06:07,844 --> 00:06:11,284
Should you be this riled up or not?

93
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:12,374
We shouldn't.

94
00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:14,934
We already installed everything earlier.

95
00:06:16,624 --> 00:06:18,454
Good job.

96
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:21,374
Aigoo.

97
00:06:21,374 --> 00:06:24,324
Wow, I'm not sure if it's because it's silk,

98
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:27,254
but the color is quite elegant.

99
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:32,484
♫  I'll cross three thousand miles  ♫

100
00:06:32,484 --> 00:06:36,914
♫  Doo, doo, doo, doo  ♫

101
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:39,894
Whoa, shit!

102
00:06:41,054 --> 00:06:42,394
Shit.

103
00:06:43,314 --> 00:06:44,844
What the hell?

104
00:06:50,554 --> 00:06:53,004
That scared me.

105
00:06:56,154 --> 00:07:00,094
Shit, did I see it wrong?

106
00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:02,844
What is this?

107
00:07:06,204 --> 00:07:08,364
Whoa!

108
00:07:08,364 --> 00:07:10,534
Shit, what's wrong with this?

109
00:07:36,904 --> 00:07:38,414
Shit!

110
00:07:44,374 --> 00:07:46,514
F***!

111
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:48,154
Oh, shit!

112
00:07:49,304 --> 00:07:53,664
Shit! I almost died. Oh, shit!

113
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:04,864
There's nothing wrong?

114
00:08:04,864 --> 00:08:07,824
Are you sure it was properly inspected?

115
00:08:07,824 --> 00:08:11,334
I said the brakes and the belt didn't work.

116
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:13,564
I almost died because of that.

117
00:08:13,564 --> 00:08:16,734
After meticulous inspection by our mechanics,

118
00:08:16,734 --> 00:08:19,654
there wasn't a single problem, sir.

119
00:08:19,654 --> 00:08:23,474
And you shouldn't speak informally to me, sir.

120
00:08:23,474 --> 00:08:28,464
Hey, you think I can act all friendly when I almost died? Huh?

121
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:31,224
Anyhow, Korea is just full of con artists.

122
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:34,414
They'll do whatever it takes to fleece their own countrymen out of money.

123
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:37,504
These money-crazed people.

124
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:55,474
Come out... Come out.

125
00:08:55,474 --> 00:08:56,964
Come out!

126
00:08:56,964 --> 00:08:59,404
Oppa! What's wrong?

127
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:01,374
Come out!

128
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,734
Who are you telling to come out?

129
00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:06,934
Someone's there. A bastard wearing a gat* and slitted eyes...
(Traditional Korean hat for men worn by Grim Reapers.)

130
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:09,344
was staring at me.

131
00:09:11,964 --> 00:09:14,404
Nobody's there. What are you saying?

132
00:09:16,074 --> 00:09:20,264
Oppa, you should immediately go to the hospital tomorrow.

133
00:09:20,264 --> 00:09:24,374
They say you can see hallucinations when your body is weak.

134
00:09:27,644 --> 00:09:29,724
What are you doing?

135
00:09:29,724 --> 00:09:31,714
Gosh...

136
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:41,424
If you have specific conditions of the brain, you might see or hear hallucinations,

137
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:44,914
but your general workup is unremarkable.

138
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:52,524
He made such a big fuss about not going to the hospital to the members,

139
00:09:52,524 --> 00:09:56,074
but look at him getting a full workup because he got a little startled.

140
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:58,314
Do you practice a religion?

141
00:09:59,334 --> 00:10:01,334
I don't. I don't believe in anything.

142
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,204
If you don't practice a religion,

143
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:05,454
try picking up a hobby like hiking or fishing.

144
00:10:05,454 --> 00:10:07,304
This could be caused by stress.

145
00:10:07,304 --> 00:10:10,064
Gosh, I get what you're trying to say,

146
00:10:10,064 --> 00:10:15,724
so give me the most expensive IV treatment you have.

147
00:10:15,724 --> 00:10:18,674
Aigoo, I'm dying here...

148
00:10:28,114 --> 00:10:31,134
 Always watch above your head. 

149
00:10:31,134 --> 00:10:35,194
 The land is up in the sky. You're destined to die young. 

150
00:10:39,324 --> 00:10:42,624
 That crafty thing got scared and ran away, for now, 

151
00:10:42,624 --> 00:10:46,044
 but I'm sure it'll come back soon... 

152
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:48,774
 to take your life away. 

153
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:04,034
 He's starting to get a bit nervous now, huh? 

154
00:11:04,034 --> 00:11:08,344
 Father Ok Joo Man is on his way to Mobumdang. 

155
00:11:19,674 --> 00:11:21,934
 

156
00:11:21,934 --> 00:11:22,674
 

157
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:45,874
Did you make a reservation?

158
00:11:45,874 --> 00:11:48,064
I need to make a reservation?

159
00:11:48,064 --> 00:11:51,924
Yes, we run solely on reservations.

160
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:54,424
So when can I see him?

161
00:11:54,424 --> 00:11:56,234
Hold on.

162
00:11:56,234 --> 00:12:01,104
The earliest availability is December 19, 2025.

163
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:03,334
Would you like to reserve that?

164
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:05,204
Shit, 2025?

165
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:08,334
Yes. Oh, my, someone else just reserved it.

166
00:12:08,334 --> 00:12:10,564
Shall I help you make one for 2026?

167
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:11,764
Are you kidding me?

168
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,144
No...

169
00:12:14,924 --> 00:12:17,594
What is all the ruckus?

170
00:12:17,594 --> 00:12:21,984
Some child rudely came to see you without a reservation.

171
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:23,224
Hey,

172
00:12:23,224 --> 00:12:26,314
you and I need to talk.

173
00:12:26,314 --> 00:12:28,174
You wretch.

174
00:12:28,174 --> 00:12:32,474
I see you're still alive, but how dare you cause a disturbance on private property?

175
00:12:32,474 --> 00:12:33,524
What?

176
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:36,894
If he causes another scene, call the police and chase him out.

177
00:12:36,894 --> 00:12:39,034
Yes, Priest Kim.

178
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:41,914
Whoa, hey.

179
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:46,984
Please leave.

180
00:12:46,984 --> 00:12:49,884
You can go back out the way you came. Just drive in reverse.

181
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:54,494
Don't make a U-turn. You'll destroy the grass. Hurry up and leave.

182
00:12:54,494 --> 00:12:55,914
My goodness.

183
00:12:55,914 --> 00:12:59,544
These fools are putting on a show.

184
00:13:06,214 --> 00:13:09,834
P-Please stop doing this.

185
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:13,494
If your unni can't pay back her debt,

186
00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:15,954
shouldn't the younger sister work hard to pay it off?

187
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:19,284
I gave you all the money you asked for.

188
00:13:19,284 --> 00:13:21,614
Our interest rate is quite high.

189
00:13:27,034 --> 00:13:28,714
Did you get hurt anywhere?

190
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:31,184
- Is she the unni?
- She's not.

191
00:13:31,184 --> 00:13:34,664
Did they have permission to come in? They just barged in, didn't they?

192
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:37,044
I didn't want to bother the neighbors,

193
00:13:37,044 --> 00:13:39,854
so I asked them to come in and talk.

194
00:13:39,854 --> 00:13:41,754
Oh...

195
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,614
so you invited them in.

196
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:47,154
Hey, I don't know what your relationship is,

197
00:13:47,154 --> 00:13:51,354
but we're having a legal conversation, so why don't you get lost?

198
00:13:52,574 --> 00:13:54,824
- Tell them to leave now.
- What?

199
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:59,474
You need to give them notice at least three times for it to become trespassing.

200
00:14:03,804 --> 00:14:05,394
Leave.

201
00:14:05,394 --> 00:14:06,934
What?

202
00:14:10,794 --> 00:14:13,104
Leave.

203
00:14:13,104 --> 00:14:15,004
What is this, a joke?

204
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:16,654
Please leave!

205
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:19,564
I was too nice to you-

206
00:14:19,564 --> 00:14:21,044
You bitch-

207
00:14:29,264 --> 00:14:32,264
I totally forgot to return this.

208
00:14:32,264 --> 00:14:35,314
Suing me would be pointless since I was only practicing self-defense.

209
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:39,244
Collections in this manner are illegal, so don't ever come back here.

210
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:42,434
I'm doing my best to hold back and handle this legally.

211
00:14:42,434 --> 00:14:43,944
Is she a cop?

212
00:14:43,944 --> 00:14:45,824
Shit, let's go.

213
00:14:52,984 --> 00:14:54,324
It's okay.

214
00:14:54,324 --> 00:14:56,214
It's okay now.

215
00:15:13,474 --> 00:15:15,104
Hang in there.

216
00:15:15,104 --> 00:15:17,204
Your unni will return without a doubt.

217
00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:20,204
Will she really come back?

218
00:15:20,204 --> 00:15:22,884
Jin Hee, you love your unni.

219
00:15:22,884 --> 00:15:26,494
Your unni feels the same way about you, too.

220
00:15:26,494 --> 00:15:29,854
So let us have some faith.

221
00:15:29,854 --> 00:15:32,404
Faith your unni will return.

222
00:15:32,404 --> 00:15:35,154
How can you be so sure?

223
00:15:36,234 --> 00:15:39,814
Because we're diligently pouring faith, even now.

224
00:15:44,974 --> 00:15:46,904
Good job.

225
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,564
You may leave.

226
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:52,424
Why did you call him here?

227
00:15:52,424 --> 00:15:53,914
I said you may leave.

228
00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:55,314
Understood.

229
00:16:12,594 --> 00:16:15,624
What on earth are you doing?

230
00:16:17,694 --> 00:16:21,294
To meet with you via reservation will be in 2026.

231
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:23,944
I don't really have patience.

232
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:27,884
I've had bad luck ever since I met you.

233
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:32,694
I now know why those crafty things on your shoulder

234
00:16:32,694 --> 00:16:34,804
are being docile.

235
00:16:34,804 --> 00:16:37,314
You know who I am...

236
00:16:37,314 --> 00:16:39,334
don't you?

237
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:40,664
They're waiting.

238
00:16:40,664 --> 00:16:42,314
How long have you been tailing me?

239
00:16:42,314 --> 00:16:44,834
They're simply waiting for their master to return.

240
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:46,654
- Trying to take you away-
- Shit!

241
00:16:46,654 --> 00:16:48,854
It's like I'm talking to a wall.

242
00:16:48,854 --> 00:16:51,534
I'm trying to have a conversation here.

243
00:16:51,534 --> 00:16:54,754
You didn't listen to a single word I said, did you?

244
00:16:54,754 --> 00:16:57,454
Judging by the green in your eyes,

245
00:16:57,454 --> 00:16:59,894
you saw something you shouldn't have.

246
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:03,574
Cut the bullshit and tell me when you started tailing me?

247
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:05,914
You awakened something that should've been left alone...

248
00:17:05,914 --> 00:17:07,704
didn't you?

249
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:11,814
Do you really want to die?

250
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:14,854
You're the one who's going to die!

251
00:17:20,434 --> 00:17:24,134
I usually don't hit people outside of work,

252
00:17:26,384 --> 00:17:28,754
but you'll be an exception.

253
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,924
The thing that's been following you around...

254
00:17:32,924 --> 00:17:36,724
was it wearing a gat?

255
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:39,234
Now we're having a conversation.

256
00:17:39,234 --> 00:17:41,544
Its eyes were sharp,

257
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:45,334
and it had a mouth full of harsh energy.

258
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:48,194
A beating is the best medicine, huh?

259
00:17:48,194 --> 00:17:51,704
You opened your mouth before I even hit you...

260
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,274
Shit.

261
00:17:53,274 --> 00:17:55,164
What's going on?

262
00:17:55,164 --> 00:17:56,724
Yes.

263
00:17:57,624 --> 00:18:00,374
From what I observed,

264
00:18:00,374 --> 00:18:03,634
it doesn't look like it'll give up on you.

265
00:18:03,634 --> 00:18:07,894
Hey, where are you looking? You should be looking at me-

266
00:18:18,374 --> 00:18:21,074
Hurry and untie me.

267
00:18:21,074 --> 00:18:23,474
Now!

268
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,474
Here.

269
00:18:53,294 --> 00:18:56,234
You saw it too, didn't you? What was that?

270
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:58,654
Don't come closer.

271
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:01,374
Speak from there.

272
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,964
What is that thing?

273
00:19:03,964 --> 00:19:07,594
What in the world have you done to attract such a thing?

274
00:19:07,594 --> 00:19:09,164
You wretch.

275
00:19:09,164 --> 00:19:10,604
What have you disturbed?

276
00:19:10,604 --> 00:19:13,584
Gosh, what are you going on about? I didn't disturb anything!

277
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:15,104
What did I disturb?

278
00:19:15,104 --> 00:19:16,854
Why are you asking me

279
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:18,244
when you're the one who disturbed it?

280
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:20,454
What did I...

281
00:19:22,724 --> 00:19:24,324
disturb?

282
00:19:33,044 --> 00:19:37,314
You didn't just disturb it. You destroyed it.

283
00:19:39,534 --> 00:19:42,194
I wouldn't step on that if I were you.

284
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:43,964
Shit.

285
00:20:02,694 --> 00:20:05,284
He has the face of a national traitor.

286
00:20:06,264 --> 00:20:10,514
I can feel the murderous intent just by looking at him.

287
00:20:10,514 --> 00:20:14,044
He's not one to give up...

288
00:20:15,384 --> 00:20:18,144
until you die.

289
00:20:19,304 --> 00:20:20,794
Me?

290
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:44,254
One sheet on a pillar bathed in the morning sunlight.

291
00:20:44,254 --> 00:20:47,194
One sheet on a pillar bathed in moonlight.

292
00:20:47,194 --> 00:20:51,854
And stick one underneath your desk.

293
00:20:51,854 --> 00:20:53,324
Where do you think you're going?

294
00:20:53,324 --> 00:20:57,314
I need to go and get those from him, don't I?

295
00:20:57,314 --> 00:21:00,034
Promise me one thing before that.

296
00:21:00,034 --> 00:21:02,634
Don't come looking for me again.

297
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:05,424
After meeting you,

298
00:21:07,994 --> 00:21:10,384
I've had bad luck.

299
00:21:18,434 --> 00:21:21,794
During the seven days of processing,

300
00:21:21,794 --> 00:21:24,434
don't add to your wealth.

301
00:21:24,434 --> 00:21:26,454
Why not?

302
00:21:26,454 --> 00:21:28,544
It's bad karma.

303
00:21:28,544 --> 00:21:31,944
It's bad karma. It's bad karma.

304
00:21:31,944 --> 00:21:35,214
That's enough. You're making me feel like shit!

305
00:21:35,214 --> 00:21:38,224
Priest Kim drew them for you with his precious time,

306
00:21:38,224 --> 00:21:40,304
so just be thankful.

307
00:21:40,304 --> 00:21:42,264
Bad karma.

308
00:21:42,264 --> 00:21:43,404
Shoo.

309
00:21:43,404 --> 00:21:45,334
That's enough!

310
00:21:58,764 --> 00:22:02,744
Priest Kim, please draw me a talisman, too.

311
00:22:02,744 --> 00:22:05,434
What type of talisman do you want?

312
00:22:05,434 --> 00:22:10,104
Well... wealth, employment, promotion, health,

313
00:22:10,104 --> 00:22:13,014
romance, and marriage. One to cover everything.

314
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:18,274
All things prosperous.

315
00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:25,444
Everything will turn out well.

316
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:36,084
This won't have any effects, gosh.

317
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:50,754
Gosh, my back.

318
00:22:51,964 --> 00:22:54,074
I'm just playing along.

319
00:22:54,074 --> 00:22:56,284
Playing along...

320
00:22:58,954 --> 00:23:01,114
Who is it?

321
00:23:05,424 --> 00:23:07,084
We finished preparing for the service.

322
00:23:07,084 --> 00:23:10,904
Nothing goes according to my liking.

323
00:23:13,054 --> 00:23:14,494
Is something bothering you?

324
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:16,984
Skip the sermon,

325
00:23:16,984 --> 00:23:19,714
and prepare the bleaching.

326
00:23:19,714 --> 00:23:23,274
I'll never give up on the path to Pure White!

327
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:27,634
I'll never give up on the path to Pure White!

328
00:23:27,634 --> 00:23:30,064
I won't give up!

329
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,964
Wait, wait, wait!

330
00:23:35,964 --> 00:23:38,994
Wait, s-so...

331
00:23:38,994 --> 00:23:42,504
I want to be healed first, Father.

332
00:23:44,284 --> 00:23:46,414
Path to Pure White...

333
00:23:46,414 --> 00:23:48,554
Move your hand.

334
00:23:48,554 --> 00:23:51,754
I won't give up on you.

335
00:23:51,754 --> 00:23:53,604
 Father! 

336
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:56,514
 

337
00:23:57,824 --> 00:24:02,204
Look at this! A real grilled chicken.

338
00:24:02,204 --> 00:24:04,024
Cool, isn't it?

339
00:24:05,584 --> 00:24:07,744
Hey, stop crying.

340
00:24:07,744 --> 00:24:10,294
I'll give you all my drumsticks.

341
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:13,564
Really?

342
00:24:20,234 --> 00:24:23,064
 Mr. Choi, Mr. Park, where are you? 

343
00:24:25,524 --> 00:24:27,284
Oh...

344
00:24:27,284 --> 00:24:29,404
we came outside for a bit.

345
00:24:31,314 --> 00:24:33,184
Is Mr. Park okay?

346
00:24:33,184 --> 00:24:35,324
Mr. Park, are you okay?

347
00:24:35,324 --> 00:24:37,044
Mr. Kim Do Gi,

348
00:24:37,044 --> 00:24:39,704
I've never been hit this much in my life.

349
00:24:39,704 --> 00:24:42,094
Who told you to run out and get it?

350
00:24:42,094 --> 00:24:43,554
Then what was I supposed to do?

351
00:24:43,554 --> 00:24:46,914
They already looked sick. How could I just sit and watch them get assaulted?

352
00:24:46,914 --> 00:24:51,004
But Hyungnim, I got hit so much, but it doesn't hurt one bit.

353
00:24:51,004 --> 00:24:53,064
- Strange, isn't it?
 - Mr. Park! 

354
00:24:53,064 --> 00:24:55,714
Did you take that narcotic again? I told you not to.

355
00:24:55,714 --> 00:24:58,764
How could I not when they were all staring at me?

356
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:02,564
More importantly, his demand for money has become more adamant.

357
00:25:02,564 --> 00:25:04,384
To build a castle of Pure White.

358
00:25:04,384 --> 00:25:09,834
Gosh, Priest Kim told him not to seek more wealth, but he didn't listen.

359
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:13,514
Mr. Park and Mr. Choi, let's start plan B.

360
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:16,644
Okay, we're ready.

361
00:25:16,644 --> 00:25:19,604
Hyungnim, aren't you being too passionate about this?

362
00:25:19,604 --> 00:25:23,854
If you'll say useless things like that, just go home. I even gave you my drumsticks.

363
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:29,914
I need to meet with Ok Joo Man's mother.

364
00:25:29,914 --> 00:25:31,884
He'll probably listen to his mom.

365
00:25:31,884 --> 00:25:33,844
Ok Joo Man's mother?

366
00:25:33,844 --> 00:25:36,354
She passed away a long time ago.

367
00:25:38,844 --> 00:25:41,104
Exactly.

368
00:25:41,104 --> 00:25:42,534
Huh?

369
00:25:49,594 --> 00:25:52,414
This is just one speck!

370
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:21,354
F-Father, your clothes...

371
00:26:27,584 --> 00:26:29,504
Huh?

372
00:26:34,664 --> 00:26:37,324
- Leader Baek, kick them all out.
- Excuse me?

373
00:26:37,324 --> 00:26:39,244
Kick out all the members.

374
00:26:39,244 --> 00:26:40,864
Yes, Father.

375
00:26:42,984 --> 00:26:46,614
The service is over! Everyone, leave.

376
00:26:47,904 --> 00:26:50,224
- Please hold me.
- What's going on?

377
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:01,784
Everyone, leave.

378
00:27:03,364 --> 00:27:05,904
The service is over!

379
00:27:31,034 --> 00:27:33,314
What have you done with the talismans I drew you?

380
00:27:33,314 --> 00:27:35,524
Oh, here, here.

381
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,534
Aigoo!

382
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:47,894
Did someone come in here to mess with that?

383
00:27:47,894 --> 00:27:50,294
No, no. No one.

384
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:53,454
No one knows I put it here.

385
00:28:02,634 --> 00:28:06,434
Why did you do that?

386
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:10,374
Oh, I just... did.

387
00:28:12,074 --> 00:28:16,214
A person being aware that they're going to die

388
00:28:16,214 --> 00:28:19,064
isn't always a bad thing.

389
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:23,544
What are you saying? You're upsetting me with your words.

390
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:28,124
This is the money I got from you.

391
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:32,074
Don't look for me anymore.

392
00:28:34,354 --> 00:28:36,804
Hey, how can you just leave like this?

393
00:28:36,804 --> 00:28:39,904
Hey, have some responsibility!

394
00:28:45,704 --> 00:28:47,014
You wretch!

395
00:28:47,014 --> 00:28:50,564
Are you deaf or something? Get lost!

396
00:28:51,774 --> 00:28:53,724
If I just leave, it's over.

397
00:28:53,724 --> 00:28:56,584
You need to do something about those ghosts-

398
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:59,314
It's bad karma. Get lost-

399
00:28:59,314 --> 00:29:03,014
Stop doing this!

400
00:29:03,014 --> 00:29:05,744
My salt! My salt...

401
00:29:07,174 --> 00:29:11,714
All right, if you won't leave, then I will!

402
00:29:11,714 --> 00:29:14,594
Come on.

403
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,414
You wretch...

404
00:29:21,414 --> 00:29:23,614
What have you brought with you?

405
00:29:23,614 --> 00:29:26,144
M-Me?

406
00:29:30,744 --> 00:29:32,484
Hide.

407
00:29:32,484 --> 00:29:35,884
If you don't want to die, hide this instant!

408
00:29:35,884 --> 00:29:37,954
W-Where? Where can I hide?

409
00:29:37,954 --> 00:29:40,884
Where?

410
00:29:48,264 --> 00:29:51,544
This is a sacred sanctuary to worship our god!

411
00:29:51,544 --> 00:29:54,474
If you're a guest, reveal yourself.

412
00:29:54,474 --> 00:29:57,854
If you're an evil spirit, then remove yourself!

413
00:30:31,684 --> 00:30:35,664
If you're a guest... then... reveal yourself...

414
00:30:35,664 --> 00:30:39,394
If you're an evil spirit... then remove-

415
00:30:51,954 --> 00:30:55,654
Hey! Get it together.

416
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,524
Hey!

417
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:35,644
Joo Man.

418
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,834
Joo Man.

419
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:40,944
Where's my Joo Man?

420
00:31:40,944 --> 00:31:42,814
My son.

421
00:31:42,814 --> 00:31:46,734
Won't you come out even when your mom is here?

422
00:31:50,624 --> 00:31:53,064
When Father Ok Joo Man was young,

423
00:31:53,064 --> 00:31:56,244
he really loved the sticky rice cakes his mom bought him.

424
00:31:56,244 --> 00:31:58,124
Sticky rice cakes...

425
00:31:59,254 --> 00:32:03,854
Are you hiding because I didn't bring sticky rice cakes?

426
00:32:04,774 --> 00:32:09,074
I forgot and couldn't buy any today.

427
00:32:09,074 --> 00:32:11,104
I'm sorry.

428
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,494
Mom?

429
00:32:14,494 --> 00:32:16,854
And...

430
00:32:19,764 --> 00:32:24,134
My Joo Man, you even sold our cow behind my back.

431
00:32:24,134 --> 00:32:26,044
Are you scared I'll punish you?

432
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:30,114
I still don't hate you, my Joo Man.

433
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,114
Lies!

434
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:36,304
You told me to go die!

435
00:32:40,004 --> 00:32:42,864
It was because I was upset.

436
00:32:42,864 --> 00:32:47,154
I just want my Joo Man to be healthy.

437
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,784
Really?

438
00:32:53,674 --> 00:32:56,244
Are you really Mom?

439
00:32:57,454 --> 00:32:59,814
My Joo Man...

440
00:32:59,814 --> 00:33:01,374
Mom won't let...

441
00:33:02,344 --> 00:33:05,764
anything bad happen to you.

442
00:33:08,814 --> 00:33:12,104
Joo Man.

443
00:33:12,104 --> 00:33:15,664
It's been tough, right?

444
00:33:17,844 --> 00:33:19,444
My son.

445
00:33:20,534 --> 00:33:23,094
My Joo Man.

446
00:33:23,094 --> 00:33:26,544
You know I love you most in the world, right?

447
00:33:30,984 --> 00:33:33,704
Mom...

448
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:38,934
Joo Man.

449
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,214
Mom will...

450
00:33:41,214 --> 00:33:43,704
never...

451
00:33:43,704 --> 00:33:45,974
give up on my son!

452
00:33:45,974 --> 00:33:48,114
Mom!

453
00:33:48,114 --> 00:33:50,624
Mom...

454
00:34:02,244 --> 00:34:04,114
Good job.

455
00:34:09,804 --> 00:34:12,284
Gosh.

456
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:16,704
I knew you were unlucky the moment I first saw you.

457
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:20,614
What will you do about the damages? Nevermind.

458
00:34:20,614 --> 00:34:23,224
I'm pleading with you.

459
00:34:24,574 --> 00:34:27,164
Don't come back here anymore.

460
00:34:30,674 --> 00:34:33,254
Did Mom write this?

461
00:34:33,254 --> 00:34:36,074
How am I supposed to know what your mom wrote?

462
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,304
I don't know, Punk.

463
00:34:40,304 --> 00:34:42,874
I know what it is.

464
00:34:42,874 --> 00:34:46,724
19510524...

465
00:34:46,724 --> 00:34:48,944
This is Dad's birthday.

466
00:34:50,624 --> 00:34:52,864
The one after that

467
00:34:52,864 --> 00:34:54,914
is Dad's memorial day.

468
00:34:56,574 --> 00:35:00,154
The numbers on the next lines

469
00:35:01,274 --> 00:35:04,934
are Mom's birthday and memorial day.

470
00:35:04,934 --> 00:35:09,194
The numbers on the last line

471
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:11,564
are my birthday.

472
00:35:13,604 --> 00:35:16,344
And the numbers after that...

473
00:35:18,614 --> 00:35:20,264
Then...

474
00:35:20,264 --> 00:35:24,684
your mom must have come to tell you when you die.

475
00:35:24,684 --> 00:35:27,794
The day...

476
00:35:28,764 --> 00:35:30,794
I will die.

477
00:35:32,744 --> 00:35:35,974
If it's the 23rd,

478
00:35:35,974 --> 00:35:38,884
you don't have much time left.

479
00:35:40,484 --> 00:35:42,394
Go on.

480
00:35:42,394 --> 00:35:45,054
Go and spend...

481
00:35:45,054 --> 00:35:48,234
your remaining time with your family.

482
00:35:48,234 --> 00:35:51,244
Priest Kim!

483
00:35:51,244 --> 00:35:57,434
What mom would come to provide the date of her child's death?

484
00:35:57,434 --> 00:36:00,564
She told me, so I could stay alive. To stay alive!

485
00:36:00,564 --> 00:36:02,244
Didn't I tell you to leave?

486
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:07,404
Please... please help me, Priest Kim!

487
00:36:10,614 --> 00:36:12,944
It's like talking to a wall.

488
00:36:12,944 --> 00:36:17,954
I think this punk is requesting a reversal of the fate ritual.

489
00:36:19,074 --> 00:36:22,464
You wretch! Shut your mouth this instant!

490
00:36:22,464 --> 00:36:25,554
Reversal of fate ritual?

491
00:36:25,554 --> 00:36:27,734
Please do that for me.

492
00:36:27,734 --> 00:36:30,894
- Please!
- Do you even know what you're talking about?

493
00:36:30,894 --> 00:36:35,714
A reversal of fate ritual is so dangerous that even I must risk my life.

494
00:36:35,714 --> 00:36:38,654
Why should I risk my life to save someone like you?

495
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,754
I don't want to!

496
00:36:57,534 --> 00:37:02,104
Your mom... must be trying to save you...

497
00:37:02,104 --> 00:37:04,524
and kill me.

498
00:37:04,524 --> 00:37:06,654
I'll do...

499
00:37:06,654 --> 00:37:09,624
whatever you ask of me!

500
00:37:11,844 --> 00:37:13,444
Fine.

501
00:37:14,464 --> 00:37:17,274
I'll do my best...

502
00:37:17,274 --> 00:37:20,364
to keep you alive.

503
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:22,164
Thank you.

504
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:26,744
I won't forget your mercy.

505
00:37:52,924 --> 00:37:55,444
One, two, three.

506
00:38:11,184 --> 00:38:13,364
While preparing for a reversal of fate ritual,

507
00:38:13,364 --> 00:38:18,314
you absolutely must not pray nor greed after wealth.

508
00:38:18,314 --> 00:38:19,794
All right.

509
00:38:25,844 --> 00:38:27,294
Be quiet!

510
00:38:27,294 --> 00:38:30,964
Offerings are off-limits. Don't pay them, don't bring them!

511
00:38:30,964 --> 00:38:32,664
Don't pray, either!

512
00:39:15,344 --> 00:39:17,974
Hwi, hwi, hwi.

513
00:39:17,974 --> 00:39:19,454
Hwi...

514
00:39:21,374 --> 00:39:24,704
Always carry this on your body.

515
00:39:24,704 --> 00:39:28,314
You should never be parted from it.

516
00:39:28,314 --> 00:39:29,944
All right.

517
00:39:35,124 --> 00:39:38,154
Don't be frugal in your spending.

518
00:39:38,154 --> 00:39:42,524
That's how you and I will live.

519
00:39:42,524 --> 00:39:44,334
Yes.

520
00:39:57,354 --> 00:40:01,734
Whoa, Father is rich in cash.

521
00:40:03,044 --> 00:40:08,754
As for instruments, you must bring in the best in the nation.

522
00:40:08,754 --> 00:40:10,224
Yes!

523
00:40:21,244 --> 00:40:23,494
What are you doing?

524
00:40:30,814 --> 00:40:32,584
No take-backs!

525
00:40:32,584 --> 00:40:35,174
Be quiet. That's bad karma.

526
00:40:36,364 --> 00:40:38,814
He's giving us exactly what we asked for.

527
00:40:38,814 --> 00:40:40,874
The thing about faith is...

528
00:40:43,084 --> 00:40:47,394
once it's built, it's game over.

529
00:40:51,934 --> 00:40:52,814
 

530
00:40:56,414 --> 00:40:57,854
 

531
00:40:57,854 --> 00:41:00,104
A mortgage loan?

532
00:41:12,744 --> 00:41:15,314
- Why are they doing that?
- It hurts, it hurts.

533
00:41:15,314 --> 00:41:17,924
I don't know. We're just doing anything that makes money.

534
00:41:17,924 --> 00:41:19,864
Oh.

535
00:41:19,864 --> 00:41:22,994
Nice and tight.

536
00:41:52,824 --> 00:41:54,864
Go away!

537
00:42:01,674 --> 00:42:05,134
Go away! Go away!

538
00:42:41,234 --> 00:42:44,114
Why are you picking up this phone? Who are you?

539
00:42:44,114 --> 00:42:46,034
Where?

540
00:43:30,914 --> 00:43:35,074
Fighting the evil spirit in my heart...

541
00:43:35,074 --> 00:43:40,014
May my lord's Pure White be spread all over the world.

542
00:43:40,014 --> 00:43:42,744
The path of Pure White.

543
00:43:49,484 --> 00:43:52,374
Jin Sun. Jin Sun!

544
00:44:00,894 --> 00:44:02,814
Go away!

545
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:18,094
 Mr. Kim Do Gi, Jin Sun passed out. 

546
00:44:31,634 --> 00:44:35,464
 The more in pain you are, the more Pure White you'll become. 

547
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:39,584
 And frequent the hospital without my knowledge! 

548
00:44:45,864 --> 00:44:47,584
 Jin Hee... 

549
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:51,294
 my condition wasn't able to improve anymore. 

550
00:44:51,294 --> 00:44:54,084
 But then I met him. 

551
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:02,484
 When time passes, you'll also realize 

552
00:45:05,424 --> 00:45:08,374
 how powerful Pure White is. 

553
00:45:11,554 --> 00:45:14,084
Don't you think it left by now?

554
00:45:14,084 --> 00:45:16,524
I think it left.

555
00:45:16,524 --> 00:45:18,744
It left.

556
00:45:41,324 --> 00:45:44,444
Priest Kim, it hurts.

557
00:45:44,444 --> 00:45:46,914
It hurts.

558
00:46:18,194 --> 00:46:20,184
Father called me

559
00:46:20,184 --> 00:46:22,274
and told me to take his place

560
00:46:22,274 --> 00:46:26,994
to lead you to the Land of Pure White.

561
00:46:26,994 --> 00:46:32,094
He passed on the Power of Pure White to me.

562
00:46:32,094 --> 00:46:35,944
I've been blessed by Father, so now I'm the blessed Mother.

563
00:46:35,944 --> 00:46:38,994
Going to more than 60 countries around the world,

564
00:46:38,994 --> 00:46:42,314
we will look for our rightful heaven-

565
00:46:42,314 --> 00:46:44,674
What the hell are you doing right now!

566
00:46:44,674 --> 00:46:46,334
 Father! 

567
00:46:46,334 --> 00:46:49,344
I told you not to gather since it's bad karma.

568
00:46:49,344 --> 00:46:51,984
Why won't you listen? Why?

569
00:46:51,984 --> 00:46:54,144
 Father! 

570
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,684
 Father! 

571
00:46:56,684 --> 00:46:59,944
What are you doing? You're the one following around a cult leader!

572
00:46:59,944 --> 00:47:04,344
Don't insult Priest Kim!

573
00:47:04,344 --> 00:47:09,164
The likes of you will have to wait at least three years to meet him.

574
00:47:09,164 --> 00:47:10,994
Have you gone entirely mad?

575
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,704
Mad?

576
00:47:15,074 --> 00:47:19,464
You can't even memorize the lines I gave you. Mother?

577
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:20,904
Aigoo...

578
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:25,294
Mother... Like hell you are!

579
00:47:25,294 --> 00:47:27,124
Let go of me.

580
00:47:29,234 --> 00:47:31,204
Hey!

581
00:47:32,404 --> 00:47:34,164
Let go!

582
00:47:34,164 --> 00:47:36,104
 Do you practice a religion? 

583
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:39,064
 I don't. I don't believe in anything. 

584
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:43,734
- What's that?
- What did he just say?

585
00:47:43,734 --> 00:47:45,324
 What if they actually die? 

586
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:47,254
 They were about to die anyway. 

587
00:47:47,254 --> 00:47:52,774
 We're not legally at fault at all! 

588
00:47:52,774 --> 00:47:56,434
 I'm sure you'll go to hell, Oppa. 

589
00:47:56,434 --> 00:48:01,204
 Hello? Aigoo! Do you believe in that? What a baby! 

590
00:48:03,704 --> 00:48:05,404
Hey!

591
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:11,874
 Go away! Go away! 

592
00:48:24,054 --> 00:48:28,024
Won't it be pointless to bring them out if they're just going to return?

593
00:48:28,024 --> 00:48:31,954
Yes, unless Ok Joon Man personally tells them to leave.

594
00:48:31,954 --> 00:48:34,604
The cult Father will tell his members to leave with his own mouth?

595
00:48:34,604 --> 00:48:36,324
 Is that possible? 

596
00:48:36,324 --> 00:48:41,794
We must expose him for the human blinded by self-interest that he is.

597
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:44,474
They'll make their own decisions after that.

598
00:48:44,474 --> 00:48:47,084
Whether to stay...

599
00:48:47,084 --> 00:48:49,024
or leave.

600
00:48:58,794 --> 00:49:00,334
Hey!

601
00:49:01,544 --> 00:49:03,734
I told you not to pray.

602
00:49:03,734 --> 00:49:05,814
It's bad karma!

603
00:49:07,174 --> 00:49:10,514
What are you staring at? Kick them all out!

604
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:13,074
All this time!

605
00:49:13,074 --> 00:49:15,194
H-Have you...

606
00:49:15,194 --> 00:49:17,814
been deceiving us all?

607
00:49:17,814 --> 00:49:20,834
- How could you?
- Gosh!

608
00:49:20,834 --> 00:49:22,484
All the money I gave you...

609
00:49:22,484 --> 00:49:24,054
Didn't you hear me?

610
00:49:24,054 --> 00:49:25,474
Kick them all out!

611
00:49:25,474 --> 00:49:27,694
Everything...

612
00:49:29,344 --> 00:49:31,494
was all a lie?

613
00:49:32,524 --> 00:49:34,454
I-I wasn't.

614
00:49:34,454 --> 00:49:37,844
I just did as he ordered me to do!

615
00:49:39,734 --> 00:49:41,304
What?

616
00:49:45,264 --> 00:49:47,504
I...

617
00:49:47,504 --> 00:49:50,594
I'm your Father! You punks.

618
00:49:52,054 --> 00:49:54,934
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

619
00:49:57,484 --> 00:49:59,534
You bastard!

620
00:50:42,684 --> 00:50:46,004
 

621
00:50:51,604 --> 00:50:54,904
Don't worry. She'll come out soon.

622
00:50:54,904 --> 00:50:56,714
They're coming out.

623
00:50:56,714 --> 00:50:59,544
 - Where's Ji Hoon?
- Honey! 

624
00:50:59,544 --> 00:51:01,154
 He's there! 

625
00:51:01,154 --> 00:51:03,694
 - Honey!
- Over there! 

626
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:05,184
 Sang Tae! 

627
00:51:05,184 --> 00:51:06,344
 Mom! 

628
00:51:06,344 --> 00:51:08,224
- Sang Tae!
- Jin Eon!

629
00:51:08,224 --> 00:51:10,294
Hyungnim!

630
00:51:11,544 --> 00:51:13,524
Aigoo, Jin Eon.

631
00:51:14,584 --> 00:51:15,784
There, there.

632
00:51:15,784 --> 00:51:17,574
Good job.

633
00:51:32,264 --> 00:51:34,644
I'm sorry.

634
00:51:40,324 --> 00:51:42,604
Sorry.

635
00:51:42,604 --> 00:51:45,434
Something must've possessed me.

636
00:51:47,044 --> 00:51:54,374
♫  It only takes a moment, just enough to catch my breath  ♫

637
00:51:54,434 --> 00:52:05,434
♫  I just have to lightly fill my stomach and walk again  ♫

638
00:52:05,494 --> 00:52:12,054
♫  It'll be fine, don't worry  ♫

639
00:52:12,134 --> 00:52:21,834
♫  If you pat my shoulder and tell me to cheer up, I'll stand back up  ♫

640
00:52:21,884 --> 00:52:26,474
♫  How beautiful is that ocean at sunrise?  ♫

641
00:52:26,474 --> 00:52:27,684
Are you cold?

642
00:52:27,684 --> 00:52:29,224
No.

643
00:52:30,554 --> 00:52:33,684
It feels nice to walk together.

644
00:52:36,374 --> 00:52:38,154
- Unni.
- Yeah?

645
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:43,774
Let's become healthier and come back here next year.

646
00:52:47,714 --> 00:52:54,654
♫  No matter where it is  ♫

647
00:53:35,014 --> 00:53:37,774
Where are you going? What about our Pure White buildings?

648
00:53:37,774 --> 00:53:40,964
I won't keep that haunted house even if you pay me.

649
00:53:40,964 --> 00:53:45,624
Gosh, this is the right place Priest Kim told me about-

650
00:53:55,504 --> 00:53:58,034
Wait for me!

651
00:54:07,014 --> 00:54:10,584
What are you waiting for? Before the other things follow us in...

652
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:11,724
Other things?

653
00:54:11,724 --> 00:54:14,084
Come on!

654
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,794
Gosh.

655
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,044
Why do you lack such sense?

656
00:54:18,044 --> 00:54:19,754
What's going on?

657
00:54:19,754 --> 00:54:21,284
I mean...

658
00:54:35,394 --> 00:54:38,934
Open the door for a sec! Huh?

659
00:54:38,934 --> 00:54:41,504
Let me see your face again!

660
00:54:41,504 --> 00:54:43,724
I just need to confirm something!

661
00:54:43,724 --> 00:54:46,414
Please open the door for a moment!

662
00:54:46,414 --> 00:54:48,924
 Just for a moment! 

663
00:54:54,154 --> 00:54:57,484
 Open the door- 

664
00:54:57,484 --> 00:55:00,004
 Sir! 

665
00:55:00,004 --> 00:55:02,044
 Open the door! 

666
00:55:02,044 --> 00:55:05,274
Hey! Ow... Open the door!

667
00:55:05,274 --> 00:55:08,374
What's going on?

668
00:55:08,374 --> 00:55:11,254
Gosh.

669
00:55:11,254 --> 00:55:13,404
Ahjussi!

670
00:55:34,084 --> 00:55:36,053
Where are we going?

671
00:55:36,053 --> 00:55:39,503
Everything will go according to Priest Kim.

672
00:55:40,563 --> 00:55:41,253
 

673
00:55:45,693 --> 00:55:47,363
Yes, Priest Kim.

674
00:55:47,363 --> 00:55:50,313
Priest, my foot. Call me Kim Do Gi.

675
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:52,563
Although, I'm not sure you'll get a chance to.

676
00:55:52,563 --> 00:55:57,633
Oh, how could I dare to call you by your name?

677
00:55:57,633 --> 00:56:02,343
But I saw that ghost again.

678
00:56:02,343 --> 00:56:04,513
Why? Are you scared?

679
00:56:04,513 --> 00:56:08,973
He must've followed me here because of bad karma.

680
00:56:08,973 --> 00:56:14,583
Isn't this nothing compared to the pain of the families you tore apart?

681
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:18,733
Priest Kim, what should I do?

682
00:56:18,733 --> 00:56:21,213
You must be really scared.

683
00:56:21,213 --> 00:56:22,983
Then try practicing a religion.

684
00:56:22,983 --> 00:56:25,933
Sorry? A religion?

685
00:56:25,933 --> 00:56:31,273
Religion usually offers courage and peace to those with hardships.

686
00:56:31,273 --> 00:56:34,803
That's what real religion is.

687
00:56:34,803 --> 00:56:36,223
Take care.

688
00:56:37,253 --> 00:56:40,113
Priest Kim, what are you saying all of a-

689
00:56:44,563 --> 00:56:46,953
Hello? Hello?

690
00:56:46,953 --> 00:56:48,893
Shit!

691
00:56:48,893 --> 00:56:51,933
What's wrong with the signal?

692
00:56:51,933 --> 00:56:53,873
Priest Kim,

693
00:56:53,873 --> 00:56:58,753
that evil spirit reappeared!

694
00:56:58,753 --> 00:57:01,673
Priest Kim!

695
00:57:18,363 --> 00:57:20,473
Dispatch complete.

696
00:57:24,633 --> 00:57:26,903
Everyone did a good job.

697
00:57:26,903 --> 00:57:29,833
I heard you transferred all the members to a treatment ward.

698
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:31,753
It's going to cost an arm and a leg.

699
00:57:31,753 --> 00:57:34,333
You know that haunted house?

700
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:38,423
After chasing away the ghosts, the price went up.

701
00:57:40,983 --> 00:57:43,523
I'm hungry.

702
00:57:43,523 --> 00:57:45,493
How do you all feel about a hot soondoobu*?
(Spicy tofu stew.)

703
00:57:45,493 --> 00:57:49,663
No, no, no. I-I don't think I can tolerate anything white for a while.

704
00:57:49,663 --> 00:57:50,583
How does jjajangmyeon* sound?
(Black bean noodles.)

705
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:53,243
I want to avoid anything black, too.

706
00:57:53,243 --> 00:57:55,953
Gosh, then we have no choice,

707
00:57:55,953 --> 00:57:59,353
but to eat the hanwoo* everyone wants.
(High quality Korean beef)

708
00:57:59,353 --> 00:58:01,483
When you feel weak, go for hanwoo!

709
00:58:01,483 --> 00:58:04,693
Let's go with hanwoo. Let's get it, hanwoo.

710
00:58:04,693 --> 00:58:08,963
Oh, by the way, how did you control the school of ravens?

711
00:58:08,963 --> 00:58:11,343
How in the world did you do that?

712
00:58:11,343 --> 00:58:12,643
W-What do you mean ravens?

713
00:58:12,643 --> 00:58:15,403
It was so cool.

714
00:58:15,403 --> 00:58:18,293
Kind of scary, too.

715
00:58:18,293 --> 00:58:20,463
That's not...

716
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:22,613
something we did.

717
00:58:22,613 --> 00:58:27,123
What are you talking about? Even now, they're still flying above my head-

718
00:58:29,823 --> 00:58:31,113
Huh?

719
00:58:40,123 --> 00:58:42,313
What's that?

720
00:58:42,313 --> 00:58:45,863
I'm flooring it, but it won't go any faster.

721
00:59:25,473 --> 00:59:27,683
Yes, Go Eun.

722
00:59:27,683 --> 00:59:29,123
 Are you home? 

723
00:59:29,123 --> 00:59:31,693
Mr. Choi said he'll buy chicken. Why don't you come?

724
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:34,313
No, it's okay.

725
00:59:34,313 --> 00:59:37,943
It's not every day Mr. Choi offers to buy...

726
00:59:37,943 --> 00:59:39,693
Mr. Kim Do Gi, what are you drinking?

727
00:59:39,693 --> 00:59:41,603
A protein drink.

728
00:59:41,603 --> 00:59:44,383
What you drink after working out?

729
00:59:44,383 --> 00:59:46,663
You really like that, huh?

730
00:59:46,663 --> 00:59:48,953
The one that's carbonated?

731
00:59:48,953 --> 00:59:52,073
It's a nice, light drink to enjoy. It's delicious.

732
00:59:52,073 --> 00:59:53,503
It's on me! Carbonation!

733
00:59:53,503 --> 00:59:56,013
Me, me, me!

734
00:59:56,013 --> 01:00:00,173
Gosh, all right. If you change your mind, come to Rainbow Chicken.

735
01:00:00,173 --> 01:00:02,523
Okay, have a good time.

736
01:00:04,093 --> 01:00:06,073
Do Gi hyungnim.

737
01:00:06,073 --> 01:00:08,943
Oh, you were working out.

738
01:00:08,943 --> 01:00:11,523
No, I was finishing up.

739
01:00:11,523 --> 01:00:15,113
I bought some coffee. I wanted to get some advice from you.

740
01:00:15,113 --> 01:00:17,073
Do you have time?

741
01:00:22,603 --> 01:00:25,803
It definitely feels different drinking it from up here.

742
01:00:25,803 --> 01:00:28,273
Is it because of the nice view...

743
01:00:28,273 --> 01:00:30,523
or because I'm drinking with you?

744
01:00:31,563 --> 01:00:36,283
I'm not in a place where I can give advice to someone else.

745
01:00:36,283 --> 01:00:38,003
And I don't know how to.

746
01:00:38,003 --> 01:00:42,673
I just thought if it's you, you might know the answer.

747
01:00:48,913 --> 01:00:53,553
To be honest, I have a number of friends.

748
01:00:53,553 --> 01:00:58,613
But at one point, they kept coming back from getting beat up somewhere! Multiple times.

749
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:02,283
So I got mad and went to punish him.

750
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:05,633
But I had no idea why he kept beating them up.

751
01:01:05,633 --> 01:01:10,113
It's not like he held a grudge, and they didn't even know each other.

752
01:01:10,113 --> 01:01:12,643
Why do you think he did it?

753
01:01:12,643 --> 01:01:17,403
I don't think I'll be of any help to you.

754
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:21,733
That's why I'm going to befriend him.

755
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:29,213
I figured I might figure it out if we became friends.

756
01:01:29,213 --> 01:01:31,473
What do you think?

757
01:01:33,083 --> 01:01:37,003
Do you think that person and I can become friends?

758
01:01:41,013 --> 01:01:42,513
No.

759
01:01:44,013 --> 01:01:50,103
It seems the two of you couldn't be friends from the start.

760
01:01:50,103 --> 01:01:52,143
Why not?

761
01:01:52,143 --> 01:01:55,333
Isn't it enough if I ask him to become friends?

762
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:59,053
That person will continue to beat up your friends.

763
01:02:01,993 --> 01:02:04,093
Gosh.

764
01:02:04,093 --> 01:02:07,033
That's going to be a problem.

765
01:02:09,073 --> 01:02:13,263
Hyungnim, can I use your bathroom?

766
01:02:36,283 --> 01:02:38,653
 

767
01:02:50,863 --> 01:02:53,513
Where did he get these?

768
01:02:59,293 --> 01:03:02,463
Do Gi hyungnim really crossed the line.

769
01:03:04,783 --> 01:03:07,453
It's taking a while for you to find the bathroom.

770
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:21,200


771
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,700
 

772
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:34,713
♫  Take me back, it's over!  ♫

773
01:03:34,713 --> 01:03:38,453
♫  Put the pain that's been trapping you behind  ♫

774
01:03:38,453 --> 01:03:42,443
♫  And I'll fight, fight for you!  ♫

775
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:46,133
♫  A I will run to the end of the world  ♫

776
01:03:46,133 --> 01:03:53,133
 

777
01:03:53,133 --> 01:03:56,783
 Will you tell me about what you've been through? 

778
01:03:56,783 --> 01:04:00,173
 Han Soo Ryeon's case causes me great sadness, too. 

779
01:04:00,173 --> 01:04:02,343
 Stop the bullshit! You're the one who did this! 

780
01:04:02,343 --> 01:04:04,023
 A doctor performed surgery to kill someone? 

781
01:04:04,023 --> 01:04:05,863
 They're trying to save her! 

782
01:04:05,863 --> 01:04:07,173
 It's a medical accident... 

783
01:04:07,173 --> 01:04:09,093
 What kind of person is Director Ahn Young Sook? 

784
01:04:09,093 --> 01:04:11,503
 She's a famous doctor known for performing many surgeries. 

785
01:04:11,503 --> 01:04:15,493
 Wow, what's with that sight of her being the focus of respect? 

786
01:04:15,493 --> 01:04:17,403
 - I'm confused.
- Which department are you from? 

787
01:04:17,403 --> 01:04:19,393
 I'm disappointed, Doctor. I'm upset. 

788
01:04:19,393 --> 01:04:21,653
 I need to get back to the site of the crime. 

789
01:04:21,653 --> 01:04:23,223
 Do you have any intention of stopping here? 

790
01:04:23,223 --> 01:04:25,293
 I'm warning you. Be careful. 

791
01:04:25,293 --> 01:04:27,323
 Mr. Kim Do Gi, you need to get out of there now. 

792
01:04:27,323 --> 01:04:29,233
 Is this noise going off because of me? 

793
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:31,513
 - Get out of there for now.
- What's going on? 

794
01:04:31,513 --> 01:04:34,953
 Excuse me. Can I borrow a coin?
