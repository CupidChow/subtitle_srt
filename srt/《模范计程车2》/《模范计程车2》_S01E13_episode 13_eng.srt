1
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,000
 

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,410
 

3
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,000
 

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,780
You must've been surprised because it's older than you expected.

5
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,560
Not at all!

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,910
I haven't been to a place like this in a while. It's nice to see.

7
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,570
Is that so?

8
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,240
There was someone who raised me when I was a kid.

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,580
Their place felt a lot like this.

10
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,660
You applied as soon as you got the taxi license.

11
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,550
Yes, I came as soon as I got it!

12
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,210
I hope you don't mind me asking,

13
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:09,490
but what's the reason you applied to our company?

14
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,040
Well...

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,780
I grew up at an orphanage alone since I was a kid.

16
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,580
Since I spent a lot of time alone,

17
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,750
I always thought it'd be nice to have someone visit me.

18
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,530
People come to you if you drive a taxi.

19
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,490
Although, you say goodbye quickly once you arrive at the destination.

20
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,620
I guess you're right.

21
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,400
I don't know if our destinations will end up matching up,

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,680
but let's enjoy ourselves while we're together.

23
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,340
Thank you! I'll work hard!

24
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,540
 

25
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,870
 Do you remember when I came back after an accident once? 

26
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,920
 You treated me warmly without scolding me. I liked that. 

27
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,980
 I think you were the first person 

28
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,670
 to treat me that way. 

29
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,320
 Live a long life. 

30
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,790
 Don't work too hard. 

31
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,530
 

32
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,910
 

33
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,680
Hello, thank you for your help.

34
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,450
I'd like to check the toll pass payment history.

35
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:07,650
 Thanks for watching Taxi Driver 2 on Viki! 

36
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,470
 

37
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,090
 

38
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,700
This is the company's rank structure I have so far.

39
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,400
The owners you see are all fake, and the real ones are nowhere to be seen.

40
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,870
At this point, this guy is

41
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,560
in the highest position at Black Sun.

42
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,270
One more thing.

43
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,670
 

44
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,960
Isn't this the bastard from Kotaya...

45
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,690
- The captain-
- Correct.

46
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:42,980
But the place he worked the longest happens to be Jungsam Police Station.

47
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,450
- The three of them were a team.
- Could it be a coincidence?

48
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,890
If it were, it'd be such an unpleasant coincidence.

49
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,930
 

50
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,030
The unpleasant coincidence he mentioned...

51
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,320
I don't think it's a coincidence.

52
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,770
They created blind spots for security cameras at Jungsan Police Station.

53
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,200
Why did they need them there?

54
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,850
They normally don't create blind spots at police stations.

55
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,670
To protect themselves and the victims' rights.

56
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:28,630
But three out of nine security cameras don't work.

57
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,230
They're fake.

58
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,700
That means it's easier to protect this way.

59
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,530
- Protect who?
- Probably not the victims.

60
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,290
What can we do now, then?

61
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,850
We need to find the recorder Reporter Kim Yong Min gave to Detective Choi first.

62
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,980
Even better if we could find the security footage, too.

63
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,200
What if we find the real owner, too?

64
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,430
Gosh! That'd be even better!

65
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:09,620
 

66
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,140
 

67
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,690
 Where are you right now, you bastard! 

68
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,170
Geez, I got so hungry.

69
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,320
I went out to eat.

70
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,040
You think it's time to eat right now?

71
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,710
 Get your ass back here right now! 

72
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,960
I'll be right there, sir.

73
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,740
If you go right now, Mr. Kim...

74
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,120
I think you might get beat up.

75
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,060
He wouldn't beat up someone innocent like me, would he?

76
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,450
You bastard! Bastard! Bastard!

77
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,890
What is the point of...

78
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,280
delivering that, you bastard!

79
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,620
What's the point of beating up someone who has no clue?

80
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,470
So did you have a nice meal?

81
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,140
What could the newbies learn from you?

82
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,550
Get your acts together!

83
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,420
Hey.

84
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,470
A VIP customer called me because he was pissed.

85
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,290
You said you'd bring Black Sun to the next level.

86
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,790
Why are you so bad at your job?

87
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,590
Don't even try to swing that at me.

88
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,710
Don't get scared. It's for massaging.

89
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,310
I heard you delivered the Doll to the hospital, not the hotel.

90
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,280
Who's the humanist who did that?

91
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,060
That trashy journo took her.

92
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,900
You feel ashamed to say that, don't you?

93
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,030
Now that you mentioned it,

94
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,310
- we'll double the delivery fee starting tomorrow.
- What?

95
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,490
I can't get these guys motivated.

96
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,710
That's why we had that humiliating accident.

97
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,870
- You must be crazy.
- Yes, I am.

98
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,150
Should I do four times as much instead?

99
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,380
Let's see if you'd split it.

100
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,810
You'd end up taking all of it!

101
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,570
That little...

102
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,090
Yes, Your Honor.

103
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,710
Yes, I'll get it ready and leave it in the management office.

104
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,060
Yes.

105
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,280
Paper. Give me a piece of paper!

106
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:37,040
Write down when you left with the Prize Doll

107
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,470
and what time you got beaten by that reporter down to the minute.

108
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,250
Right now!

109
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,380
Stupid bastards!

110
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,110
It doesn't seem necessary to block the path.

111
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,660
It definitely looks totally different from the club.

112
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,800
I could see why Reporter Kim couldn't find this place.

113
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,830
But thinking about it, wasn't it kind of weird?

114
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,970
 

115
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,460
What was?

116
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,200
Why was he so obsessed with what time the accident happened?

117
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,600
 

118
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,530
 He wanted to know what time they left and came back down to the minute. 

119
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,210
 

120
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,530
 

121
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,920
 

122
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,290
 

123
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,420
 

124
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,220
Pathetic bastards.

125
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,000
Done.

126
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,070
What's all this?

127
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,270
I searched the Black Sun office's computer,

128
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:34,140
but I couldn't find anything but these security footage files.

129
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,980
The file names are Jang Ga Young, Yoo Jin Young, Kim Hee Young...

130
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,290
They're women's names.

131
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,270
They are.

132
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:49,230
I think they named the files with the women in the videos.

133
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,040
All the videos look similar.

134
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,660
All of the other files are like this.

135
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,160
They leave the club, get on the elevator, and enter the hotel room.

136
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,780
That's all there is.

137
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,450
That means that's all they needed.

138
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,260
Looks like they collected evidence.

139
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,430
Are there men in these videos, too?

140
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,040
There was just one person.

141
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,500
By chance, was it Detective Choi Sung Eun?

142
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,340
Yes.

143
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,920
I think it's evidence, like you said.

144
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,580
Just this by itself?

145
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:46,450
Choi Sung Eun's death was concluded as suicide because of video evidence.

146
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:51,420
These video files were probably created to change something.

147
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,390
I feel like it's not for anything positive.

148
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,580
Right.

149
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,190
What's that?

150
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,550
It's the same model of the recorder Reporter Kim gave to Detective Choi.

151
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,360
It was kind of blurry in the video,

152
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,240
but that's the only model out there. So that's probably it.

153
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,290
 

154
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,140
- Hello?
 - Hello? 

155
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,540
Oppa, where are you? What are you doing right now?

156
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:26,550
Well, I'm enjoying my hobby because I don't have to go to work yet.

157
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:31,330
Actually, I have a favor to ask.

158
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,470
A favor?

159
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,750
What favor?

160
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,530
Nice shot!

161
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:54,900
Wow, you're pretty good for someone bad.

162
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,420
I'm saying you're trying hard.

163
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,260
I come here often to practice.

164
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,660
But you said you have a favor to ask me.

165
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,100
Are you close with Victor?

166
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:12,050
The woman from the recent delivery accident was Victor's prize.

167
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,240
So he got pretty angry.

168
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,620
I'm planning to make him feel better when he comes this afternoon.

169
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,550
But I'm not that close to him.

170
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,960
Who told you to win his heart?

171
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,070
I'm asking you to get beaten instead if he flips out.

172
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:31,410
If I get injured, it'll affect my job.

173
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,970
You're his friend. It won't be too bad.

174
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,040
Got it.

175
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,140
What?

176
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,850
Was it you? Why didn't you say so?

177
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,310
What? Are you sure you hurt yourself?

178
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,910
Shit...

179
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:07,940
You said you wanted a job. You're working here now?

180
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,680
Hey, buddy, I heard something bad happened.

181
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,460
I heard.

182
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,450
Why did it have to be you...

183
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,030
So what will you do about my shitty mood?

184
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:25,210
You said you heard about it. You should take responsibility, then.

185
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,290
Shit!

186
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,890
You work here, too, you bastard.

187
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,890
No. 9.

188
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,480
- Victor oppa, you came!
- That little b****...

189
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,630
Buddy, I don't know what to say.

190
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,570
Let me pour you a glass.

191
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,990
Oppa, let's forget about the past.

192
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,950
Everything is on the house today!

193
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,610
You said that last time, too. But you made me roll on the bed alone instead.

194
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,160
You made me feel so f***ing lonely.

195
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,350
Okay, it's time for the Doll Play.

196
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,740
You have to hit the home run this time, Oppa!

197
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,830
Time for the Doll Play!

198
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,100
Let's go!

199
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,110
You're so annoying, Windy.

200
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,500
Good work. You can leave now.

201
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,730
Hold on.

202
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:02,000
Buddy, you should take care of it this time.

203
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,500
It'd be your responsibility if there's another accident this time, No. 9.

204
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,070
He doesn't have enough experience yet. Let me get you someone else!

205
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,100
Did you make me roll in bed alone because you had enough experience?

206
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,910
Why don't you just shut your mouth instead?

207
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,910
Don't ruin my mood, and just leave. So annoying.

208
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,820
Come out for a sec.

209
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,960
That little bastard is getting more and more annoying.

210
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,190
I'll make sure you get paid, so just follow them around

211
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,070
and just call your buddy at the end.

212
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,450
Don't try to help or anything, okay?

213
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,060
Why are you so quiet?

214
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,220
Do you understand?

215
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,380
Just one phone call at the end?

216
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,930
Yes.

217
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,570
What's with you, bastard? Didn't you get trained?

218
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,880
Pardon?

219
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,550
Back off.

220
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,040
Step further behind, you bastard!

221
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,480
Don't try to get caught.

222
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,340
Let's go. Follow me.

223
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:02,500
Mr. Kim, the destination is a hotel this time, too.

224
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,090
It's happening again.

225
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,310
I can't tell if she's conscious or not.

226
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,360
What's the deal?

227
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:13,290
 Should I tell you what would've happened if we had just left her? 

228
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,510
 She would've been dragged to an unfamiliar place 

229
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:18,670
 and terrible things would've been done to her. 

230
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,110
- What are you doing?
- Pardon?

231
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,620
- Get out!
- Yes.

232
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,180
What? Does looking at her

233
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,990
turn you on?

234
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:42,660
Call your friend.

235
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,440
Tell him that the prize was delivered to Room 1018.

236
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,720
Yes.

237
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,830
Hey, buddy. It's Room 1018.

238
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,540
The prize has been delivered.

239
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:01,170
Good work, buddy. I'm almost there, too.

240
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,120
 

241
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,280
 

242
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,040
 

243
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,200
 

244
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,450
 

245
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:35,660
Aigoo! Sunbaenims!

246
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,040
My stomach has been hurting for a bit.

247
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,070
Would it be okay if I went to the restroom?

248
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,700
Bastard! You should've gone sooner.

249
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,080
Aigoo!

250
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,400
- Hurry up.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

251
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,520
I'll be right back!

252
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,100
 

253
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,330
 

254
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:58,080
 

255
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,110
 

256
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:18,580
♫  Light is shining on your shaky eyes  ♫

257
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,470
♫  My heart is dancing under the starlight  ♫

258
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,660
 

259
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:33,600
♫  I'm thinking of destroying the world you created one step at a time  ♫

260
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,340
♫  You didn't question yourself.  ♫

261
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,360
♫  That's the reason why you're being punished  ♫

262
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:48,080
♫  The beautiful night. My ever-lonely heart. Every moment I endured.  ♫

263
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:54,250
♫  You can't avoid anything. You'll be paid back.  ♫

264
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:59,750
♫  You can never run away  ♫

265
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:06,690
♫  You can never run away  ♫

266
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,270
♫  You can never run away  ♫

267
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:16,530
♫  My broken soul doesn't know where to go  ♫

268
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,100
Shit!

269
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,320
What's this now?

270
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,340
♫  Falling down  ♫

271
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:33,730
♫  I'm taking out the sun in my torn-up heart  ♫

272
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:40,350
♫  I will throw it toward you  ♫

273
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:44,400
♫  The beautiful night. My ever-lonely heart.  ♫

274
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,550
♫  Every moment I endured.  ♫

275
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,310
Could you take him to the hospital instead?

276
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,760
I was already on my way.

277
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,810
Gosh. We're here to pick up laundry!

278
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,430
We'd better clean this up!

279
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,540
Let's clean this.

280
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,140
- Here's something big to wash.
- Look how dirty it got.

281
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,440
Here we go!

282
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,910
His butt goes down first.

283
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:14,850
It's all covered up. Thank you!

284
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,410
To the laundry room!

285
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,960
 

286
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,060
 I learned this as a kid. 

287
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:51,280
 You have to dress cleanly so you don't get picked on. Okay? 

288
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:55,500
You should drink some coffee while waiting. Why did you come out here?

289
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,360
I was just looking around.

290
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,350
According to the employees, most of them are missing

291
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,870
since they started collecting them long after the orphanage closed.

292
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:08,140
People didn't really keep records back then.

293
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,250
 

294
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,280
I'm glad we were able to get this much.

295
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,600
He was here more than decades ago.

296
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,880
Just knowing his name, "On Ha Joon," won't be so helpful in looking for him.

297
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,500
I'll just do as much as I can.

298
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,990
It must've been difficult looking for them. Thank you.

299
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:29,190
We should help as much as we can when it comes to Blue Bird Foundation.

300
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:33,520
Could you also tell me where the old orphanage used to be?

301
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,690
I'll send you the address as soon as I find it.

302
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:40,350
That child named On Ha Joon must've grown quite a bit now.

303
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,310
I hope you find him.

304
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,790
Yes, thank you.

305
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,830
- I'll get going now, then.
- Yes.

306
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,030
- Take care.
- Yes.

307
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,400
Shit!

308
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,880
Geez! I almost died!

309
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,950
I almost died!

310
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,180
Aigoo! What a shame.

311
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,920
I could've caught you, right?

312
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,950
I'm sorry, buddy!

313
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,970
I'll apologize with my music!

314
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:14,220
No, I'll just join the military! How about it?

315
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,950
Please stop now! Please?

316
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,770
- What does "home run" mean?
- Home run? Home run?

317
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,320
Home run means I got to sleep with the woman

318
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,290
I picked in the Doll Play. That's a home run!

319
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:30,180
If I almost got to sleep with her, that's...

320
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:34,370
That's getting to third base. It's easy, isn't it?

321
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:37,140
Don't insult baseball.

322
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,750
I answered! I answered...

323
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,150
Don't do it! I'm scared!

324
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:46,640
What's so scary about this? Just think of it as a game.

325
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,240
Let's do it just a hundred times more.

326
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,830
What kind of game is this? Do you see how dangerous it is?

327
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,510
Just think about it for a moment!

328
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,020
Why do I have to think about it?

329
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:04,050
When you were doing that to people while playing Doll Play,

330
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:09,990
have you ever thought about how afraid they must've been?

331
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,720
No! That's...

332
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,730
You haven't. Why are you telling me to think, then?

333
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,050
That was just the Doll Play!

334
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:20,960
The server! She did everything! Windy!

335
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,550
You saw it, too, buddy!

336
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:27,750
I never had a buddy like you.

337
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,620
Hey, let's get started again.

338
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:34,340
No, buddy! Buddy!

339
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,960
Don't do it! Don't do it!

340
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,830
Don't do it! Seriously!

341
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,680
Geez!

342
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,290
What?

343
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:47,640
Do Gi! Mr. Do Gi!

344
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,640
Don't!

345
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,290
You're not doing it, right? Seriously? No!

346
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:25,350
- How refreshing!
- I blended it while it was fresh.

347
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,870
I see.

348
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,250
Let's go with 100 kg.

349
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,750
How much did you say?

350
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,930
- 100 kg.
- Stop joking.

351
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:40,940
You only joke when you're drinking. We're having a business meeting now.

352
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:46,680
Bishop also told me to get a sufficient amount you can circulate.

353
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,270
Excuse me.

354
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,410
Yes?

355
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:05,200
The commissioner position will become available soon, apparently.

356
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,970
And the rumor says I'm a candidate for that position, too.

357
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:10,860
And?

358
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:15,110
I do think I'll be the No. 1 candidate,

359
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:19,210
but compared to other candidates,

360
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:22,430
I'm a little short on my performance.

361
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,640
We'll have to help you bring results.

362
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,950
That's right. They say you should check even the stone bridge before you cross.

363
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,930
It's better to be certain about it.

364
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,820
Bishop is working hard for me, too.

365
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,720
Make sure to go to a beauty salon.

366
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,150
You should look nice for the press conference.

367
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,870
I'll be counting on you, then.

368
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,730
To be sure-

369
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,530
I'm sorry, Ma'am. He gets angry if I don't answer his calls.

370
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,000
Yes.

371
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:56,440
Bishop told you to get a sufficient amount?

372
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,400
Yes. Bishop can feel free to say that.

373
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,910
Because he doesn't work in the field himself.

374
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:06,340
My situation changed, too. I don't think I can do 100 kg.

375
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:12,110
Yes! People like you who work hands-on need to find the right balance!

376
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,210
I need 200 kg.

377
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,450
What?

378
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:20,160
I'll arrange the collection location and transportation myself.

379
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,140
Mr. On. What makes you so confident?

380
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,780
Tell me your secret.

381
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:32,320
I'll do it in the safest way possible. Don't worry.

382
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,670
If something goes wrong in the process,

383
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,600
I'll be responsible for everything since I'm the person in charge.

384
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,510
 

385
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,500
Victor, the phone owner.

386
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,400
He's registered as the non-executive director at Black Sun.

387
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,340
He's one of the key members.

388
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:27,060
That means there are victims like today's almost every day.

389
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,630
Should we barge in and punish everyone?

390
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:33,350
I'm in! Let's catch them and teach them a thing or two immediately!

391
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,800
I'd like to, too. But it won't be easy.

392
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,670
Why? Why is that?

393
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:41,770
I want to catch everyone and destroy them!

394
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:45,790
I still haven't figured out who "everyone" is.

395
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:48,800
Right. All of them were puppet bosses.

396
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,910
- Then things like this will keep repeating.
- We need to prevent that, at least.

397
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,230
How?

398
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:59,290
Hierarchical system. You said Black Sun has a strict hierarchical system, right?

399
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,740
Let's teach them what

400
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,630
a true hierarchical system is like.

401
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,910
 - Cheers! 
- Congratulations on your new job.

402
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,580
We'll pay for everything as a gift.

403
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,060
Thank you!

404
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,780
By the way, I've never been here before. It really feels different here.

405
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,520
- Isn't that a great song?
- I know.

406
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,540
He picked who?

407
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,040
The yellow top?

408
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,600
Okay.

409
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,140
Oppa, two bottles of the special liquor, please.

410
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,330
Thank you. Carry on.

411
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:44,870
- It's your first time here, isn't it?
- Gosh, how did you know?

412
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:47,020
I know everything.

413
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,450
To celebrate your first visit to the club,

414
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,760
these are on me!

415
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,230
Wow! What's that?

416
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,700
Shall we clank our glasses?

417
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,970
- Bottoms up, okay?
- Okay.

418
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,080
Thank you.

419
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,590
Excuse me for a second!

420
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,420
Victor oppa, did you hit a home run yesterday?

421
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,810
Congratulations!

422
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:24,920
When?

423
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,260
How many?

424
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,890
Well, that many?

425
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,500
High-Pass for all of them?

426
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,030
Will it be your treat?

427
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,990
You're so cool, Oppa!

428
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,370
E-Excuse me!

429
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,050
What? What is it?

430
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,900
- I think you should come out.
- Did someone cause trouble again?

431
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,900
- W-Well...
- Shit.

432
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,610
Seriously, you bastard...

433
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,330
Geez!

434
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,880
Aigoo, I'm sorry!

435
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,640
Wait...

436
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,610
Hey, who let a street vendor in?

437
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,650
Hey! Watch where you're going, kid!

438
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,950
Wait, gramps...

439
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,220
Shit!

440
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,920
- Let's go!
- Hey!

441
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,010
 

442
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,040
 

443
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,370
 

444
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,800
- Where are you? Hurry, hurry!
- Wait, wait...

445
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,150
Hey! What are you guys doing? You have to stop them, bastards!

446
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,150
Stop! Stop!

447
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,860
You came to the wrong place! This isn't it!

448
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,480
You came to the wrong place! Stop!

449
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,010
This is the wrong place!

450
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:08,830
They're all High-Pass VIP customers.

451
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,830
High-Pass?

452
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,960
Shit.

453
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,500
Young man, move aside.

454
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,180
What's going on?

455
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,300
I found a spot here!

456
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,950
Hey, you have your snacks, right?

457
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:04,060
Gosh! Why is the music so loud and boring?

458
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,320
All right!

459
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:46,650
♫  Ya- ya, what's wrong with my age?  ♫

460
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:53,320
♫  Love doesn't know age  ♫

461
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,820
♫  Our hearts are one  ♫

462
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,500
♫  Our feelings are one  ♫

463
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:07,370
♫  You're my only true love  ♫

464
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:11,140
♫  I'm tearing up  ♫

465
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:15,100
♫  What's wrong with my age?  ♫

466
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:20,600
♫  It's the perfect age to fall in love  ♫

467
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:28,830
♫  Some day, in the mirror...  ♫

468
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,540
Sir.

469
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:36,220
♫  While looking at myself  ♫

470
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,860
What's this?

471
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:42,620
They're the VIPs Windy made a High-Pass reservation for.

472
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,850
Let's spin around!

473
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:51,050
♫  It's the perfect age to fall in love  ♫

474
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,850
Seriously, what's this?

475
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,560
 Let's get out of here. 

476
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,310
 This isn't good. Let's leave! 

477
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:02,050
We're closing for the day.

478
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,590
Close the door!

479
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,550
Yes.

480
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:08,750
Hey, we're closing. Close the door right now!

481
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,460
Right now!

482
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,410
What did you do, exactly?

483
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:23,410
Victor asked me to. I thought they were a group of VIPs.

484
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:25,930
Did those old fogies look like VIPs to you?

485
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,750
Cancel all the reservations.

486
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,110
- All of them?
- Rumors spread quickly in this field.

487
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:34,030
Tell them we're under maintenance. Check the reservation system first.

488
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,780
The business loss in that period

489
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,280
will be covered by you.

490
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,560
How would I be able to afford that, Oppa?

491
00:41:43,806 --> 00:41:46,976
Shit. Victor, that son of a b****.

492
00:41:46,976 --> 00:41:49,546
Tell Victor that I'd like to see him.

493
00:41:49,546 --> 00:41:53,876
I kept calling him, too. But his phone is off.

494
00:41:53,876 --> 00:41:57,016
You must know his family or friends.

495
00:41:57,016 --> 00:41:59,756
If you can't find him, find someone else instead!

496
00:42:13,976 --> 00:42:17,566
I found out why they were keeping the videos.

497
00:42:18,596 --> 00:42:20,836
They're evidence, as Mr. Jang said.

498
00:42:20,836 --> 00:42:23,826
- What evidence?
- Stop moving around!

499
00:42:23,826 --> 00:42:25,536
No more.

500
00:42:25,536 --> 00:42:28,776
These people had a few things in common.

501
00:42:28,776 --> 00:42:31,066
They all lost consciousness at Black Sun

502
00:42:31,066 --> 00:42:32,476
and when they woke up,

503
00:42:32,476 --> 00:42:35,536
they were in a hotel room with a man they'd never seen before.

504
00:42:35,536 --> 00:42:37,646
So they called the police for sexual assault.

505
00:42:37,646 --> 00:42:39,686
That's the first thing in common.

506
00:42:39,686 --> 00:42:41,666
What's the second one?

507
00:42:41,666 --> 00:42:43,476
Most of their lawsuits were canceled

508
00:42:43,476 --> 00:42:46,146
and they got counter-sued for libel.

509
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,526
Because of these videos.

510
00:42:50,066 --> 00:42:52,666
They said they lost consciousness and woke up in a hotel room.

511
00:42:52,666 --> 00:42:54,666
But in these videos,

512
00:42:54,666 --> 00:42:59,396
they left the club and entered the hotel themselves.

513
00:42:59,396 --> 00:43:02,966
They must've kept these clips to use for libel lawsuits.

514
00:43:02,966 --> 00:43:05,366
Bastards.

515
00:43:05,366 --> 00:43:06,956
That's why they did whatever they wanted to.

516
00:43:06,956 --> 00:43:09,456
They knew they couldn't be punished by law.

517
00:43:09,456 --> 00:43:13,426
Aren't they seriously so terrible?

518
00:43:13,426 --> 00:43:17,196
How could they promote sexual assault as if it's part of a tour package?

519
00:43:17,196 --> 00:43:21,496
We stopped them for now, but I'm sure they'll start again soon.

520
00:43:21,496 --> 00:43:26,026
How could they do this in the middle of Seoul so blatantly?

521
00:43:26,026 --> 00:43:28,076
They turned the victims into perpetrators,

522
00:43:28,076 --> 00:43:30,736
and perpetrators into victims.

523
00:43:30,736 --> 00:43:34,016
I feel like I'm looking inside the devil's playground.

524
00:43:39,886 --> 00:43:43,226
Who created this monster, anyway?

525
00:43:47,086 --> 00:43:51,246
 Police arrested a group who attempted to bring in the largest amount 

526
00:43:51,246 --> 00:43:53,056
 of narcotics ever found in the country. 

527
00:43:53,056 --> 00:43:56,806
 Korean Police found 230 kg of narcotics, which is enough for 8 million people 

528
00:43:56,806 --> 00:44:01,366
 to use at the same time, and it's worth about 850 billion won. 

529
00:44:01,366 --> 00:44:03,126
 It's the largest amount of narcotics found in history. 

530
00:44:03,146 --> 00:44:08,386
 It was by a global criminal organization based in Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong. 

531
00:44:08,386 --> 00:44:12,976
 
 The organization attempted smuggling using a ship that was 

532
00:44:12,976 --> 00:44:14,296
 
 coming into Korea through China and Japan, 

533
00:44:14,296 --> 00:44:17,836
 but the police were able to stop them since they were 

534
00:44:17,836 --> 00:44:20,546
 informed and planned accordingly. 

535
00:44:24,046 --> 00:44:28,566
Mr. On! Why don't you pick up your phone?

536
00:44:28,566 --> 00:44:32,076
What brings you here so early? Have you eaten?

537
00:44:32,076 --> 00:44:35,706
Did you watch the news? What's going on?

538
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:40,326
- Please bring another meal.
- How am I supposed to eat right now?

539
00:44:40,326 --> 00:44:42,786
Mr. On, you were so confident.

540
00:44:42,786 --> 00:44:45,926
This is why I suggested splitting it up!

541
00:44:45,926 --> 00:44:48,686
Hold on, Madam. Let me just watch this.

542
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,546
Do you want to watch it together?

543
00:44:51,506 --> 00:44:53,306
I wonder if he prepared well.

544
00:44:53,306 --> 00:44:56,156
 The amount of narcotics that were found 

545
00:44:56,246 --> 00:45:01,746
 is unprecedented, which is almost twice much as we found last year. 

546
00:45:01,746 --> 00:45:05,426
 In order to keep our status as a drug-free country, the police 

547
00:45:05,426 --> 00:45:10,716
 will work harder and won't hesitate to start a war on drugs. 

548
00:45:10,716 --> 00:45:13,676
Now, we will arrest six members of the organization and...

549
00:45:13,676 --> 00:45:17,686
His beauty shop did a great job.

550
00:45:17,686 --> 00:45:19,736
Are you mocking me?

551
00:45:21,296 --> 00:45:23,146
Don't worry, Madam.

552
00:45:23,146 --> 00:45:25,366
I'll take care of everything.

553
00:45:26,946 --> 00:45:29,406
How will you take care of this?

554
00:45:29,406 --> 00:45:31,806
They already confiscated our stuff!

555
00:45:31,806 --> 00:45:34,496
Calm down a bit.

556
00:45:40,146 --> 00:45:45,706
Do you remember we agreed to grant the winner's wish in the bottle game?

557
00:45:47,756 --> 00:45:50,196
I'll tell you my wish now.

558
00:45:50,196 --> 00:45:52,046
Trust me.

559
00:45:52,046 --> 00:45:54,436
Nothing will happen.

560
00:46:05,946 --> 00:46:09,956
Are you arriving now? Clean up right now, you bastard!

561
00:46:11,856 --> 00:46:15,056
- Hello, Sunbaenim.
- Do you know what time it is?

562
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:19,856
- I'm not late.
- Did you know there's a training session today or not?

563
00:46:19,856 --> 00:46:22,266
Training session?

564
00:46:22,266 --> 00:46:24,616
Run to Room 5 right now!

565
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:26,246
Yes!

566
00:46:26,246 --> 00:46:27,816
Hey!

567
00:46:28,936 --> 00:46:31,366
Take it with you, you bastard.

568
00:46:31,366 --> 00:46:33,466
See you, Sunbaenim!

569
00:47:02,276 --> 00:47:06,466
Be careful with stuff like that. Wrap it several times.

570
00:47:08,286 --> 00:47:12,126
 You're totally f***ed now. 

571
00:47:17,286 --> 00:47:20,036
 Just answer my questions. 

572
00:47:30,286 --> 00:47:32,216
Stop moving.

573
00:47:34,696 --> 00:47:38,566
What team were you again?

574
00:47:38,566 --> 00:47:42,606
You said, "Evidence Removal Team."

575
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:45,426
What did I tell you to do with the bloody towels?

576
00:47:46,936 --> 00:47:49,476
Put them in the trash bags-

577
00:47:50,756 --> 00:47:55,586
Hey. How many times did I tell you to put them in the bags for different boroughs?

578
00:47:55,586 --> 00:48:00,276
So they can't combine them since they'd get dispersed to different jurisdictions, you idiot!

579
00:48:01,256 --> 00:48:03,606
Hey, the same goes for you.

580
00:48:03,606 --> 00:48:07,776
I told you more than 10 times to clean blood with a special solution!

581
00:48:07,776 --> 00:48:09,986
More than 10 times!

582
00:48:14,086 --> 00:48:16,926
Never mind. You did a good job.

583
00:48:16,926 --> 00:48:21,466
I get paid more often if you keep forgetting.

584
00:48:21,466 --> 00:48:23,036
Well done.

585
00:48:23,036 --> 00:48:24,936
Well done, well done.

586
00:48:47,426 --> 00:48:50,576
- Go Eun.
- Yes, Mr. Kim.

587
00:48:50,576 --> 00:48:54,836
Where did the victims in the videos file lawsuits again?

588
00:48:58,096 --> 00:48:59,616
Jungsam Police Station.

589
00:48:59,616 --> 00:49:03,956
I think most of them went there because it's in their jurisdiction.

590
00:49:03,956 --> 00:49:06,116
And who arrested the victims for libel?

591
00:49:06,116 --> 00:49:08,616
That's...

592
00:49:10,876 --> 00:49:13,616
Jungsam Police Station.

593
00:49:16,946 --> 00:49:18,656
You asked...

594
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:23,986
how it's possible to do this in the middle of Seoul, right?

595
00:49:23,986 --> 00:49:27,956
That's why Mr. Jang said it's like looking inside the devil's playground.

596
00:49:27,956 --> 00:49:33,056
Don't you think they're showing us what kind of monster is created in the middle of the city

597
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:38,206
when law enforcement works with the devil instead of catching him?

598
00:49:40,676 --> 00:49:42,326
No. 9!

599
00:49:43,646 --> 00:49:45,526
You scared me.

600
00:49:45,526 --> 00:49:47,966
Why are you looking at me like that, you bastard!

601
00:49:50,236 --> 00:49:54,026
Follow me. Mr. Yoo wants to see you.

602
00:49:54,026 --> 00:49:55,376
Yes.

603
00:50:02,456 --> 00:50:05,476
 - Sir! 
- Come on in.

604
00:50:06,646 --> 00:50:08,356
I brought him with me.

605
00:50:13,786 --> 00:50:15,436
Have a seat.

606
00:50:21,236 --> 00:50:23,676
- You can leave.
- Yes.

607
00:50:39,046 --> 00:50:42,876
- Have some.
- Well, but I'm working.

608
00:50:42,876 --> 00:50:46,066
It's okay to drink when I offer.

609
00:50:46,066 --> 00:50:47,406
Yes.

610
00:50:57,916 --> 00:50:59,816
I heard you're Victor's friend.

611
00:51:03,076 --> 00:51:06,566
Yes, but we're not that close.

612
00:51:07,576 --> 00:51:09,986
Are you able to reach him?

613
00:51:09,986 --> 00:51:13,036
I've been trying to reach him,

614
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:15,486
but he won't answer his phone.

615
00:51:16,976 --> 00:51:20,106
Have another glass. Give me the glass after you empty it.

616
00:51:21,086 --> 00:51:22,456
Yes.

617
00:51:32,476 --> 00:51:35,006
Doesn't your body warm up quickly?

618
00:51:35,006 --> 00:51:36,866
Because it's expensive stuff.

619
00:51:42,096 --> 00:51:45,136
When did you last see him?

620
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:49,276
I haven't seen him since I finished the delivery last time.

621
00:51:55,716 --> 00:51:57,956
Looks like you don't know a lot.

622
00:52:00,936 --> 00:52:03,586
What are you doing? Drink.

623
00:52:13,066 --> 00:52:14,366
Yes.

624
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,900
You probably...

625
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,000
know about this, still.

626
00:52:57,670 --> 00:53:01,500
 If you want this, buy me a beer. 

627
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:06,880
Who are you?

628
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,090
What did you make me drink?

629
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:15,190
Doesn't your body warm up quickly?

630
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,010
What did you...

631
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:21,210
make me drink?

632
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,810
It's okay.

633
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,130
Aigoo.

634
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:38,480
Get up. Get up.

635
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:07,730
- Clean up.
- Yes.

636
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:20,080
- Go Eun, we got yours, too!
- We're in trouble! Mr. Kim passed out!

637
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,340
What?

638
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:29,340
Hey.

639
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,520
Walk toward...

640
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:38,550
the entrance.

641
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,230
Mr. Kim!

642
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:57,150
Can you hear me?

643
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:05,840
Mr. Kim!

644
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,900
Mr. Kim! Say something!

645
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:40,310
Hey, what are you guys doing?

646
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:42,230
Go help him.

647
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,890
Sorry, sir.

648
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:01,320
I'm on my way right now.

649
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,440
Take care of it without making a mistake.

650
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:06,110
Yes, sir.

651
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:10,690
Go to the main intersection.

652
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:26,750
Mr. Kim will be okay, right?

653
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:31,470
Where is he taking him to, anyway?

654
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,350
I think the light will change ahead of us.

655
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:41,740
I think we'll lose them.

656
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:44,660
We can't fall behind. Hold tight!

657
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:55,320
Slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down!

658
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,810
Be quiet!

659
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:00,510
- Yes, yes.
- Hey!

660
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:14,640
Where did they go?

661
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:20,070
- I don't see them.
- We followed them right behind.

662
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,480
The car stopped! We passed them.

663
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,910
What?

664
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:32,590
Geez. What should we do?

665
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:34,690
It'd take a while if we do a U-turn.

666
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:37,770
I"ll get off first. Drop me off on the shoulder.

667
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,070
This bastard.

668
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:56,690
I didn't like you from the moment I saw you.

669
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:58,560
Goodbye.

670
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:06,090
Wake up.

671
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:08,480
Wake up.

672
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,930
Cross that street. You've done well.

673
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,340
Who are those bastards?

674
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:25,350
Mr. Kim!

675
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:28,500
Mr. Kim! Wake Up!

676
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,330
Hey, get off!

677
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:33,820
Get off right now, you bastard! He's not dead!

678
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:37,640
Mr. Kim, are you okay? Wake up, Mr. Kim!

679
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,320
You have to wake up! Please wake up, Mr. Kim!

680
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,890
- Jin Eon, hold tight!
- What?

681
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,460
Shit! Hey!

682
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:30,290
Mr. Kim. Mr. Kim!

683
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:32,890
- Mr. Kim!
- I'm okay!

684
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:35,520
Try waking up, Mr. Kim!

685
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,080
Mr. Kim, are you okay?

686
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,600
- Mr. Kim!
- Are you okay?

687
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,450
Mr. Kim!

688
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:12,540
Hurry up, Go Eun!

689
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,820
Here.

690
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:18,670
Wow, it smells so good!

691
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:22,810
Pour me a glass.

692
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:26,400
Mr. Kim, hurry!

693
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,510
Have a seat, Do Gi!

694
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:31,520
 The meat is almost done! 

695
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:51,450
 Walk toward the entrance. 

696
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:54,330
 Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim! 

697
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:57,390
 You have to wake up! Please open your eyes! 

698
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:59,750
 Mr. Kim! 

699
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,880
Are you awake?

700
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:20,510
How long... have I been out?

701
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:23,340
You slept all day.

702
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:26,700
Do you remember what happened at all?

703
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:29,440
That was a close one.

704
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,450
There are some fragments left,

705
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:36,500
but I don't remember what happened.

706
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,870
You really don't remember?

707
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:47,060
You probably don't remember how great we were, too, then.

708
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:50,940
Do you know how aggressively he drove?

709
01:03:55,550 --> 01:04:00,270
Mr. Kim, you were just like the people in the videos.

710
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:04,030
Do you really not remember what they did to you?

711
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:10,320
If it's hard to remember, try remembering your last memory.

712
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:13,010
The last memory?

713
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:15,630
You can start from there.

714
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:20,260
My last memory was...

715
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:37,020
That's...

716
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:41,190
That I found this.

717
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:48,290
 Thanks for watching Taxi Driver 2 on Viki! 

718
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:51,990
 

719
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,370
♫  Take me away  ♫

720
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:56,180
♫  You don't have to tell me  ♫

721
01:04:56,180 --> 01:05:04,230
♫  Your eyes already told me clearly  ♫

722
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:14,230
♫  Those painful nights were so cruel to me  ♫

723
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:22,040
 

724
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:25,170
 "Make sure the ones who harm others get punished properly." 

725
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:29,670
 I think those last words by Detective Choi were a message to you, Reporter Kim. 

726
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:31,410
 I'm here to collect the confiscated narcotics. 

727
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:34,560
 They were reselling the narcotics they were supposed to burn. 

728
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:38,620
 A perfect blindspot for the law in the middle of the city. 

729
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:41,620
 It's way more than just a playground. 

730
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:43,610
 We can't win by fighting them one by one. 

731
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:46,640
 We need to beat all of them with one blow. 

732
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,830
 Can I see a picture of the new bodyguard? 

733
01:05:48,830 --> 01:05:51,540
 Kim Do Gi was here? 

734
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:53,280
 The goods are ready. 

735
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,610
 How dare you come in here by stabbing me behind my back? 

736
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:59,930
 He'll definitely show up. Without a doubt. 

737
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:02,160
 Kim Do Gi. 

738
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,540
 I'll kill you with my own hands. 

739
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:10,876
♫  I won't hesitate before it's too late  ♫
