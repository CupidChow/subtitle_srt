1
00:00:27,164 --> 00:00:32,034
 

2
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,200
 

3
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,800
 Thanks for watching Taxi Driver 2 on Viki! 

4
00:00:48,144 --> 00:00:50,314
Your long journey has finally come to an end, Bishop.

5
00:00:50,314 --> 00:00:53,714
It was my choice to embark on this pilgrimage.

6
00:00:53,714 --> 00:00:55,534
I'll carry your bag.

7
00:00:57,584 --> 00:01:00,144
- I'll tell them to prepare a bath.
- No, that can wait.

8
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:02,764
Now that I've completed my pilgrimage,

9
00:01:02,764 --> 00:01:05,044
we should have a small mass first.

10
00:01:06,284 --> 00:01:11,804
Judging by your weight loss, it seems time has been tough on you.

11
00:01:11,804 --> 00:01:13,704
It's nothing much.

12
00:01:15,594 --> 00:01:18,224
I'm sorry. There was traffic.

13
00:01:37,934 --> 00:01:42,484
 

14
00:02:18,134 --> 00:02:19,504
 Walk toward the entrance. 

15
00:02:19,504 --> 00:02:21,624
 Mr. Kim, wake up, Mr. Kim! 

16
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:23,034
 Please! 

17
00:02:23,034 --> 00:02:25,164
 Mr. Kim! 

18
00:02:33,414 --> 00:02:35,694
Are you awake?

19
00:02:35,694 --> 00:02:37,474
How long have I been out?

20
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:40,304
You slept all day.

21
00:02:40,304 --> 00:02:43,324
Do you remember what happened at all?

22
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:48,724
There are some fragments left, but I don't remember what happened.

23
00:02:48,724 --> 00:02:51,844
You really don't remember?

24
00:02:53,394 --> 00:02:56,364
You probably don't remember how great we were, too, then.

25
00:02:56,364 --> 00:03:00,214
Do you know how aggressively he drove?

26
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:04,194
Mr. Kim, you were just like the people in the videos.

27
00:03:04,194 --> 00:03:07,904
Do you really not remember what they did to you?

28
00:03:09,464 --> 00:03:14,094
If it's hard to remember, try remembering your last memory.

29
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,824
The last memory?

30
00:03:15,824 --> 00:03:19,124
You can start from there.

31
00:03:19,124 --> 00:03:21,904
My last memory was...

32
00:03:28,604 --> 00:03:31,004
 I heard you're Victor's friend. 

33
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:33,404
 When did you last see him? 

34
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:37,874
 I haven't seen him since I finished the delivery last time. 

35
00:03:37,874 --> 00:03:40,034
 Looks like you don't know a lot. 

36
00:03:42,624 --> 00:03:45,174
 Have another glass. Give me the glass after you empty it. 

37
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:46,504
 Yes. 

38
00:03:56,144 --> 00:03:59,334
 You probably know about this, still. 

39
00:03:59,334 --> 00:04:02,894
 If you want this, buy me a beer. 

40
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:05,684
 What did you make me drink? 

41
00:04:05,684 --> 00:04:07,934
 Doesn't your body warm up quickly? 

42
00:04:07,934 --> 00:04:10,194
 What did you... 

43
00:04:10,194 --> 00:04:12,514
 make me drink? 

44
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:19,034
 It's okay. 

45
00:04:30,454 --> 00:04:32,834
That I found this.

46
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:37,444
- That's...
- That's the recorder, right?

47
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,474
The recorder that the reporter was looking for.

48
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:44,544
Yes, the recorder Kim Yong Min gave Detective Choi.

49
00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:46,884
Daebak! How did you find that?

50
00:04:46,884 --> 00:04:48,624
Tell us!

51
00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:51,774
Where did you find that in the midst of everything?

52
00:04:58,654 --> 00:05:02,154
 

53
00:05:06,234 --> 00:05:07,934
How did you find this?

54
00:05:08,034 --> 00:05:10,774
Your prediction was right.

55
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:20,174
 Is this on? 

56
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,694
- What's this?
- A recorder.

57
00:05:25,694 --> 00:05:29,354
 
I should at least have a recording if I want to hurry the breaking news.

58
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:31,064
So how do I use this?

59
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,964
- Press the top?
- If you can't remember,

60
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:36,184
just press the tip and leave it on. Just hold onto it.

61
00:05:36,184 --> 00:05:37,924
It should stay on for several hundred hours.

62
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:41,564
Whoa, this really looks like a pen.

63
00:05:45,464 --> 00:05:47,224
Police.

64
00:05:48,424 --> 00:05:50,964
You've had a lot to drink.

65
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:53,394
- Hold on, hold on.
- What is it?

66
00:05:55,894 --> 00:05:57,504
Oppa!

67
00:05:57,504 --> 00:06:00,684
I'm the same, right? I sound the same, right?

68
00:06:00,684 --> 00:06:02,344
- I sound the same.
- Hey, bring him down.

69
00:06:02,344 --> 00:06:03,874
Okay.

70
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:20,614
Give me a raise! How is it the same amount each time?

71
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:23,844
Tomorrow's a big day, so stop drinking and just go to sleep.

72
00:06:23,844 --> 00:06:26,144
All right. Loyalty!

73
00:06:26,144 --> 00:06:28,334
- Escort him home.
- Understood.

74
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:30,604
Come on, let's go.

75
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:42,154
 

76
00:06:42,154 --> 00:06:44,784
 

77
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:53,134
Detective Choi, I changed your shift with Sergeant Cho's, so you can go home.

78
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:54,474
No, it's all right.

79
00:06:54,474 --> 00:06:57,814
Just say thank you and go home, punk. Your sunbae's going out of his way.

80
00:06:57,814 --> 00:07:01,614
Yeah, man, go home early and earn those brownie points from your wife.

81
00:07:01,614 --> 00:07:04,254
- Let's hurry back.
- Okay!

82
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,724
Stay here.

83
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:10,444
Take care.

84
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,214
 

85
00:07:13,214 --> 00:07:17,294
 I hung around for a few days since I got the report. I have a feeling. 

86
00:07:17,294 --> 00:07:18,644
 But Hyung, think about it. 

87
00:07:18,644 --> 00:07:22,024
 Why would a club that makes billions of won per year supply drugs? 

88
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:26,174
 I'm asking you this because that's what I'm curious about. 

89
00:07:34,874 --> 00:07:38,044
 

90
00:07:56,334 --> 00:07:59,794
 
Loyalty!

91
00:08:08,734 --> 00:08:09,974
 

92
00:08:11,994 --> 00:08:15,294
Hey, let's go in.

93
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,784
You did well.

94
00:08:17,784 --> 00:08:19,464
Come here, man.

95
00:08:47,384 --> 00:08:50,974
 - Hello? 
- Yong Min hyung.

96
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:53,214
You were right.

97
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:57,294
Hyung, I don't know what to do, though.

98
00:08:57,294 --> 00:09:00,214
Why? Why? Why? What's going on?

99
00:09:00,214 --> 00:09:04,274
Wait, where are you? I'll be right there.

100
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:08,134
Hyung, no, no.

101
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:12,034
I'll go to you. You're the only person I can trust right now.

102
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:14,074
I'll be there after I check out one more thing.

103
00:09:29,474 --> 00:09:30,984
What the hell?

104
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:32,964
Don't move. Don't move!

105
00:09:32,964 --> 00:09:34,964
Sung Eun...

106
00:09:34,964 --> 00:09:36,634
How could you guys do this?

107
00:09:36,634 --> 00:09:38,764
Hey, hey, calm down, and let's talk.

108
00:09:38,764 --> 00:09:40,734
Put down your gun, punk!

109
00:09:40,734 --> 00:09:44,514
How could the police... out of all people...

110
00:09:44,514 --> 00:09:47,384
We shouldn't be doing this!

111
00:09:50,474 --> 00:09:52,324
Damn...

112
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:55,884
Hey, Sung Eun.

113
00:09:55,884 --> 00:09:58,874
You must not know since you're still a newlywed,

114
00:09:58,874 --> 00:10:01,374
but you'll need a lot of money going forward!

115
00:10:01,374 --> 00:10:02,794
Shut your mouth.

116
00:10:02,794 --> 00:10:07,584
Just turn a blind eye and think of it as working for a company with a high salary.

117
00:10:07,584 --> 00:10:10,134
What better job is out there?

118
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:13,254
- What are you going to do about this?
- All right.

119
00:10:13,254 --> 00:10:16,154
All right, we'll take care of it like that.

120
00:10:17,964 --> 00:10:19,604
Let go, let go.

121
00:10:20,604 --> 00:10:22,994
Hey, Sung Eun, what should we do?

122
00:10:22,994 --> 00:10:26,604
Don't say my name. You're shameless.

123
00:10:28,414 --> 00:10:30,924
I want to save your life.

124
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:33,224
But the higher-ups won't allow it.

125
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:35,634
I told you not to say my name, you bastard!

126
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:38,544
Hey, Sung Eun! Hey!

127
00:10:47,504 --> 00:10:49,224
Hey.

128
00:10:49,224 --> 00:10:55,084
Who the hell told you to needlessly go around looking for justice?

129
00:10:55,084 --> 00:10:57,644
You think getting rid of me...

130
00:10:57,644 --> 00:10:59,874
will be the end of it, huh?

131
00:10:59,874 --> 00:11:02,734
- Hey, clean up the mess.
- All right.

132
00:11:02,734 --> 00:11:06,304
Why the hell are you throwing things, asshole?

133
00:11:06,304 --> 00:11:10,514
Even if I disappear, my hyungnim will never give up.

134
00:11:10,514 --> 00:11:14,304
He'll sit you guys in a court of law, without a doubt.

135
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:15,914
What hyungnim?

136
00:11:16,894 --> 00:11:21,024
A hyungnim who doesn't like exercise.

137
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,554
- Grab him.
- All right.

138
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,874
Come on, you bastard.

139
00:11:27,874 --> 00:11:29,724
Stay still.

140
00:11:33,004 --> 00:11:34,574
Stay still!

141
00:11:35,774 --> 00:11:37,364
Let go!

142
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:46,624
Sung Eun...

143
00:12:49,604 --> 00:12:51,314
Sung Eun...

144
00:12:55,214 --> 00:12:58,684
Sung Eun, what are you doing here?

145
00:13:00,144 --> 00:13:02,024
Sung Eun!

146
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:31,484
After doing that to Sung Eun,

147
00:13:31,484 --> 00:13:37,014
those bastards are probably still living a good life, huh?

148
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:42,004
Without an inkling of guilt or remorse.

149
00:13:46,704 --> 00:13:49,924
Do you like to exercise?

150
00:13:55,904 --> 00:13:59,724
 A hyungnim who doesn't like exercise. 

151
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:06,774
I think these final words of Detective Choi...

152
00:14:06,774 --> 00:14:10,064
were a message to you, Reporter Kim.

153
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:14,434
There's bound to be a hidden meaning.

154
00:14:14,434 --> 00:14:17,564
Something only you could recognize.

155
00:14:18,544 --> 00:14:20,664
Think about it carefully.

156
00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:47,544
My fatigue is dissipating now that I'm home.

157
00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:51,684
Everyone did a good job while I was away.

158
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:59,044
I heard that an awful man has been harassing many of our people.

159
00:14:59,044 --> 00:15:01,324
Everything's been taken care of now.

160
00:15:03,304 --> 00:15:05,464
Congratulations on your appointment as Commissioner.

161
00:15:05,464 --> 00:15:10,734
Commissioner Park, it seems you'll have a lot on your plate from now on.

162
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:18,684
No changes in our planned schedule?

163
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,984
Yes, there are no changes.

164
00:15:20,984 --> 00:15:26,694
Tell Madam Yang I'll personally see her once my fatigue is relieved.

165
00:15:28,254 --> 00:15:33,084
As you all know, I met many valuable guests on my pilgrimage.

166
00:15:33,084 --> 00:15:36,484
Everyone agreed to come on the designated date,

167
00:15:36,484 --> 00:15:39,104
so please prepare without a hitch.

168
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,354
All right.

169
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:44,404
And if there's anything our Mr. On needs,

170
00:15:44,404 --> 00:15:47,194
please see to them, Commissioner Park.

171
00:15:50,764 --> 00:15:52,994
Yes, Bishop.

172
00:16:04,374 --> 00:16:09,124
He's blatantly treating him like his second-in-command when I'm sitting right there.

173
00:16:18,674 --> 00:16:21,894
 A hyungnim who doesn't like exercise. 

174
00:16:27,794 --> 00:16:30,954
 A hyungnim who doesn't like exercise. 

175
00:16:31,904 --> 00:16:36,684
 I think these final words of Detective Choi were a message to you, Reporter Kim. 

176
00:16:36,684 --> 00:16:40,224
 There's bound to be a hidden meaning. 

177
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:43,344
 Something only you could recognize. 

178
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:46,014
Huh?

179
00:16:46,014 --> 00:16:47,854
Why would I go there? You can go.

180
00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:49,264
Look at this.

181
00:16:49,264 --> 00:16:52,714
They're offering a 1+1 deal for opening, and the timing is perfect. Why not?

182
00:16:52,714 --> 00:16:57,594
You should start exercising, Hyung. How do you call yourself a man? So scrawny.

183
00:16:57,594 --> 00:16:59,484
- I'll pay.
- Forget it.

184
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:01,714
What I hate the most in the world is exercise.

185
00:17:01,714 --> 00:17:06,764
And hey, if I had time for this, I'd rather sleep. I'm so tired.

186
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:08,604
- Gosh, I'm leaving.
- Hey.

187
00:17:09,614 --> 00:17:12,864
I even rented a locker in your name, so you have to go. Okay?

188
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:16,524
No. Gosh, so much nagging. I'm leaving.

189
00:17:16,524 --> 00:17:18,294
- You better go.
- Whatever.

190
00:17:18,294 --> 00:17:19,944
Go.

191
00:17:21,324 --> 00:17:25,474
 I even rented a locker in your name, so you have to go. Okay? 

192
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,664
This way.

193
00:17:37,444 --> 00:17:39,304
It's this one.

194
00:17:40,974 --> 00:17:45,474
I was going to contact you because your locker rental was about to expire.

195
00:17:51,094 --> 00:17:56,064
 

196
00:18:08,214 --> 00:18:11,094
 Dear Yong Min hyung, who hates exercise. 

197
00:18:11,094 --> 00:18:14,474
 If you're reading this, it means you came to exercise. 

198
00:18:14,474 --> 00:18:16,754
 How do you call yourself a man? So scrawny. 

199
00:18:16,754 --> 00:18:18,424
 Gosh, so much nagging. 

200
00:18:18,424 --> 00:18:20,974
 - I'm leaving.
- You better go. 

201
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,904
 You've evolved. 

202
00:18:24,514 --> 00:18:28,404
 We need to catch the bad guys together. 

203
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:36,184
 But just in case, I leave you a gift. 

204
00:18:38,154 --> 00:18:41,204
 
 I believe you'll succeed even without me. 

205
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,964
 
 

206
00:18:43,964 --> 00:18:46,134
 You might not like exercise, 

207
00:18:47,314 --> 00:18:49,904
 but you love the truth. 

208
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:52,994
 Hyung, 

209
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:55,044
 even if I'm not there, make sure... 

210
00:18:57,044 --> 00:19:02,314
 those who commit heinous acts against others are rightfully punished. 

211
00:19:03,384 --> 00:19:05,114
 You must... 

212
00:19:06,214 --> 00:19:08,394
 sit them in a court of law. 

213
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:27,384
He made copies of all the documents and left them in my locker.

214
00:19:29,364 --> 00:19:31,634
Do you think Sung Eun...

215
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:36,004
knew there was a chance he could die?

216
00:19:36,004 --> 00:19:39,464
Detective Choi probably didn't want to give up.

217
00:19:39,464 --> 00:19:41,334
Just like you.

218
00:19:47,634 --> 00:19:51,954
I made a promise to Sung Eun.

219
00:19:51,954 --> 00:19:54,004
That I'll undoubtedly...

220
00:19:55,984 --> 00:19:59,224
sit those bastards down in a court of law.

221
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:07,884
 

222
00:20:18,194 --> 00:20:21,314
 

223
00:20:21,314 --> 00:20:22,724
 
 Detective Choi, 

224
00:20:22,724 --> 00:20:25,574
 I changed your shift with Sergeant Cho's, so you can go home. 

225
00:20:25,574 --> 00:20:26,984
 Stay here. 

226
00:20:27,874 --> 00:20:30,404
 
- Good day.
- Hello.

227
00:20:30,404 --> 00:20:33,134
We're here to take over the confiscated goods to dispose of.

228
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:34,784
 

229
00:20:42,954 --> 00:20:45,174
Come this way.

230
00:20:45,174 --> 00:20:47,704
I'll begin recording.

231
00:20:49,434 --> 00:20:53,264
I'm taking over 21.542 kg.

232
00:20:54,204 --> 00:20:58,424
21.542 kg, confirmed.

233
00:21:05,714 --> 00:21:06,924
 

234
00:21:09,274 --> 00:21:12,414
Yes, 21.542 kg confirmed.

235
00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:37,904
Thank you for your cooperation.

236
00:21:45,334 --> 00:21:49,784
 

237
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:52,944
- Hello.
- Hi.

238
00:21:57,444 --> 00:21:59,564
- Let's go.
- All right.

239
00:21:59,564 --> 00:22:01,844
I'm going to weigh it.

240
00:22:07,194 --> 00:22:11,014
- There's a difference of 1 gram.
- That's odd.

241
00:22:11,014 --> 00:22:14,204
Wait, maybe it's this.

242
00:22:18,874 --> 00:22:21,284
It must've ripped off when we took it out.

243
00:22:21,284 --> 00:22:24,724
21.542 kg, confirmed.

244
00:22:25,694 --> 00:22:28,784
Then we'll proceed with the incineration.

245
00:22:39,294 --> 00:22:41,384
Come on.

246
00:22:47,124 --> 00:22:49,414
Okay, good job!

247
00:22:49,414 --> 00:22:51,744
- Good job.
- Good job!

248
00:22:51,744 --> 00:22:53,994
- All done?
- Yes.

249
00:22:56,524 --> 00:23:00,074
 

250
00:23:09,814 --> 00:23:11,384
All right.

251
00:23:17,334 --> 00:23:20,704
Whoever created this transformer oil deserves a Nobel prize.

252
00:23:20,704 --> 00:23:22,494
It makes the job so easy.

253
00:23:31,634 --> 00:23:34,164
 
Okay, let's go in.

254
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:36,494
You did well.

255
00:23:41,694 --> 00:23:45,164
They smuggled the drugs that should've been incinerated and resold them.

256
00:23:45,164 --> 00:23:47,014
To Black Sun.

257
00:23:47,014 --> 00:23:51,354
The drugs they circulated in the club were Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate.

258
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:53,434
 
The acronym is GHB.

259
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:59,024
When taken with alcohol, it can induce symptoms similar to dementia...

260
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:02,574
- is what it says.
- Dementia?

261
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:05,454
It may seem like the person acts consciously,

262
00:24:05,454 --> 00:24:09,724
but they cannot restrain or remember their acts,

263
00:24:09,724 --> 00:24:14,494
and they're only able to obey simple commands.

264
00:24:16,944 --> 00:24:20,694
 Walk toward the entrance. 

265
00:24:23,454 --> 00:24:28,074
 Cross the street with a smile. 

266
00:24:44,674 --> 00:24:48,064
It has already become a serious problem abroad.

267
00:24:48,064 --> 00:24:51,254
It supposedly turns people into a zombie-like state

268
00:24:51,254 --> 00:24:55,204
so it's also called the rape drug.

269
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:58,414
Most drugs are taken for self-enjoyment.

270
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:02,014
So even though it's illegal, they seek high quality.

271
00:25:02,014 --> 00:25:04,124
But it's the opposite for this drug

272
00:25:04,124 --> 00:25:08,234
since the intent is to use it on someone else.

273
00:25:08,234 --> 00:25:11,724
That's right. So they have absolutely no interest

274
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:15,344
in the after-effects or how harmful it can be to the human body.

275
00:25:15,344 --> 00:25:18,404
Which is why it's that much more dangerous.

276
00:25:19,474 --> 00:25:22,464
How incredible.

277
00:25:22,464 --> 00:25:25,904
A money laundromat for those who desire tax evasion.

278
00:25:25,904 --> 00:25:30,454
A carnival for drug addicts who dream of deviations.

279
00:25:30,454 --> 00:25:37,394
And a money depot for the government authorities who coverup and defend

280
00:25:37,394 --> 00:25:40,464
all these deviations and crimes.

281
00:25:41,554 --> 00:25:47,704
The perfect blind spot was constructed in the middle of the city

282
00:25:47,704 --> 00:25:50,404
where people bustle about.

283
00:25:50,404 --> 00:25:54,264
This is way more than a simple playground.

284
00:25:58,844 --> 00:26:00,894
 

285
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:02,804
 

286
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:07,324
 

287
00:26:07,324 --> 00:26:08,394
 

288
00:26:09,294 --> 00:26:10,534
 

289
00:26:15,414 --> 00:26:18,064
 
 

290
00:26:18,064 --> 00:26:22,674
If it's the perfectly constructed blind spot, as you said, Mr. Jang,

291
00:26:22,674 --> 00:26:25,664
we can't beat them by dealing with them one by one.

292
00:26:26,824 --> 00:26:31,884
We must take all of them down in one move.

293
00:26:50,444 --> 00:26:53,824
I was really shocked.

294
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:59,044
Who knew the police would deliver our goods?

295
00:26:59,044 --> 00:27:02,564
I would never have imagined!

296
00:27:02,564 --> 00:27:05,454
How should we repay them?

297
00:27:05,454 --> 00:27:08,594
I've heard a lot about you.

298
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:13,694
Mr. On, why did you introduce such a lovely person to me only now?

299
00:27:13,694 --> 00:27:15,334
When you frequent my business?

300
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:19,384
Oh, my. This is your place, Commissioner?

301
00:27:19,384 --> 00:27:22,384
I thought it was Mr. On's.

302
00:27:22,384 --> 00:27:27,054
I guess Bishop trusts someone other than Mr. On, too.

303
00:27:27,054 --> 00:27:29,044
Commissioner is good at running a business.

304
00:27:29,044 --> 00:27:32,024
Mr. On, you've been through a lot all this time,

305
00:27:32,024 --> 00:27:36,164
so if there's anything you need, let me know right away.

306
00:27:36,164 --> 00:27:39,584
No need to be cautious.

307
00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:46,054
I really don't need to be cautious?

308
00:27:46,054 --> 00:27:49,624
That's when you used to be the police superintendent's lackey.

309
00:27:49,624 --> 00:27:54,944
The head doesn't need to be cautious.

310
00:27:58,214 --> 00:27:59,814
Cheers.

311
00:28:01,484 --> 00:28:06,604
I can see why Bishop trusts Mr. On so much.

312
00:28:06,604 --> 00:28:09,544
This is the world's safest delivery route.

313
00:28:09,544 --> 00:28:13,484
I'm loving this method.

314
00:28:14,874 --> 00:28:19,084
The first order is complete. The second order will also be processed as scheduled.

315
00:28:19,084 --> 00:28:24,334
Okay. Once the second order is complete, let's launder our money then, too.

316
00:28:24,334 --> 00:28:29,024
I'll burn 5,000 to Hong Kong and 2,000 to Bishop.

317
00:28:30,604 --> 00:28:33,754
- That's what I'll report to him.
- Okay!

318
00:28:41,184 --> 00:28:43,564
Commissioner, I have urgent news.

319
00:28:43,564 --> 00:28:45,474
Yes, it's okay. You may speak.

320
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,804
A problem occurred while dealing with the club's new guard.

321
00:28:48,804 --> 00:28:51,224
A new guard?

322
00:28:51,224 --> 00:28:53,444
Must I involve myself in all that, too?

323
00:28:53,444 --> 00:28:54,544
Oh, right.

324
00:28:54,544 --> 00:28:59,084
It's been ages since I asked for Guard No. 9. Why don't I see him yet?

325
00:29:04,234 --> 00:29:07,114
The menu setting is complete. Should I tell them to bring it?

326
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:10,204
Bring Guard No. 9 that Madame mentioned, along with the menu.

327
00:29:10,204 --> 00:29:13,874
The problematic guard is No. 9, so he isn't here.

328
00:29:13,874 --> 00:29:16,504
Why? Did he quit?

329
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,864
Look at the way things are running.

330
00:29:18,864 --> 00:29:20,694
Who the hell is Guard No. 9?

331
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:23,704
The previous guards all went off the grid, so we hired him through HR.

332
00:29:23,704 --> 00:29:27,334
But dubious events kept arising afterward.

333
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:30,364
He's also Victor's friend.

334
00:29:30,364 --> 00:29:32,614
Victor's friend?

335
00:29:32,614 --> 00:29:37,104
There were consecutive delivery accidents after he started working, too.

336
00:29:37,104 --> 00:29:41,344
He stopped the business, so I was also forced to take the can multiple times.

337
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:44,494
What the hell are you guys talking about? Shit!

338
00:29:44,494 --> 00:29:49,464
By chance, could I take a look at the photo of that new guard?

339
00:29:49,464 --> 00:29:52,074
- Oh, yes.
- I want to see it, too.

340
00:29:52,074 --> 00:29:53,644
Here you go.

341
00:29:55,214 --> 00:29:58,144
Yes, this is Guard No. 9!

342
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,884
Gosh.

343
00:30:07,364 --> 00:30:08,954
This man...

344
00:30:09,944 --> 00:30:12,724
was here at Black Sun?

345
00:30:12,724 --> 00:30:14,054
What the hell?

346
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:16,334
Yes.

347
00:30:18,474 --> 00:30:20,564
He's still alive?

348
00:30:22,764 --> 00:30:24,744
Kim Do Gi...

349
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,944
was here?

350
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:44,594
 

351
00:30:45,634 --> 00:30:47,014
Spread out!

352
00:30:47,034 --> 00:30:48,834
Search!

353
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:50,984
Go!

354
00:31:34,614 --> 00:31:38,494
There are a bunch of temporary closure signs, and no one's here.

355
00:31:59,504 --> 00:32:03,494
- Bishop, I must tell you something-
- The Lord be with you.

356
00:32:06,264 --> 00:32:08,694
Thanks be to God.

357
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:11,914
You're in a rush, which is unlike you.

358
00:32:11,914 --> 00:32:14,654
I think it'll be a good idea to postpone the date.

359
00:32:14,654 --> 00:32:19,204
There's a dubious factor, so I'll reset the date once that's resolved.

360
00:32:21,744 --> 00:32:27,194
Our Ha Joon must be fearful of that nasty fellow.

361
00:32:31,264 --> 00:32:36,514
Proceed with the original schedule.

362
00:32:36,514 --> 00:32:40,464
And greet the guests who've agreed to come that day.

363
00:32:40,464 --> 00:32:43,814
If there happens to be a setback,

364
00:32:43,814 --> 00:32:49,584
that reflects your inability to see things through.

365
00:32:49,584 --> 00:32:52,854
I've said something unnecessary.

366
00:32:52,854 --> 00:32:55,224
I'll proceed without any setbacks.

367
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,834
Amen.

368
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:10,711
 

369
00:33:17,991 --> 00:33:20,011
Yes.

370
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:21,991
Did you construct a plan?

371
00:33:23,021 --> 00:33:26,051
Mr. Kim, it took quite a while this time.

372
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,491
 

373
00:33:41,301 --> 00:33:42,491
 

374
00:33:42,491 --> 00:33:44,681
Okay, we should go.

375
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:50,811
- How much is it?
- It's 20,000 won.

376
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:52,851
- Thank you.
- Hyungnim!

377
00:33:52,851 --> 00:33:55,101
- Come again.
- Okay!

378
00:34:03,111 --> 00:34:05,441
Aigoo, everyone got here before I did.

379
00:34:05,441 --> 00:34:07,161
Of course.

380
00:34:22,031 --> 00:34:26,561
 

381
00:34:35,361 --> 00:34:36,801
Aigoo...

382
00:35:09,061 --> 00:35:11,381
Why are there so many today?

383
00:35:11,381 --> 00:35:15,131
- I don't know, either.
- How odd.

384
00:35:34,661 --> 00:35:38,681
Mr. On, aren't you being too sensitive?

385
00:35:38,681 --> 00:35:41,201
I think you're overreacting.

386
00:35:41,201 --> 00:35:43,721
Being sensitive is better than being oblivious.

387
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,681
What we need right now is to overreact.

388
00:35:55,241 --> 00:35:57,341
Shit, what the hell?

389
00:36:01,371 --> 00:36:06,301
They're restoring the road ahead. Should we go around it?

390
00:36:07,591 --> 00:36:11,251
The road ahead of them is being restored. Should they go around it?

391
00:36:12,341 --> 00:36:14,351
No.

392
00:36:14,351 --> 00:36:17,211
Don't go around it and just keep going.

393
00:36:19,451 --> 00:36:23,221
Go ahead as planned. We'll keep the roads open.

394
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:45,801
They got through without a turn of events.

395
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:11,061
We received the goods without a problem.

396
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:13,341
We'll head over now.

397
00:37:35,091 --> 00:37:38,481
See? Nothing happened.

398
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:42,071
This is unusual.

399
00:37:42,071 --> 00:37:45,971
After all this, I wouldn't show up if it were me.

400
00:37:48,201 --> 00:37:50,821
The enemy isn't weak,

401
00:37:50,821 --> 00:37:53,241
you're just too strong, Mr. On.

402
00:37:53,991 --> 00:37:55,921
You can rest assured.

403
00:38:01,961 --> 00:38:04,861
I'm going to leave first.

404
00:38:06,391 --> 00:38:09,101
He doesn't even appreciate a compliment.

405
00:38:18,441 --> 00:38:21,041
 

406
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:27,841
As you see, regular customers can't come in today.

407
00:38:29,091 --> 00:38:30,761
Please enter.

408
00:38:38,571 --> 00:38:40,091
What's up?

409
00:38:40,091 --> 00:38:41,901
Thank you very much.

410
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:48,671
Is Bishop not coming?

411
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:53,171
He asked me to relay that this place wasn't suitable for the clergy.

412
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:56,971
Geez, out of all things, he worries about that.

413
00:38:56,971 --> 00:39:01,831
After gathering all these precious guests from his pilgrimage.

414
00:39:01,831 --> 00:39:03,921
Hey, cheers!

415
00:39:12,681 --> 00:39:14,331
Hey, there.

416
00:39:24,801 --> 00:39:26,191
One.

417
00:39:27,001 --> 00:39:28,461
Two.

418
00:39:28,461 --> 00:39:29,701
Three.

419
00:39:30,711 --> 00:39:32,221
Yes!

420
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:42,221
My life would be different if I could have even one of these bags.

421
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:45,581
Your life could be different if you keep eating canned mackerel, too.

422
00:39:45,581 --> 00:39:46,851
Isn't that right?

423
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,521
Shut up and get back to work.

424
00:39:54,381 --> 00:39:55,901
Next.

425
00:40:09,771 --> 00:40:12,131
Hey, Boss, this is Floyd.

426
00:40:12,131 --> 00:40:15,611
Something very suspicious is going on.

427
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:25,281
Excuse me. Yes.
(In Japanese)

428
00:40:26,411 --> 00:40:28,571
It's okay. It's okay.
(In Japanese)

429
00:40:30,621 --> 00:40:32,831
 

430
00:40:42,461 --> 00:40:44,401
Yes, is everything done?

431
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:46,301
 

432
00:40:46,301 --> 00:40:47,611
Why?

433
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,571
It's not over yet?

434
00:40:49,571 --> 00:40:51,181
Well, you see...

435
00:40:51,181 --> 00:40:53,211
the thing is...

436
00:40:57,171 --> 00:41:00,341
The situation seems to have gone awry here.

437
00:41:00,341 --> 00:41:02,071
Mr. On!

438
00:41:02,071 --> 00:41:04,411
Mr. On!

439
00:41:08,641 --> 00:41:10,421
Mr. On,

440
00:41:10,421 --> 00:41:13,881
do you find this funny? I don't like this kind of joke.

441
00:41:13,881 --> 00:41:18,101
What's all this flour, and where the hell are my goods?

442
00:41:22,901 --> 00:41:26,601
We distributed the goods as soon as they arrived.

443
00:41:26,601 --> 00:41:30,431
Everyone was waiting, so we rushed right to it.

444
00:41:34,011 --> 00:41:38,341
Where are the goods I sent?

445
00:41:38,341 --> 00:41:40,431
What is the meaning of this?

446
00:41:42,431 --> 00:41:44,661
Why are you asking us?

447
00:41:44,661 --> 00:41:46,621
We have no idea.

448
00:41:48,351 --> 00:41:52,431
That's the wrong answer in this type of situation.

449
00:41:52,431 --> 00:41:56,171
We just brought it right over as you ordered.

450
00:41:56,171 --> 00:42:00,241
You said not to stop the car, so we couldn't even stop for the restroom.

451
00:42:00,241 --> 00:42:04,511
Hey, don't you know how important this is?

452
00:42:04,511 --> 00:42:07,131
Does Bishop know about all this?

453
00:42:12,921 --> 00:42:14,251
What the hell?

454
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:40,581
You bastards dare to stab me in the back?

455
00:42:40,581 --> 00:42:44,321
Are you sure you didn't give us the wrong goods in the first place? Huh?

456
00:42:45,871 --> 00:42:48,541
- What's the problem? Are you okay?
- My head...

457
00:42:48,541 --> 00:42:50,461
Sunbae!

458
00:42:50,461 --> 00:42:55,411
You bastards. You dare mess with the police?

459
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:02,201
Sunbaenim!

460
00:43:05,641 --> 00:43:07,881
Shit!

461
00:43:09,251 --> 00:43:10,971
Kill them all!

462
00:43:10,971 --> 00:43:12,721
Stop them!

463
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:23,011
Sunbaenim!

464
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:34,761
Shit.

465
00:43:44,241 --> 00:43:46,261
No way.

466
00:43:47,441 --> 00:43:49,571
This isn't possible.

467
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:12,351
Kim Do Gi.

468
00:45:17,221 --> 00:45:21,721
 
 The drugs confiscated this time are a large amount weighing over 200 kg, 

469
00:45:21,721 --> 00:45:27,161
and will be transferred to the incineration plant as per protocol.

470
00:45:27,161 --> 00:45:31,041
 Currently, we arrested eight gang members 

471
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:34,051
 
 and we're chasing down the final remaining member. 

472
00:45:34,051 --> 00:45:37,991
 The police will pay extra attention to the drug crimes... 

473
00:45:57,211 --> 00:46:00,441
Aigoo, what should we do?

474
00:46:00,441 --> 00:46:02,251
What's the problem this time?

475
00:46:02,251 --> 00:46:04,331
I brought out the wrong log.

476
00:46:04,331 --> 00:46:06,391
- We'll put it back.
- No, no. Wait.

477
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:09,771
As per protocol, I must accompany you inside.

478
00:46:09,771 --> 00:46:12,891
Of course, you should!

479
00:46:17,651 --> 00:46:20,221
- Excuse me.
- Be careful.

480
00:46:20,221 --> 00:46:23,141
- You should be careful.
- Let's go.

481
00:46:29,741 --> 00:46:32,721
Exactly! I forgot again.

482
00:46:32,721 --> 00:46:35,611
- I'm sorry. What rank are you?
- I've been around a long time.

483
00:46:35,611 --> 00:46:37,641
Oh, is that so?

484
00:46:37,641 --> 00:46:40,021
- All done.
- Okay, okay.

485
00:46:40,021 --> 00:46:42,241
You put it back.

486
00:46:46,181 --> 00:46:47,371
Aigoo...

487
00:46:48,331 --> 00:46:49,841
You dropped your key.

488
00:46:49,841 --> 00:46:51,421
Gosh.

489
00:46:55,001 --> 00:46:58,501
Geez, there's a hole in my pocket.

490
00:46:58,571 --> 00:47:00,851
Gosh, I need a new one.

491
00:47:04,841 --> 00:47:07,041
Mission complete.

492
00:47:13,421 --> 00:47:15,511
I'm also connected.

493
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:30,381
It takes five minutes to update the connection.

494
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:32,771
You must come back out before then.

495
00:47:32,771 --> 00:47:34,491
Of course.

496
00:47:34,491 --> 00:47:38,521
That scale is useless. We must use the scale inside.

497
00:47:38,521 --> 00:47:40,311
See?

498
00:47:40,311 --> 00:47:43,121
Hyungnim, you're the one who suggested bringing this.

499
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:45,181
Huh? What are you doing? Put it back.

500
00:47:45,181 --> 00:47:47,881
- I mean...
- Hurry and put it back.

501
00:47:47,881 --> 00:47:49,641
Hurry!

502
00:47:50,721 --> 00:47:52,761
Gosh.

503
00:47:58,901 --> 00:48:01,621
All right, let's go and switch it up.

504
00:48:05,621 --> 00:48:09,601
 The CCTV is off. You have four minutes left. 

505
00:48:20,181 --> 00:48:24,261
 Make sure not to mix up the flour and the actual drugs, okay? 

506
00:48:40,201 --> 00:48:42,721
It's 198.26 kg.

507
00:48:42,721 --> 00:48:46,071
Don't worry. I'll match it in one try.

508
00:49:00,911 --> 00:49:02,691
It's missing a gram.

509
00:49:06,781 --> 00:49:08,421
It's one gram over.

510
00:49:08,421 --> 00:49:09,891
Damn it.

511
00:49:10,861 --> 00:49:12,311
Better?

512
00:49:12,311 --> 00:49:15,331
- It's missing a gram again.
- One gram is fine.

513
00:49:15,331 --> 00:49:17,021
No, it's not.

514
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:21,441
Mr. Kim Do Gi said we must match exactly 198.26 kg.

515
00:49:21,441 --> 00:49:24,341
One gram is enough to inject 30 people.

516
00:49:24,341 --> 00:49:27,711
 We're not measuring accurately for no reason. 

517
00:49:32,211 --> 00:49:35,261
Okay! That's it. Don't touch it...

518
00:49:57,351 --> 00:49:59,281
Hello.

519
00:50:19,301 --> 00:50:20,961
Oh, shit...

520
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:30,311
The road ahead of them is being restored.

521
00:50:30,311 --> 00:50:32,291
Should they go around it?

522
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:34,231
No.

523
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:37,031
Don't go around it and just keep going.

524
00:50:44,661 --> 00:50:48,331
 He'll show up without a doubt. 

525
00:51:12,091 --> 00:51:14,841
 Mr. On, we have a problem! 

526
00:51:14,841 --> 00:51:17,441
 They're all in my room... 

527
00:52:24,261 --> 00:52:27,371
My hunch about you wasn't wrong.

528
00:52:27,371 --> 00:52:30,051
You're such an amusing hyungnim.

529
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:43,461
I'll see you soon.

530
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:46,071
I'll kill you myself.

531
00:52:55,971 --> 00:52:58,371
- Hey!
- Catch them all!

532
00:53:39,661 --> 00:53:42,801
 
 Do you admit the charges? 

533
00:53:42,801 --> 00:53:44,801
 Do you admit it? 

534
00:53:47,271 --> 00:53:50,891
Aren't we sending them off too easily?

535
00:53:50,891 --> 00:53:54,571
You're right. I feel like we're being too lenient.

536
00:53:54,571 --> 00:53:56,891
That's right. You might feel that way.

537
00:53:56,891 --> 00:54:03,261
But escorting our clients to their desired destination is our first principle.

538
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:06,221
I approve.

539
00:54:07,981 --> 00:54:12,611
- Okay.
- Mr. Park and Mr. Choi also approve.

540
00:54:15,681 --> 00:54:20,491
Reporter Kim Yong Min wanted to sit these guys down in a court of law.

541
00:54:23,431 --> 00:54:26,541
 The words of the crimes related to a famous, large-scale club in Seoul, 

542
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:30,771
 aka the Black Sun case, is sending a shockwave. 

543
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:36,421
 Drugs, violence, abduction, sexual assault, tax evasion, and other major crimes 

544
00:54:36,421 --> 00:54:40,831
 took place right in the middle of Seoul, Korea. 

545
00:54:40,831 --> 00:54:43,691
 The fact that government authorities, including the police 

546
00:54:43,691 --> 00:54:46,261
 were involved in these illegal activities 

547
00:54:46,261 --> 00:54:49,041
 added to the nation's shock. 

548
00:54:49,041 --> 00:54:52,621
 The government said it will also keep a close eye on this case, 

549
00:54:52,621 --> 00:54:56,171
 and make sure to thoroughly investigate, 

550
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:58,781
 so no one is left in the wrong. 

551
00:55:03,011 --> 00:55:07,691
Case number 2022, collaboration 1135.

552
00:55:07,691 --> 00:55:10,561
Defendants Yoo Mun Hyun,

553
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:12,741
Jang Jin Ho,

554
00:55:12,741 --> 00:55:14,481
Lim Jong Seon,

555
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:15,951
Yang Mi Kyung.

556
00:55:15,951 --> 00:55:20,081
As the administrator of an adult entertainment business, Defendant Yoo Mun Hyun

557
00:55:20,081 --> 00:55:27,121
illegally distributed the drug GHB within Black Sun for financial gains,

558
00:55:27,121 --> 00:55:32,501
and abet the sex crimes using drugs that occurred within Black Sun.

559
00:55:32,501 --> 00:55:35,321
As his illegal activities were exposed,

560
00:55:35,321 --> 00:55:38,371
he collaborated with Jang Jin Ho and Jo Min Keun,

561
00:55:38,371 --> 00:55:43,621
to murder Jungsam Police Station's Detective Choi Sung Eun.

562
00:55:43,621 --> 00:55:44,941
I didn't kill anyone!

563
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:47,171
These bastards are the ones who did all that!

564
00:55:47,171 --> 00:55:49,111
Hey, Lawyer. What are you doing?

565
00:55:49,111 --> 00:55:51,061
This bastard ordered us to do everything!

566
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:54,711
- Defendants! Please be quiet!
- This asshole is responsible for everything!

567
00:55:54,711 --> 00:55:56,531
Hey, take your hands off my body!

568
00:55:56,531 --> 00:55:58,481
Please be quiet!

569
00:55:58,481 --> 00:56:05,411
Thus, defendants Yoo Mun Hyun, Jang Jin Ho, Lim Jong Seon, and Yang Mi Kyung

570
00:56:05,411 --> 00:56:08,811
are sentenced to life imprisonment.

571
00:56:08,811 --> 00:56:13,061
 While the prosecution has placed the key figure of this case, Chief Park Hyeon Jo, 

572
00:56:13,061 --> 00:56:14,911
 on the wanted list. 

573
00:56:14,911 --> 00:56:21,141
 They will be investigating everyone who attempted to destroy evidence .

574
00:56:23,121 --> 00:56:26,371
Mr. On, what do we do now?

575
00:56:26,401 --> 00:56:30,501
The Regional Investigation Unit is chasing me. Do something about that, Mr. On!

576
00:56:42,341 --> 00:56:45,511
An asshole betrayed us along the way.

577
00:56:45,511 --> 00:56:47,371
I'm certain of it.

578
00:56:57,251 --> 00:57:00,871
Who betrayed us isn't what's important right now.

579
00:57:08,211 --> 00:57:13,371
What's important is who will resolve this situation?

580
00:57:13,371 --> 00:57:17,041
- Mr. On!
- What should we do, Commissioner?

581
00:57:17,041 --> 00:57:21,921
You're about to retire dishonorably without getting to sit in your Commissioner's seat.

582
00:57:45,415 --> 00:57:49,015
 We received news of the unjust death of Detective Choi 

583
00:57:49,015 --> 00:57:51,705
 who died while investigating Black Sun's drug case. 

584
00:57:51,705 --> 00:57:55,295
 The appeals for the perpetrators charged with murdering Detective Choi Sung Eun 

585
00:57:55,295 --> 00:57:57,205
 are scheduled to be held today. 

586
00:57:57,205 --> 00:58:00,685
 To cover up their crimes once they've been exposed, 

587
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:04,155
 they murdered Detective Choi and set it up as a suicide- 

588
00:58:07,205 --> 00:58:08,875
I...

589
00:58:09,935 --> 00:58:13,265
don't support your method.

590
00:58:13,265 --> 00:58:18,995
Of course, Detective Choi's unjust death has been revealed, thanks to you,

591
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:23,635
and we were able to sit those bastards in a court of law.

592
00:58:23,635 --> 00:58:26,685
But it wasn't a fair method.

593
00:58:26,685 --> 00:58:32,485
If there comes a day when the world listens to your words, Reporter Kim,

594
00:58:32,485 --> 00:58:35,645
people like me will choose to disappear.

595
00:58:39,025 --> 00:58:42,495
I have a twisted personality,

596
00:58:42,495 --> 00:58:44,525
so I have trouble saying thank you.

597
00:58:44,525 --> 00:58:47,575
So what I want to say is...

598
00:58:47,575 --> 00:58:50,495
call me if you want to grab a beer.

599
00:59:12,485 --> 00:59:16,865
The total fare came out quite low for a premium taxi.

600
00:59:16,865 --> 00:59:21,655
I thought maybe you'd give me a free ride since you kept quiet on the way,

601
00:59:21,655 --> 00:59:25,075
but who knew you'd actually run the meter?

602
00:59:25,075 --> 00:59:28,195
There's no free taxi in the world.

603
00:59:28,195 --> 00:59:30,345
That is true.

604
00:59:38,705 --> 00:59:41,445
Hey, well...

605
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:44,185
it wasn't fair,

606
00:59:45,355 --> 00:59:47,375
but it was just.

607
00:59:58,815 --> 01:00:03,765
Sunbaenim, the appeal for those related to Black Sun is starting now.

608
01:00:03,765 --> 01:00:05,085
Okay, did you grab a nice spot?

609
01:00:05,085 --> 01:00:08,925
The spot you told me about is the perfect spot.

610
01:00:13,435 --> 01:00:17,415
 The court dismissed the appeal of the criminal charges against Officer Jang 

611
01:00:17,415 --> 01:00:21,235
 for murdering Detective Choi, along with Black Sun's key figure Mr. Yoo and others 

612
01:00:21,235 --> 01:00:23,005
 and sentenced them to life imprisonment. 

613
01:00:23,005 --> 01:00:25,815
 The Justice Department added that their criminal methods and intentions were very heinous 

614
01:00:25,815 --> 01:00:29,785
 that there was a need to isolate them from society. 

615
01:00:29,785 --> 01:00:33,415
 Meanwhile, celebrity Victor received a sentence of 10 years 

616
01:00:33,415 --> 01:00:36,495
 and is currently serving in Northern Prison. 

617
01:00:36,495 --> 01:00:39,875
 In reality, he will be driven out of the entertainment industry for good. 

618
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:43,785
 For the criminals to receive proper punishment rather than a slap on the wrist, 

619
01:00:43,785 --> 01:00:48,335
 people's continuous attention is needed to keep them accountable. 

620
01:00:48,335 --> 01:00:51,685
 This was Reporter Kim Yong Min from Hanbaek News. 

621
01:00:57,875 --> 01:01:00,925
Dispatch 5283, complete.

622
01:01:03,135 --> 01:01:04,885
Good job.

623
01:01:18,195 --> 01:01:20,425
According to your orders,

624
01:01:20,425 --> 01:01:24,235
I've arranged it so things will wrap up at Superintendent Park's end.

625
01:01:24,235 --> 01:01:28,025
That seems to be taken care of.

626
01:01:30,805 --> 01:01:33,775
How should I take care of you?

627
01:01:45,995 --> 01:01:51,575
Ha Joon, do you know why you lost to that kid, Kim Do Gi?

628
01:01:51,575 --> 01:01:55,045
It was arrogance to think you would win.

629
01:01:59,055 --> 01:02:03,645
That arrogance made you blind.

630
01:02:04,645 --> 01:02:09,515
What more can I expect from someone who's become blind?

631
01:02:10,365 --> 01:02:12,905
Please give me...

632
01:02:12,905 --> 01:02:15,645
one more chance.

633
01:02:40,605 --> 01:02:43,755
I'll personally end...

634
01:02:43,755 --> 01:02:47,955
Kim Do Gi's life with my own hands.

635
01:03:23,165 --> 01:03:25,695
 

636
01:03:55,145 --> 01:04:00,145
Could you tell me what you have been through?

637
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:07,870
 Thanks for watching Taxi Driver 2 on Viki! 

638
01:04:12,495 --> 01:04:16,635
♫  The other day, is it a different fate?  ♫

639
01:04:16,635 --> 01:04:20,305
 

640
01:04:20,305 --> 01:04:24,425
♫  When I open my eyes in my next life  ♫

641
01:04:24,425 --> 01:04:27,335
♫  When you come again  ♫

642
01:04:27,335 --> 01:04:30,025
♫  Will you be able to recognize me  ♫

643
01:04:30,025 --> 01:04:32,845
♫  When I've changed so much  ♫

644
01:04:32,845 --> 01:04:36,375
♫  I'm unfamiliar to myself  ♫

645
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:42,515
♫  A darkness like being underwater where your feet don't reach  ♫

646
01:04:42,515 --> 01:04:50,485
 

647
01:04:50,485 --> 01:04:52,605
 You must always win a fight. 

648
01:04:52,605 --> 01:04:55,395
 Being weak is very bad, Ha Joon. 

649
01:04:55,395 --> 01:04:57,145
 These guys were all in it together. 

650
01:04:57,145 --> 01:05:00,935
 When and where would a crazy bastard appear? 

651
01:05:00,935 --> 01:05:02,435
 Here. Right now. 

652
01:05:02,435 --> 01:05:04,825
 You can't leave here alive. 

653
01:05:04,825 --> 01:05:06,445
 These are all the kids you killed.

01:05:06,445 --> 01:05:08,225
 I pray every time I look at their photos. 

655
01:05:08,225 --> 01:05:11,235
 Put aside the bullshit, you crazy bastard. 

656
01:05:11,235 --> 01:05:14,975
 Go Eun probably means a lot to you, right, Hyungnim? 

657
01:05:14,975 --> 01:05:17,825
 Do you think she's dead or alive? 

658
01:05:17,825 --> 01:05:19,605
 I'm going to kill you. 

659
01:05:19,605 --> 01:05:23,455
 That's why I'll show you what it feels like when the people 

660
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:25,785
 you treasure and love get crushed. 

661
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:29,275
 Because they didn't forget, 

662
01:05:29,275 --> 01:05:32,485
 I was able to show up in front of you guys. 

663
01:05:33,855 --> 01:05:35,915
 - Cheers!
- Cheers. 

664
01:05:35,915 --> 01:05:37,745
 Heed my words. 

665
01:05:37,745 --> 01:05:40,315
 There are things you can only retrieve by remembering. 

666
01:05:40,315 --> 01:05:44,600
