1
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,060
 

2
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,750
 Recently, at a factory, a worker died by getting stuck in a machine. But there's a big controversy because 

3
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,950
 the factory was back in operation just after three hours after his death. 
 

4
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,360
 The group says it was the worker's personal mistake, 

5
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,710
 not a work accident... 

6
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,530
 
 A man who indiscriminately 

7
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,430
 assaulted a woman who was returning home alone 

8
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,000
 
 was given a five-year sentence from the first trial. 

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,960
 
 The man, who works for a security company, 

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,240
 insists that he was in a weak state mentally during the incident since he was drunk 

11
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,280
 and asked for a favorable arrangement. 
 

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,920
This is unfortunate news.

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,640
 The administrators of a website that were sentenced to three years in prison during the first trial 

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,950
 for spreading illegal pornographic materials are awaiting an appeal. 

15
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,860
 And one of the victims made a drastic choice in the meantime. 

16
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,750
 Her family said the victim expressed extreme distress due to 

17
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,150
 the attackers' continuous threats. 

18
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,780
 When this news came out, the internet was enraged 

19
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,510
 and demanded the judicial branch a harsh punishment. 

20
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,790
 

21
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:53,360


22
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,370
 No. 5283 is going to court. 

23
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,260
 Come to the convoy area. 

24
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,460
 The administrator of the illegal chatroom sites are getting a verdict for their appeal today. 

25
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,360
 Perpetrator A disguised as a woman 

26
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,510
 and through video chats, he 

27
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,180
 got footage of the minor victims... 

28
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,300
Get off me!

29
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,160
I heard you'd be on probation today after the appeal.

30
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,270
Geez, you do get special treatment for hiring a former officer.

31
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,530
I'd better.

32
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,550
I spent a fortune on him.

33
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,930
Call me when you get out.

34
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,950
I'll make a spot for you.

35
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:26,850
 

36
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,410
You secured the footage from before things exploded, right?

37
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,990
Yes.

38
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,220
- Do you know what this is?
- What is it, Hyungnim?

39
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,520
It's a combination of a subway locker.

40
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,490
There's a down payment for the 2-year subscription in it.

41
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,290
Is this note money, then?

42
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,810
Did you get subscribers in prison, too, Hyungnim?

43
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,150
Hey, there are at least tens of thousands of viewers waiting for us just in Korea.

44
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,410
When there's a great demand, we have to supply.

45
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,710
We have to get ready to make money in advance, you punks.

46
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,650
I respect you so much, Hyungnim.

47
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,620
But even if we get out, we'd be on probation.

48
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,350
- Would it be okay to get back to it, Hyungnim?
- Geez!

49
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,900
Get a puppet boss,

50
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,480
and start a paid site using a foreign server.

51
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,630
Honestly, I thought we'd rot in prison for several years.

52
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,290
They couldn't stop talking about us on TV.

53
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,420
Do you know why?

54
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,480
Isn't it because you got a lawyer who was a former officer?

55
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,510
He already forgot all about us.

56
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,490
This is why I love this country!

57
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,090
I agree, Hyungnim.

58
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,660
Hey, you.

59
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,580
Put the seat belts on.

60
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:48,370
Put. The. Seat. Belt. On.

61
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,420
Seriously, hey.

62
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,310
- Did you talk to us just now?
- Hey!

63
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,550
Let's not cause trouble at the end and just put the belt on.

64
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,860
Hey! Hey!

65
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,250
You definitely got injured, right?

66
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,440
What are you doing?

67
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,120
Come out.

68
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,320
Hyungnim, let me take it off.

69
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,320
Where are we?

70
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,490
Get in! Right now!

71
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,720
Alright!

72
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,320
My throat stings so much.

73
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,730
Hey.

74
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,470
Let's celebrate our success first.

75
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,180
Open one for me, too.

76
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,310
Wow. Hey!

77
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,370
You suffered so much being locked up.

78
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,060
Alright, cheers!

79
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,080
By the way,

80
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,180
who are you...

81
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,380
Me? I'm a subscriber.

82
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,810
A subscriber?

83
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:33,140
I'm an avid subscriber to the site you people made.

84
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,220
I heard it'd all be over once you attend court like this.

85
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,030
That'd be...

86
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,650
too simple, wouldn't it?

87
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,500
Hyungnim.

88
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,170
Hyungnim, I think you should get up.

89
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,390
Hyungnim!

90
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,900
- What happened?
- Hyungnim!

91
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,700
- I think you should come here.
- What is it?

92
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,560
 ...they were imprisoned. 

93
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,080
 In the process of escaping, they assaulted the prison guard who was escorting them 

94
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,770
 and even stole his gun. 

95
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,940
That looks like us.

96
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,900
What are you talking about? She said they stole a gun.

97
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,580
- That's not us!
- I'm sorry, Hyungnim.

98
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,290
Hey! Hey! What's that?

99
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,270
W-W-W-Why are you holding that?

100
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,050
I-I don't know, either!

101
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,670
 They decided to put them on the wanted list. 

102
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,510
 - The escaped prisoners... 
- Look!

103
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,840
That's really us!

104
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,880
What did I tell you?

105
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,700
- What's going on?
 - And they committed hijacking as well. 

106
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,630
 They could get life imprisonment for this. 

107
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,710
- "Life imprisonment?"
- Damn it!

108
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,270
Hey! Call the police right now!

109
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,830
Call them and say that we're turning ourselves in! Hurry!

110
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,720
Geez!

111
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,520
It would've been over after the appeal.

112
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,870
Why would we escape unless we got shot in the head?

113
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,690
Why aren't you calling right now?

114
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,420
- It's password-protected, Hyungnim!
- Shit!

115
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,090
 Their hideout just got confirmed. 

116
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,830
 The special forces are approaching them right now. 

117
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,820
What the hell...

118
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,360
Freeze!

119
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,260
Please...

120
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,520
We didn't escape!

121
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,550
We didn't.

122
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,750
We really didn't do it!

123
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,910
I don't want those punks to stay comfortably in prison, either.

124
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,720
They won't be able to.

125
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,100
When the people who gave them those notes

126
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,300
find out their subscription payment for two years disappeared,

127
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,590
they won't just sit back.

128
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,000
Subscription payment for two years?

129
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,580
It'd be our taxi fares.

130
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,680
Mr. Jang already went to collect it.

131
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,730
Driver Kim Do Gi asked me to thank you for putting them in prison.

132
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,100
We'll take care of it when they come out.

133
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,410
I can't ask that from someone who's studying abroad.

134
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,280
I won't be able to see you again,

135
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,160
but I wish you all the luck wherever you are.

136
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,820
Be healthy, Prosecutor Kang Ha Na.

137
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,920
I got the taxi fare.

138
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,830
I thought we'd lose gas money on the case.

139
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,440
As expected of him.

140
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,060
Okay, shall we get going?

141
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,630
 

142
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:00,670
 

143
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,910
Thank you for all of your hard work.

144
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,840
So do you have plans after this?

145
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,180
I'll be going back to where I worked before.

146
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,190
Me, too. Thankfully, there was a spot for me.

147
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,670
Wow, you must've been good workers.

148
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,320
How about you, Go Eun?

149
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,370
I'm taking a civil servant exam next week.

150
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,280
- What?
- Doesn't that take several years to prepare?

151
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,490
Are you just taking it as practice? As a warm-up?

152
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:54,150
- Hold on, shouldn't we get you taffies or something?
- Geez!

153
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,720
We don't do taffies these days.

154
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,650
- What?
- What is it, then?

155
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,640
- Who eats taffies these days?
- You give them chocolates.

156
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,840
This is a gift to wish you success.

157
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,600
Good luck with the exam.

158
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,540
This is it!

159
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,090
How about you, Mr. Kim?

160
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,040
What's your next plan, Mr. Kim?

161
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,500
I'm thinking of taking trips wherever I feel like.

162
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,190
How about you, sir?

163
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,630
Thank you for everything.

164
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,670
I was able to start, thanks to you.

165
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,170
And I was able to stop, thanks to you, too.

166
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,540
Some people return to where they belong,

167
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,930
some people have a fresh start,

168
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,760
and some people leave, but...

169
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,200
 I hope all of you are happy 

170
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,130
 and feel peaceful 

171
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,430
 wherever you would be. 

172
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,800
 

173
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,220
Where are all the others?

174
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,880
I'm not sure what you mean.

175
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,780
I did everything on my own.

176
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,760
Whatever it was.

177
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,150
 

178
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,020
 

179
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,880
 

180
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,850
Is the proof of employment I requested ready, by chance?

181
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,160
Yes? Ouch!

182
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,510
Right, the proof of employment!

183
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,550
I forgot to bring it to you.

184
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,910
Just one moment, please.

185
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,760
Aigoo!

186
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,750
Why don't you just hire more people?

187
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,910
All the employees here quit a long time ago.

188
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,600
It's for your daughter-in-law's daycare, right?

189
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,190
Are people not coming here because of that incident from last year?

190
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,980
You were concluded not guilty, and it's all over now.

191
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,140
Aigoo.

192
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,240
It's nice to be busy. It's a good workout, too.

193
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,920
It's because you look like

194
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,960
- you're suffering, not working out.
- Yes.

195
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,480
- Take care.
- Yes!

196
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,880
Geez.

197
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,490
Let me see.

198
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,680
- Mr. Jang.
- Huh?

199
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,070
- Did you get injured?
- Huh? No!

200
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,040
- Hold on a moment.
- I'm okay!

201
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,210
- Have a seat here.
- It's just a small cut!

202
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,500
Aigoo, the cars are getting old. It's not easy.

203
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,280
I should give it another try and send it to a professional shop.

204
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,150
I don't know how Jin Eon and Gyeong Goo

205
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,900
maintained these cars.

206
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,870
They probably cursed me a lot while doing it.

207
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,670
Do you miss them?

208
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,540
Don't even try to call them back.

209
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,860
They found jobs, and they're doing well right now.

210
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,220
I don't want ever to see them again.

211
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,760
Seeing the ones I love

212
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,340
getting hurt and being in pain.

213
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,850
I don't think I can see that anymore.

214
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,310
Is that why you chased them away

215
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,080
so coldly when they came back?

216
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,830
Was I that cold to them?

217
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,370
I guess I really didn't want to let them go.

218
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,160
Why didn't you chase me away, then?

219
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,310
How unfair.

220
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,280
Even if I did, I'm sure

221
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,290
you'd be doing the same thing somewhere.

222
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:23,080
I might as well give you a hand by your side.

223
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,890
Don't you think?

224
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,860
It's all done.

225
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,750
Okay.

226
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,060
No one should be sacrificed because of me anymore.

227
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,270
Why don't you go to the basement

228
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,440
and get me a work light if there's one?

229
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,980
This is on the fritz, too.

230
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,490
Yes.

231
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,000
 

232
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,630
 

233
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,480
Through the sixth successful projectile launch,

234
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,260
we were able to fix the third projectiles'

235
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,810
stable fuel distribution, and the oxidant tank's pressure issues,

236
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,320
which were the biggest issues we had.

237
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,820
Could you briefly tell us how you feel about the success?

238
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,490
It hasn't quite hit me yet, but...

239
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,170
it feels a bit empty that I no longer have homework.

240
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,890
We also succeeded in producing

241
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,490
Korean-made major parts, so we no longer depend on foreign countries.

242
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,220
Especially the high-functioning reverse motor for collision prevention

243
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,910
from the first separation is lightweight and small.

244
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,970
If you add just one each on the front and the back of premium taxis,

245
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,750
it'd change their performance level.

246
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,670
Premium taxis?

247
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,500
What was the question, again?

248
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,510
This beeper...

249
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,280
Is this yours?

250
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,320
- Yes, it's mine.
- It's been forever since I've seen one.

251
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,110
Does it still work these days?

252
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,420
I'm just keeping it.

253
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,390
Enjoy your meal!

254
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,370
How are you doing these days?

255
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,870
It's all good. I eat a lot of tasty food and

256
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,230
I make a lot of money, too. It's all good.

257
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,710
Me, too.

258
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,000
I don't taste anything.

259
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,200
I think I'm having male menopause.

260
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,630
You, too? I'm like that, too!

261
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,210
It's normal for me, but you're still so young.

262
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,350
 Murder, robbery, rape, assault, and theft. 

263
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:16,850
 Teenagers getting arrested for these five major crimes... 

264
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,880
Punks like that should be punished properly.

265
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,510
I don't get calls anymore, either.

266
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,850
I'm being transferred to Russia.

267
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,780
- Did you do something terrible?
- Come on!

268
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,970
- They're sending me because I'm good.
- But why Russia, then-

269
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:33,910
For how long?

270
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,450
- Five years.
- That's long.

271
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,150
- I'm leaving right after this project ends.
- It's long.

272
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,800
Shouldn't I, at least, say goodbye to Mr. Jang before I leave?

273
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,290
Mr. Jang? Gosh, you'll hear an earful if you stop by again.

274
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,600
Did Mr. Jang yell at you?

275
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,310
Don't even bring it up. He made such a scary face.

276
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,730
How many times did I tell you to never come back?

277
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,510
Don't you know what getting fired means?

278
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,170
Don't ever come back here again!

279
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,380
Understand?

280
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,510
You're fired!

281
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,980
I guess he didn't mention the funeral, at least.

282
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,270
Funeral?

283
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,910
Don't ever come back again!

284
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,690
Even if you hear I died,

285
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,080
don't even come to the funeral, okay?

286
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,690
Isn't that too harsh to tell me not to come to the funeral?

287
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,770
He did that to stop feeling affectionate toward you.

288
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,000
Of course, I know. But...

289
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,960
But I should still visit him, right?

290
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,020
Yes.

291
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,150
Here you go.

292
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,520
Thank you.

293
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,560
Take care.

294
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,420
 

295
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,830
Excuse me, you dropped this.

296
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,850
Thank you.

297
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,260
- Officer Ahn.
- Ma'am.

298
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,370
You're not butting into other departments' business again, right?

299
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:03,960
He's a petitioner who's been looking for his son for over a year.

300
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,610
We could help just by figuring out his whereabouts.

301
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,850
Stop being nosy. Get ready to take off.

302
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,830
You can't miss tonight's work dinner.

303
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,340
Ma'am!

304
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,960
I told you clearly.

305
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,890
The information department just needs to work on the requested cases.

306
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,570
What are you doing? Hurry up and bring your bag.

307
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,050
Yes.

308
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,690
That person you tried to help earlier.

309
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,220
His son is already an adult.

310
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,240
He's not missing. He ran away.

311
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,510
You can't reveal the whereabouts of a runaway

312
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,660
without his agreement.

313
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,990
You can't rule out domestic violence, either.

314
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,700
Did it seem that way to you?

315
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,360
To me,

316
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,960
he just looked like a father who was looking for his son.

317
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,370
Well...

318
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,160
He might be.

319
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,290
But you can't judge without clear evidence.

320
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:08,010
Someone who needs help is right in front of us.

321
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,190
If we just hold back,

322
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,750
what are we there for, exactly?

323
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,580
It's because that's the rule.

324
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,150
Aigoo, sir.

325
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,180
Are you drunk already?

326
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,450
If you ignore the rule and cross the line just because you can,

327
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:29,190
that makes you a criminal, not an officer.

328
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:32,410
Here's another rule you can't forget.

329
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,120
We're...

330
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,640
office workers.

331
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,560
Be careful not to get fired or cause a pay cut.

332
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,290
And watch your performance evaluation score.

333
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,900
Give me a cigarette.

334
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,970
Alright.

335
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:49,190
- Aigoo!
- Why is he meddling with our department?

336
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,180
Officer Ahn, don't worry.

337
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,490
Here.

338
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,260
♫  You still don't know who I am
  ♫

339
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,750
♫  Bright eyes that protect the darkness
  ♫

340
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:05,700
♫  Those cruel looks, the lonely moments
  ♫

341
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,840
♫  Are now disappearing far away
  ♫

342
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:18,350
♫  I want to survive in this crazy crying out  ♫

343
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:23,770
♫  I won't hold it in anymore, I'll do what I want
  ♫

344
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,040
♫  I'm gonna break it down  ♫

345
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,390
♫  I'll repay you even more roughly
  ♫

346
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:35,550
♫  Tell me the truth inside the darkness
  ♫

347
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:40,140
♫  Even if they fall in this endless place
  ♫

348
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,530
 

349
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,730
♫  I will overcome again  ♫

350
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:49,230
♫  The place I want  ♫

351
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:53,550
♫  All the things I want
  ♫

352
00:26:53,550 --> 00:27:03,790
♫  I will find again, all of my small dreams that were so precious
  ♫

353
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,280
 

354
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,170
Dong Jae! I won't give up!

355
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,670
 

356
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,910
 

357
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:39,560
 

358
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,830
♫  The moonlight is asleep  ♫

359
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,010
♫  The darkness is getting deeper already  ♫

360
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:02,190
♫  There isn't even wind to take me away  ♫

361
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:07,880
♫  Over the rainbow, I'll hide my tired body  ♫

362
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:14,130
♫  Far away, far away, far away, I'll leave this place  ♫

363
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:19,520
♫  The red sunset provokes me for some reason  ♫

364
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,970
♫  I roamed aimlessly in those tiring days  ♫

365
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:32,710
♫  Just like the echo that keeps coming back no matter how many times I call  ♫

366
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:37,280
♫  It keeps repeating like that  ♫

367
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:51,250
♫  I'll try running toward tomorrow on the path that I can't see the end of  ♫

368
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,050
♫  The moonlight is asleep  ♫

369
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:57,010
♫  The darkness is getting deeper already  ♫

370
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:02,100
♫  There isn't even wind to take me away  ♫

371
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:07,870
♫  Over the rainbow, I'll hide my tired body  ♫

372
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,950
♫  Far away, far away, far away  ♫

373
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:15,100
♫  I'll leave this place  ♫

374
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,370
Could you tell me

375
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,740
what has happened to you so far?

376
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,440
Well...

377
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:29,270
 There's a son who's like the apple of my eye. 

378
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,590
 His mother died young in an accident. 

379
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,970
 I raised Dong Jae while running a shop. 

380
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,380
Take this and eat it with your friends.

381
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:40,710
- Right, the radish pickle-
- No! Who brings fried chicken to school?

382
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:44,160
Don't forget to bring the notice notebook home!

383
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,800
See you later, Dad!

384
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,520
 He must've had a hard time as a young boy, 

385
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,430
 but he grew up as a nice and exemplary kid. 

386
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,200
- Here you go.
- Congratulations!

387
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,350
Son, happy birthday.

388
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,620
I'm still a student!

389
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,280
It's okay to drink it when Dad gives it to you.

390
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,800
Ahjussi, how come we don't get any?

391
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,530
- That's unfair!
- Come on!

392
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,480
Come here on your birthdays, then.

393
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,850
Cheers!

394
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,870
Yes.

395
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,080
Yes, I'll bring it over.

396
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,440
Yes.

397
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,880
One boneless!

398
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,100
Son, don't you need to go to school?

399
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,980
It's okay. The class was canceled today.

400
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,510
I see.

401
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,350
Just one moment.

402
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,570
 
It's because I can't get more loans.

403
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:47,570
- If you give me a little more time-
- How come you say that

404
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,490
every time I come here?

405
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,920
Let's break off the contract if it's too difficult.

406
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,110
We'll end up on the street, then.

407
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,690
Stop making me a bad person.

408
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:02,550
Let me know if you'll renew or end the lease at the end of the month.

409
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,380
Well, sir!

410
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,620
You said boneless, right?

411
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,290
Dad.

412
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,760
I need to tell you something briefly.

413
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,700
 I'll be going abroad as a foreign exchange student. 

414
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,220
For two years.

415
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,700
Foreign exchange student?

416
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,150
A scholarship covers the entire tuition, and I'll be given a dorm room, too.

417
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,540
 For two years? 

418
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,490
 If I study abroad, 

419
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,620
 what would you do on your own? 

420
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:42,430
Will that be good for you, then?

421
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,370
It's a great opportunity!

422
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,920
Other kids are dying to go.

423
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,840
Okay!

424
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,580
If you're happy, I'm happy, too.

425
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:59,030
 Why are you buying me this when I'm leaving as a foreign exchange student? 

426
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,740
You're an adult now.

427
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,490
You need to have at least one proper suit.

428
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:06,430
- Wow.
- Would you like your initials on the sleeves?

429
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,290
No! It's okay.

430
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,430
Yes, please do.

431
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:11,750
Dad.
 

432
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,400
What's this?

433
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:21,530
I set the alarm for when you need to take your meds.

434
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,030
I'll call you once a day, every day.

435
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,750
This kid...

436
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,150
My son, let me hug you.

437
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:34,100
 Dong Jae was my pride in any situation. 

438
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,860
Safe travels!

439
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,190
 But as time went on, 

440
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:48,190
 things started to seem strange. 

441
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,920
 He used to contact me every day. 

442
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:56,550
 But he strangely didn't respond to my message in 15 days. 

443
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,390
You came, sir.

444
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,370
Pardon?

445
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,940
No, I was just passing by.

446
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,640
If you wait for me a bit,

447
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,600
- I'll get money no matter what.
- It's okay.

448
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,590
Pardon?

449
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,400
I received it. It's okay.

450
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,300
What do you mean, you received it?

451
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,950
I can't lie to you.

452
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,580
Your son paid me.

453
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,030
What do you mean he paid you?

454
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:24,110
He has no money! How did he pay you that much-

455
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,840
He took time off school. He said he got a job.

456
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,950
I heard he got a refund for the tuition, too.

457
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,520
He got a job?

458
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,840
He didn't leave to study?

459
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,830
He said he'd make a lot of money for two years.

460
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,800
 

461
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,250
 That's when I realized... 

462
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,970
You little...

463
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:56,690
 that he didn't leave the country as a foreign exchange student. 

464
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:00,490
 Quit your job immediately and come back! 

465
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:08,420
 

466
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,020
 I'm sorry, Dong Jae. 

467
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,250
 I'll come to you. 

468
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:27,060
 

469
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,270
 I went to my son's supposed company, 

470
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,140
 but... 

471
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,030
 there was nothing there. 

472
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,520
Are you sure we're here?

473
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,530
This is it.

474
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:06,870
You can't file a missing person's report because

475
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,970
your son, who's working abroad, can't be reached.

476
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:11,010
If he's 25, he's a grown-up, too.

477
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,460
Please give him more time.

478
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:16,010
I said I even got a phone call from him.

479
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,440
Hello?

480
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:24,300
Hello?

481
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,580
- Is this Dong Jae?
 - I'm sorry! 

482
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:31,250
H-hello! D-Dong Jae! Dong Jae!

483
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,230
- Look at this, please.
- You already showed me all this.

484
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,890
You might've written down the wrong address.

485
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,710
Something must've happened to him.

486
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,730
He promised that he'd call every day, and he did.

487
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,580
Something must've happened.

488
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,540
Otherwise, it won't be this hard to reach him!

489
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,470
Well, sir.

490
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,450
I understand how you feel.

491
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:53,360
He's not even in the same country.

492
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,970
We...

493
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,510
will make sure to look into it and contact you.

494
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:00,050
- If you leave for now-
- Why do you keep telling me to leave?

495
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,040
Why? Why? Why?

496
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,440
This is a bit much!

497
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,660
Why are you blaming us when your son won't contact you?

498
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,850
What are you saying?

499
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:12,540
What do you mean he won't contact me?

500
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,250
Get back to work.

501
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,820
Let me talk to him.

502
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,350
By chance...

503
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:20,610
were you able to reach Dong Jae?

504
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,520
Please have a seat for now.

505
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,610
When you talked to us last time,

506
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:33,040
we looked into it right away. But...

507
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,820
your son...

508
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,420
called the embassy himself.

509
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,590
He asked us not to look for him anymore.

510
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:43,530
Since he's an adult and refused to be in touch,

511
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,940
I don't think there's anything more

512
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,710
we can do for you.

513
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,500
Why won't you believe me? Why?

514
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,920
What do you mean, we won't believe you, exactly?

515
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,970
There's no father who can't recognize his son's voice!

516
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,020
I said I heard it!

517
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,600
I saw that his company wasn't there.

518
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,000
Why won't you believe me? Why?

519
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,890
If you won't look for him,

520
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:15,080
I'll look for him myself.

521
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,970
Thank you.

522
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:38,040
 
Did he wander around with this in a foreign country looking for his son for over 10 months?

523
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,520
It would've been likely to find him if they had notified him

524
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,930
when they found his initial whereabouts.

525
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:44,930
The police just played it by the book.

526
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:48,660
An adult over 18 without a criminal record

527
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,350
is considered a runaway, not a missing person.

528
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:54,300
If he's a runaway, the police can't easily

529
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,120
get the transaction record, too.

530
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,470
Because it has to do with his rights.

531
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,150
 When I returned home, 

532
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,110
 that piece of mail was there. 

533
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,600
 

534
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,560
 

535
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:29,010
 

536
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,910
 

537
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,050
Yes, got it.

538
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:42,690
The handwriting analysis says it's the same person.

539
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,380
That's not possible.

540
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,000
I couldn't tell you this then, but...

541
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,350
the place your son called from

542
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,720
was an illegal gambling district

543
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,770
for foreigners.

544
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:58,720
I'm at a loss for words giving you this news.

545
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:01,430
My son...

546
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,200
That's not possible.

547
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,460
It's my son.

548
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,390
Please have a look at this.

549
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:12,060
Please have a look at this.

550
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,910
Please have a look at this. Please have a look at this.

551
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:17,890
Please... Have a look...

552
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,830
 
 Life is too hard. 

553
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,450
 I'm sorry. 

554
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,740
If this really were the son's suicide note,

555
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,390
there's nothing for us to do, is there?

556
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:39,270
It's probably real since the handwriting was as a match.

557
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,790
But he wrote against his will.

558
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,000
Why do you think that?

559
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,550
Toward the very bottom...

560
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,440
They probably ignored it because it looked like a scribble.

561
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:57,870
When Lee Dong Jae was in the military, he was a divisional operational soldier,

562
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,550
a signal man.

563
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,230
He must've been used to the morse code.

564
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,020
 

565
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:31,270
Geez, you can't always say you don't know.

566
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:34,530
You should learn and figure it out.

567
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,440
You should survive and go see your mom.

568
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,930
Excuse me, sir!

569
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,810
- This is what I have so far.
- Geez, gross!

570
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,360
Go away, go away!

571
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,560
Geez, look!

572
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,760
He did it because he studied!

573
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,920
- Hey, give him some food.
- Yes.

574
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,920
Have this first. Drink it.

575
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,800
- Thank you.
- Good work!

576
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,800
This is amazing!

577
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,380
Hello?

578
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:20,170
Is this Dong Jae?

579
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,790
- What are you doing, you punk?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

580
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:25,300
Are you out of your mind?

581
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,040
Hey!

582
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,010
Hello? D-Dong Jae! Dong Jae!

583
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:47,270
 

584
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,640
 

585
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,930
"Help me."

586
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:54,490
He was forced to write this suicide note.

587
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:57,100
That means there were people who forced him.

588
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,600
Since we got the message,

589
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,070
we should respond, too.

590
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,190
 

591
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:29,330
 

592
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,290
 

593
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:12,050
 Hello. Thank you for coming to Rainbow Premium Taxi Service. 

594
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:16,850
 I'll tell you a few points to remember for your safety and convenience. 

595
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:21,610
 While we're working on your case, the taxi meter will be left turned on. 

596
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:25,750
 As for the taxi fare, after the case is closed, it will be settled at a later time. 

597
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,870
 Depending on the situation, there may be an extra charge. 

598
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:31,660
 After using the taxi, you may not mention 

599
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:36,120
 matters relevant to Rainbow Premium Taxi Service to others. 

600
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,680
 We ask you to keep that in mind. 

601
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,280
 If you wish to commission us, 

602
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,720
 press the blue button on the left. 

603
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,300
 And if you wish not to, 

604
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,990
 press the red button on the right. 

605
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:51,840
 Please pick one now. 

606
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,470
 Dad. 

607
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:59,850
 I set the alarm for when you need to take your meds. 

608
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:03,670
 - Dad, you didn't forget to take the pill, right? 
- Aigoo, Dong Jae.

609
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:08,140
- Have you eaten?
 - Dad, you didn't forget to take the pill, right? 

610
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,000
I already took it, of course.

611
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,370
Dad, look! Look at this!

612
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:16,740
- Didn't I do a good job?
- Yeah, I'll admit it.

613
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,880
 Dad, you didn't forget to take the pill, right? 

614
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,040
 Take it right now! 

615
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,880
 Dad, you didn't forget to take the pill, right? 

616
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,500
 Take it right now! Dad... 

617
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:41,870
 

618
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:43,110
 

619
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,270
 

620
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:16,250
 So, where will you go first? 

621
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:20,000
I'll go to the HQ in Korea first, where Lee Dong Jae submitted the resume.

622
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,690
I think you can stay in the office.

623
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:27,430
What are you talking about? The thread needs to follow the needle.

624
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,990
The branch abroad is a pigsty,

625
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,770
and the HQ is under construction.

626
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:54,100
 I think they just used random addresses of abandoned buildings. 

627
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:57,520
 I need to check if there were job ads 

628
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,120
using this address recently.

629
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,880
You're not waiting for me, are you?

630
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,090
I'm sure they deleted all the contents

631
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:19,430
regarding the company from job sites, too.

632
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:21,980
 If they already deleted all the job posts, 

633
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:25,080
it won't be easy to trace these bastards.

634
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,910
Not necessarily.

635
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,140
You can get rid of the traces,

636
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:33,520
but it's not easy to get rid of habits.

637
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:00,510
 

638
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,380
 

639
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:25,600
This is the job ad posted by those bastards, huh?

640
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,470
It has a different company name, but everything, including

641
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:30,840
tracking, font, and style are all the same.

642
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,350
It's just as you said.

643
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:36,410
Habits are hard to get rid of.

644
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:37,560
What's this?

645
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,280
I sent a resume with the same qualifications as Lee Dong Jae.

646
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,390
And they responded within a day.

647
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:44,170
Resume?

648
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:48,310
The job requires working abroad, just like Dong Jae's.

649
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:49,940
Hold on.

650
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,570
Are you...

651
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:54,190
thinking of going there in person?

652
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:55,280
Yes.

653
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,090
If it's outside of the country,

654
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:00,290
there'd be more restrictions than you think.

655
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,880
I have no other options.

656
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:06,320
 

657
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:20,450
 

658
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,440
Dad...

659
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,470
Dad...

660
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:39,470
 Mr. Kim, where are you right now? 

661
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:41,670
I'm entering now.

662
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:43,090
I keep thinking that

663
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:45,570
this case is difficult in many ways.

664
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:47,280
If you don't prepare perfectly,

665
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,570
you might be in danger, Mr. Kim.

666
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:51,450
I think so, too.

667
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:53,070
Why don't you come back now

668
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:56,080
and think about what would be the best way together.

669
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:59,110
Yes, sir. I'll be right there.

670
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,700
Yes, you can enter now.

671
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,110
Thank you.

672
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,910
 

673
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:17,250
Aigoo.

674
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,540
He's not here.

675
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,700
- Should we check the office?
- Okay.

676
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:46,340
Mr. Jang isn't answering the phone, either.

677
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:48,300
Is something going on?

678
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,200
There are no other employees, either.

679
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,360
Looks like he's been managing the place alone since we left.

680
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,890
 

681
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:06,900
Hyungnim, check this out.

682
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,080
 

683
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,230
It's a missing person's ad. What about it?

684
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:12,580
It was in Mr. Jang's drawer.

685
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:15,040
This was in his drawer?

686
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:18,050
You don't normally put stuff like this in a drawer, right?

687
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:19,160
That's right.

688
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,640
You usually put important stuff in a drawer.

689
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,510
That means...

690
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:25,600
this is really important right now, right?

691
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,840
There were "out of office" signs everywhere outside, too.

692
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,710
- He won't pick up the phone, either.
- That means-

693
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:40,710
Mr. Jang!

694
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:43,910
- Mr. Jang!
- Driver Kim Do Gi! Driver Kim Do Gi!

695
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:48,230
The premium taxis are...

696
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:49,670
still here.

697
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:51,200
You're right.

698
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,580
Were we wrong?

699
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,110
Were we?

700
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,390
You guys!

701
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,100
What's this?

702
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,440
What are you doing here?

703
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,050
Have you been well, sir?

704
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,380
Why do you care? I think I clearly told you

705
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,350
not to come back anymore.

706
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:15,720
I'm here to say goodbye because I'll be working abroad for five years.

707
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:20,300
How does that concern me in any way?

708
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,710
Forget it!

709
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:25,280
Get out of here. Don't ever come back here.

710
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:30,030
Yes, we'll get going.

711
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,150
Take care, sir.

712
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:49,030
Aigoo, they look awful.

713
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:52,110
I told them to be well.

714
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:56,100
- Did you sense it, too, by chance?
- Yes.

715
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:59,630
- It was totally awkward.
- That's what I'm saying.

716
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:02,320
He's definitely hiding something.

717
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,400
I think this is...

718
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,120
what he's hiding.

719
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:12,880
 

720
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:18,280
 

721
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,220
I arrived safely.

722
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:23,720
This is an international call.

723
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:28,050
You don't know how dangerous it'd be. You shouldn't have gone alone.

724
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:30,160
We should've prepared well and gone together.

725
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,250
Since I don't know how dangerous it'd be,

726
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:34,870
I thought it'd be a lot better to act alone.

727
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:37,190
You should help me where you are.

728
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:38,390
Would you really be okay?

729
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:40,350
 If I send you the names of the people I meet here, 

730
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:43,300
please look up their information for me.

731
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:46,310
Okay, let's reconnect in a bit.

732
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,280
Mr. Jung! Yes, yes.

733
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,930
Aigoo, nice to meet you.

734
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,230
- It's hot, isn't it?
- Yes.

735
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:02,400
Mr. Choi, help them with the luggage.

736
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,590
Yes, I'm ready.

737
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,410
Can you see it?

738
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:17,620
Yes, yes. I can see well.

739
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:19,410
Where are you headed to now, by the way?

740
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,470
They could've picked them up at the arrivals.

741
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:23,800
But they purposedly meet somewhere else.

742
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,960
I guess that's a blind spot for CCTVs.

743
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,670
Hello.

744
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:32,900
Save the introduction for later.

745
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:35,070
Let's get going for now.

746
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:37,790
Hey! Let's load another suitcase.

747
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,110
Let's go, let's go!

748
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,090
Welcome.

749
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:57,070
Long time no see, Go Eun. You've been well, right?

750
00:57:57,070 --> 00:57:59,860
You know this isn't what we agreed to, don't you?

751
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:02,970
We found this in Mr. Jang's office.

752
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:05,840
Isn't it weird?

753
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,960
What is?

754
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,090
I'm sure Mr. Jang and Mr. Kim are onto something together.

755
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:14,410
- I agree with him.
- Officer Ahn.

756
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:18,820
Are you busy right now? We have some stuff to process.

757
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:21,550
Well, I'll be right there!

758
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:24,470
I'm sorry. I was in the middle of work.

759
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:25,660
It's okay...

760
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:26,810
Let's talk later.

761
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:28,790
Yes, you must be busy. Get going.

762
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:29,910
Take care of yourself.

763
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:31,220
See you.

764
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,370
Bye.

765
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,520
She must be really busy.

766
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,590
Looks like she's doing well.

767
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:39,690
- Let's stop bothering her and leave.
- This is no good.

768
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:41,360
We should do this ourselves.

769
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,710
It's a head-on match.

770
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:44,520
Head-on match?

771
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,830
I have an idea. Follow me.

772
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:49,280
Hyungnim, are you planning right now?

773
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,430
You're so cool.

774
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:01,090
 

775
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,820
Is everything to your liking?

776
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:17,250
Here's Vietnam's local product.

777
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:19,070
It's coconut juice.

778
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:22,870
I have a delicious tip for you guys.

779
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:24,040
- Do you like working out?
- Yes.

780
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,770
Scuba diving? Surfing?

781
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,530
If you learn every weekend,

782
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:30,090
you can even get certificates! Wow!

783
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:34,050
The post said you provide food and lodging.

784
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:36,000
Is there any separate fee?

785
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,900
- Of course not. It's all on us!
- Wow!

786
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,220
Do you like seafood? Do you know your sashimi?

787
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,750
Shark fin? Caviar?

788
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,020
These people eat that stuff every day.

789
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:46,420
Don't eat stuff like that.

790
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:48,010
This is the last day you'd be eating this.

791
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:49,840
You're eating shark fin and caviar from now on!

792
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,450
So tasty!

793
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:54,040
 

794
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:00,220
 

795
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:16,140
 

796
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:25,240
 

797
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:39,820
I'm sure this is the route Lee Dong Jae took.

798
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:40,970
Look at them!

799
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,950
They're busy taking photos of each other and taking selfies.

800
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:45,900
They're so busy!

801
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:49,300
Hurry up and get the schedule going. Okay, okay...

802
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,320
Will you really be okay alone?

803
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,150
I should find out now.

804
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,240
If Lee Dong Jae had been here,

805
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,080
and when he was here,

806
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,540
what had happened here.

807
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:00,270
I'll look up the guide's information.

808
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:02,290
 Don't sweat it too much. 

809
01:01:02,290 --> 01:01:04,980
I used to look up stuff like this all by myself.

810
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:07,200
Don't underestimate me.

811
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,250
I told you not to sweat it.

812
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,740
Hey!

813
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:13,240
Hold on, hold on!

814
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,070
Let's get going now!

815
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:17,540
Come gather around!

816
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:20,010
Come this way!

817
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:23,780
- Okay? Okay!
- This isn't bad, either.

818
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,480
Seriously!

819
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,560
The car apparently went somewhere else.

820
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,400
It's not as nice, but let's take this instead and get going.

821
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,040
Yes? Let's hop on.

822
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,210
Hold on, hold on!

823
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:35,000
- Could you give me your phones?
- Why?

824
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,930
I'll put the local sim cards in them and give them back to you.

825
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:40,490
- Yes.
- We're in Vietnam. It'd take better pictures, too.

826
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:42,720
Here. Get in.

827
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:02,210
The view here is a lot different.

828
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:04,920
A place like this is better for work!

829
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,050
The air is different already, right?

830
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:10,130
There's no microdust at all!

831
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:12,330
We're almost there. Hang in there!

832
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:53,280
What happened?

833
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,830
Hey, hey, everyone. Look at me. Look!

834
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:59,010
This is my last delicious tip to you guys.

835
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,470
Study hard, you guys!

836
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:08,300
Mr. Kim!

837
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,390
Can you hear me, Mr. Kim?

838
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:12,270
Mr. Kim!

839
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:30,680
Why did you hang them up? So dizzy. It's not like they're meat.

840
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:33,400
Put them down.

841
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:55,030
It must've been difficult getting here.

842
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,050
 

843
01:03:58,050 --> 01:03:59,900
Looking at your resumes,

844
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:02,920
well, it's not bad.

845
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,250
Okay.

846
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:08,430
Here comes a survey.

847
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:11,270
Answer right away if it applies to you.

848
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:13,600
Does anyone know how to play baccarat?

849
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:20,720
How about badugi?

850
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:24,550
Geez, don't be shy!

851
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:26,100
I-I-I do.

852
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:28,380
Yes.

853
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:31,120
Next. How about poker?

854
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:35,450
Shit! I'm the only one talking here.

855
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:37,660
I can't have a conversation with you

856
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:39,810
because you have Micky Mouse degrees.

857
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:42,580
I need to teach them how to talk first.

858
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:03,100
Okay.

859
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,740
Let me ask you again.

860
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:07,880
Has anyone played an online game before?

861
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,190
I-I-I have!

862
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:10,620
M-M-Me, too.

863
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:14,570
Yes! I have to beat you to make you behave!

864
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:17,430
Okay, from now on,

865
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:19,940
you'll be making all kinds of online games

866
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:23,010
so we get tons of subscribers.

867
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:25,730
You all have computer-related degrees.

868
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:27,620
I'm sure you'll do well.

869
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,210
 

870
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:34,640
Look it up in the books if there's something you don't know.

871
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,160
I'll check every morning.

872
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,780
Are you telling us...

873
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:41,310
to make illegal gambling programs, by chance?

874
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:43,200
This bastard is better.

875
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,170
I just studied graphic design.

876
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:46,730
I don't know about programs like that.

877
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:48,230
You don't?

878
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:49,850
I'll teach you then.

879
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:51,990
- Hold his hands.
- I really don't know!

880
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:53,290
Hyungnim!

881
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:55,470
Cutting the hands off is a bit...

882
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:59,470
Geez! Come out. Come out!

883
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,880
Hey, you don't know, either?

884
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,920
- I-I-I'll try!
- Yes.

885
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,890
Everyone says they don't know at first,

886
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:13,920
- but they all become good later.
- Y-Yes!

887
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:19,730
Hey, you came!

888
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:20,970
Hey, say hello.

889
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:22,430
They're your seniors.

890
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:25,700
They didn't know anything at first, like you, too.

891
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:27,140
But look at them now.

892
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:29,960
They're experts!

893
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:37,780
Geez.

894
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:39,560
That face.

895
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,830
Are you upset?

896
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,750
Are you?

897
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:48,240
If so, you should blame your poor and ignorant parents.

898
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:52,370
There's only one way for you to get out of here alive.

899
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:55,460
Trying really hard.

900
01:06:58,730 --> 01:07:00,510
Understand?

901
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:04,710
Okay, let's go to your rooms

902
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:07,620
and start studying!

903
01:08:23,070 --> 01:08:25,170
It was hard to peel

904
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:27,070
because the shell is hard.

905
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:29,120
I hope you enjoy it.

906
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:53,010
Wang Tao Ji.

907
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:56,100
The asshole who came to...

908
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:58,630
ruin my life.

909
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:07,400


910
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:19,590
♫  Take me back, it's over  ♫

911
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:23,520
♫  Put the pain that's been trapping you behind  ♫

912
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,420
♫  And I'll fight, fight for you  ♫

913
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:29,640
♫  I will run to the end of the world  ♫

914
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:32,700
 

915
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:34,990
 We'll mess up one of his ankles tomorrow. 

916
01:09:34,990 --> 01:09:35,670
 Good night. 

917
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:37,500
 Driver Kim is there alone right now. 

918
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,560
 We don't know what'd happen to him! 

919
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,050
 The situation is way direr than expected. 

920
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:42,990
 I can't escape alone, leaving others behind. 

921
01:09:42,990 --> 01:09:47,150
 I'll never trust a man! 

922
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:48,130
 Go to the HQ. 

923
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:49,460
 I'm sorry for the commotion, Chairman. 

924
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:51,250
 Sir, that chairman is... 

925
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:53,760
 Make sure to get everyone's suicide note if you missed anyone. 

926
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,960
 Write down what I say from now on. 

927
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,310
 It's too hard. 

928
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:58,850
 Goodbye, everyone. 

929
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:01,040
 I can't guarantee it. 

930
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,580
 Are you okay? Mr. Kim! 

931
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:06,840
 We can all return home safely. 

932
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:09,800
♫  For you, I'll run to the end of the world  ♫
