1
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,870
 

2
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,100
 We need to make them gather in one place. 

3
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,300
 Gather all those bastards who are scattered all over in one place? 

4
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,990
 Of their own accord? 

5
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,080
 Hurry up and give me! 

6
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,220
 You're out of your mind! 

7
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,950
 I think someone set this all up. 

8
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,440
 To come here. 

9
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,420
 Wang Tao Chi. 

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,180
 I'll make sure to rip you into pieces today. 

11
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,920
 That Chairman... 

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,120
 is a policeman. 

13
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,360
 In Korea, no matter how many criminals you catch, there's utterly no use. 

14
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,190
 Because in the end, those criminal bastards live better lives. 

15
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,780
 We're only doing as we're ordered by HQ. 

16
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,510
 Mr. Kim Do Gi! Mr. Kim, are you okay? 

17
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,230
 Welcome. You're all here. 

18
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,220
 Okay, is everyone here? 

19
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,700
 Shall we get started once again? 

20
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,900


21
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,360
 Hello, I'm On Ha Joon, here for my first day at work. 

22
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,300
 Is anybody there? 

23
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,790
 Is anybody there? 

24
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,950
 

25
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,410
Yes, I finished the joint guard dispatch duty at 15:00, and I'm returning to the HQ.

26
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,620
I'll report on the changes in alignment separately. Unity.

27
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,950
Sir, did I tell you where we're going?

28
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,510
If you're returning to SMU after a dispatch, it must be this way.

29
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,880
I think you'll get there before your night duty.

30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,920
Lieutenant!

31
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,070
How long has it been?

32
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:29,460
Hearing your phone conversation, it sounds like you became a leader. Congratulations.

33
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,220
Hold on. It's impolite to sit in the back. I'll move to the front seat.

34
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,540
Sir, you can't move while I'm driving.

35
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,850
I'm sorry!

36
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,150
During the second half of the last training, I thought our team got totally demolished,

37
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,700
but you flipped the script all on your own.

38
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,380
 
It's still a legend in the unit.

39
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,020
 

40
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,990
We arrived on time.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,700
Already?

42
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,990
 

43
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,390
 

44
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,820
Lieutenant, are you interested in coming back at all?

45
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,630
Everyone would be happy if you returned.

46
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,970
I have no interest in that.

47
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,450
Are you considering a special security office or private security service?

48
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,420
No.

49
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,180
What are you thinking then...

50
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,980
I'm a taxi driver.

51
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,520
You might be late. You should go in now.

52
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,640
Yes, I was so happy to see you again.

53
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,220
Unity.

54
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,790
- Hold on.
- Yes.

55
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,890
You should pay the fare.

56
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,980
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,140
Here's the card.

58
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,060
There's no such thing as a free taxi.

59
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,470
 

60
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,120
Be well. Please say hello to the teammates.

61
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,530
Yes, please give me a call.

62
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,750
Mom! Mom!

63
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,700
 

64
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,930
Thank you.

65
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,890
Take care.

66
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,890
 

67
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,860
Are you really giving us ice creams if we blow this?

68
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,880
If I'm lying down without responding, it's because I'm too tired.

69
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,830
So take these and split them with your friends.

70
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,960
- Okay?
- Yes.

71
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,770
Hold on!

72
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,340
Please blow it when I signal you.

73
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,660
It's okay. It's no big deal. It's nothing.

74
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,990
It'll be okay.

75
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,180
Not yet!

76
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,880
It's...

77
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,040
not time yet.

78
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,920
I think he's a coward.

79
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,470
Ahjussi, will you do it or not?

80
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,000
Well...

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,800
- Should we do it now?
- Now?

82
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,880
It's good, isn't it?

83
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,190
Yeah.

84
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,200
 

85
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,520
Yes, Mr. Jang.

86
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,140
The empty cartridge in the chief's chest is apparently from Korea.

87
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,320
If it's from Korea, it means a third person was at the scene.

88
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,580
Yes, that's why I'm on my way to look into it.

89
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,970
 Are you going alone? 

90
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,560
Why don't you go with me instead?

91
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,490
Okay, I'll leave right now.

92
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,300
- Thank you.
- Sure.

93
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,240
 

94
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,730
What do you think? Doesn't it look great?

95
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,630
I guess it's not bad.

96
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,830
What do you mean, not bad?

97
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,920
Jin Eon and I spent our entire yearly salaries on this.

98
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,880
It looks amazing.

99
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,520
Everything got sorted out at work. I'm done now!

100
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,810
Register me as an employee here, too.

101
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,490
You should've come earlier. I already finished unboxing.

102
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll match your old salary.

103
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,700
Why did you bring all that?

104
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,910
What do you think? I brought them to put them to good use.

105
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,260
This looks like a mic.

106
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,870
It's not just a normal mic.

107
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,510
It's called a shotgun mic they use in the Olympics.

108
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,030
If you point it in the right direction, you can hear someone breathing 100 meters away.

109
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,620
Look.

110
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,320
If you put this on the top right here,

111
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,320
and put the rudder on the steering wheel,

112
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,330
the premium taxi gets amazing ears.

113
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:16,220
Wow, that looks really cool and lame at the same time.

114
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,830
What if it rains?

115
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,960
Should we put an umbrella on it? So you can open and close it-

116
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,870
Geez! It's my fault for paying attention.

117
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,840
You can't get stuff like this anywhere!

118
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,070
According to what I heard, geniuses are really dumb.

119
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,500
Can those two words be used together?

120
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,690
Did you make this? Wow, what a genius!

121
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,510
You want to put that there? You stupid bastard!

122
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,170
Is it no good?

123
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,250
We can put it on the side-view mirrors.

124
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,310
If you put them behind the mirrors, they won't get rained on.

125
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,230
If you attach them to the side-view mirrors' rudders,

126
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,110
you don't need to install them separately.

127
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,900
I think they'll come in handy while we're on-site.

128
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,720
The maximum distance might vary depending on the weather.

129
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,560
I should get closer if I can't hear well.

130
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,910
Install them. I think they'd be great.

131
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,340
He's a genius.

132
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,990
Hyungnim.

133
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,560
Why is Mr. Kim so sweet?

134
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,440
- He's sweet?
- Yeah...

135
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,820
I'm so smitten right now.

136
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,130
Smitten?

137
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,740
That's because he put you in the water and tried to kill you.

138
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,120
So if he's a little bit nice to you,

139
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,450
it gets magnified by this much.

140
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,790
Put them on. On the side mirrors.

141
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,240
Jin Eon, wake up. He's not sweet.

142
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,900
He's Kim Do Gi.

143
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,810
Watch out for him whether you're asleep or awake.

144
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,960
 

145
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,480
Thank you!

146
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,630
 

147
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,040
- Hey!
- Hi, Detective Jang.

148
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,390
- Long time no see.
- Long time no see.

149
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,620
So how is the investigation going?

150
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,450
I looked into it,

151
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,770
but there's something unusual.

152
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,080
It wasn't a mistake.

153
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,100
They aimed him perfectly and shot him.

154
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,570
They targeted him from the beginning?

155
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,170
If they shot him in the heart in one go,

156
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,140
they intended to kill him from the beginning.

157
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,970
Don't you think the police there will investigate?

158
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:27,330
No, the local police seemed to want to close the case where they were.

159
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,940
We're the same, too.

160
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,200
Lee Dong Jae and the other victims returned safely.

161
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,030
We could say that's enough, but...

162
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,970
Is there something you're worried about?

163
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,080
If...

164
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:50,960
there's someone who's worth killing the chief with a sniper for,

165
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,180
it must be something serious.

166
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,380
That means you've been exposed to people like that.

167
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,830
Let them be.

168
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,290
We won't just sit back and watch, either.

169
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,310
If you won't just sit back, will you hit me then?

170
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,740
I...

171
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,330
Why would I hit you? You're such a nice person.

172
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:17,460
You brought the taxi back. Then I should take your vehicle log, right?

173
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,600
I'll give it to you in a bit, Go Eun.

174
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,830
When will you give it to me?

175
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,480
In 10 minutes?

176
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,880
Five minutes.

177
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,720
He's so frustrating.

178
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,400
He reminds me of Mr. Park.

179
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,070
Mr. Ohn!

180
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,990
Hello, good morning!

181
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,230
Why are you bothering him first thing in the morning?

182
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,860
I'm not bothering him!

183
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,840
Bring it in five minutes.

184
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,320
- Would you like a coffee?
- I'm okay.

185
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,190
- Do you want some coins?
- We have them!

186
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,800
I'll take them next time.

187
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,720
Yes, enjoy!

188
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,050
Yes.

189
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,680
He's so handsome, like me.

190
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,840
- Like who?
- Like me.

191
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,930
- Mr. On is handsome.
- Yes, like me.

192
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,950
- I said he's handsome.
- Like me.

193
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,190
But he's actually handsome.

194
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,530
Mr. Kim!

195
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:16,660
Could you help me for a moment? Just for a moment.

196
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,900
I drove safely, but a car suddenly came in.

197
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,170
I see.

198
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,350
What should I do?

199
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,440
I don't think it needs to be painted.

200
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,670
They sell touch-up pens at car supply stores for 20,000 won..

201
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,650
You can just cover it up with that.

202
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,660
Is that all it really needs?

203
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,220
Yes.

204
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,490
Thank you, Hyungnim.

205
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,130
I didn't do anything...

206
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,940
I was so scared!

207
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,100
I'll go get the touch-up paint. Thank you.

208
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,700
Right, the vehicle log.

209
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,450
Yes.

210
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,830
Thank you!

211
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,710
 

212
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,740
 

213
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,460
 

214
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,480
 

215
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,850
 

216
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,360
 

217
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,410
 

218
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,740
This client is quite old.

219
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,830
But the first thing she said on the phone was different than other clients.

220
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,320
Different?

221
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,680
 If I die, 

222
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:13,250
 my kids won't get any of that stuff, right? 

223
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,580
If you tell me what's going on in detail,

224
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,480
I'll answer all of your questions.

225
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,750
 I have nothing to talk about. 

226
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,240
 It's all my fault. 

227
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,790
Where are you right now?

228
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,240
We'll send you a car there.

229
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:11,970
I wrote everything you're curious about.

230
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:21,030
Could you tell me what happened now, then?

231
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,280
It's...

232
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,970
It's all my fault.

233
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,820
Hello, everyone!

234
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,410
We just opened at the empty lot in town!

235
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,690
Come over and hang out!

236
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,510
I came here to live here!

237
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,430
Come over here!

238
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,500
What's this?

239
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,650
♫  Walking so slowly like that  ♫

240
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,560
♫  When will you get to me at that rate  ♫

241
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,900
♫  Just like birds in that blue sky  ♫
 

242
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,240
 From the first time I saw him, I noticed 

243
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,750
 he was a really good singer. 

244
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:24,070
 
♫  Looking around here and there  ♫

245
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,400
♫  When will you get to me at that rate  ♫

246
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,740
♫  Come back before it's too late  ♫

247
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,460
♫  Hurry, hurry up and come to me  ♫

248
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:46,800
♫  Love, my love who drifted away  ♫

249
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:53,400
♫  Noonim, the one I miss  ♫

250
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,140
- I love it!
- Doesn't it feel nice?

251
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,030
♫  Here I come! I'm coming over  ♫

252
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,570
- Grandmother!
- Yeah!

253
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,560
- You should be healthy, so your kids are happy!
- That's right!

254
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,270
♫  Before it's late, before it's too late  ♫

255
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,960
♫  Don't take the stairs  ♫

256
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:17,500
♫  Take the elevator  ♫

257
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,810
This is for you, Mom.

258
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,000
Your glass is getting full.

259
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,200
There, there.

260
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,570
 

261
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:32,690
We enjoyed a fun show, and we were treated to food, too.

262
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,170
Shouldn't we buy that stuff from you?

263
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,320
Mom! Don't worry about stuff like that.

264
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,650
You can buy it only if you really need it.

265
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:46,130
If you buy it even if you don't need it, I'd be so sad.

266
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:52,270
If you understand, give me your pinkies and promise!

267
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,910
Promise! Promise!

268
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,010
 It was fun watching him perform. 

269
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,420
 It was a good way to pass the time every day. 

270
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,490
Promise! Promise!

271
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,990
Mom!

272
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,300
Aigoo, Gyu Nam's family is suffering the most.

273
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,020
Their son's company isn't doing well.

274
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,890
He can barely get paid every month.

275
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,550
He hasn't come home in more than a year, I suppose.

276
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:25,300
They can't often come because her only grandchild

277
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,170
needs to go to the hospital all the time.

278
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,620
Gyu Nam is so nice.

279
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,450
What a pity.

280
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,600
Let's just drink.

281
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,170
Aigoo. Go ahead and drink.

282
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,020
Do you want me to help you?

283
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,010
- Aigoo, you'd ruin your clothes!
- Give it.

284
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,580
Don't ruin your clothes!

285
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,060
You treated us to tasty food. I should be doing this, at least.

286
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,540
Mom.

287
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,260
You're so pretty.

288
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,020
Should we take a selfie together?

289
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,670
- Aigoo! What are you talking about?
- Come here!

290
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:02,630
- Come here, Mom! Come on!
- Don't do it!

291
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,870
Okay, one, two, three!

292
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,590
Mom, smile!

293
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,870
One, two, three!

294
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:17,160
Okay! We'll draw winners for the prizes for moms and dads here!

295
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,870
- Here comes the first-place prize.
- First place!

296
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,730
Far-infrared Gamma Radiation Lamp!

297
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,760
Quiet, quiet, quiet!

298
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,440
What happens when the grandchildren come over?

299
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,730
They don't come near you because they say you smell, right?

300
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,720
If you turn this on before they come over, I'm sure they'd like you more!

301
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,640
It takes the smells away, and it kills harmful bugs, too!

302
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,230
Okay, then...

303
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,100
The first-place prize...

304
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,050
Who would it be, who would it be, who would it be?

305
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,510
Okay!

306
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,220
No. 27!

307
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,980
No. 27!

308
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,120
No. 27, where are you?

309
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,450
Gyu Nam's mom is 27! Over here!

310
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,540
- She's No. 27!
- Aigoo!

311
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,480
Come here, come here!

312
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,280
♫  You got it! You got No. 1.  ♫

313
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,220
♫  That's what it's like to be No. 1  ♫

314
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,280
A round of applause!

315
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,260
Please write this down first.

316
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,550
We're paying for the product. You just need to pay taxes and the public utility charge.

317
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,150
Aigoo, I have no money.

318
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,310
Give this to someone else who needs it.

319
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:41,170
Mom, not everyone wins first place.

320
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,590
I will pay for the 22% of taxes and the public utility charge.

321
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,860
You can just take it.

322
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,980
Give that to her.

323
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,870
- No, no!
- Take it, take it!

324
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,540
Don't do that. I don't need it!

325
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,090
What's wrong?

326
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,500
- Mom!
- Give it to me instead!

327
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,560
 

328
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,380
 I didn't go to the venue on purpose since that day. 

329
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,610
Mom!

330
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,950
You scared me! What brings you here?

331
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,810
Mom, how come you don't come to my shows these days?

332
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,770
I feel bad.

333
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,630
I feel like I should buy you something.

334
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,980
If you don't want to come, I'll just sing here instead.

335
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,330
No!

336
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:33,100
♫  My love toward seaweed is guaranteed...  ♫

337
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,020
 I didn't do anything for him. 

338
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,680
 I felt so grateful. 

339
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,820
♫  It's premium love  ♫

340
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:45,470
How's refreshing seaweed soup for dinner tonight?

341
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,830
♫  Even if I have to cross the Pacific, the Atlantic  ♫

342
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,790
♫  Even if I have to cross the Indian Ocean  ♫

343
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,440
♫  I will run over if seaweed calls me  ♫

344
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,740
♫  I will run over no matter what  ♫

345
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,440
Looks like you're happy about something.

346
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,180
Do you want to see it?

347
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,530
It's my son.

348
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,900
He's five this year.

349
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,310
My grandkid is five this year, too.

350
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:23,240
He's pretty because he resembles you.

351
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,040
He's a bit sick.

352
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,550
I can't see him often because he's at the hospital.

353
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:33,620
I'll make a lot of money and bring him lots of toys this time.

354
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:41,250
Aigoo! I'll eat a lot and sing well!

355
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,090
Thank you, Mom.

356
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,500
It's so good!

357
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:56,250
Thank you, Mom. I enjoyed the meal.

358
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,440
Make sure to come to my show, okay?

359
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,150
Don't come out! Go back in!

360
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,300
 Working hard to raise the sick son 

361
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,920
 reminded me of my Gyu Nam. 

362
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,520
Aigoo, how come you're so good at singing?

363
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,370
You drive me crazy!

364
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:34,610
Is that so? I'll give you some more.

365
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:37,510
Mom! What brings you here?

366
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:42,200
I'm here to buy something, too.

367
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,160
You don't even go to the hospital to save money.

368
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,370
No! I'm fine!

369
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,120
I know how that feels, too.

370
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,520
This money...

371
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,990
You should keep it.

372
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,430
You have to ask your kids for money if you run out.

373
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,400
Then you'd feel guilty again!

374
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,600
Aigoo, you're so unbelievably thoughtful.

375
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,380
Instead of taking your money,

376
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,730
can I ask you a favor?

377
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,970
 

378
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:26,930
I get tens of thousand wons for commission if you just get approved.

379
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:31,210
When you get it, you can just tear it up and throw it away.

380
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,550
Did I ask for too much?

381
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,210
Mom, let's forget about this!

382
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,260
- We'll do it next time-
- No, no, no!

383
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,710
I'll do it.

384
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,320
 

385
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,520
 

386
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,680
Here you go.

387
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,000
Aigoo.

388
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,300
- Aigoo, thank you!
- Thank you.

389
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,790
Take care!

390
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:05,080
Since you did me a favor, I should do something for you in return.

391
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,060
What are you talking about? I'm okay.

392
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,130
You won the first-place prize last time.

393
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,450
I paid the taxes and public utility charge instead of you.

394
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,770
I will bring it to you tomorrow.

395
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,460
Don't do that! I'm sure it costs a lot.

396
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,130
We already gave it to you!

397
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:23,870
Now you have to use it at home.

398
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,800
- She can't just sign stuff like that.
- I know.

399
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,590
He lied about the sick five-year-old son.

400
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,170
He lied to Ms. Lee about having a son.

401
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:47,210
He heard about her son, who lives far away, and his sick son from her neighbors.

402
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:52,080
So he copied that exactly so she thinks of him as his son.

403
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:58,000
Ms. Lee feels bad about her son, who works hard far away.

404
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,600
That's why she couldn't ignore it when he said he'd sing and bring his son toys.

405
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,110
My grandma rarely took out the money she tucked away deep inside the closet.

406
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:12,860
The fact that she took that out and tried to give it to him...

407
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,550
It means she really thought of him as her own son.

408
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,990
She had no idea that he was a bastard.

409
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,500
 

410
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:28,720
 

411
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,520
 

412
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,200
Aigoo, Mom! Are you going to the market to sell seaweed?

413
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,010
Yes. I thought I might sell some since the weather is nice.

414
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,770
Should I help you sell it like I did last time?

415
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,990
Don't do that! It'd tire you out for no reason.

416
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,420
Oh, Mom.

417
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,560
Could you watch this for a moment? I want to go eat real quick.

418
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,960
Okay, don't worry about it, and go eat a lot.

419
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,540
You just need to charge whatever's written here.

420
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,620
But if you want to give it away for free, you can.

421
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,530
Aigoo, I can't give it away for free.

422
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,310
I should take what it costs.

423
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,660
Go ahead and eat.

424
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,950
I'll put this away for you then.

425
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,950
Okay, okay, okay!

426
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,410
- I'll be right back!
- Okay.

427
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,940
What are you doing here? It's Gyu Nam's mom!

428
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,700
What are you doing here anyway?

429
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,310
Are you giving these away for free?

430
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:24,500
They're not for free. They're for sale.

431
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,570
Try picking up one of each. They're nice products.

432
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:31,210
Aigoo, I should check it out!

433
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,710
Does it work well?

434
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:37,440
- Is this the price?
- Yes, the prices are written there.

435
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,590
Mom, hold on!

436
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,770
Sell all of this to me. Someone asked me to get some.

437
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,560
- You want all this?
- Yes, here.

438
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,470
No, that's too much! No!

439
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,960
- It's because I sold it for a lot.
- But still, that's too much...

440
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,550
- Take it, take it, take it!
- No!

441
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,650
When your son and grandson come over,

442
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:02,670
don't take his money and give him money this time.

443
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,180
Your grandkids will be so surprised.

444
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,100
I'm sure they'd be shocked!

445
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,920
Is anyone here?

446
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:15,180
I'll finish things up here. Go wash your hands. Take the trash out, too.

447
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,180
- Okay. Thank you, Mom.
- Okay.

448
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,320
Yes, welcome!

449
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,300
- Do you sell this stuff?
- Yes.

450
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,940
- What did you want?
- I'll just have a look...

451
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,300
- I want to see what you have.
- They all have prices tags.

452
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,340
Yes.

453
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,880
Mom!

454
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,950
Mom!

455
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,560
Can I store these here for a bit?

456
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,800
Those precious things are getting wet! Hurry, hurry!

457
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,530
Aigoo!

458
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:54,300
It suddenly started pouring at the venue.

459
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,400
Can I store these for a bit since there's nowhere to put them?

460
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,850
Of course! It's fine.

461
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,640
- Go ahead!
- Yes.

462
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,800
- Mom, thank you.
- Don't mention it.

463
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,190
I'll go get more. Wait for me!

464
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,980
Aigoo!

465
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,300
Yes, this is it!

466
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:26,970
Forget about everything! Either you give me a new one, or give me a refund!

467
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,870
What are you talking about? Why would I give you a refund?

468
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:32,150
I heard you were sitting there!

469
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,890
It's because I was asked to watch things for a moment!

470
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,850
You told me to buy them! You said they're good products!

471
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:42,890
Aigoo, Gyu Nam's Mom! What happened anyway?

472
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:51,030
What's going on? Geez!

473
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:56,060
There they come! There they come!

474
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,110
Over here!

475
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:01,260
This grandma sold this to me!

476
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,730
You're Ms. Lee Im Soon, right?

477
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,810
How could you sell us faulty products?

478
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,840
Please come to the police station for a moment.

479
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,550
It doesn't even work! What will you do with this?

480
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,090
What do you mean, I bought them?

481
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,620
You made a credit card under your name.

482
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,800
- You paid for the goods with it and received them.
- I did?

483
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,600
Here. It says you bought them with a credit card.

484
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,170
How many times do I have to show it to you?

485
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,850
No! I was just helping someone.

486
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:31,960
Everyone saw you receiving money!

487
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,810
Why did you take money if you were just helping?

488
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:39,200
I took it because he told me to give it as pocket money to my son.

489
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,710
I think you're mistaken right now.

490
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:45,260
You're not here as a victim.

491
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,660
You're in on it, too!

492
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:52,010
Aunt, Aunt. Hold on. All these products are faulty.

493
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,820
My aunt got burnt on her back!

494
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,220
You can't sell stuff you can't even use, Grandma.

495
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,090
- I just-
- Calm down and have a seat.

496
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:05,150
Ma'am, have a seat. Calm down, calm down.

497
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:08,610
Call your son and tell him to come here.

498
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:11,480
Pardon? I can't call my son!

499
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,870
Don't you have anyone young around you?

500
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:18,100
I only have my son, his wife, and their son.

501
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,420
Call your son then! Won't you resolve this?

502
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,670
I can't call my son!

503
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:28,580
Sir! Please don't call my son!

504
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:33,190
He's working really hard far away right now!

505
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:39,390
I beg you! Please just punish me, sir!

506
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,630
Seriously, I can't talk to her.

507
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,970
 

508
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,930
 Mom! It's me. 

509
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:22,980
Don't call me mom.

510
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,730
What's wrong, Mom?

511
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,220
The whole neighborhood came to me.

512
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,900
I went to the police station,

513
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,890
but they told me to bring my son...

514
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,770
Of course, they did.

515
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:45,100
If you can't take care of it, your son should instead.

516
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,900
I can't even help him.

517
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,930
I can't make him suffer!

518
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:58,610
But I'm sure your son will have to.

519
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:05,430
That's why I called you to give you a tip.

520
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:12,930
You can just be responsible for everything and die.

521
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,790
Your son and grandson won't be affected then.

522
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,240
Think about it carefully.

523
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,480
I hung up, I hung up!

524
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,510
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

525
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:43,590
 Even if I die, 

526
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:49,130
 I can't let my son s-suffer from it. 

527
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,640
She should be reporting him.

528
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,790
But she ended up being reported.

529
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,420
Shouldn't she, still?

530
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,910
Even if she does, he probably won't get punished properly.

531
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:06,870
Why? All the products he sold were of poor quality.

532
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:12,820
Even if you buy something for 100 won and sell it for 1,000 won, it's legal.

533
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,170
It's just a matter of conscience.

534
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,610
He committed all sorts of crimes.

535
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:21,270
He's doing all kinds of bad things you can do to old people.

536
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:26,450
They're trying to get money out of those poor old people. Bastards.

537
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:32,030
Why are they only targeting the ones that are already suffering?

538
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:35,540
Because they don't think they're suffering.

539
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:41,260
To them, they're the targets with higher success rates.

540
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,850
People don't know the truth if you don't tell them.

541
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:47,370
"I didn't buy them. I'm a victim, too. I was scammed."

542
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,680
Why didn't she speak up more strongly like that?

543
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,500
Their goal was clear from the beginning.

544
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:58,370
The ones who can't talk to their children about what they did.

545
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:04,140
They looked for the ones who'd take responsibility for everything.

546
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,820
Making a face like that.

547
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,440
 
 You can just be responsible for everything and die. 

548
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,110
 Your son and grandson won't be affected then. 

549
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,210
I think Ms. Lee was also

550
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,630
more afraid of his son's suffering than hers.

551
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:26,810
She only asked questions regarding her son until the end.

552
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,310
This reminds me of my grandma.

553
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:31,460
These goddamn bastards.

554
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,550
What should we do with them?

555
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,420
We should return it...

556
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,130
- back to them.
- Right?

557
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,800
 

558
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,590
 

559
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,740
 Hello. Thank you for coming to Rainbow Premium Taxi Service. 

560
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:34,620
 I'll tell you a few points to remember for your safety and convenience. 

561
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:39,360
 While we're working on your case, the taxi meter will be left turned on. 

562
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,480
 As for the taxi fare, after the case is closed, it will be settled at a later time. 

563
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,620
 Depending on the situation, there may be an extra charge. 

564
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,710
 After using the taxi, you may not mention matters 

565
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:53,900
 relevant to Rainbow Premium Taxi Service to others. 

566
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,720
 We ask you to keep that in mind. 

567
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:02,610
 If you wish to commission us, press the blue button on the left. 

568
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:08,010
 And if you wish not to, press the red button on the right. 

569
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,870
 Please pick one now. 

570
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:15,880
 Mom. One, two, three! 

571
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,420
 When you get it, you can just tear it up and throw it away. 

572
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,800
 You made a credit card under your name. 

573
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,290
 You paid for the goods with it and received them. 

574
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,680
Hello?

575
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,440
 This is Ms. Lee Im Soon, right? 

576
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,650
 You have overdue payments for your card. 

577
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,580
But I don't have money.

578
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:47,270
 We have no choice but to file a lawsuit, then. 

579
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,100
Lawsuit?

580
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,980
If I get sued,

581
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,690
will my son find out, too?

582
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,390
 Yes, that's correct. 

583
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:59,350
 If you don't pay, we have to make your children pay instead. 

584
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:01,740
Ma'am, I'm sorry!

585
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,250
It's my fault...

586
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,430
 It's not your fault. 

587
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,580
 Don't blame yourself. 

588
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:23,360
 We'll return everything back to you. 

589
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,440
No. 5283 is getting started.

590
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:18,520
I'll send you the locations of the wholesalers.

591
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:25,930
 

592
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:28,600
 

593
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,460
There.

594
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,290
 

595
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,950
That's too much! Use some tape...

596
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:53,810
They supply broken appliances.

597
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:55,530
And they've been purchasing with cash.

598
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:58,410
It was not easy to find them.

599
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:11,440
Far-infrared Gamma Radiation Lamp.

600
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,410
Does it really kill all the invisible bugs, by the way?

601
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:19,230
Sure. It's gamma radiation.

602
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:22,810
It kills invisible bugs, birds, dogs, and humans, too. They all die.

603
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:24,720
It's dangerous.

604
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,420
But it's all fake.

605
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:30,370
The sterilizing lamp they sold was just a regular lamp with a cellophane wrap on it.

606
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:32,280
They didn't show any effort.

607
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,890
They're doing it carelessly because the old people don't know.

608
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:39,550
How could they sell stuff like that?

609
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:42,410
- Sir!
- Yes!

610
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:43,960
Aigoo, let's see...

611
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,350
Thank you for today, too. Here's 100,000 won.

612
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:50,600
- Yes, thank you!
- Thank you!

613
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,880
- Come again!
- Yes, yes!

614
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,890
Is that it?

615
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,790
The weather will be nice tomorrow.

616
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,800
Mothers and fathers!

617
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,740
I came because I missed you!

618
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:36,910
No, we came because we want to live here!

619
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,390
Come and watch!

620
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:53,080
♫  Walking so slowly like that  ♫

621
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:57,160
♫  When will you get to me at that rate  ♫

622
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:05,570
♫  Just like birds in that blue sky, come flying to me  ♫

623
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:11,200
♫  Looking around here and there  ♫

624
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,410
He sings so well!

625
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:15,330
He's so good.

626
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:18,210
- Why are your shoulders so stiff?
- It's because I work a lot.

627
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:20,130
You can't work too much!

628
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:23,060
- You should take care of yourself from now on.
- Okay.

629
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,890
This thing is...

630
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:32,830
♫  Love, my love who drifted away  ♫

631
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:41,280
♫  Noonim, the one I miss  ♫

632
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,810
Let's go with a solo shot.

633
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,810
The picture quality is good. Nice.

634
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:59,810
 

635
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,850
Kimchi! One, two!

636
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,810
Take care!

637
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:30,690
Can I see what message he got?

638
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:33,240
Mr. Kim Do Gi!

639
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,210
Don't ask me if you can. Just ask me to send it.

640
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:39,820
You're making it sound like there are things I can't do.

641
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:47,000
He shared the photo as soon as he took picture with him.

642
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,700
It's obvious what he'll do next.

643
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:54,620
- You all have prize numbers, right?
- Yes!

644
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,590
Here's the third-place prize!

645
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:59,340
Third place! Third place! Third place!

646
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:02,720
It's already predetermined. Why are you so excited?

647
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,290
Don't worry! You won't get picked!

648
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:08,170
Be quiet. They said I'll have 70% of luck today.

649
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:10,580
 I have good luck today, okay? 

650
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:13,360
Geez.

651
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:17,570
 
Okay, the first place goes to...

652
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:23,450
Who would it be, who would it be, who would it be?

653
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:24,530
I got it!

654
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:27,590
Who would it be, who would it be, who would it be?

655
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:31,940
No. 19!

656
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,390
No. 19! Where are you? Where are you?

657
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:36,400
Where's No. 19?

658
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,780
Over here?

659
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,940
Congratulations on winning first place!

660
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:45,150
♫  You got it! You got No. 1!  ♫

661
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:49,660
♫  That's what it's like to be No. 1  ♫

662
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,730
 A round of applause! 

663
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,270
 - Here you go.
- Congratulations! 

664
00:48:56,270 --> 00:49:00,030
The ones who won prizes today

665
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:04,950
will have to file a simple form for collecting prizes.

666
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:09,770
IDs! Make sure to have your ID ready, everyone!

667
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:14,390
 

668
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:19,140
Yong Chil will be on vacation tomorrow. Send this right away and make sure it's active.

669
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,190
- Yes!
- Vacation?

670
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:22,700
How about us?

671
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:26,370
Yong Chil? Active?

672
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:28,390
Active...

673
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:32,370
- Go Eun.
 - Hold on, don't tell me. 

674
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:35,230
I'll guess what you're asking for.

675
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:36,990
I'm sure you'll guess correctly.

676
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:39,510
I haven't said anything yet!

677
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:42,460
So what's Ms. Lee Im Soon's situation right now?

678
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,200
There are six active phone numbers under her name!

679
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,950
 Does she know about this? 

680
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,360
Probably not, right?

681
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:01,370
They probably targeted her because she won't be able to check.

682
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:04,410
They probably did everything they could do with those numbers.

683
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:09,080
 They bought mobile game items with all the credits on those phone numbers. 

684
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,670
 If you combine everything, it's a lot of money. 

685
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:14,590
She needs to get it all back.

686
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:18,630
First of all, I need to meet with Yong Chil first.

687
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:29,340
In summary, you got a discount through the Smart 83 plan.

688
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:34,990
You'll owe 153,800 won per month with the 36-month install payments.

689
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:38,870
No one can match this price. I guarantee you!

690
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:41,850
If you just sign this, I'll help you activate the number immediately.

691
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,900
- Next time...
- Hey!

692
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,790
Will you just leave after hearing the explanation?

693
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:50,710
- Sir, do you want to die?
- Pardon?

694
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,860
 

695
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,890
 

696
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,360
 

697
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:17,500
 

698
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,840
Geez!

699
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:24,300
It won't get us enough money to try to sell like that.

700
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,930
What should we do, Hyungnim?

701
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:28,840
Did you activate all the numbers for that old man who picks up trash?

702
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,190
Yes. I got him the most expensive plan,

703
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:35,060
paid services, and game times to the max.

704
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:37,970
I got three latest phone models for 9 million wons!

705
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,990
Okay, here we go!

706
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:43,100
Who's next?

707
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:48,260
It's this old man. The trot singer, Jang, got him for us.

708
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:51,360
Wow, he looks like he has good credit!

709
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,510
 One, two! 

710
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:57,990
Make sure to get him everything to the max, so he doesn't feel left out.

711
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,110
Try getting 1.2 million out of him.

712
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:04,720
Hyungnim.

713
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,170
- I'll make sure to do it!
- Okay!

714
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:11,940
By the way, that Trot singer Jang...

715
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,440
I don't know why he's so good at his job.

716
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:18,570
He gets us nice, old people all the time. How nice is that?

717
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:21,050
What's his secret?

718
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:44,130
You got a customer. You won't even greet me?

719
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:47,270
I've never seen a customer who comes in through the back door.

720
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:50,460
Anyway, welcome.

721
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,470
Have a seat.

722
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:02,720
I'm here to cancel the membership.

723
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,350
Cancel?

724
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:06,380
You want to cancel?

725
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:13,170
Seriously!

726
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,180
Where did this man come from?

727
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:21,130
I said I was a customer. Let's cancel it right now.

728
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,570
We don't do cancellations.

729
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:40,350
I'm sure you do.

730
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,030
You don't seem to understand!

731
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:02,800
Get out of here before you get hurt.

732
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:09,230
What a nice service. You're speaking on my behalf, too.

733
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:12,720
Look at you, you little...

734
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,560
Okay, let's go.

735
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,280
 

736
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:27,450
Cancellation is complete!

737
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:13,390
♫  Don't take the stairs, take the elevator  ♫

738
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:25,400
Yong Chil, did this bastard go on vacation or not?

739
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:29,460
That old man's about to conk. I need to activate the numbers before he does.

740
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:36,090
Hey! Let's go to the sauna.

741
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:39,240
Geez, I smell like old people.

742
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:21,140
Mr. Kim Do Gi, how should we plan this one?

743
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:43,010
What should we do if that's what Mr. Kim does?

744
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:44,620
- Let's gather things.
- Gather what?

745
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:45,920
What?

746
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,310
What do you mean?

747
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:49,700
How will we gather things if we don't know?

748
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,990
- So we should gather everything.
- So what exactly?

749
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:54,840
I said I don't know, either! Why do you keep asking-

750
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,290
Am I the weird one now?

751
00:57:57,290 --> 00:58:00,100
You're so weird. Why do you keep asking?

752
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,000
You look like you still don't get it.

753
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,660
Who would get this?

754
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:07,810
 
Among the Bluebird members who moved recently,

755
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:11,470
17 of them don't have window guards in their houses.

756
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:13,770
Also, winter is coming early this year.

757
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:16,820
For houses with old people, we should install window guards

758
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:20,700
and windbreak cloth, as well.

759
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,920
I heard some organizations stopped donating.

760
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,320
Would you be okay without them?

761
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:28,460
I'm sure the window guards alone are costly.

762
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:33,930
Yes. It'd be nice if the victims' pain went away, just like the donations.

763
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:36,780
I'll try to work harder on that end.

764
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:45,600
Should we end the meeting here today, then?

765
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,070
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

766
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:49,310
- I'll get going first.
- Yes.

767
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:55,050
Aigoo, what's going on?

768
00:58:56,050 --> 00:59:00,700
I... really drove safely, but...

769
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,670
Please take it out of my paycheck.

770
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:06,590
Did you get hurt?

771
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:09,870
- Pardon?
- Did you stop by the hospital?

772
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:11,090
No.

773
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:13,650
Go to the hospital first from now on, even if you're okay.

774
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:16,180
That comes first, okay?

775
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:18,690
Let's go. Let's take my car.

776
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:21,250
You don't have to try to adjust too quickly.

777
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:22,880
You're already doing well.

778
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,390
Thank you.

779
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:26,950
How's the commute? Is it okay?

780
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:29,510
I actually signed a lease for a place to move into.

781
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:32,050
That's great. Get in.

782
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:40,730
Put that on the left.

783
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:42,670
Further left.

784
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:45,080
- All the way to the left!
- You should've told me earlier!

785
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,180
I have to move the ladder. Why do you make me move so much?

786
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,890
To the right, to the right!

787
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:50,670
No, the left is better. Left is better.

788
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:51,710
-There?
- Over there!

789
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:53,750
You should've told me earlier...

790
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:56,870
Stop knocking stuff around! I can't focus!

791
00:59:56,870 --> 01:00:00,220
Go Eun, the display is key in sales.

792
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:02,350
I know it's annoying. Please put up with it a bit.

793
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:04,950
She wouldn't know because she never had a sales job.

794
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:07,490
You're having a blast, aren't you?

795
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,400
Over there?

796
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,050
Aigoo, welcome!

797
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:15,390
Welcome, buy one, get one for free!

798
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:18,440
I'm so glad a general store came!

799
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,580
I'll give it to you cheaply! Just 1 million won!

800
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,960
- What if we get two?
- If you get two, it's 5,000 won!

801
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,110
This one's 1 million won!

802
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:35,750
Geez!

803
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:38,770
Fix the AC! I'm roasting. Look at us now!

804
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:40,870
It's better to scrap it.

805
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:45,210
How come all I see is a field no matter how far we go?

806
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:47,190
Are you sure this is the right way?

807
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:49,950
How strange. Isn't this the way?

808
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:53,400
What's this?

809
01:00:57,260 --> 01:01:00,010
What's going on? Get off, get off, get off!

810
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:02,020
Get off right now, man!

811
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:07,990
What's with this?

812
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:09,490
Hey!

813
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:12,680
I told you to check the car because it can't break down in the countryside.

814
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:16,470
- It was definitely okay!
- Geez!

815
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:18,640
Hyungnim, should we call the insurance company?

816
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,810
What if we do? Are they coming from across the street?

817
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:25,120
When will they come? You dodged?

818
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,470
 

819
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:16,760
Is something wrong?

820
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:37,500


821
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,700
♫  Take me back, it's over!  ♫

822
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:44,370
♫  Put the pain that's been trapping you behind  ♫

823
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:48,410
♫  And I'll fight, fight for you  ♫

824
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:51,910
♫  I will run to the end of the world  ♫

825
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:54,570
♫  Fight to the end  ♫

826
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:58,580
♫  Cold glances and smirks toward you  ♫

827
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:02,470
♫  Even the endless pain  ♫

828
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:05,820
♫  Just like hot flame  ♫

829
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:08,130
 

830
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:09,640
 Shall we get started, too? 

831
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,620
 Emergency Service, be on your way! 

832
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:13,600
 Did you call the Emergency Service? 

833
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,320
 - Make the insurance cover it!
- Why? 

834
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,110
 Let's go out for a walk. 

835
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:20,000
 There was big fish right in front of us. 

836
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,310
 I'm sure they hid it somewhere in the field. 

837
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:24,890
 All of us will chase them starting tomorrow. 

838
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:26,360
 Do something for me. 

839
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:27,280
 What should we do now? 

840
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,890
 Go Eun, you're all we have right now. 

841
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:31,700
 My name is Eun. 

842
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:36,260
 Their twisted mind targets only the kindest people. 

843
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:38,060
 They should experience that, too. 

844
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:39,790
 Please tell Mr. Jang 

845
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:42,960
 that it's time to take the last walk.
