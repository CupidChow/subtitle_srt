1
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,010
 

2
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,280
♫  Elavator  ♫

3
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,900
♫  Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta  ♫

4
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,200


5
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,660
Let's just have seven teams today.

6
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,370
Yes, sir.

7
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,910
- You brought him?
- Yes.

8
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,090
He's waiting inside.

9
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,870
You came.

10
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,860
Yes, Mr. On, you made it.

11
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,760
I'm sorry, I'm a bit late.

12
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,070
No! Thanks to you, I get to have some tea, too.

13
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,040
By the way, the view is so amazing here.

14
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,360
- How about the contract?
- Yes.

15
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:13,320
We can start doing the interior as soon as the city approves the renovation.

16
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,720
For the reopening, it'd take about...

17
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,950
four weeks, I think.

18
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,220
That's good.

19
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,100
I'm giving up all my management rights because I trust you, Mr. On.

20
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,080
Since when did you trust me?

21
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,690
We just bid high.

22
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,550
All we have left to do is...

23
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,960
get our hands on a lot of money!

24
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,540
- Geez!
- I sent the deposit.

25
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,870
Okay.

26
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,280
Yes, I got it.

27
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:48,020
Mr. On, you were a bit sloppy just now.

28
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,780
I was?

29
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,420
You have to send the money after I stamp my seal.

30
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,200
If you send the money, but then I don't stamp it,

31
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,220
you'd be losing a great deal.

32
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,870
Okay.

33
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,290
We're done finishing up now.

34
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,910
Why don't we go somewhere nice and...

35
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,020
Hold on, what's going on?

36
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,350
Ouch.

37
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,090
I read through the contract,

38
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,580
and it seems you make the most money when the contract gets canceled

39
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,350
because of a personal reason from the other party.

40
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,380
H-Hey!

41
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,970
Mr. On, you bastard...

42
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,240
If you disappear now,

43
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,740
we become the No. 1 creditor of the hotel.

44
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,780
You were a bit sloppy.

45
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,600
That's why something like this is happening to you.

46
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,740
I thought we were friends!

47
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,550
Weren't we friends?

48
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,950
Friends, my foot.

49
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,590
You have to be on a similar level to be friends.

50
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,950
We'll run it well.

51
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,920
It's ours now.

52
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,710
 

53
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,390
 

54
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,000
 

55
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,540
 

56
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,490
 

57
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,710
 

58
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,020
 

59
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:29,070
A body was found halfway up Mt. Yangmoon yesterday.

60
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,740
It was Mr. Kang.

61
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,550
 
Kang Pil Seung.

62
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,860
Just like in Kotaya, I think this was

63
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,130
also to cover up something.

64
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,520
I think it's the opposite.

65
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,870
Opposite?

66
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,030
Kang Pil Seung was living in a subway station.

67
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,390
But they moved him all the way to Mt. Yangmoon and made it look like a suicide.

68
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,880
This isn't a cover-up. It's more of a self-display.

69
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,020
They're the type that enjoys playing games.

70
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,770
The type that enjoys playing games, huh?

71
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,000
If so...

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,540
they might already know who we are.

73
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,450
They might be watching us already.

74
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,680
From somewhere closer than expected.

75
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,060
 

76
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,650
 

77
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,220
 
- Come!
- Geez, what is it?

78
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,700
Just come first!

79
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,970
Can't you just tell me? I'm a bit busy right now.

80
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,700
What?

81
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,750
Just get on first!

82
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,010
Geez, you scared me!

83
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,380
Put the seatbelt on.

84
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,630
Can't you just tell me? I'm really busy!

85
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,920
I can tell you only if you put the seatbelt on.

86
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,630
It better be something important.

87
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,330
- Did you put it on?
- Yes!

88
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,700
Okay.

89
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,190
What do you think? It can normally be used as a seatbelt,

90
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,890
but in special situations, it turns into a restraining belt

91
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,840
for tying up bad guys!

92
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,660
You can never undo it!

93
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,570
Also, the front seat tilts back as soon as it starts restraining.

94
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,810
What do you think? Isn't it amazing?

95
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,440
It's amazing! Totally amazing!

96
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,870
Go Eun, what do you think?

97
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,530
Undo this when I'm being nice to you.

98
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,780
I'll go to the bathroom.

99
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,750
It's not like that. I just wanted your approval.

100
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,150
I told you to undo it!

101
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,910
- If I do, you'll hit me, won't you?
- Five...

102
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,810
Four, one! That's it!

103
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,040
Wait for me! You said you won't ditch me!

104
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,420
Mr. Park, where are you running to, anyway?

105
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,730
I need to tell you something! Mr. Park!

106
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,840
Mr. On, you came in early.

107
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,860
I'll be leaving soon.

108
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,120
Do Gi hyungnim, I picked up seven passengers today!

109
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,710
What are they doing this time?

110
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,510
Open it when I'm being nice to you.

111
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,100
You're only talking nicely. I'm not a fool!

112
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,330
Also, Jin Eon made that thing all by himself!

113
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,390
You can't say that! You're hurting my feelings!

114
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,250
What do you mean? It's true that you made it.

115
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,750
I only did what you told me to do!

116
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,280
- What's going on?
- Don't worry about it!

117
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,790
G-Go Eun!

118
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,780
- I worked here for years. I'll just break this open!
- Well, no, no!

119
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,200
- No, no, you'd break it that way!
- You'd hurt your hands!

120
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,820
You don't even know how to do it! What are you doing?

121
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,020
- Open right now! I might end up breaking this whole thing!
- No, no!

122
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,420
You're breaking it!

123
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,450
- No, no! Don't!
- I said I won't just let it slide!

124
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,140
No!

125
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,650
- Come on!
- You're breaking the car!

126
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,380
- Open it right now, then!
- No!

127
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,780
It worked! It worked! Do you want to see me open it?

128
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:58,080
Please move! I'll just pick up my sister!

129
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,970
Everything is up to the individuals.

130
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,230
We don't hold anyone.

131
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,000
I beg you!

132
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,360
Please let go of my sister.

133
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,340
Please, let me just take my sister with me!

134
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,980
Take her?

135
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,040
Who do you think you are?

136
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,940
She's...

137
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,910
my only family.

138
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,300
She's my sister!

139
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,940
Family?

140
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,280
You're stalking her using that as an excuse.

141
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:44,790
Not only that, you're disparaging her belief.

142
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,880
Help me. My sister is in there. They're not allowing her to come out!

143
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,300
You can't do this here. We got a complaint.

144
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,320
What are you doing? Get her out of my private property right now!

145
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,840
- Let's go.
- No, no!

146
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,310
No! My sister is in there!

147
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,920
No!

148
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,240
Lee Jin Sun! Lee Jin Sun, come out right now!

149
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,490
Stop it! Let go!

150
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,270
Unni!

151
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,920
I'll never leave unless I can leave with my sister!

152
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,960
Unni!

153
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,730
Hey! Lee Jin Sun!

154
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:31,010
Let go! I can't leave! Unni!

155
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,730
- Lee Jin Sun, come out!
- This might count as obstruction of justice!

156
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,630
Please come out!

157
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,260
Let's go! Please!

158
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,430
 

159
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,680
Could you tell me...

160
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,030
what has happened so far?

161
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,730
I don't know what to do.

162
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,390
Well...

163
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,110
Please help my sister.

164
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,400
Let me see.

165
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,940
What if I didn't make it?

166
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,420
Don't say that! I know how smart you are, Jin Hee.

167
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,180
Let's see.

168
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,390
But still, what if I didn't make it?

169
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,480
If you didn't make it...

170
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,620
Unni! Hold on!

171
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,150
You got in!

172
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,480
You got in!

173
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,310
 

174
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,080
 

175
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,060
Well done! My baby!

176
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:06,780
Don't study too much and make a lot of friends, too.

177
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,390
I don't want to. I'll just study.

178
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,670
Don't worry about the tuition, either.

179
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,040
- You should get a boyfriend, too!
- I don't want to!

180
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,710
What do you mean? I think you'll get one right away!

181
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,570
How did you know?

182
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,860
Well done! You did great!

183
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,520
- My baby.
- Thanks for your help.

184
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,530
 

185
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,700
 Unni... 

186
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,280
 was not only my sister, 

187
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,860
 but also my mom and dad. 

188
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,050
- I'll take it now!
- Yes.

189
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,620
One, two... Oh.

190
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,170
- Excuse me...
- What is it?

191
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,080
Unni!

192
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,260
Unni, are you sick?

193
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,230
I think I overworked the past few days.

194
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,080
It's chronic myeloid leukemia.

195
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,740
We still need to do additional tests,

196
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,950
but looks like it has already progressed quite a bit.

197
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,720
 We found out too late that her illness 

198
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,650
 was much scarier than I thought. 

199
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,140
Unni!

200
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,290
Can you leave work at this hour?

201
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,830
I took a half day off. How about the treatment?

202
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,610
Are you done? When do they want you back?

203
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,630
I'm thinking of stopping the treatment.

204
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,520
I think I'm just wasting money. I don't think I'm getting better, either.

205
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,170
If it's about money, you don't have to worry.

206
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,890
We still have a lot of money from Mom and Dad left.

207
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,940
A lot, my foot.

208
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:55,110
Right! Didn't I tell you? My salary went up a lot this time!

209
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,550
You know what? Today marks the second anniversary of the day you started being treated.

210
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:05,640
I think we've been fighting really well for two years.

211
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,520
So you should stop having bad thoughts.

212
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,000
Wait here. I'll go get the prescription.

213
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,210
 Father laid his hand on me and said- 

214
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:48,500
 But at some point, my sister started acting strangely. 

215
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,740
 How did I get healed? How did I recover? 

216
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,690
They told me to get a shot and...

217
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:58,470
 tried to let the demon inside of me again! 

218
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,010
Unni, what are you watching?

219
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,390
Unni!

220
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,490
Huh?

221
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,760
Hey.

222
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,190
Can I use the bathroom?

223
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,940
 She started hiding more things from me. 

224
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,410
 

225
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,500
 

226
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,780
Loan?

227
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,350
What are you doing? Why are you reading my mail?

228
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,300
Unni! What's wrong with your face?

229
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,550
It's nothing.

230
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,440
I fell.

231
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,750
 For the past couple of years, I've received extremely painful treatments every week. 

232
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:05,120
 My body only got worse even if I took a handful of pills at a time, 

233
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,370
 but with just one touch from Father, I could feel that I healed miraculously. 

234
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,990
- What are you doing right now?
- Unni!

235
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,400
You're out of your mind right now. You can't refuse treatment!

236
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,940
What do you know, anyway?

237
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,070
Have you been giving them the money for the treatment all this time?

238
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,410
They're the ones who'll heal me, not the hospital!

239
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:29,730
Is that why you got a loan, too?

240
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,790
To give to these weird people?

241
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,770
I really can't have a conversation with you.

242
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,010
It's just as he said.

243
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,100
Please help me to hold onto your word...

244
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,530
Your words are the way, Father...

245
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,730
I know it's hard, but I hang onto you...

246
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,140
I hold onto your words of strength. Father...

247
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,240
I hold onto your words tightly...

248
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,410
You can't just skip treatments like this. Especially considering her condition.

249
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:05,070
Her condition might worsen unless she starts her treatment quickly.

250
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,440
 Please persuade her and come back with her as soon as possible. 

251
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,510
Unni!

252
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,960
 

253
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,180
 Jin Hee, my condition wasn't able to improve anymore. 

254
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,950
 But then I met him. 

255
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,310
 Don't believe whatever the doctor says. 

256
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:49,920
 I feel like I found a ray of light in the dark. 

257
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,430
 When time passes, you'll also realize 

258
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,910
 how powerful Pure White is. 

259
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:02,420
 As long as he's with me, my condition will continue to improve. 

260
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,570
 Please wait briefly until then. 

261
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,200
Unni.

262
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,290
Unni! Unni!

263
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:15,430
- Lee Jin Sun. That's my sister!
- Non-believers can't go in.

264
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,680
- She needs to go to the hospital!
- Sister Jin Sun

265
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,560
is being treated both physically and mentally.

266
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,500
Unni! Just one moment, please!

267
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,220
Sir.

268
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,550
Is your name Lee Jin Hee?

269
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,540
Yes, I'm Lee Jin Hee.

270
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,500
Jin Sun doesn't want to see you. She wants you to leave.

271
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,480
There's no way. Why would she not want to see me?

272
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,640
I'm done relaying her message.

273
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,370
H-Hold on! Let me just see her! It'd only take a moment!

274
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,390
There's nothing we can do with religious cases.

275
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,870
We're not allowed to.

276
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,930
They kidnapped her, and they don't even let her see her family. What kind of religion is that?

277
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,240
Please help me.

278
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,390
I need to get my sister out of there.

279
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,140
There's nothing we can do if she doesn't want to see you.

280
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,920
You should try to persuade her in person.

281
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,660
How can I do that if they don't even let me see her?

282
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,490
I'm sorry.

283
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,690
 No one would help me. 

284
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:23,950
 I don't know what I should do. 

285
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:37,410
♫  When I'm taking a walk through the quiet night  ♫

286
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:43,420
♫  I think of your face without fail  ♫

287
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,930
♫  You're someone I drew out by gathering the twinkling stars  ♫

288
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,790
Would you like some coffee?

289
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,910
♫  You're someone I drew out by gathering the twinkling stars  ♫

290
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,570
How did you know I was here?

291
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,990
I thought you might be here to see your sister.

292
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:06,780
♫  I wish I could smell this scent of azalea flowers with you  ♫

293
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,800
Even when I think everything is okay now,

294
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,650
once in a while, I think

295
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,550
"Maybe Unni will come back."

296
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,040
She'd tell me, "Are you sleeping in again?

297
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,100
Hurry up and eat."

298
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,780
I hope she comes back as if nothing happened like that.

299
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,980
♫  I miss you, again today  ♫

300
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,550
Isn't that so silly?

301
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:44,770
If you're silly, all of us, including me, Mr. Jang,

302
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,030
Mr. Choi and Mr. Park are silly, too.

303
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:53,520
♫  I'm taking a walk again today  ♫

304
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,740
I want to find the client's sister.

305
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,380
I really want to.

306
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,940
I'll visit her first thing tomorrow.

307
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,700
Give me my daughter back!

308
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,730
You bastard! Come out!

309
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,450
Give me my daughter!

310
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,370
Give me my daughter!

311
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,920
Honey!

312
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,880
- Hey, you, bastard!
- Did you call the police?

313
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,570
Well, they didn't come into the private property.

314
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,900
This is a free country. Why are they acting so vulgar like that?

315
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,440
Let's go.

316
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,700
 

317
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,370
They have tight security.

318
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:23,870
They covered all the windows so you can't see inside.

319
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:27,750
Hold on a sec. I'll connect shortly.

320
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,040
- Geez!
- Are you almost done yet?

321
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,230
It's not that hard. What's taking so long?

322
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,660
Why don't you come up here then? You'd forget everything you know.

323
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,360
Why did I come up here, by the way?

324
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,490
Okay, look inside your bag.

325
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,100
Is there something in it?

326
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,130
My bag?

327
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,650
- Yes, there's something.
- Good work, good work.

328
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,960
Plug that into the middle of the communications socket.

329
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,840
- Connect it.
- Right.

330
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,610
That's what I was here for.

331
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:05,740
Good. Mr. Kim, I'll share the screen.

332
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,060
 

333
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,510
 The end of... 

334
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,110
 the world is approaching! 

335
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,020
Especially the vaccines!

336
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,050
When you're sick and go to the hospital, they give you shots and meds.

337
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,330
They're creating demons!

338
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,240
They're plotting an evil plan!

339
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,050
 Father! 

340
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,330
 Father! 

341
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,450
What's your relationship?

342
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,550
I'm her mother.

343
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:52,070
I'm her daughter.

344
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,210
No, no, no!

345
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,810
How many times did I tell you to cut off the people you're closest with first?

346
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,690
- Father!
- That's how you become pure white

347
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,160
and you can get on the train to the Pure White Land!

348
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,830
How many times do I have to tell you?

349
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,440
Do you want to be left behind and become evil?

350
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,610
- I'm sorry!
- I'm so sorry!

351
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,960
 Father, I'm sorry! 

352
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,640
Forgive us!

353
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,110
- Does it hurt?
- No?

354
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:26,290
- Are you in pain?
- No, no, no...

355
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,380
Remember that pain.

356
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:33,180
Remember this moment whenever you're in pain!

357
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:37,070
Think of the Pure White Land and long for it!

358
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,610
Please, wake up and realize!

359
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:42,090
 Father! 

360
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,460
Help each other.

361
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,300
Cut off all the personal connections.

362
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,660
I must be the only connection you have!

363
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,930
Your only father!

364
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,540
 Do you need help, too? 

365
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,110
Continue.

366
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:21,100
When death approached me,

367
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:26,010
he finally gave me his message.

368
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:30,470
He told me to become the light

369
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:36,120
and save the people who are in pain from the hellfire!

370
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,140
That's why I'll never give up!

371
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:46,340
I'll take every single person with me to the Pure White Land!

372
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,840
I will not take a step back!

373
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,760
and I will not give up!

374
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,640
 Father! 

375
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,790
For Catholicism, there're priests. For churches, there're pastors. And for Pure White Church,

376
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,630
there's Father.

377
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,400
What kind of person is that Father Crybaby?

378
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,060
Ok Joo Man, Father Crybaby...

379
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,600
was in the wholesale fabric business for a long time.

380
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:28,490
His business in China failed, and he started a wholesale fabric business in Korea again.

381
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,840
It sounds pretty ordinary.

382
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,120
I know. It sounds ordinary, right?

383
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,300
But his ordinary-sounding background

384
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,130
includes 14 criminal records.

385
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:42,640
Running a pyramid scheme, embezzlement, spreading false information, fraud, and so on.

386
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,870
What kind of wholesale fabric business did he run anyway?

387
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,460
Also...

388
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,730
Ta-da!

389
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,510
Wow.

390
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:56,590
Aigoo, what's that? Is that a space station?

391
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:01,790
It's a plan for Pure White Church Ok Joo Man is passionately working on.

392
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:04,710
Wow, I can tell that it'd be really expensive.

393
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,260
He plans to own that place and act like a king.

394
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:12,380
It's obviously a cult. Why is Jin Sun refusing to even see her sister?

395
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,480
- I don't get it.
- Because no one thinks that

396
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,870
their religion is a cult.

397
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:25,230
Satisfying their greed by using that belief is the criminal part.

398
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:28,720
What's worse is that the believers

399
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,280
rarely realize that they're victims of a crime.

400
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,650
Because of their belief.

401
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:37,520
Death, demon, and hellfire.

402
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,720
He's controlling people by making them fearful.

403
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,380
The weaker your body and mind get,

404
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,500
the stronger they cling to the leader.

405
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:53,550
To maximize that, he forces them to cut ties with family.

406
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:56,000
He won't even allow her to see her only sister.

407
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,980
A religion that forcibly separates families is no longer a religion.

408
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,250
That just makes them a criminal cult organization.

409
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:10,070
What should we do with this evil father?

410
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,020
Mr. Park.

411
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:24,060
Hit me just five times.

412
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:27,370
- No!
- Actually, you can hit me ten times.

413
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:31,510
No, no, I won't hit you. You hit him! You wanted to!

414
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,420
When did I? Sir, I've never said that!

415
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,780
Hyungnim!

416
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:48,180
Aigoo, Aigoo, Aigoo!

417
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,060
Wake up!

418
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,580
How about the real estate properties?

419
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,700
They dealt with everything in cash.
 

420
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,160
Did you confirm the hidden account?

421
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,950
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

422
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:13,610
They donated everything to various infrastructures.

423
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:16,680
You mean they're managing the assets as a non-profit organization?

424
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,050
No, it's exactly as I said.

425
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,420
They. Donated.

426
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,540
We lost our property fund manager to them again.

427
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,310
It's partially your responsibility, too.

428
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:37,620
This wouldn't have happened if you didn't waste so much time.

429
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,940
What do you do there anyway? Are you playing pretend?

430
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,120
What do you mean, "playing pretend"?

431
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,710
You only get one thing, but not the others.

432
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,700
What?

433
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,680
Hyun Jo,

434
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,690
do you understand the situation right now?

435
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,110
What situation?

436
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:00,670
A pathetic situation where we got all the money taken and couldn't recover a single penny?

437
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:05,020
Stop sounding stupid and just look at the situation.

438
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,290
Stop worrying about chump change.

439
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:21,280
The operating system I built for the Kotaya case was perfect.

440
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:27,890
We even managed the backdoor by bribing the detective just in case.

441
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,700
It's not a system you can easily crack.

442
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:39,540
But they cracked it and came in.

443
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,750
 Where did this person go just now? 

444
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,980
 This taxi driver... 

445
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,660
 came in through the most vulnerable part of the system I created 

446
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,260
and uprooted everything.

447
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,530
Isn't that funny?

448
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,060
But it wasn't just that one time.

449
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,240
He approached us pretending to want an apartment,

450
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,560
but he found our source of property funds,

451
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,800
the breeding facility, and destroyed everything.

452
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,690
They even took all the kids.

453
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:01,130
Do you understand this situation? I can't wrap my head around it.

454
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,110
The old owner of the taxi company.

455
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:15,420
Two useless mechanics who used to be lab workers.

456
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,920
A bookkeeper who used to be a cop, and...

457
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,840
an ex-military taxi driver.

458
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,350
We lost two of our affiliates to these losers.

459
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,120
To these useless people.

460
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,910
Aren't you curious?

461
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,580
Why do they go through all these troubles?

462
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:46,170
There must be a reason.

463
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:52,950
 

464
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,690
 

465
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:09,870
 In the past, tigers, smallpox, and war were the most fearful things for children, 

466
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:14,280
 but modern children can face scary consequences of becoming 

467
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:19,040
 juvenile delinquents by watching illegal videos. 

468
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,440
 Hello. Thank you for coming to Rainbow Premium Taxi Service. 

469
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,310
 I'll tell you a few points to remember for your safety and convenience. 

470
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:33,980
 While we're working on your case, the taxi meter will be left turned on. 

471
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:38,190
 As for the taxi fare, after the case is closed, it will be settled at a later time. 

472
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:41,360
 Depending on the situation, there may be an extra charge. 

473
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,170
 After using the taxi, you may not mention matters 

474
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:48,560
 relevant to Rainbow Premium Taxi Service to others. 

475
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,150
 We ask you to keep that in mind. 

476
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:53,840

482
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,990
It's perfect. I'm sure no one will come.

483
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,910
Let's hurry up!

484
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,240
Let's go!

485
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:04,090
5283 in operation.

486
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,310
Don't worry, Mr. Park. You can do it well.

487
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,430
Repeat after me. "I can do it!"

488
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:29,210
Stop saying that! You don't even know how I feel.

489
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:32,950
Of course, I do! I understand very well.

490
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:36,860
Here. Take one and focus.

491
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,590
Okay, focus!

492
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:00,710
Why am I the only one who always does stuff like this?

493
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:04,430
 You have an authentic face. 

494
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,870
Authentic?

495
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,470
When you do stuff, it's really believable.

496
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:12,190
 Mr. Park, are you wearing makeup? You really look sick. 

497
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,070
 - It turned out so well! 
- What are you talking about?

498
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,670
I didn't put on any.

499
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:19,090
 See? That's what I meant by "authentic." 

500
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:22,960
But I'm so scared!

501
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,260
She's coming, she's coming!

502
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,620
What should I do?

503
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,600
Thank you.

504
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,970
Fighting!

505
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:49,530
What did the hospital say?

506
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,110
They said it'd be difficult.

507
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:57,760
They told me it was hopeless to me, too.

508
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,110
But later, they said I had fully recovered.

509
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,390
Fully recovered?

510
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,110
How?

511
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,180
After I was diagnosed with cancer,

512
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,360
I spent two years with various treatments and surgeries.

513
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:16,050
After spending tens of million wons, I was told

514
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,960
that it's incurable.

515
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,300
When I was distressed after losing everything,

516
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,340
I met Father Ok Joo Man.

517
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,780
Father told me.

518
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,040
"You will heal.

519
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,860
You will heal! You will heal!

520
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,660
You will heal!"

521
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:40,030
Afterward, I felt that I was healing miraculously.

522
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,590
What saved me was neither

523
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:44,390
the doctor nor medicine.

524
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:49,100
It was Father Ok Joo Man!

525
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:04,060
Everyone, be healed

526
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,410
and take the path of eternity together!

527
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:11,810
I will prepare the train to Pure White Land!

528
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,550
Let's all become one!

529
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,850
 Father! 

530
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:19,700
 Father! 

531
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,600
 Father! 

532
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:29,630
You can never go to the hospital because you're in a lot of pain now.

533
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:33,910
The evil spirit and the Pure White energy are fighting in your body.

534
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,190
That's why you're sick.

535
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,680
The more in pain you are, the happier you should be.

536
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,770
The more in pain you are, the more Pure White you'll become.

537
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,430
Father.

538
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,960
I know that there are ones with weak faith among you!

539
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,210
A speck of doubt!

540
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:55,990
Do you know what that is?

541
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,630
This is that speck!

542
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:10,220
The power of Pure White.

543
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:31,440
What more do I need to show you to make you believe me?

544
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,990
What more should I do?

545
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:49,730
♫  Let's go together  ♫

546
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:53,530
♫  Let's take the Pure White train together  ♫

547
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:56,160
♫  Let's take the Pure White train together  ♫

548
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,550
Excuse me.

549
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,500
Are you okay? You look like you're really sick.

550
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,630
I'm okay.

551
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,930
I'm getting a lot better.

552
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,800
Oh, I see.

553
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,980
When I'm sicker,

554
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,510
it means I'm fighting the evil spirit inside me harder.

555
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:19,280
Your sister is waiting outside.

556
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,180
Do you know what my dream is?

557
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,560
Putting Jin Hee on the train to

558
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,210
Pure White Land with me.

559
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:32,990
You can't be treated here. You have to be treated at the hospital!

560
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,570
If I fully recover,

561
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:39,980
Jin Hee will believe in the power of Pure White, too.

562
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:43,720
That's why I'll make sure...

563
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,900
I definitely...

564
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:49,620
recover.

565
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:53,550
♫  He is saving us  ♫

566
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:57,410
♫  Pure White Land...  ♫

567
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,910
 

568
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,440
Aigoo!

569
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,640
I tried to bring her out as Do Gi told me, but she won't listen.

570
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,940
How does she have complete faith in Ok Joo Man?

571
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,670
 

572
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:53,220
Wouldn't it be pointless even if we brought her out? She'll just go back in.

573
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,700
Probably. Unless Ok Joo Man tells her to leave.

574
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,390
What?

575
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:02,980
That cult leader will make his followers leave on his own?

576
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:06,200
 Seeing how things are, I don't think he'd ever do that. 

577
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,500
Of course not.

578
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,070
Why would he do that after going through all the trouble of getting them?

579
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:13,610
You're saying you'd make him do that, right?

580
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:15,540
No, I can't do that, either.

581
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,210
There isn't much I can do.

582
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:20,180
If you can't, who will?

583
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,870
The outcome of this case is completely up to

584
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:26,240
Mr. Park and Mr. Choi.

585
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,860
Us?

586
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,030
U-Us!

587
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,680
Please make all of these possible.

588
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,260
No matter what.

589
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,370
- You want us to make all of this possible?
- Yes.

590
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:59,160
Please do all of these successfully and send them to me.

591
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,750
Okay! Just leave it to us.

592
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,050
Can we really do all this?

593
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,170
Didn't you hear Mr. Kim?

594
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:08,900
He said the outcome is up to us!

595
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:13,440
Don't worry. This is a piece of cake.

596
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:18,550
Oh, right!

597
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:19,920
Geez...

598
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,650
Geez! I get so scared whenever I go there!

599
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:25,630
You can do it.

600
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:28,010
You're the authentic one.

601
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,360
I just can't calm down.

602
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,790
Follow Father! Father! Fighting!

603

 Father! Father!

The power of Pure White!

605
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,170
Father!

606
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,580
There aren't that many seats left on the train to Pure White Land!

607
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:05,170
Leave all the impure belongings with me

608
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:08,070
and become Pure White together!

It's time to strengthen your faith.

629
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:57,050
Please memorize this doctrine.

630
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:58,060
Memorize?

631
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,370
The more you memorize, the stronger your faith will become.

632
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:03,320
And you'll experience a miracle.

You want me to memorize all this?

637
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,970
If you memorize everything

638
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:25,680
so you can recite anytime and anywhere, knock on the door.

639
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,840
I'll open the door then.

640
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:33,170
That means I can only go out if I memorize all of this?

Well, excuse me...

642
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,720

What do you think? Does it suit me?

647
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,960
Mr. Kim must be waiting. Let's hurry.

What?

- You know what?
- What?

650
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,670
Pure White Land.

651
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:23,550
It might actually exist.

652
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:27,280
- Where have you been?
- The room of faith.

653
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,710
This is no good. Let's go to the other room of faith.

654
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:32,510
Put the seatbelt on.

655
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,650
Did you put it on? Let's go!

656
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:43,190
Is it good?

657
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:45,130
It's good.

658
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,550
Doo-bi-doo-doop-doo!

659
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:52,120
Are they really for me?

660
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,220
It's a reward for your tears. I'm giving you this to work hard!

661
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:57,860
They're so pretty!

662
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:02,040
By the way, recent believers are all about to die.

663
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,060
Even if they were told when they'll die,

664
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:09,280
they want to live until the very last minute. That's how humans are.

665
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,350
Would you rather wait to die while frequenting the hospital

666
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:17,260
or have someone tell you that you can live a long, long life?

667
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,290
What would you rather believe?

668
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,020
What if they actually die?

669
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,200
They were about to die anyway.

670
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,750
We're not legally at fault at all!

671
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:31,540
I guess you really have the power to make people believe.

672
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:40,040
What's wrong all of a sudden?

673
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,410
What's the matter? Huh?

674
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:47,210
It's not that...

675
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:50,860
people believe me.

676
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:55,510
Their belief comes...

677
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:59,060
from this right here!

678
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,310
Come on! You scared me!

679
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:03,950
That's why you should cry as hard as possible, too.

680
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:06,650
Building faith is hard at first,

681
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:10,130
but once you have it, it's already game over!

682
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:13,630
I'm sure you'll go to hell, Oppa.

683
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:18,570
Hello? Aigoo! Do you believe in that? What a baby!

684
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:28,420
- What's this?
- Someone over there sent this.

685
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,160
Over there?

686
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,640
What is it?

687
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:39,820
Seriously...

688
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,990
Aigoo! You're having tasty food.

689
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:53,240
You want me to pay for what you ate?

690
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,770
Are you kidding right now?

691
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:58,390
What are you doing after eating expensive meals?

692
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:05,080
It's cheap for the cost of your life.

693
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,480
What did you say?

694
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,600
Always watch above your head.

695
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:14,370
The land is up in the sky.

696
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:18,100
You're destined to die young.

697
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,670
Hey, you! How dare you lose focus?

698
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:48,570
I'm sorry, Priest!

699
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:57,490
Let me get you a cleaner piece...

700
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:00,550
Okay, go ahead and eat.

701
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:01,720
Enjoy!

702
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,160
Let me get you a tasty piece...

703
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,210
No bones.

704
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:10,490
I mean, seriously...

705
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:13,060
Why did you just come back? Didn't you go to argue?

706
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:16,260
I was going to, but I couldn't.

707
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:19,260
They're too crazy!

708
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,730
Looks like it.

709
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:22,740
Shit!

710
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:30,760
 

711
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:36,050
 

712
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:39,580
Shit! What is this? It scared me!

713
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,410
Oppa!

714
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:42,670
Are you okay?

715
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:45,450
Shit! I got so scared!

716
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,930
 

717
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,050
- What's this?
 - Always watch above your head. 

718
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:59,330
 The land is up in the sky. 

719
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:02,020
 You're destined to die young. 

720
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,140
Shit! How creepy!

721
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,990
- Are you okay?
- Why don't you drive?

722
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:17,440
You should eat it.

723
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,180
Oh, they left.

724
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,500
I focused way too much!

725
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,340
Geez!

726
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:28,140
- Help yourself.
- Let's finish everything.

727
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:32,310
 Mr. Kim. Pure White Church fed Mr. Park with some 

728
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:36,500
white liquid and said "Power of Pure White" or something, right?

729
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,630
Yes.

730
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:40,860
Meperidine hydrochloride was found in it.

731
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:45,700
Meperidine hydrochloride? It's an opioid pain treatment.

732
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,320
It's usually for severely ill cancer patients.

733
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,870
Doesn't it make you so angry?

734
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:55,160
He kept telling them not to go to the hospital while giving them pain medicine.

735
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,940
I'm sure they're getting worse.

736
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:03,840
I think I'm done introducing myself. Let's stop the construction first.

737
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,020
There's already plenty in there.

738
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:08,430
It was done by two trustworthy men.

739
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,110
Hello.

740
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:25,330
So you found artifacts? Where are they?

741
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:28,130
All the workers were sent home, and the work is put on hold.

742
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:30,680
I asked where are the artifacts?

743
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,890
They're left as they were found over there.

744
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:34,490
That over there?

745
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:36,010
- Let's go.
- Yes.

746
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:44,130
Artifacts.

747
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:48,360
Take that!

748
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,990
Geez.

749
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:08,480
Aigoo! The artifacts are gone.

750
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,200
They're no longer artifacts. They're just pieces of rocks.

751
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,130
Don't you dare report them as cultural heritage like last time.

752
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:17,620
How much did that delay the construction schedule?

753
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:20,540
We didn't mean to. But when artifacts are found during construction,

754
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:22,990
- we're required to report them-
- Geez!

755
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:27,740
When you die, your underwear, socks, and everything will become artifacts later.

756
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:29,990
What significance does that have?

757
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:32,590
The Pure White Church that will be built here

758
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:35,570
is 100 times, 1,000 times, 10,000 times...

759
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:39,170
more meaningful than that. Can't you just...

760
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:42,580
Try calling me about stuff like this again.

761
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,450
Do that, okay?

762
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:47,030
Seriously!

763
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:56,160
Seriously, how annoying.

764
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:04,200
It's almost time for the sermon.

765
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,800
Where have you been going for missionary work?

766
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,210
We're targeting the ICUs and cancer centers as you told us to.

767
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:13,140
- Check out the nursing hospitals, too.
- Yes.

768
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,820
Your role is very important, right?

769
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:21,090
I think of you as my son, you know.

770
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:25,910
You'll be in the first-class seat in the first car on our train.

771
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:28,470
First class!

772
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:30,560
Thank you, Father!

773
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,920
How far along are you?

774
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:10,190
♫  Let's all go to Pure White Land together  ♫

775
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:12,070
♫  Pure...  ♫

776
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,180
What am I singing right now?

777
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:18,950
Get it together! Come on!

778
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,000
- You haven't eaten, right?
- No.

779
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,650
- Let's have fried chicken!
- Fried chicken?

780
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,790
You're the best, Go Eun!

781
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:30,530
You got the sauce, too, right?

782
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,930
What's wrong? What's wrong?

783
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:35,390
You scared me! You scared me!

784
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:37,330
You scared the hell out of me!

785
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,730
Why are you so scared?

786
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:42,420
Hyungnim! You can't suddenly turn the light on in there!

787
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:45,920
I had to because I couldn't see anything. What kind of fried chicken did you get?

788
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,650
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

789
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,890
What now?

790
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:53,910
Just starve! Starve for the rest of your life!

791
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:57,190
Go Eun! Go Eun! That wasn't intentional this time!

792
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:58,600
I'll eat all of this by myself.

793
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,290
Go Eun! Go-

794
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:02,970
My fried chicken...

795
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,850
This is all your fault!

796
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:09,780
Seriously! Is fried chicken important? Of course, it is!

797
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:12,440
But still, keep it in mind.

798
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:16,540
This mission is completely up to us. Start working!

799
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,550
Aigoo, too bad about the fried chicken...

800
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,260
Aigoo!

801
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:39,320
What?

802
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,560
Was there a folk village here?

803
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,470
It scared me!

804
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,170
Huh?

805
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:47,870
What's going on...

806
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:51,030
Geez!

807
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:53,850
What's this? What's wrong?

808
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:58,650
Shit!

809
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:04,800
Why did the car shut down all of a sudden?

810
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,790
Shit!

811
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:10,230
Huh? Now the phone is...
 

812
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:14,330
Seriously, don't they know what age we live in?

813
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:16,290
Where the hell am I?

814
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:22,150
What's that?

815
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:21,280
Hey, let me use your phone if you have one.

816
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,790
My car just died.

817
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:27,060
You managed to survive until now.

818
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:28,450
What?

819
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,690
Hold on. You're that...

820
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:46,980
Who the hell are you anyway? How dare you talk down to me like that?

821
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,390
You bastard!

822
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:56,450
Get lost immediately!

823
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:32,330
That crafty thing got scared and ran away for now,

824
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:35,140
but I'm sure it'll come back soon...

825
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,430
to take your life away.

826
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,830
 

827
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,800
What a crazy cult bastard.

828
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:01,630
What kind of concept is that?

829
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:05,090
How will you sell it like that? Geez...

830
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:12,780
He called you a cult, Mr. Kim!

831
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:17,430
Looks like he's lacking faith a lot.

832
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:21,330
If you lack faith,

833
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:23,600
you should strengthen it.

834
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:32,000


835
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,440
 

836
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,390
 I'm certain that Unni will come back. 

837
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:05,150
 Will she really come back? 

838
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:10,100
 We need to show them their leader is also a weak man who's blinded by greed. 

839
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:13,790
 The one who was following you... 

840
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,250
 Was he wearing a got* by chance? 
(Traditional Korean hat for men)

841
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:18,610
 Looks like you'll never give up... 

842
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:20,220
 until you die. 

843
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,920
 Hide yourself immediately! 

844
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,520
 Please help me, Priest! 

845
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,680
 I guess he's requesting the exorcism ceremony. 

846
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,220
 Does he even know what he's asking for? 

847
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:32,590
 Mr. Kim! Jin Sun passed out!
