1
00:00:26,134 --> 00:00:31,154
 

2
00:00:31,154 --> 00:00:32,754
Hey, get him up.

3
00:00:33,924 --> 00:00:37,124
Wait a minute. Why don't you tell me why you're kicking me out first?

4
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:38,504
The reason?

5
00:00:40,034 --> 00:00:41,374
We really don't need to help?

6
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:45,304
Why is that police car just standing there watching?

7
00:00:45,304 --> 00:00:47,624
What the hell? Hold him.

8
00:00:49,544 --> 00:00:52,594
My stomach! Aigoo!

9
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:56,254
Aigoo, I'm dying.

10
00:00:56,254 --> 00:00:58,664
Please call the police. The police.

11
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:02,334
Aigoo...

12
00:01:02,394 --> 00:01:05,114
Yes, Hyungnim. This is your call.

13
00:01:07,364 --> 00:01:10,474
- Who made the report?
- Yes.

14
00:01:14,934 --> 00:01:17,704
Are you okay? Can you get up?

15
00:01:17,704 --> 00:01:19,584
Get up. Are you okay?

16
00:01:19,584 --> 00:01:21,494
Aigoo.

17
00:01:21,494 --> 00:01:24,124
Huh? What's going on?

18
00:01:24,124 --> 00:01:27,894
You're being arrested for obstruction of business.

19
00:01:29,894 --> 00:01:33,404
What kind of situation is that?

20
00:01:37,084 --> 00:01:39,894
If there are no other inconveniences, we'll take our leave.

21
00:01:39,894 --> 00:01:41,534
Take care!

22
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:54,904
I still can't believe it, even after seeing it for myself.

23
00:01:54,904 --> 00:01:56,954
- Let's follow them.
- Wait, stop.

24
00:01:56,954 --> 00:01:58,704
Wait, we're not going to follow Mr. Kim Do Gi?

25
00:01:58,704 --> 00:02:02,324
- We should check something first.
- Check? Check what?

26
00:02:02,324 --> 00:02:05,934
Why that ambulance came to Black Sun.

27
00:02:06,884 --> 00:02:08,484
What's this?

28
00:02:11,654 --> 00:02:14,404
Did someone get hurt inside?

29
00:02:14,404 --> 00:02:15,834
Gosh.

30
00:02:20,114 --> 00:02:21,814
What the hell is this?

31
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:24,184
Let go! I can't feel my arms.

32
00:02:24,184 --> 00:02:27,564
Let go! Why are you doing this to me?

33
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,174
Who do you think I am?

34
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:33,514
Mom!

35
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:41,044
Load him onto the car. Aigoo!

36
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:44,224
I'll get on myself.

37
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:48,484
I'm going to report you guys. You can't get away with this.

38
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:50,874
How dare you accept a minor?

39
00:02:55,794 --> 00:02:57,714
Hey, you dumbass.

40
00:02:57,714 --> 00:03:00,484
- Did I tell you no minors allowed or not?
- You did.

41
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:04,184
Someone who knew that allowed kids inside?

42
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,954
Those kids came in with a server's high pass.

43
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:09,014
High pass?

44
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:12,144
- Who was the server?
- Windy. It was Windy.

45
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:16,684
She must be desperate for money.

46
00:03:16,684 --> 00:03:18,954
We should feed her some canned mackerel.

47
00:03:18,954 --> 00:03:22,434
Put a hold on all of Windy's schedule.

48
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:29,564
She's desperate for money, but feed her mackerel?

49
00:03:29,564 --> 00:03:31,714
What are they talking about?

50
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:40,700
 !

51
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:42,384
You want a glass?

52
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:49,694
Are you nuts?

53
00:03:49,694 --> 00:03:52,204
Who are you to cancel the reservations I secured?

54
00:03:52,204 --> 00:03:53,774
Who do you think you are?

55
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:57,344
You lose a day in your business, and you're losing it, huh?

56
00:03:57,344 --> 00:04:00,634
- Do you know how much you cost me today?
- I don't.

57
00:04:00,634 --> 00:04:05,624
But the minors you thoughtlessly accepted put me in a difficult situation.

58
00:04:05,624 --> 00:04:07,874
Shouldn't you get on your knees and apologize first?

59
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:12,484
 
You're feeding me canned mackerel just for that, you scumbag?

60
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:16,354
I think I made myself clear.

61
00:04:16,354 --> 00:04:19,004
Whether it's harassment or assault or whatever,

62
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:20,964
we can just say it was a happening between customers.

63
00:04:20,964 --> 00:04:24,374
But we have no excuses for minors.

64
00:04:24,374 --> 00:04:25,804
Let go of me, scum.

65
00:04:25,804 --> 00:04:30,094
Accepting minors leaves us nowhere to go. Shit.

66
00:04:30,094 --> 00:04:32,984
I'm the one who has to take the blame.

67
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:37,774
You crazy-

68
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:39,224
Hey!

69
00:04:42,444 --> 00:04:44,974
You really want to die?

70
00:04:44,974 --> 00:04:48,584
You're going to die first, you scumbag.

71
00:04:50,994 --> 00:04:52,764
Hyungnim.

72
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,734
I mean, Bishop...

73
00:04:56,884 --> 00:04:59,694
 

74
00:05:01,004 --> 00:05:03,764
- What are you two doing?
- Nothing, Sir.

75
00:05:03,764 --> 00:05:05,824
We were just having a talk.

76
00:05:05,824 --> 00:05:07,694
You've got to be kidding me.

77
00:05:07,694 --> 00:05:10,384
We still have customers, so talk quietly after work if you must.

78
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:11,514
Yes, Bishop.

79
00:05:11,514 --> 00:05:14,454
I was about to get to work, too.

80
00:05:18,574 --> 00:05:21,584
Shit, that crazy bitch.

81
00:05:29,104 --> 00:05:31,814
Yes, Detective Jang. It's me.

82
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:33,234
Yeah.

83
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:35,094
 

84
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:37,374
Stop making stuff up.

85
00:05:37,374 --> 00:05:38,804
 
Just don't damage other people's property.

86
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:40,174
 

87
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,074
You won't believe me, who reported them for letting in minors.

88
00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:46,574
but you believe an employee at the club that I damaged their property.

89
00:05:46,574 --> 00:05:50,044
But you didn't even go inside the club.

90
00:05:50,044 --> 00:05:51,434
Hey!

91
00:05:52,254 --> 00:05:55,154
Did you say your name is Kim Do Gi?

92
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:05,144
From now on, you were arrested for sexually assaulting a club worker.

93
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:07,624
You should've just behaved yourself.

94
00:06:07,624 --> 00:06:11,604
Why stir things up and bother everyone?

95
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:20,234
You're totally f***ed now.

96
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:27,114
 

97
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:28,534
 

98
00:06:28,534 --> 00:06:32,744
Gosh, they all use aliases, making it harder to identify them.

99
00:06:32,744 --> 00:06:35,534
Which one of them reported Mr. Kim Do Gi?

100
00:06:35,534 --> 00:06:38,574
Just wait until I catch you.

101
00:06:56,674 --> 00:06:58,974
Why did he come here?

102
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:05,654
How may I help you?

103
00:07:05,654 --> 00:07:08,184
What? What is it now?

104
00:07:24,094 --> 00:07:25,584
Yes?

105
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,584
Huh? Geez...

106
00:07:42,564 --> 00:07:47,084
Shouldn't you at least say thank you?

107
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:51,424
I don't think I received a thank you last time, either.

108
00:07:51,424 --> 00:07:53,374
I received an earful.

109
00:07:58,494 --> 00:08:02,304
If you want this, buy me a beer.

110
00:08:20,564 --> 00:08:22,754
Gosh, that's refreshing.

111
00:08:25,444 --> 00:08:28,444
Wow, you can take a beating.

112
00:08:28,444 --> 00:08:32,344
A person ought to be unconscious from such a beating.

113
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:35,704
I don't really need this video.

114
00:08:36,674 --> 00:08:38,894
Watch a bit longer.

115
00:08:48,214 --> 00:08:49,624
Stop.

116
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:52,824
The woman who just got off that taxi.

117
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,904
She made a false report about being sexually harassed.

118
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:59,574
Her nickname is Ayna. She's one of the club's servers.

119
00:08:59,574 --> 00:09:02,924
She got to work after the police arrested you and took you away,

120
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:05,334
so her lie got exposed.

121
00:09:05,334 --> 00:09:07,544
That's how you were released right away.

122
00:09:08,584 --> 00:09:09,934
Cheers.

123
00:09:12,124 --> 00:09:16,994
But how did you think to report a minor from inside that den?

124
00:09:16,994 --> 00:09:21,934
Wow, you're either fearless or you've got guts.

125
00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:28,064
Most reporters don't get beat up on the rooftop, either.

126
00:09:31,024 --> 00:09:34,194
I never told you I was a reporter.

127
00:09:34,194 --> 00:09:36,724
They called you a "trashy journo" to your face.

128
00:09:40,364 --> 00:09:46,144
Why would a reporter film a scene of himself getting beat up on the rooftop?

129
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:52,394
I guess I tried to blackmail them for money since I'm a trashy journo.

130
00:09:52,394 --> 00:09:56,174
If your objective was money, you would've done that at the entrance.

131
00:09:56,174 --> 00:09:59,344
Since there are more witnesses there.

132
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,174
You probably didn't want any uninvited guests.

133
00:10:03,174 --> 00:10:05,574
For example...

134
00:10:05,574 --> 00:10:07,434
the police?

135
00:10:09,414 --> 00:10:12,584
Were you trying to film yourself getting beat up,

136
00:10:12,584 --> 00:10:15,034
so you could blackmail them?

137
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:16,744
Or...

138
00:10:17,914 --> 00:10:19,704
to negotiate?

139
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:28,584
I don't know what your objective is,

140
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:31,004
but don't go near Black Sun again.

141
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:33,994
This isn't a threat. It's a kind warning.

142
00:10:33,994 --> 00:10:35,724
You experienced it for yourself.

143
00:10:35,724 --> 00:10:40,084
The result of being a good Samaritan and reporting a minor.

144
00:10:40,084 --> 00:10:46,204
Black Sun isn't someplace where common sense applies.

145
00:10:46,204 --> 00:10:49,054
Quitting while all your limbs are still intact is a good idea.

146
00:10:49,054 --> 00:10:52,344
And you'll also disrupt me by hovering there.

147
00:10:57,404 --> 00:11:00,494
Okay. Thanks for the beer.

148
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:20,114
Anyhow, it's a huge relief.

149
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:23,034
Whatever his intentions, if it weren't for Reporter Kim Yong Min,

150
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:25,704
you would've been in a tight spot.

151
00:11:25,704 --> 00:11:28,334
But isn't it ridiculous?

152
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:33,714
The fact the police came to the scene just because of the report is strange, too.

153
00:11:33,714 --> 00:11:36,864
Creating a fake victim and causing a predicament,

154
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:38,874
and attempting to push a reporter off the rooftop.

155
00:11:38,874 --> 00:11:41,124
There are no hesitations in their actions.

156
00:11:41,124 --> 00:11:44,804
It's evidence there's a lot to conceal within Black Sun.

157
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:48,584
How about capturing the president of the club and shaking him up?

158
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:50,404
Here's a pop quiz.

159
00:11:50,404 --> 00:11:53,554
How many presidents are behind Black Sun?

160
00:11:53,554 --> 00:11:56,424
- Isn't there only one?
- Wrong.

161
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,584
One, two people. Two, three people.

162
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:01,344
Three, four people. Four, five people. Five, six people.

163
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:03,254
Number five.

164
00:12:04,714 --> 00:12:08,094
Gosh, he's good at guessing these types of questions.

165
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,804
Mr. Choi, correct.

166
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:11,344
People don't change.

167
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:13,864
I'm so consistent.

168
00:12:13,864 --> 00:12:17,384
But do you know what's even more surprising?

169
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:19,214
All six of them aren't real presidents.

170
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:22,454
They're all presidents in name only.

171
00:12:22,454 --> 00:12:25,384
No one knows the actual president?

172
00:12:25,384 --> 00:12:28,014
Whoa, that's strange.

173
00:12:31,154 --> 00:12:33,604
I need to get back inside Black Sun.

174
00:12:33,604 --> 00:12:35,524
- Should I reserve another table?
- No.

175
00:12:35,524 --> 00:12:39,354
There's a limit to how much I can walk around as a customer.

176
00:12:39,354 --> 00:12:43,854
It's a better idea to enter another way.

177
00:12:50,134 --> 00:12:53,344
I'd have been in big trouble if it weren't for you, Chief.

178
00:12:53,344 --> 00:12:57,214
Gosh, I told you not to call me that here.

179
00:12:57,214 --> 00:12:58,724
 

180
00:12:58,724 --> 00:13:00,554
 

181
00:13:01,924 --> 00:13:03,934
All right, President Park.

182
00:13:05,794 --> 00:13:07,704
Call a driver if you drink.

183
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,734
What's with a DUI? How humiliating. On the main road, too.

184
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:13,664
I told that bastard, Hoon Jung, clearly.

185
00:13:13,664 --> 00:13:16,104
That I won't cover up his next DUI.

186
00:13:16,104 --> 00:13:18,544
That's that. Anyway, Chief...

187
00:13:19,644 --> 00:13:20,814
I mean, President.

188
00:13:20,814 --> 00:13:23,554
To celebrate the release of my new album,

189
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:27,334
I'm thinking about renting an entire island resort to throw a party.

190
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:29,334
You'll be there, right?

191
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:32,004
Will there be any nice celebrities?

192
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:34,694
I really like the ones who look like models these days.

193
00:13:34,694 --> 00:13:37,664
I know exactly what your type is.

194
00:13:39,074 --> 00:13:44,274
I'll find some model-like girls who'll treat you nicely.

195
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:46,924
- I read another dating article about you.
- Huh?

196
00:13:46,924 --> 00:13:49,744
- With whom?
- Hey, you don't even know the girl?

197
00:13:49,744 --> 00:13:51,814
Gosh, whatever.

198
00:13:51,814 --> 00:13:53,764
I'll just go out with everyone

199
00:13:53,764 --> 00:13:57,094
but I'm going to marry a foreigner.

200
00:13:59,384 --> 00:14:00,974
Man!

201
00:14:03,954 --> 00:14:05,714
This is this month's calculation.

202
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:10,124
Don't I just need to check the final number?

203
00:14:10,124 --> 00:14:11,824
Wow...

204
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:15,284
Victor, thanks to your promotion,

205
00:14:15,284 --> 00:14:18,234
we hit a new high every month.

206
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:19,794
It's not just anyone's business.

207
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:22,094
I treat it like my own.

208
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,544
I'll have you down as attending,

209
00:14:27,544 --> 00:14:30,874
and make sexy preparations.

210
00:14:30,874 --> 00:14:32,534
To our success.

211
00:14:32,534 --> 00:14:34,684
To our success!

212
00:15:19,954 --> 00:15:22,544
- Did you call a taxi?
- Yes, it'll be here soon.

213
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:25,394
 Rainbow Taxi has arrived. 

214
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:50,354
What did you do to the kids that they all went off the grid, huh?

215
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:51,674
I'm sorry.

216
00:15:51,674 --> 00:15:54,464
They didn't properly take care of that trashy journo,

217
00:15:54,464 --> 00:15:56,374
so I told them to quit in anger.

218
00:15:56,374 --> 00:15:59,894
I didn't know they'd actually quit like this.

219
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:02,754
You lack the basics.

220
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,954
I'll head over now, so have some guys picked out.

221
00:16:07,954 --> 00:16:10,934
Not the scrawny ones, but the ones with guts.

222
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:19,474
Shit!

223
00:16:29,194 --> 00:16:32,434
Kids these days lack the basics.

224
00:16:32,434 --> 00:16:35,704
I'm sorry, Bishop. The last group was okay.

225
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,544
How strange.

226
00:16:37,544 --> 00:16:39,814
Send me the address of the bastard who went off the grid.

227
00:16:39,814 --> 00:16:42,264
He should learn a lesson for acting irresponsibly.

228
00:16:42,264 --> 00:16:45,074
Well, we do all this through referrals,

229
00:16:45,074 --> 00:16:47,114
so we never took down addresses.

230
00:16:47,114 --> 00:16:49,094
We don't have his address.

231
00:16:54,424 --> 00:16:56,894
Hey. Hey!

232
00:16:58,124 --> 00:16:59,834
Why do you think I hired you?

233
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:03,274
I give you money to filter out the bastards lacking basics.

234
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:04,594
I'm sorry.

235
00:17:04,594 --> 00:17:08,724
I'll find and thrash the ones who quit without calling.

236
00:17:10,754 --> 00:17:12,224
Please calm your anger.

237
00:17:12,224 --> 00:17:14,954
We have some nice kids today.

238
00:17:14,954 --> 00:17:16,604
Take your pick.

239
00:17:17,744 --> 00:17:19,584
Hey, move.

240
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:24,664
I'm not done yet.

241
00:17:24,664 --> 00:17:26,184
That's your problem.

242
00:17:26,184 --> 00:17:28,874
We're going to use this, so get lost.

243
00:17:28,874 --> 00:17:31,104
I said I'm not done yet.

244
00:17:31,104 --> 00:17:33,814
You arrogant bastard. Who do you think-

245
00:17:33,814 --> 00:17:35,214
Hey!

246
00:17:36,704 --> 00:17:38,474
Those rude bastards-

247
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,754
Hold it.

248
00:17:54,744 --> 00:17:57,554
Keeping public order and manners among the members.

249
00:17:57,554 --> 00:17:58,804
And...

250
00:17:59,664 --> 00:18:01,124
 

251
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:03,494
let's keep our turns.

252
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,814
Right.

253
00:18:16,814 --> 00:18:18,954
Protein time.

254
00:18:18,954 --> 00:18:21,544
 

255
00:18:31,374 --> 00:18:33,184
Who is that guy?

256
00:18:33,184 --> 00:18:37,044
He's Woo Sik's cellmate. He came after hearing about us.

257
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:41,384
- This is good.
- What's his specialty?

258
00:18:41,384 --> 00:18:42,824
I heard assault.

259
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:45,544
But he's pretty new, so I'm not too sure.

260
00:18:55,964 --> 00:18:58,954
Kids who use their fists have a naivete to them.

261
00:19:01,494 --> 00:19:02,724
They're pure.

262
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,234
They can't tell the difference between shit and chocolate.

263
00:19:08,464 --> 00:19:09,884
Come in.

264
00:19:12,174 --> 00:19:14,594
You asked for me?

265
00:19:14,594 --> 00:19:16,424
Take them and train them well.

266
00:19:16,424 --> 00:19:18,504
Yes, sir. Thank you.

267
00:19:20,384 --> 00:19:22,194
Huh?

268
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,874
You bastard...

269
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,974
Why? Do you know him?

270
00:19:27,974 --> 00:19:30,844
This is the bastard who reported the minor.

271
00:19:30,844 --> 00:19:32,714
What?

272
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:35,694
I didn't think I'd meet someone so noble

273
00:19:35,694 --> 00:19:37,944
back here again.

274
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:40,474
You managed to slip out unscathed.

275
00:19:41,404 --> 00:19:43,764
I apologize for my previous behavior.

276
00:19:43,764 --> 00:19:47,094
I got too riled up.

277
00:19:47,094 --> 00:19:49,974
I actually briefly worked at a convenience store.

278
00:19:49,974 --> 00:19:53,964
I saw blood multiple times because of those little punks who faked their age

279
00:19:53,964 --> 00:19:56,304
to buy cigarettes and booze.

280
00:19:56,304 --> 00:19:59,464
I wasted one month's pay for settlement money.

281
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:03,324
That's why when I see minors who lack basics and fake their age,

282
00:20:03,324 --> 00:20:06,024
I just flip out.

283
00:20:06,024 --> 00:20:08,424
I didn't think twice and reported them.

284
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:09,874
I'm sorry!

285
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:12,924
What's with the prelude, you bastard? You think sorry will cut it?

286
00:20:12,924 --> 00:20:15,124
Just thinking about what I went through because of you-

287
00:20:15,124 --> 00:20:16,784
Good job.

288
00:20:18,664 --> 00:20:21,134
If you see punks like that again, report them immediately.

289
00:20:21,134 --> 00:20:24,454
But not to the police.

290
00:20:24,454 --> 00:20:25,894
To me.

291
00:20:28,354 --> 00:20:29,704
Yes, sir.

292
00:20:31,344 --> 00:20:33,154
You may leave.

293
00:20:33,154 --> 00:20:34,544
Yes, sir.

294
00:20:37,314 --> 00:20:39,394
I'll do my best!

295
00:20:44,984 --> 00:20:47,244
He possesses the basics.

296
00:20:51,204 --> 00:20:54,874
- Hello!
- You can greet me later.

297
00:20:54,874 --> 00:20:56,504
Go in. Go inside.

298
00:20:56,504 --> 00:20:58,154
Hurry, hurry.

299
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,274
Attention.

300
00:21:01,274 --> 00:21:04,434
The four duties we're responsible for on-premise are

301
00:21:04,434 --> 00:21:08,214
the hall, admissions, VIP marking, and delivery.

302
00:21:08,214 --> 00:21:09,514
Hey.

303
00:21:11,844 --> 00:21:15,324
Newbies don't need to worry about marking or deliveries.

304
00:21:15,324 --> 00:21:16,704
Those in charge of the hall,

305
00:21:16,704 --> 00:21:20,714
don't get involved even if a fight breaks out between drunk customers.

306
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:22,734
If it gets extreme,

307
00:21:22,734 --> 00:21:25,074
then just kick out the men. Got it?

308
00:21:25,074 --> 00:21:27,624
- Easy breezy, right?
 - Yes, sir! 

309
00:21:27,624 --> 00:21:32,074
Those in charge of admissions, you're responsible for water quality*.
(What kind of people they let in.)

310
00:21:32,074 --> 00:21:35,724
I'll teach you how to manage water quality, so listen carefully.

311
00:21:35,724 --> 00:21:37,864
Once business starts,

312
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:40,284
admit all women as long as they're not hideous.

313
00:21:40,284 --> 00:21:44,014
 Don't admit men who look like ahjussis or college students. 

314
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:46,704
 If they have reservations but have terrible style, 

315
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:48,844
 only admit them if they're VIP, 

316
00:21:48,844 --> 00:21:51,504
 otherwise, commoners get denied at the entrance, got it? 

317
00:21:51,504 --> 00:21:52,884
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir!

318
00:21:52,884 --> 00:21:57,224
If the premise seems full, then start water quality control.

319
00:21:57,224 --> 00:22:00,324
For women, hippos and pigs get denied entry.

320
00:22:00,324 --> 00:22:02,774
Even if their friend looks like a model, they'll ruin the water quality.

321
00:22:02,774 --> 00:22:07,264
For men, unless they look rich and have great style, deny them entry.

322
00:22:07,264 --> 00:22:10,514
Then comes midnight.

323
00:22:11,514 --> 00:22:14,634
It's our peak time!

324
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:16,244
Boom, boom, boom!

325
00:22:16,244 --> 00:22:18,864
Men are denied unless they're VIPs.

326
00:22:18,864 --> 00:22:22,054
The cutline for women is those who look like models.

327
00:22:22,054 --> 00:22:24,024
Just ask me if you can't tell.

328
00:22:25,014 --> 00:22:27,904
Everything that happens at Black Sun is part of our job.

329
00:22:27,904 --> 00:22:32,164
We are Black Sun, and we are its beginning and end.

330
00:22:32,164 --> 00:22:34,314
Everyone has some pride, got it?

331
00:22:34,314 --> 00:22:36,074
 Yes, sir! 

332
00:22:36,074 --> 00:22:38,644
Beginning and end, he says.

333
00:22:39,614 --> 00:22:42,034
Are you God, or what?

334
00:22:42,034 --> 00:22:44,774
What did you just say?

335
00:22:44,774 --> 00:22:46,364
Oh, my.

336
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:49,144
I was talking to myself. Did you hear me?

337
00:22:49,144 --> 00:22:52,744
Our head of guard has such great hearing.

338
00:22:52,744 --> 00:22:54,554
Like a dog.

339
00:22:58,824 --> 00:23:01,394
What are you staring at, dumbass?

340
00:23:04,454 --> 00:23:08,144
You still haven't learned your lesson, have you?

341
00:23:08,144 --> 00:23:10,294
This won't do.

342
00:23:10,294 --> 00:23:12,674
I should feed you more canned mackerel.

343
00:23:12,674 --> 00:23:14,614
Don't you dare.

344
00:23:14,614 --> 00:23:17,444
I'm going to smash bottles in each room.

345
00:23:18,524 --> 00:23:20,774
Yeah, I will.

346
00:23:23,934 --> 00:23:26,074
That rude bitch.

347
00:23:26,994 --> 00:23:28,814
What are you guys doing?

348
00:23:28,814 --> 00:23:31,724
Go and get ready for business, you bastards!

349
00:23:31,724 --> 00:23:34,904
Newbies, prep the tables and start cleaning.

350
00:23:34,904 --> 00:23:38,304
 
Come on, hurry up. Let's get to it.

351
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:59,804
Whoa! What the hell?

352
00:24:04,454 --> 00:24:07,664
Hey, number 9! What are you doing?

353
00:24:07,664 --> 00:24:09,164
You want to get beat up over there?

354
00:24:09,164 --> 00:24:11,074
Heed my words.

355
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:14,554
You're a goldfish. A goldfish with open eyes.

356
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:15,684
You know goldfish, right?

357
00:24:15,684 --> 00:24:19,374
Whatever you see, forget it immediately. Got it?

358
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:24,514
- Yes, sir.
- Let's not get heroic and ruin the atmosphere.

359
00:24:24,514 --> 00:24:26,204
Yes, understood, Sunbaenim.

360
00:24:26,204 --> 00:24:28,224
By the way,

361
00:24:28,224 --> 00:24:32,074
where's Bishop's office?

362
00:24:32,074 --> 00:24:33,984
Look at this punk.

363
00:24:33,984 --> 00:24:35,614
Why would you need to know that?

364
00:24:35,614 --> 00:24:40,374
Bishop told me to immediately report to him if something happened.

365
00:24:40,374 --> 00:24:44,324
Is Bishop the club's president?

366
00:24:44,324 --> 00:24:47,744
You're already thinking about scoring brownie points with the higher-ups?

367
00:24:47,744 --> 00:24:50,264
- I'll kill you, you little-
- What's going on?

368
00:24:50,264 --> 00:24:52,234
Hello, Madam.

369
00:24:53,824 --> 00:24:58,004
Didn't you say you weren't a guard?

370
00:24:58,004 --> 00:25:00,544
Now I am.

371
00:25:00,544 --> 00:25:02,184
Welcome.

372
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,414
 

373
00:25:26,674 --> 00:25:28,104
Gosh.

374
00:25:31,304 --> 00:25:34,054
I still haven't found another space within Black Sun.

375
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:35,964
What if there isn't one?

376
00:25:35,964 --> 00:25:39,544
They need an office if they're to organize and manage revenue.

377
00:25:39,544 --> 00:25:44,014
There are a lot of CCTV circuits nearby, so they'll need a server facility, too.

378
00:25:44,014 --> 00:25:48,114
If they've hidden these spaces, that means they also have many things to hide.

379
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:49,984
I'll look around some more.

380
00:25:53,894 --> 00:25:56,474
Look at that bastard playing hooky.

381
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:59,644
That wet-behind-the-ears newbie.

382
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:04,674
He seems to be coming over here.

383
00:26:04,674 --> 00:26:07,134
Hope you sell a lot.

384
00:26:15,544 --> 00:26:19,734
I told you not to do business here!

385
00:26:19,734 --> 00:26:23,044
Don't you understand Korean? Why won't you listen to me?

386
00:26:23,044 --> 00:26:25,644
- Take it someplace else!
- We need to make a living, too.

387
00:26:25,644 --> 00:26:27,144
- Hey!
- Yes.

388
00:26:27,144 --> 00:26:30,074
I told them to take their business elsewhere

389
00:26:30,074 --> 00:26:32,314
since it's difficult for the customers to park,

390
00:26:32,314 --> 00:26:34,594
but they just won't listen to me.

391
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:36,944
What is all this? Since when was this even here?

392
00:26:36,944 --> 00:26:41,294
Misters, you can't do this here. Take it elsewhere.

393
00:26:41,294 --> 00:26:45,964
Imagine how hungry people will be after a round at the club.

394
00:26:45,964 --> 00:26:50,234
What could be better than books to ease the hunger of the heart?

395
00:26:51,424 --> 00:26:53,154
Ahjussi,

396
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:55,034
I told you to take it elsewhere.

397
00:26:57,334 --> 00:27:00,194
- We should take it elsewhere.
- We'll clean this right up.

398
00:27:00,194 --> 00:27:03,424
- I'm sorry.
- Have a good time.

399
00:27:04,774 --> 00:27:06,984
He looks mean.

400
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:11,324
- Hey.
- Yes.

401
00:27:11,324 --> 00:27:15,424
How do you know Madam Yang?

402
00:27:15,424 --> 00:27:18,974
Who's Madam Yang?

403
00:27:20,114 --> 00:27:22,054
Look at you putting on a show.

404
00:27:22,054 --> 00:27:25,864
How could she specifically choose your number and order you to

405
00:27:25,864 --> 00:27:30,844
do markings when you don't even know who she is?

406
00:27:30,844 --> 00:27:34,814
Gosh, this bastard. You're annoying for no reason.

407
00:27:34,814 --> 00:27:36,484
Follow me.

408
00:27:55,094 --> 00:27:56,744
Listen carefully.

409
00:27:56,744 --> 00:27:59,144
You're going to start marking VIPs,

410
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,274
but you're not protecting the people.

411
00:28:01,274 --> 00:28:05,954
You'll be protecting the bottles with your number on them. Got it?

412
00:28:10,874 --> 00:28:14,264
If the bottle gets stolen or shatters,

413
00:28:14,264 --> 00:28:16,374
you'll get shattered, too.

414
00:28:18,944 --> 00:28:22,144
Go. Go and protect your owner.

415
00:28:59,994 --> 00:29:01,874
All right.

416
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,044
Here I go.

417
00:29:23,384 --> 00:29:25,374
- So Ra unni.
- Thank you!

418
00:29:25,374 --> 00:29:27,194
Cheers, cheers, cheers!

419
00:29:27,194 --> 00:29:29,324
Cheers, cheers!

420
00:29:29,324 --> 00:29:31,894
Everyone, cheers!

421
00:29:46,224 --> 00:29:49,484
Where are you? Why aren't you here yet?

422
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,034
My schedule got delayed, so I left late.

423
00:29:57,034 --> 00:29:59,104
I just parked.

424
00:29:59,104 --> 00:30:01,494
 I got bored, so I ordered the most expensive item. 

425
00:30:01,494 --> 00:30:03,804
You're late, so you pay.

426
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:07,044
All right. Order whatever you want.

427
00:30:26,234 --> 00:30:27,564
Hey!

428
00:30:27,564 --> 00:30:29,414
Hey, come here.

429
00:30:29,414 --> 00:30:31,264
Come here, bastard!

430
00:30:33,284 --> 00:30:35,134
Hey, hey.

431
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:39,184
You immoral, rude little asshole.

432
00:30:39,184 --> 00:30:42,134
You're marking Madam Yang when even I've only done it a few times?

433
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:44,924
Who the hell are you?

434
00:30:44,924 --> 00:30:48,484
Bodyguard Jang told me to.

435
00:30:48,484 --> 00:30:50,714
Hey, you've got connections?

436
00:30:50,714 --> 00:30:55,044
You should've declined. You should've declined, bastard.

437
00:30:55,044 --> 00:30:56,934
Did you receive a tip or not?

438
00:30:56,934 --> 00:31:00,374
- I haven't yet.
- Really?

439
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:03,414
Then I'll go in.

440
00:31:03,414 --> 00:31:06,484
You go through the back door for deliveries.

441
00:31:06,484 --> 00:31:08,554
Get it together.

442
00:31:09,864 --> 00:31:11,254
Okay.

443
00:31:48,414 --> 00:31:50,334
Whoa, hey!

444
00:31:55,784 --> 00:31:58,674
Hey, how come you're here?

445
00:31:58,674 --> 00:32:00,514
I was told to do a delivery.

446
00:32:00,514 --> 00:32:04,054
Shit, I'm exhausted. Do you have a license?

447
00:32:04,054 --> 00:32:05,864
Yes.

448
00:32:05,864 --> 00:32:08,504
Here. Get in and drive.

449
00:32:57,724 --> 00:33:00,224
Are you the guardian of this drink?

450
00:33:00,224 --> 00:33:02,834
Yes, I am.

451
00:33:02,834 --> 00:33:06,164
That's odd. Did I mistake the number?

452
00:33:06,164 --> 00:33:08,054
That's no fun.

453
00:33:27,654 --> 00:33:32,234
So, is the Bishop still on his pilgrimage?

454
00:33:32,234 --> 00:33:33,764
Yes.

455
00:33:33,764 --> 00:33:38,974
He told me to escort you with devotion when you arrive.

456
00:33:38,974 --> 00:33:42,174
On that note, since you're bored,

457
00:33:42,174 --> 00:33:43,874
how about a round of choosing a bottle?

458
00:33:43,874 --> 00:33:46,284
It's no fun without a bet.

459
00:33:46,284 --> 00:33:48,104
We can make a bet, then.

460
00:33:49,324 --> 00:33:51,134
Loser grants winner's wish?

461
00:33:51,134 --> 00:33:54,834
Whatever it may be, to the best of my abilities.

462
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:59,444
Who is this? Number four.

463
00:33:59,444 --> 00:34:01,104
Yes.

464
00:34:01,104 --> 00:34:02,974
Where's number five?

465
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,824
Mr. On, who will you bet on?

466
00:34:11,324 --> 00:34:12,574
Yes.

467
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:22,564
These three will be on the same team.

468
00:34:22,564 --> 00:34:26,384
And their opponent will be me.

469
00:34:26,384 --> 00:34:29,954
Oh, my. What on earth? This is fun already.

470
00:34:29,954 --> 00:34:32,974
Madame Yang, who will you bet on?

471
00:34:32,974 --> 00:34:36,864
I'm on your side, of course.

472
00:34:36,864 --> 00:34:39,244
But since that won't be fun,

473
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,834
I'll bet on them.

474
00:34:46,614 --> 00:34:49,164
If you beat me, the three of you can share this.

475
00:34:49,164 --> 00:34:51,474
This gets you motivated, right?

476
00:35:09,244 --> 00:35:12,964
Whoa, you're so cool!

477
00:35:22,484 --> 00:35:24,524
Let's go!

478
00:35:39,034 --> 00:35:43,064
Oh, my goodness. You're so cool!

479
00:35:50,814 --> 00:35:52,994
Hey, you guys should reset the table.

480
00:35:52,994 --> 00:35:57,994
What should I do? You're so sexy, Mr. On.

481
00:35:57,994 --> 00:36:02,394
You can grant my wish when the time comes, as you promised.

482
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:04,984
Of course. Here.

483
00:36:04,984 --> 00:36:08,314
Take this glass of victory.

484
00:36:27,294 --> 00:36:30,884
Sunbaenims, where are we going?

485
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:33,534
It's on the navigation.

486
00:36:33,534 --> 00:36:36,204
The delivery is late, so step on it.

487
00:36:37,494 --> 00:36:38,824
All right.

488
00:36:42,774 --> 00:36:45,674
I think the destination is a hotel.

489
00:36:46,624 --> 00:36:49,814
"The delivery is running late?" What's he talking about?

490
00:37:10,474 --> 00:37:11,734
 

491
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:19,644
Go Eun, 34 Ro 3535. Please look into the car.

492
00:37:19,644 --> 00:37:22,214
34 Ro 3535.

493
00:37:22,214 --> 00:37:23,874
 

494
00:37:24,854 --> 00:37:28,064
That's reporter Kim Yong Min!

495
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:46,334
Hey, why are you turning here?

496
00:37:46,334 --> 00:37:48,314
There's a car on our tail.

497
00:37:48,314 --> 00:37:49,594
What?

498
00:37:57,334 --> 00:37:59,014
What the hell?

499
00:38:10,564 --> 00:38:13,554
Is that trashy journo nuts? He showed up again.

500
00:39:10,134 --> 00:39:11,714
Shit.

501
00:39:12,744 --> 00:39:15,974
- Hey, get off.
- Get out, you bastard.

502
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,444
This bastard-

503
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:38,894
Why would you...

504
00:39:42,124 --> 00:39:44,314
We need to take that woman to a hospital.

505
00:39:44,314 --> 00:39:46,894
We don't have time. Hurry!

506
00:40:01,574 --> 00:40:04,664
A simple test is going to take 10 minutes.

507
00:40:04,664 --> 00:40:06,084
All right.

508
00:40:25,354 --> 00:40:28,104
You're probably tired. Have some.

509
00:40:28,104 --> 00:40:30,154
We'll need to wait a while.

510
00:40:33,244 --> 00:40:35,544
Who knew I'd meet you there.

511
00:40:35,544 --> 00:40:37,554
How come you were there?

512
00:40:37,554 --> 00:40:40,094
That's my line.

513
00:40:41,284 --> 00:40:45,114
I think I clearly told you not to interfere.

514
00:40:45,114 --> 00:40:47,484
That's my line, too.

515
00:40:49,004 --> 00:40:50,804
A simple test...

516
00:40:50,804 --> 00:40:52,844
Are you talking about a visual field test?

517
00:40:52,844 --> 00:40:55,224
I'm not sure,

518
00:40:55,224 --> 00:40:58,884
but she was definitely exposed to a particular drug.

519
00:40:58,884 --> 00:41:03,684
Should I tell you what would've happened if we had just left her?

520
00:41:03,684 --> 00:41:06,994
She would've been dragged to an unfamiliar place

521
00:41:06,994 --> 00:41:09,184
and terrible things would've been done to her.

522
00:41:09,184 --> 00:41:13,304
And nothing would've changed even if she had told the police.

523
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,774
She would've been framed as the perpetrator for a false charge.

524
00:41:18,544 --> 00:41:20,814
What's your relationship to the patient inside?

525
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:22,514
Are the test results out?

526
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:26,744
The test result was positive for the drug substance.

527
00:41:26,744 --> 00:41:28,274
I knew it.

528
00:41:28,274 --> 00:41:30,114
I reported it to the police right away.

529
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:32,044
You made a report?

530
00:41:32,044 --> 00:41:35,104
H-How could you make a report on your own accord like that?

531
00:41:35,104 --> 00:41:40,034
We have a duty to report a positive drug test result to the police.

532
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:41,964
How long has it been since you made the report?

533
00:41:41,964 --> 00:41:45,824
As soon as it showed positive, so they should be here soon.

534
00:41:50,064 --> 00:41:51,724
Shit...

535
00:41:57,934 --> 00:42:00,744
 

536
00:42:09,034 --> 00:42:10,474
Can you hear me?

537
00:42:10,474 --> 00:42:13,814
As of now, you're being arrested for drug use,

538
00:42:13,814 --> 00:42:16,564
and you have the right to remain silent- Do you hear me?

539
00:42:16,564 --> 00:42:18,204
Get her inside.

540
00:42:38,664 --> 00:42:40,904
We were almost there.

541
00:42:55,094 --> 00:42:57,124
 Mr. Kim. 

542
00:42:57,124 --> 00:43:00,374
Mr. Choi said those people will wake up soon.

543
00:43:00,374 --> 00:43:02,564
All right. I'll be there soon.

544
00:43:11,344 --> 00:43:13,574
Oh, my head.

545
00:43:15,674 --> 00:43:18,064
W-Where's the girl?

546
00:43:18,064 --> 00:43:20,014
Where's the girl?

547
00:43:23,874 --> 00:43:26,754
Get up. Hey, get up!

548
00:43:26,754 --> 00:43:29,674
- Where am I?
- W-Where's the girl?

549
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:31,414
Sunbaenims,

550
00:43:31,414 --> 00:43:34,574
- are you all right?
- As if.

551
00:43:34,574 --> 00:43:37,784
Hey, call the higher-ups and brief them.

552
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:41,054
My head...

553
00:43:52,054 --> 00:43:53,864
Who is it?

554
00:44:01,054 --> 00:44:03,494
How did you know my address?

555
00:44:03,494 --> 00:44:06,084
I was wondering if I could drink some tea.

556
00:44:06,084 --> 00:44:08,214
If it's not too much trouble.

557
00:44:38,284 --> 00:44:42,214
I don't have tea, but I have beer and water.

558
00:44:42,214 --> 00:44:44,074
Whichever you want.

559
00:44:51,014 --> 00:44:54,704
You're not really here to drink tea.

560
00:44:54,704 --> 00:44:58,584
I want to know what you're after.

561
00:45:01,054 --> 00:45:05,514
What is it you want that you'd risk your life

562
00:45:05,514 --> 00:45:07,844
with your poor driving skills?

563
00:45:08,904 --> 00:45:11,264
Let me ask you something first.

564
00:45:11,264 --> 00:45:15,414
The reason you pushed my car out of the way that day...

565
00:45:15,414 --> 00:45:20,054
was it because you thought I'd collide with the truck? So, was it intentional?

566
00:45:21,154 --> 00:45:25,474
Since I have greater driving skills than you.

567
00:45:25,474 --> 00:45:27,234
I see.

568
00:45:30,424 --> 00:45:32,524
What it is I want...

569
00:45:32,524 --> 00:45:35,224
What I want...

570
00:45:35,224 --> 00:45:38,454
I don't know. I think there was a lot,

571
00:45:38,454 --> 00:45:40,784
but I attained none of them.

572
00:45:42,154 --> 00:45:44,574
I messed everything up.

573
00:45:44,574 --> 00:45:47,364
Someone even died because of me.

574
00:45:51,974 --> 00:45:53,914
Choi Sung Eun was...

575
00:45:56,414 --> 00:46:00,094
one of the few true police officers I knew.

576
00:46:00,094 --> 00:46:01,654
 

577
00:46:01,654 --> 00:46:06,144
 

578
00:46:06,144 --> 00:46:10,164
That person who took his own life?

579
00:46:11,204 --> 00:46:13,854
It wasn't suicide.

580
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,644
Someone killed him...

581
00:46:16,644 --> 00:46:19,534
and set it up to look like that.

582
00:46:20,534 --> 00:46:22,164
A setup?

583
00:46:23,204 --> 00:46:24,944
I don't know.

584
00:46:26,714 --> 00:46:30,104
I thought I figured almost everything out, but...

585
00:46:31,354 --> 00:46:33,614
Only if I hadn't...

586
00:46:35,184 --> 00:46:38,714
made that report to Detective Choi one year ago.

587
00:46:41,814 --> 00:46:42,964
 

588
00:46:42,964 --> 00:46:44,564
We need to choose where we're going to look.

589
00:46:44,564 --> 00:46:47,214
Team Leader, you're here?

590
00:46:47,214 --> 00:46:52,714
All right. As a reward for the joint arrest we made, the commissioner issued a bonus.

591
00:46:52,714 --> 00:46:54,994
- All right.
- Whoo!

592
00:46:54,994 --> 00:46:56,734
- Oh, and the youngest.
- Yes.

593
00:46:56,734 --> 00:47:00,434
Commissioner asks for a list based on the achievement level. So, put one together and submit it.

594
00:47:00,434 --> 00:47:01,244
Understood.

595
00:47:01,244 --> 00:47:04,214
- Good job, everyone.
 - Good job! 

596
00:47:04,214 --> 00:47:07,864
- Hey, hey. This, too. It's due today.
- Okay.

597
00:47:07,864 --> 00:47:10,644
- I have something I need to take care of.
- All right.

598
00:47:12,894 --> 00:47:14,834
What? What, now?

599
00:47:14,834 --> 00:47:16,604
Whoa, congrats.

600
00:47:16,604 --> 00:47:21,104
Large-scale drug trafficking in Incheon, arrested. How incredible.

601
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:22,954
I heard you found almost 20 kg.

602
00:47:22,954 --> 00:47:25,204
How did you know that? You're quick.

603
00:47:25,204 --> 00:47:27,004
It might just make our front page.

604
00:47:27,004 --> 00:47:30,174
Hyung, the kimchi was delicious. My wife told me to thank you for that.

605
00:47:30,174 --> 00:47:31,424
Oh, really?

606
00:47:31,424 --> 00:47:34,494
My mother has big hands, so I had too much.

607
00:47:34,494 --> 00:47:37,504
- Good thing you liked it.
- Hyung, stop rambling on.

608
00:47:37,504 --> 00:47:39,654
What is it you wanted to report?

609
00:47:42,814 --> 00:47:45,324
Hey, if it's something big, it's my exclusive, okay?

610
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:48,014
Did I ever deny you?

611
00:47:48,014 --> 00:47:50,144
Let's see. Drugs...

612
00:47:50,144 --> 00:47:51,344
 

613
00:47:51,344 --> 00:47:54,984
I hung around for a few days since I got the report. I have a feeling.

614
00:47:54,984 --> 00:47:57,494
But Hyung, think about it.

615
00:47:57,494 --> 00:48:00,974
Why would a club that makes billions of won per year supply drugs?

616
00:48:00,974 --> 00:48:04,914
I'm asking you this because that's what I'm curious about.

617
00:48:04,914 --> 00:48:08,504
- I don't think this is true.
- If it's not, then good for them.

618
00:48:08,504 --> 00:48:13,094
Oh, when you're at the scene, press this button like this.

619
00:48:13,094 --> 00:48:16,084
- Just press this once.
- What's this?

620
00:48:16,084 --> 00:48:20,154
I should at least have a recording if I want to hurry the breaking news.

621
00:48:20,154 --> 00:48:24,974
I'll hold onto it and only release the article when you give me the okay.

622
00:48:24,974 --> 00:48:26,634
I'll buy you a drink, too.

623
00:48:26,634 --> 00:48:29,954
Hyung, I'm not doing this for the drink.

624
00:48:29,954 --> 00:48:33,444
I'm taking a look because of an allegedly unjust place, okay?

625
00:48:33,444 --> 00:48:36,004
- Justice!
- Go. Stop bothering me and go.

626
00:48:36,004 --> 00:48:38,484
Justice. Laters.

627
00:48:41,234 --> 00:48:45,354
 

628
00:48:51,714 --> 00:48:55,544
- Hello?
 - Hyung, you were right. 

629
00:48:55,544 --> 00:48:57,464
What's up at this time?

630
00:48:57,464 --> 00:49:00,644
 Hyung, I don't know what to do, though. 

631
00:49:00,644 --> 00:49:02,224
Why? Why? Why?

632
00:49:02,224 --> 00:49:04,094
What's going on?

633
00:49:09,944 --> 00:49:11,584
Where are you? I'll be right there.

634
00:49:11,584 --> 00:49:15,214
Hyung, no, no. I'll go to you.

635
00:49:15,214 --> 00:49:17,894
You're the only person I can trust right now.

636
00:49:19,204 --> 00:49:21,474
I'll be there after I check out one more thing.

637
00:49:22,864 --> 00:49:25,414
Wait, hello? Hold on. Detective Choi.

638
00:49:25,414 --> 00:49:26,884
Sung Eun!

639
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:30,404
When he said he'd check out something...

640
00:49:30,404 --> 00:49:33,224
it just sounded so ominous.

641
00:49:34,324 --> 00:49:37,024
And that ominous feeling...

642
00:49:37,024 --> 00:49:39,144
wasn't wrong.

643
00:49:51,224 --> 00:49:52,934
Sung Eun...

644
00:49:56,204 --> 00:49:59,024
Sung Eun...

645
00:49:59,024 --> 00:50:00,644
Internal affairs said...

646
00:50:00,644 --> 00:50:05,284
Detective Choi formed many debts recently.

647
00:50:05,284 --> 00:50:09,914
The inspection team told us the first round of investigation is done...

648
00:50:09,914 --> 00:50:12,254
and they think it really was a suicide.

649
00:50:13,284 --> 00:50:15,914
Stop lying.

650
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:20,074
Why would Detective Choi commit suicide?

651
00:50:21,984 --> 00:50:24,494
Detective Choi was framed.

652
00:50:24,494 --> 00:50:27,534
He was murdered while digging for the truth!

653
00:50:27,534 --> 00:50:30,484
Look, Reporter Kim. Please watch your mouth in front of the bereaved.

654
00:50:30,484 --> 00:50:32,864
Are you people on the same team?

655
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:35,924
Are you sure you properly investigated?

656
00:50:39,264 --> 00:50:42,714
Ma'am, I'm going to reveal...

657
00:50:43,804 --> 00:50:46,864
Sung Eun's unjust death, no matter what.

658
00:50:46,864 --> 00:50:48,864
Detective Choi...

659
00:50:48,864 --> 00:50:50,724
was our precious colleague, too.

660
00:50:50,724 --> 00:50:53,644
If something suspicious comes up...

661
00:50:53,644 --> 00:50:56,814
I'll investigate from the start myself.

662
00:51:00,944 --> 00:51:04,244
You see him entering the car by himself after leaving, right?

663
00:51:04,244 --> 00:51:08,304
We also investigated everything there was before informing the bereaved family.

664
00:51:08,304 --> 00:51:12,164
Since we can't spew bullshit to them without knowing anything like you did.

665
00:51:12,164 --> 00:51:14,894
Anyhow, the case is closed as of today.

666
00:51:14,894 --> 00:51:18,664
So you just stay put, too.

667
00:51:18,664 --> 00:51:23,684
Don't be ridiculous. If you people can't, I'll do it again on my own.

668
00:51:23,684 --> 00:51:24,734
 

669
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:28,214
 

670
00:51:28,214 --> 00:51:31,694
 When they ruled Detective Choi's death as a suicide, 

671
00:51:31,694 --> 00:51:34,654
 some detectives requested a reinvestigation, 

672
00:51:34,654 --> 00:51:38,974
 but strangely, they all got transferred somewhere else. 

673
00:51:38,974 --> 00:51:40,364
 

674
00:51:42,594 --> 00:51:43,634
 

675
00:52:18,104 --> 00:52:23,274
 Oh, when you're at the scene, press this button like this. 

676
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:24,634
 What's this? 

677
00:52:24,634 --> 00:52:29,574
 I should at least have a recording if I want to hurry the breaking news. 

678
00:52:29,574 --> 00:52:32,424
The pen recorder I gave him.

679
00:52:32,424 --> 00:52:33,414
 

680
00:52:38,574 --> 00:52:39,974
The pen's missing.

681
00:52:39,974 --> 00:52:41,864
 The Detective Choi I knew... 

682
00:52:41,864 --> 00:52:44,684
 assuming someone didn't steal it from him... 

683
00:52:44,684 --> 00:52:47,024
 I thought he definitely hid it somewhere. 

684
00:52:47,024 --> 00:52:48,814
Get lost!

685
00:52:52,684 --> 00:52:57,774
Since then, I did everything I could to get inside Black Sun.

686
00:52:57,774 --> 00:53:01,624
And that's why I became a thorn in their eyes.

687
00:53:08,244 --> 00:53:09,314
Hello?

688
00:53:09,314 --> 00:53:13,494
 Is this Reporter Kim Yong Min? 

689
00:53:13,494 --> 00:53:17,994
 There's something I'd like to report regarding Detective Choi Sung Eun. 

690
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:20,284
Where are you right now?

691
00:53:29,434 --> 00:53:31,874
The report you'd like to make...

692
00:53:58,904 --> 00:54:00,604
Mr. Kim Yong Min,

693
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:04,094
you're under arrest for conveying false information and accepting bribery.

694
00:54:04,094 --> 00:54:06,134
- Don't be ridiculous-
- Let's go.

695
00:54:06,134 --> 00:54:09,014
Everything's been set up!

696
00:54:10,384 --> 00:54:14,834
We've obtained evidence of you accepting a bribe.

697
00:54:18,294 --> 00:54:21,364
 I became a trashy journo overnight for 

698
00:54:21,364 --> 00:54:26,014
 manipulating articles and accepting bribes in all communities and media. 

699
00:54:29,304 --> 00:54:32,444
Those bastards got me good.

700
00:54:39,264 --> 00:54:41,674
You asked me once.

701
00:54:43,334 --> 00:54:46,714
Why I recorded myself on the rooftop that day.

702
00:54:48,264 --> 00:54:50,264
To be honest, that day...

703
00:54:50,264 --> 00:54:53,454
I was going to die at those people's hands.

704
00:54:55,294 --> 00:55:00,704
If the video of those guys killing me spread on the internet,

705
00:55:02,284 --> 00:55:05,494
I thought they might reopen the...

706
00:55:06,444 --> 00:55:08,054
investigation.

707
00:55:10,914 --> 00:55:14,154
I want to find the bastards who made Detective Choi like that...

708
00:55:16,164 --> 00:55:19,384
and make them stand in court, but...

709
00:55:19,384 --> 00:55:22,844
there's nothing more I can do.

710
00:56:16,824 --> 00:56:18,384
 

711
00:56:25,354 --> 00:56:27,654
 

712
00:56:34,364 --> 00:56:39,374
Saying this at this time is a bit harsh, but...

713
00:56:39,374 --> 00:56:43,854
we're not in a situation to help Reporter Kim Yong Min, no?

714
00:56:43,854 --> 00:56:45,794
I agree.

715
00:56:45,794 --> 00:56:50,034
We have our own fish to fry, and if they find out Mr. Kim is alive, they'll try to hurt him again.

716
00:56:50,034 --> 00:56:52,284
We need to catch them first.

717
00:56:53,454 --> 00:56:55,724
What we're chasing might not be so different

718
00:56:55,724 --> 00:56:59,744
from what Reporter Kim Yong Min is looking for.

719
00:57:00,724 --> 00:57:04,324
Mr. Jang, why aren't you saying anything?

720
00:57:04,324 --> 00:57:08,154
In my opinion,

721
00:57:08,154 --> 00:57:10,734
I think everyone is right.

722
00:57:10,734 --> 00:57:13,364
Mr. Jang! How can you say everyone is right?

723
00:57:13,434 --> 00:57:15,734
We lost our taxi, and Mr. Kim Do Gi...

724
00:57:15,734 --> 00:57:18,814
really almost died.

725
00:57:18,814 --> 00:57:22,454
It's not the first time he almost died.

726
00:57:22,454 --> 00:57:25,674
Go Eun is right! Mr. Kim Do Gi almost died this time.

727
00:57:25,674 --> 00:57:27,894
It could've been really bad!

728
00:57:27,894 --> 00:57:30,534
All the answers we're looking for

729
00:57:30,534 --> 00:57:34,774
seems to be waiting inside Black Sun.

730
00:57:36,444 --> 00:57:38,684
 
 

731
00:57:43,174 --> 00:57:47,674
What I think is that we should accept this case.

732
00:57:47,674 --> 00:57:51,004
We do have our own fish to fry, but...

733
00:57:51,004 --> 00:57:56,154
someone like him, who needs help, is the reason we exist. Don't you think?

734
00:57:57,194 --> 00:57:58,794
I'm in favor.

735
00:57:59,714 --> 00:58:01,084
Me, too.

736
00:58:09,864 --> 00:58:12,414
Mr. Kim Do Gi is busy as it is...

737
00:58:12,414 --> 00:58:16,484
I guess you have one more thing to do at Black Sun.

738
00:58:24,204 --> 00:58:30,574
 

739
00:58:42,844 --> 00:58:44,754
 

740
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:45,694
 

741
00:58:57,584 --> 00:59:01,084
 

742
00:59:01,084 --> 00:59:02,544
 

743
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:08,184
 

744
00:59:18,124 --> 00:59:19,444
 

745
00:59:22,694 --> 00:59:27,904
 Hello. Thank you for coming to Rainbow Premium Taxi Service. 

746
00:59:27,904 --> 00:59:30,434
 I'll tell you a few points to remember 

747
00:59:30,434 --> 00:59:33,394
 for your safety and convenience. 

748
00:59:33,394 --> 00:59:38,094
 While we're working on your case, the taxi meter will be left turned on. 

749
00:59:38,094 --> 00:59:42,264
 As for the taxi fare, after the case is closed, it will be settled at a later time. 

750
00:59:42,264 --> 00:59:45,364
 Depending on the situation, there may be an extra charge. 

751
00:59:45,364 --> 00:59:49,424
 After using the taxi, you may not mention matters 

752
00:59:49,424 --> 00:59:53,104
 relevant to Rainbow Premium Taxi Service to others. 

753
00:59:53,104 --> 00:59:54,744
 We ask you to keep that in mind. 

754
00:59:54,744 --> 00:59:58,394
 If you wish to commission us, 

755
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:00,934
 press the blue button on the left. 

756
01:00:00,934 --> 01:00:02,554
 And if you wish not to, 

757
01:00:02,554 --> 01:00:06,844
 press the red button on the right. 

758
01:00:13,354 --> 01:00:15,564
 Hyung, I'm not doing this for the drink. 

759
01:00:15,564 --> 01:00:19,294
 I'm taking a look because of an allegedly unjust place, okay? 

760
01:00:19,294 --> 01:00:20,974
 Yong Min hyung... 

761
01:00:22,064 --> 01:00:24,174
 you were right. 

762
01:00:24,174 --> 01:00:26,254
 You're the only person I can trust right now. 

763
01:00:26,254 --> 01:00:28,414
 I'll be there after I check out one more thing. 

764
01:00:42,294 --> 01:00:44,354
 You have selected. 

765
01:00:44,354 --> 01:00:49,174
 Now, shall we get revenge with Premium Taxi? 

766
01:02:43,864 --> 01:02:46,844
Dispatch 5283, commencing operation.

767
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,700
 

768
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:09,200
 !

769
01:03:27,914 --> 01:03:35,824
 

770
01:03:35,824 --> 01:03:38,684
 How can they do something like this in the middle of bustling Seoul? 

771
01:03:38,684 --> 01:03:41,364
 It's like looking at the devil's playground. 

772
01:03:43,394 --> 01:03:44,794
 Is it that hard? 

773
01:03:44,794 --> 01:03:46,934
 All right, it's time for "Doll Play." 

774
01:03:46,934 --> 01:03:49,104
 You should hit a home run tonight, Oppa. 

775
01:03:49,104 --> 01:03:52,484
 I'll show you what social hierarchy really looks like. 

776
01:03:52,484 --> 01:03:54,364
 Put operation on hold today. Close up! 

777
01:03:54,364 --> 01:03:57,194
 Don't worry, Madam. Just trust me. 

778
01:03:57,194 --> 01:04:00,004
 We stopped them for now, but they'll start up again soon. 

779
01:04:00,004 --> 01:04:01,274
 What's your identity? 

780
01:04:01,274 --> 01:04:04,404
 Mr. Kim Do Gi! Answer us! 

781
01:04:04,404 --> 01:04:05,694
 Goodbye. 

782
01:04:05,694 --> 01:04:07,994
 Mr. Kim! Get it together! 

783
01:04:07,994 --> 01:04:10,694
 You have to go back, Mr. Kim! Please get it together! 

784
01:04:10,694 --> 01:04:12,864
 Mr. Kim Do Gi!
