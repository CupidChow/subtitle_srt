1
00:00:26,197 --> 00:00:31,207
 

2
00:00:31,207 --> 00:00:36,197
 

3
00:00:36,197 --> 00:00:39,017
 

4
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:42,997
 

5
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,100
Hold on a second!

6
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:57,500


7
00:00:57,517 --> 00:00:59,787
You aren't married, are you?

8
00:01:05,907 --> 00:01:10,697
Is it more beneficial for us not to be married when buying a house?

9
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:14,107
Just let us know. We can get divorced right away-

10
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:21,877
What do you think, Honey?

11
00:01:28,427 --> 00:01:30,507
Gosh...

12
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,917
you two are really funny.

13
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:36,467
Thank you for the show.

14
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:01,647
Something's gone wrong, right?

15
00:02:01,647 --> 00:02:03,607
Yes. I think we were found out.

16
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:07,137
Gosh, what do we do now?

17
00:02:07,137 --> 00:02:09,527
We need to kneel and beg.

18
00:02:09,527 --> 00:02:11,177
Desperately.

19
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:19,077
Mr. Kang! Mr. Kang...

20
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:26,077
I'm sorry. As you said, Mr. Kang, we aren't...

21
00:02:26,077 --> 00:02:28,397
a real married couple.

22
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:33,667
We're just coworkers and...

23
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:36,637
we just wanted to buy a house desperately.

24
00:02:39,857 --> 00:02:43,997
I'm really sorry for deceiving you, but it wasn't intended.

25
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:49,287
You did prepare a lot, but you overreacted too much.

26
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:51,447
I would've been totally deceived if I hadn't visited today.

27
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:56,647
Looking at just you two, it feels like you really care for each other.

28
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:03,527
I have no excuses.

29
00:03:03,527 --> 00:03:06,767
So you're saying you two got...

30
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:10,347
married on paper without feelings,

31
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:12,477
just to buy a house?

32
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:15,147
Gosh, I'm sorry.

33
00:03:15,147 --> 00:03:16,727
Kim Do Gi...

34
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:27,457
Do you remember what I said?

35
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:31,787
Do you remember the type of people I said I help?

36
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:36,367
- People who don't have a house-
- No, that's wrong.

37
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:38,327
Desperate people.

38
00:03:38,327 --> 00:03:42,697
I'm indeed spiteful of your lying, but your desperation...

39
00:03:42,697 --> 00:03:44,897
I like it a lot.

40
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:50,407
I got to know your reality.

41
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:53,107
Shall we see what your future will look like?

42
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,877
Our future?

43
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:00,597
This isn't too bad.

44
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:04,077
Isn't that the top floor?

45
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,897
Whoa...

46
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:07,647
Please come in.

47
00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:14,357
Whoa... Whoa!

48
00:04:14,357 --> 00:04:16,347
Whoa!

49
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:19,697
Whoa! Whoa...

50
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:21,707
Whoa!

51
00:04:21,707 --> 00:04:24,047
Whoa, Mr. Kang!

52
00:04:25,617 --> 00:04:27,777
Whoa... This is really great.

53
00:04:27,777 --> 00:04:30,527
Th-The house is so nice!

54
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:34,267
Well, you're so happy when it's just a model house.

55
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:36,287
What's your blood type, Mr. Kim?

56
00:04:36,287 --> 00:04:38,207
I-I'm type A.

57
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:39,617
I see. And you, Ma'am?

58
00:04:39,617 --> 00:04:42,037
- I'm type B.
- A and B?

59
00:04:42,037 --> 00:04:47,127
Whoa, you two are so lucky with blood types, too.

60
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:50,387
Under whose name is the house going to be?

61
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:52,007
Wh-What do you mean?

62
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:55,287
It's not bad to decide that much in advance.

63
00:04:55,287 --> 00:04:57,297
Oh, I see...

64
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:01,087
That means...

65
00:05:02,117 --> 00:05:05,727
Are you going to pick us?

66
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:11,387
- Whoa...
- Yes! Y-Yes!

67
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:15,047
- Whoa!
- Really!

68
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:17,347
Hey, shall we just get married now?

69
00:05:17,347 --> 00:05:19,067
Gosh, what are you saying? Shall we?

70
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:21,227
- Gosh!
- Yes!

71
00:05:21,227 --> 00:05:23,047
It makes me happy to see you two that happy.

72
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:26,007
- Thank you so much.
- I'll contact you soon,

73
00:05:26,007 --> 00:05:28,907
so take good care of your wife's health.

74
00:05:28,907 --> 00:05:30,327
H-Health?

75
00:05:30,327 --> 00:05:31,717
You didn't know?

76
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:34,047
That your wife is expecting?

77
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:38,077
I-I'm not pregnant, though.

78
00:05:38,077 --> 00:05:42,007
If I say you are, then you are.

79
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:44,547
You can call me a magician.

80
00:05:44,547 --> 00:05:46,587
Or something like that.

81
00:05:46,587 --> 00:05:49,647
- Congratulations.
- Okay.

82
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:06,087
"In a pitch dark night sky,

83
00:06:06,087 --> 00:06:09,647
a small light blossomed.

84
00:06:09,647 --> 00:06:15,357
Rabbits went back home, dancing in joy.

85
00:06:15,357 --> 00:06:20,827
Grandmother also went to bed for a sweet, sweet sleep.

86
00:06:20,827 --> 00:06:25,097
Good night, everyone!"

87
00:06:25,097 --> 00:06:27,617
The end. It's fun, isn't it?

88
00:06:27,617 --> 00:06:29,437
Yes.

89
00:06:29,437 --> 00:06:31,627
What shall we do now?

90
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:34,627
Can we draw a picture of those rabbits here?

91
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,677
A picture of rabbits? Let's see.

92
00:06:36,677 --> 00:06:39,477
Where was the rabbit again? Oh, it's here.

93
00:06:39,477 --> 00:06:41,197
You mean those rabbits, right?

94
00:06:41,197 --> 00:06:44,687
- Yes.
- Okay. One second.

95
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:50,447
Wouldn't it be way better to draw on here? With these.

96
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:52,247
Am I allowed to draw on here?

97
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:54,307
Of course, you can!

98
00:06:54,307 --> 00:06:56,277
Thank you.

99
00:06:56,277 --> 00:06:58,707
You're welcome.

100
00:07:05,877 --> 00:07:09,317
I'm continuously searching for information on Seo Yeon's adoption, but it's not easy.

101
00:07:09,317 --> 00:07:11,837
Me, too. I want to find more, but there's no data.

102
00:07:11,837 --> 00:07:15,367
There are still many places that handwrite adoption papers,

103
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,557
so they won't be easy to find online.

104
00:07:17,557 --> 00:07:20,637
When adopting and registering a child for adoption, there must be a legal proxy.

105
00:07:20,637 --> 00:07:23,527
So, there must be an adoption officer present.

106
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,507
You can't skip over that.

107
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:29,497
So I think we should start investigating from there.

108
00:07:29,497 --> 00:07:34,437
However, I think there's one more problem regarding Seo Yeon besides that.

109
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:36,257
One more problem?

110
00:07:42,097 --> 00:07:44,237
It's a picture of her playing at a playground in rain.

111
00:07:44,237 --> 00:07:46,647
But the rain looks so odd.

112
00:07:46,647 --> 00:07:48,507
That's not rain.

113
00:07:48,507 --> 00:07:51,857
- She meant to draw iron bars.
- Iron bars?

114
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:57,277
She's not playing at a playground. She's watching...

115
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,447
while she's locked up somewhere.

116
00:08:16,827 --> 00:08:19,957
You want to blow it out? We need to sing the song first.

117
00:08:43,227 --> 00:08:45,277
 

118
00:08:58,257 --> 00:09:00,257
Unni...

119
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:03,827
You're awake, So Mang?

120
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:05,057
Unni...

121
00:09:05,057 --> 00:09:08,027
I miss my mom.

122
00:09:11,997 --> 00:09:15,127
When can I see my mom?

123
00:09:16,907 --> 00:09:18,497
So Mang...

124
00:09:19,427 --> 00:09:23,127
should we play tag at the playground?

125
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:27,227
 Rock, paper, scissors, set, shoot! 

126
00:09:27,227 --> 00:09:30,167
 Rock, paper, scissors, set, shoot! 

127
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:33,677
 Rock, paper, scissors, set, shoot! 

128
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:43,977
 And stop right there! 

129
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:21,387
I come down the slide and start running to catch you.

130
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:29,447
Children.

131
00:10:32,907 --> 00:10:35,797
Hey! Wake up.

132
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,227
Wake up!

133
00:10:42,657 --> 00:10:46,657
At least act glad when your uncle is here.

134
00:10:46,657 --> 00:10:48,467
Oh, okay.

135
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:50,697
Have you been doing well, Darlings?

136
00:10:50,697 --> 00:10:52,737
Uncle is here.

137
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:55,007
-  Hello. 
- Yes.

138
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:57,527
Let's clean up here. There's no place to sit.

139
00:10:57,527 --> 00:11:00,667
Aigoo. I did make them clean, but...

140
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,207
Aigoo!

141
00:11:06,507 --> 00:11:08,537
Come here. Come here.

142
00:11:09,747 --> 00:11:11,117
Sit down.

143
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:14,117
You little punks.

144
00:11:16,647 --> 00:11:18,157
Wait.

145
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:24,877
Whoo!

146
00:11:36,097 --> 00:11:37,697
Ring.

147
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,327
Wait.

148
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:57,647
Hurry up and eat slowly.

149
00:11:57,647 --> 00:11:59,437
Hey, you're kicking up the dust.

150
00:11:59,437 --> 00:12:01,447
Move, move.

151
00:12:02,997 --> 00:12:05,217
So Mang, right?

152
00:12:05,217 --> 00:12:06,807
You're So Mang, right?

153
00:12:06,807 --> 00:12:08,297
How old are you, So Mang?

154
00:12:08,297 --> 00:12:10,707
So Mang is four years old.

155
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:13,067
Four years old?

156
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:15,657
All right.

157
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:32,307
Mr. Kang.

158
00:12:35,997 --> 00:12:40,187
Yes, Mr. Kang. I was eagerly awaiting your call.

159
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:42,517
 Mr. Kim Do Gi. 

160
00:12:42,517 --> 00:12:45,467
- Are you ready to become a dad?
- Sorry?

161
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:47,877
I'll text you a map,

162
00:12:47,877 --> 00:12:49,927
so head over with your wife.

163
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,697
 Do you have any questions? 

164
00:12:55,697 --> 00:12:57,607
No, I don't.

165
00:12:57,607 --> 00:13:00,607
We're ready to do whatever it takes.

166
00:13:00,607 --> 00:13:03,147
Gosh, you people are so lucky.

167
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:06,207
Thank you, Mr. Kang. Take care-

168
00:13:07,117 --> 00:13:09,797
- He hung up.
- What did he say?

169
00:13:09,797 --> 00:13:13,407
He asked me to come with you, so I think he'll bring up the adoption.

170
00:13:13,407 --> 00:13:15,847
That means...

171
00:13:15,847 --> 00:13:19,027
you might get to go to where these children are.

172
00:13:20,787 --> 00:13:24,047
Where do you think all these kids came from?

173
00:13:35,267 --> 00:13:38,907
Should I expand to America?

174
00:13:38,907 --> 00:13:40,447
Huh?

175
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,787
 

176
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:48,067
Gosh.

177
00:13:51,117 --> 00:13:53,237
What? What, what?

178
00:13:53,237 --> 00:13:57,177
 
So, what about Seo Yeon...

179
00:13:57,177 --> 00:14:00,857
- have you found her yet?
- I'm still looking.

180
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:04,057
But even if we do, she's useless since she's school-aged now.

181
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:06,037
Why do you ask when you're not even interested?

182
00:14:06,037 --> 00:14:08,237
Is Seo Yeon eight years old already?

183
00:14:08,237 --> 00:14:11,587
Pay a little more attention to the kids before you're forced to close down.

184
00:14:11,587 --> 00:14:13,217
Mister Director of Dreamland.

185
00:14:13,217 --> 00:14:17,917
We changed the sign last week, so we're now Dream Butterfly.

186
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:23,557
 Anyway, the reason I called you is because 

187
00:14:23,557 --> 00:14:26,757
this month's pay still hasn't come in yet.

188
00:14:26,757 --> 00:14:30,577
Please take good care of me, Mr. Kang.

189
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:32,677
Salute!

190
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,387
This alcoholic bastard.

191
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:37,807
Aigoo, aigoo.

192
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:40,197
 

193
00:14:40,267 --> 00:14:41,967
 

194
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:54,737
 

195
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:59,017
 

196
00:14:59,017 --> 00:15:00,387
Hello, hello.

197
00:15:00,387 --> 00:15:03,337
- Mr. Kang is waiting inside.
- Okay.

198
00:15:13,677 --> 00:15:15,457
I escorted the two of them.

199
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,317
Oh, Mr. Kang! Mr. Kang.

200
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:18,647
Have a seat.

201
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:21,177
Oh, thank you.

202
00:15:21,177 --> 00:15:23,327
You're like a real couple.

203
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,517
I know.

204
00:15:26,517 --> 00:15:28,287
So...

205
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:30,507
did you decide on a name?

206
00:15:30,507 --> 00:15:35,127
- Sorry?
- Gosh, you're not ready to be a father at all.

207
00:15:35,127 --> 00:15:37,797
Are you usually this oblivious?

208
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,877
No, I'm pretty keen.

209
00:15:40,877 --> 00:15:43,747
You're telling us to adopt, right?

210
00:15:43,747 --> 00:15:45,287
No, no, no, no.

211
00:15:45,287 --> 00:15:48,237
Adoption is one way to increase your housing subscription points,

212
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:50,947
but you have to prepare for the screening and due diligence.

213
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:54,557
We've a lot to do, and it's a handful. But...

214
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:59,007
you two are really lucky, you know?

215
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:02,837
Your desperation has reached the heavens. Shall I say?

216
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:06,697
No, no, no. It has reached me.

217
00:16:08,557 --> 00:16:11,687
What are you saying?

218
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:19,127
 

219
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:21,537
Manager Lim has arrived.

220
00:16:21,537 --> 00:16:23,477
Okay!

221
00:16:25,637 --> 00:16:26,967
 

222
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:29,527
Here.

223
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:33,037
Right here, today, a baby will be born.

224
00:16:33,037 --> 00:16:36,147
You two will register its birth under your name.

225
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:42,527
Then you won't need a screening or due diligence.

226
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:44,437
It's your baby.

227
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:51,647
It's your biological child, so no need for a screening, right?

228
00:16:51,647 --> 00:16:53,587
Biological child?

229
00:16:53,587 --> 00:16:55,247
You're afraid you'll have to raise it?

230
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:58,617
Don't worry, we'll collect it back when it's time.

231
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:02,647
Later on, after everything is over, you two just have to...

232
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,937
file a missing report. That's all.

233
00:17:06,937 --> 00:17:08,507
 

234
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:10,227
Hold on.

235
00:17:11,787 --> 00:17:13,597
Why are you calling when you're right outside?

236
00:17:13,597 --> 00:17:15,577
Just come in.

237
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:16,877
What?

238
00:17:16,877 --> 00:17:18,137
Okay.

239
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:22,087
I'll be right back, so just fill out the forms in the meantime.

240
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:23,957
Okay.

241
00:17:34,657 --> 00:17:36,827
Your wife's expression is a bit...

242
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:39,937
dark.

243
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:46,807
Because she can't think of a name.

244
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:49,967
It's not like you're going to raise it.

245
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:53,207
Just choose from one of those. Mid Eum, So Mang, Sa Rang*.
(Faith, Hope, Love)

246
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:56,107
Oh, not So Mang. That's taken.

247
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:57,697
Let's go.

248
00:18:03,607 --> 00:18:06,647
Seo Yeon and So Mang both...

249
00:18:06,647 --> 00:18:10,307
This is how they've been using the children.

250
00:18:12,497 --> 00:18:14,547
This is how...

251
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,597
Nice cushion.

252
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:27,557
Be gentle. She might lose the baby.

253
00:18:29,187 --> 00:18:30,447
You'll do it, right?

254
00:18:30,447 --> 00:18:32,327
I'm sorry.

255
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:34,367
I don't think I can go through with it.

256
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,207
Damn you.

257
00:18:37,357 --> 00:18:38,567
Aigoo.

258
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:42,377
You reckless young lady.

259
00:18:42,377 --> 00:18:45,487
Don't get too traumatized. You'll lose the baby.

260
00:18:45,487 --> 00:18:49,597
You unmarried woman. You agreed, so I cast parents and a hospital.

261
00:18:49,597 --> 00:18:52,017
I spent a lot of money.

262
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:54,627
Will you compensate for everything if you change your mind now?

263
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:58,297
- I'll work and pay it off.
- By working...

264
00:18:58,297 --> 00:19:00,777
That's out of the question.

265
00:19:00,777 --> 00:19:03,237
- You need money, huh?
- I don't need money.

266
00:19:03,237 --> 00:19:06,637
Please just let me raise the baby.

267
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:09,547
This won't do.

268
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:14,847
Please spare me. Spare me...

269
00:19:14,847 --> 00:19:18,507
Please save my baby. I beg you...

270
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:19,747
Please just let us go.

271
00:19:19,747 --> 00:19:23,557
Did I say I'll kill the baby? You're out of line! Shit!

272
00:19:24,527 --> 00:19:26,677
- Give it to me.
- Please just let us go.

273
00:19:26,677 --> 00:19:29,117
You're filthy. Don't touch me.

274
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:31,667
What's that?

275
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:34,617
Wait, I think there's a fire.

276
00:19:34,617 --> 00:19:38,637
We're the only ones here. Who started the fire?

277
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:41,367
Geez...

278
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:55,477
Man, today's just not the day.

279
00:19:55,477 --> 00:19:57,407
Let's postpone the labor.

280
00:19:57,407 --> 00:20:02,227
Labor pains are a part of the delivery, right?

281
00:20:02,227 --> 00:20:05,877
Mr. Kang! Mr. Kang! Mr. Kang, the woman...

282
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:10,687
- She ran away.
- So what?

283
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:13,237
- Sorry?
- Go and catch her.

284
00:20:14,357 --> 00:20:17,177
Yes, understood.

285
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:44,347
Shit, where the hell is she? How annoying.

286
00:20:47,517 --> 00:20:52,197
There she is. She couldn't even go that far. So aggravating.

287
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:57,677
Gosh, I get all the blame because of her.

288
00:20:59,277 --> 00:21:01,027
Stop right there!

289
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:06,157
Huh? Look at her keep running away.

290
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:14,147
Geez, should I break a limb?

291
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,077
It's a good idea.

292
00:21:18,807 --> 00:21:21,477
There's no reason I can't. Shit...

293
00:21:44,557 --> 00:21:46,427
What the hell is that?

294
00:21:52,607 --> 00:21:55,197
Gosh, shit.

295
00:23:39,597 --> 00:23:42,517
It's okay. They won't follow you anymore.

296
00:23:42,517 --> 00:23:44,347
You can rest assured.

297
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:50,847
It's okay.

298
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:53,117
It's okay, it's okay.

299
00:24:03,497 --> 00:24:06,147
Everything was frightening.

300
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:11,387
That man said he'll raise the child well.

301
00:24:11,387 --> 00:24:13,587
I only trusted his word and...

302
00:24:24,487 --> 00:24:27,077
 

303
00:24:27,077 --> 00:24:29,047
 

304
00:24:37,197 --> 00:24:40,017
I got a call from CEO Jang of Bluebird Foundation.

305
00:24:40,017 --> 00:24:42,177
- Okay.
- Thank you.

306
00:24:46,497 --> 00:24:51,917
 If he took away unmarried single mothers' children to report as other couple's child... 

307
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:57,327
it means finding the child through the initial adopter is also impossible.

308
00:24:57,327 --> 00:24:59,947
Gosh, what do we do now?

309
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:05,597
You said Kang Pil Seung owned more than 30 apartments and buildings, right?

310
00:25:05,597 --> 00:25:07,157
He had a lot.

311
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:11,407
Can you display all the real estate he owns on the map?

312
00:25:11,407 --> 00:25:13,187
Of course.

313
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:29,017
They're all concentrated in big cities.

314
00:25:29,017 --> 00:25:33,407
Do we know which of these places has the least investment value?

315
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,557
The least investment value?

316
00:25:35,557 --> 00:25:37,977
One moment, please.

317
00:25:37,977 --> 00:25:39,877
But why are you looking for that?

318
00:25:39,877 --> 00:25:45,377
If a top real estate investment consultant has a building with low investment value...

319
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:49,177
Find a building with a purpose other than money?

320
00:25:51,127 --> 00:25:53,077
It's this place.

321
00:25:53,077 --> 00:25:56,657
He owns a store in an old commercial building.

322
00:25:57,917 --> 00:26:01,257
The store is a photo studio.

323
00:26:01,257 --> 00:26:02,977
But this place is...

324
00:26:02,977 --> 00:26:06,937
near where we first met Seo Yeon.

325
00:26:19,257 --> 00:26:24,947
 

326
00:27:27,477 --> 00:27:30,957
They're not open for business, but it's been frequently used.

327
00:27:30,957 --> 00:27:33,997
There's no revenue generated from the photo studio.

328
00:27:40,107 --> 00:27:43,387
He shoots these photos for free?

329
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:49,607
It's Seo Yeon's family photo.

330
00:27:49,607 --> 00:27:52,907
 But they're not the people we know. 

331
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:08,367
I finally understand why the adoptive parents didn't recognize Seo Yeon.

332
00:28:14,977 --> 00:28:19,017
 

333
00:28:26,297 --> 00:28:28,757
After the picture comes out, I'll put it in a frame.

334
00:28:28,757 --> 00:28:31,147
So hang it in the most noticeable place at home.

335
00:28:31,147 --> 00:28:33,517
Nothing else is more effective than this for due diligence.

336
00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:36,827
- Okay, we got it.
- Thank you, Mr. Kang.

337
00:28:38,547 --> 00:28:41,077
Go and stand between Mom and Dad.

338
00:28:41,077 --> 00:28:42,467
Okay.

339
00:28:45,787 --> 00:28:48,267
- Are you my mom?
- What's the matter with you?

340
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:50,427
Gosh, how creepy.

341
00:28:50,427 --> 00:28:52,377
What is it?

342
00:28:52,377 --> 00:28:55,117
- No, she just...
- What's wrong?

343
00:28:57,037 --> 00:28:58,687
Hey, Orphan.

344
00:28:58,687 --> 00:29:01,337
You don't have a mom.

345
00:29:01,337 --> 00:29:04,077
What did I say I'll do if you don't listen?

346
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:08,667
I'm sorry.

347
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:11,537
I won't ever do it again.

348
00:29:11,537 --> 00:29:14,067
No, no, no. You can't cry.

349
00:29:14,067 --> 00:29:16,637
You need to smile. Peekaboo!

350
00:29:26,357 --> 00:29:31,307
♫  After a deep breath  ♫

351
00:29:31,307 --> 00:29:34,367
Sir, smile a bit wider. Say, "apartment."

352
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:36,607
Okay, one, two, three!

Seo Yeon had a total of four moms and dads.

356
00:30:00,477 --> 00:30:03,197
Thank you in advance. We trust in you, Mr. Kang.

357
00:30:03,197 --> 00:30:06,177
We'd die happy even with one that's 25 pyeong*.
(1 pyeong = 35.5832 sq. ft.)

358
00:30:06,177 --> 00:30:08,727
- 25 pyeong.
- Yes!

359
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:11,007
- Please take good care of us.
- Sure, don't worry.

360
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:12,617
Take care.

You two are truly desperate, so...

00:30:23,047 --> 00:30:25,477

No way.

368
00:30:43,737 --> 00:30:46,047
How could they do this to a young girl?

He says I'm going to see my mom and dad!

373
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:08,817
Let's go.

374
00:31:08,817 --> 00:31:12,397
Uncle, can't you just take me instead?

375
00:31:12,397 --> 00:31:16,007
You had fun doing it a few times, huh? You need to go somewhere else. Go inside for now.

376
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,487
Get inside!

377
00:31:17,487 --> 00:31:20,617
- So Mang!
- Hurry up and get in!

378
00:31:20,617 --> 00:31:23,057
Uncle!

Aigoo.

00:31:46,457 --> 00:31:48,757
Did you have a bad dream?

385
00:31:48,757 --> 00:31:51,367
I need to find So Mang.

386
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,667
She's probably really scared.

387
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:56,087
That's why you said...

388
00:31:56,087 --> 00:31:58,767
you need to hurry and go hug her.

389
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:02,267
Because you didn't want So Mang to be scared?

390
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:04,097
My baby.

391
00:32:21,077 --> 00:32:24,167
- They'll arrive soon, so set everything up.
- Okay.

392
00:32:25,117 --> 00:32:27,417
Go over there.

393
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:30,567
We'll take a few photos and go, so sit there quietly.

394
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:34,157
Don't needlessly talk to the adults, got it?

395
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:35,877
Sit on that chair.

396
00:32:37,857 --> 00:32:40,567
- Who the hell are you?
- Sit up straight.

397
00:32:43,877 --> 00:32:45,407
Huh?

398
00:32:45,407 --> 00:32:48,647
I didn't hear anything about you taking a photo today.

399
00:32:56,037 --> 00:32:58,147
Are you my dad?

400
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:05,517
The adults are very sorry.

401
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:08,827
What the hell are you doing?

402
00:33:08,827 --> 00:33:10,207
What's with this?

403
00:33:10,207 --> 00:33:11,897
Hey! Who closed this?

404
00:33:11,897 --> 00:33:14,997
You're going to turn around and loudly count from one to ten.

405
00:33:14,997 --> 00:33:17,277
- Whoa.
- Slap!

406
00:33:18,817 --> 00:33:21,267
Close your eyes and cover your ears.

407
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:24,117
You must not look back.

408
00:33:24,117 --> 00:33:27,017
Hey! Open the door!

409
00:33:35,937 --> 00:33:38,567
Who the hell are you?

410
00:33:38,567 --> 00:33:41,127
I'll take a nice photo of you.

411
00:33:41,127 --> 00:33:42,807
Actually...

412
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:47,007
you guys need a beating.

413
00:33:47,007 --> 00:33:49,007
One...

414
00:33:49,007 --> 00:33:51,677
two...

415
00:33:51,677 --> 00:33:53,577
three...

416
00:33:54,587 --> 00:33:56,527
four...

417
00:33:57,547 --> 00:33:59,997
five...

418
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:02,717
six...

419
00:34:02,717 --> 00:34:04,837
seven...

420
00:34:12,537 --> 00:34:15,897
We're filming. We're filming an action movie.

421
00:34:15,897 --> 00:34:18,597
- We're filming an action movie.
- You may keep going.

422
00:34:24,547 --> 00:34:27,177
Where are the other children?

423
00:34:27,177 --> 00:34:29,717
Please spare me...

424
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:34,507
Stop bullshitting.

425
00:34:35,427 --> 00:34:37,067
Where are they?

426
00:34:38,617 --> 00:34:41,597
Nine...

427
00:34:41,597 --> 00:34:43,377
Ten.

428
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:52,767
It was really noisy, huh?

429
00:34:52,767 --> 00:34:55,097
You're good at counting.

430
00:34:55,097 --> 00:34:56,927
Good job.

431
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:25,717
I handed the child to Mr. Jang.

432
00:35:25,717 --> 00:35:29,087
Kang Pil Seung arranged the adoption of children to couples he selected

433
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:30,867
to get them a spot in the apartment.

434
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:33,317
And when everything was over, he'd take those children

435
00:35:33,317 --> 00:35:35,837
and arrange another adoption for new parents.

436
00:35:37,627 --> 00:35:39,787
How could he do something like that?

437
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:42,437
Why go to these lengths?

438
00:35:44,117 --> 00:35:47,567
How could Kang Pil Seung have...

439
00:35:47,567 --> 00:35:50,877
gotten a hold of over 30 apartments?

440
00:35:50,877 --> 00:35:52,607
 

441
00:35:52,607 --> 00:35:53,527
 

442
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:57,277
Customer Service Satisfaction Award...

443
00:36:00,657 --> 00:36:02,777
The transfer of ownership has been completed.

444
00:36:02,777 --> 00:36:06,267
Good, good, good.

445
00:36:08,777 --> 00:36:11,887
Okay, good.

446
00:36:16,817 --> 00:36:18,337
Give it to me.

447
00:36:20,717 --> 00:36:22,957
 

448
00:36:29,247 --> 00:36:30,707
Whoa...

449
00:36:30,707 --> 00:36:33,467
I really love the smell...

450
00:36:33,467 --> 00:36:35,307
of the ink on a contract.

451
00:36:38,767 --> 00:36:41,757
Assistant Choi, it's time for you to expand your house size, right?

452
00:36:41,757 --> 00:36:45,027
- Thank you for your consideration.
- Shucks, we're family.

453
00:36:45,027 --> 00:36:47,687
 Mr. Kang! Mr. Kang! 

454
00:36:50,097 --> 00:36:51,707
 Mr. Kang! Mr. Kang! 

455
00:36:51,707 --> 00:36:55,767
- You can't come in here.
- It's okay. Let them in.

456
00:36:55,767 --> 00:36:57,877
Don't come closer. S-Speak from there.

457
00:36:57,877 --> 00:37:00,927
Mr. Kang, how could you do this to us?

458
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,507
We did everything you told us to do.

459
00:37:02,507 --> 00:37:05,247
We even took a random child and registered her under our family.

460
00:37:05,247 --> 00:37:07,697
And you said to register one more, so we did that, too!

461
00:37:07,697 --> 00:37:10,197
But what do we do if you suddenly take them away from us?

462
00:37:10,197 --> 00:37:12,797
Whoa, you guys are scary people.

463
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,447
What do you mean by take them away from you?

464
00:37:14,447 --> 00:37:17,867
The sale under your name went well, and we even collected the kids.

465
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:21,217
And let's get this straight. I did all the work.

466
00:37:21,217 --> 00:37:25,207
I lent you the money. I even collected the children.

467
00:37:25,207 --> 00:37:27,717
What exactly did you guys do?

468
00:37:27,717 --> 00:37:29,717
If you tell us to pay you back suddenly,

469
00:37:29,717 --> 00:37:31,917
how is that different from taking it all away?

470
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:35,057
I'm simply collecting my money. What's wrong with that?

471
00:37:35,057 --> 00:37:37,647
You don't have any money. Which is why I agreed to take the house instead.

472
00:37:37,647 --> 00:37:38,857
What's wrong with that?

473
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:41,857
I'm going to report you to the police!

474
00:37:43,727 --> 00:37:45,927
Go ahead. Go right ahead.

475
00:37:45,927 --> 00:37:50,097
This is an illegal transfer, so your subscription will go down the drain.

476
00:37:50,097 --> 00:37:53,637
And you people will most likely be arrested.

477
00:37:53,637 --> 00:37:56,617
And you'll still be in debt.

478
00:37:56,617 --> 00:38:00,817
Whoa, can you handle all that?

479
00:38:01,817 --> 00:38:03,797
I told you, didn't I?

480
00:38:03,797 --> 00:38:07,407
That desperation of yours...

481
00:38:07,407 --> 00:38:10,387
Wow! I commend it.

482
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:14,307
Hold on to that desperation and try to land your own house...

483
00:38:14,307 --> 00:38:16,457
Fighting!

484
00:38:16,457 --> 00:38:17,377
- Please leave.
- W-Wait.

485
00:38:17,377 --> 00:38:18,167
- Get out.
- Mr. Kang!

486
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:20,217
- Get out.
- I won't just sit back!

487
00:38:20,217 --> 00:38:22,447
- I'm going to get you!
- So clingy.

488
00:38:22,447 --> 00:38:24,607
Absolutely clingy.

489
00:38:28,147 --> 00:38:29,577
What's this?

490
00:38:31,507 --> 00:38:33,307
What's with this bastard?

491
00:38:33,307 --> 00:38:35,067
What's wrong?

492
00:38:36,887 --> 00:38:38,317
The guys.

493
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:40,987
G-Get the car!

494
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:49,687
Step on it, step on it.

495
00:38:49,687 --> 00:38:51,357
Are you here on tour?

496
00:38:51,357 --> 00:38:53,787
I said, step on it!

497
00:39:23,827 --> 00:39:25,387
 

498
00:39:44,407 --> 00:39:46,467
 

499
00:40:12,747 --> 00:40:16,027
You're supposed to be frozen, Oppa.

500
00:40:18,423 --> 00:40:20,733
Assistant Choi!

501
00:40:20,733 --> 00:40:21,993
Assistant Choi!

502
00:40:21,993 --> 00:40:24,463
I do all the work around here.

503
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:31,223
Gosh.

504
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:41,203
Who are you? Are you the police?

505
00:40:42,203 --> 00:40:44,953
Wait, you're that taxi driver.

506
00:40:46,853 --> 00:40:48,413
You're a dad, aren't you?

507
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:50,383
What's your child's name?

508
00:40:51,453 --> 00:40:55,633
Have you ever felt sorry? Even once?

509
00:40:55,633 --> 00:40:57,073
What?

510
00:40:57,073 --> 00:40:59,703
As you gave them hope of meeting their mom and dad,

511
00:40:59,703 --> 00:41:03,653
and stepped on that hope and repeated the whole thing,

512
00:41:03,653 --> 00:41:06,673
did you ever once...

513
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:09,453
feel bad for them?

514
00:41:09,453 --> 00:41:13,333
I just asked what your child's name is. What's with the prelude?

515
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:17,663
I need to know what your child's name is, so I can at least deliver your last words.

516
00:41:18,713 --> 00:41:21,373
That your dad is dead.

517
00:41:24,953 --> 00:41:26,613
Aigoo.

518
00:41:27,673 --> 00:41:30,723
Wow, so warm.

519
00:41:30,723 --> 00:41:32,903
You're nothing, man.

520
00:41:51,263 --> 00:41:54,113
Get in! Hurry up and get in! Hurry!

521
00:42:02,933 --> 00:42:05,943
- I think there's a fire.
- What?

522
00:42:05,943 --> 00:42:08,343
- Aigoo.
- Yes.

523
00:42:09,533 --> 00:42:11,543
Aigoo, get in.

524
00:42:11,553 --> 00:42:14,253
Get in! We don't have time!

525
00:42:16,913 --> 00:42:20,423
Hyungnim! I think they're taking the kids.

526
00:42:24,913 --> 00:42:26,703
Mr. Kim Do Gi.

527
00:42:26,703 --> 00:42:28,993
 Mr. Kim Do Gi, are you okay? 

528
00:42:30,023 --> 00:42:31,413
 We'll head over there right now. 

529
00:42:31,453 --> 00:42:35,413
No, don't come and just chase Kang Pil Seung. The kids come first.

530
00:42:35,413 --> 00:42:37,273
What are you saying? You're the one in danger right now!

531
00:42:37,273 --> 00:42:39,563
Listen to me!

532
00:42:39,563 --> 00:42:42,753
 Don't lose Kang Pil Seung and chase him. 

533
00:42:42,753 --> 00:42:44,813
 I'll catch up soon. 

534
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:46,193
Mr. Kim Do Gi comes first.

535
00:42:46,193 --> 00:42:48,173
Mr. Kim Do Gi said to chase them.

536
00:42:48,173 --> 00:42:50,453
Mr. Kim Do Gi might die!

537
00:42:50,453 --> 00:42:53,783
Hyungnim, what should we do?

538
00:42:53,783 --> 00:42:56,633
Let's do as we always did.

539
00:42:56,633 --> 00:42:59,153
Let Mr. Kim Do Gi do the strategizing.

540
00:42:59,153 --> 00:43:01,293
Let's chase Kang Pil Seung, Go Eun.

541
00:43:43,843 --> 00:43:45,453
Are you okay?

542
00:43:49,993 --> 00:43:52,303
I'll cover you with this,

543
00:43:52,303 --> 00:43:56,843
so can you hang on a bit, even if it's stuffy?

544
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:58,213
Here.

545
00:44:35,053 --> 00:44:37,423
Are you okay?

546
00:44:37,423 --> 00:44:40,003
Are you hurt anywhere?

547
00:44:40,003 --> 00:44:42,313
Thanks for hanging on.

548
00:44:45,233 --> 00:44:46,743
Let's go.

549
00:45:27,753 --> 00:45:29,703
You didn't lose them, right?

550
00:45:30,823 --> 00:45:33,793
- Mr. Kim Do Gi!
- See? I told you he'd be fine.

551
00:45:33,793 --> 00:45:35,903
I'll catch up soon.

552
00:45:50,493 --> 00:45:52,893
Manager Lim isn't picking up. He's not.

553
00:45:52,893 --> 00:45:54,493
Gosh.

554
00:45:55,573 --> 00:45:57,403
We should move.

555
00:45:58,913 --> 00:46:00,173
Be quiet.

556
00:46:00,173 --> 00:46:01,973
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

557
00:46:01,973 --> 00:46:05,273
Be quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

558
00:46:10,863 --> 00:46:11,943
 

559
00:46:13,603 --> 00:46:16,503
Seo Yeon had a hematoma on her head.

560
00:46:16,503 --> 00:46:18,113
According to the doctors,

561
00:46:18,113 --> 00:46:22,243
it's due to repeated trauma before the wound could heal.

562
00:46:22,243 --> 00:46:24,563
 She'll probably have a scar. 

563
00:46:25,463 --> 00:46:26,853
Shit.

564
00:46:36,843 --> 00:46:40,053
 Please find So Mang. 

565
00:47:01,523 --> 00:47:02,993
 

566
00:47:08,593 --> 00:47:10,923
Something's going on.

567
00:47:16,553 --> 00:47:18,363
Huh? Aigoo, aigoo.

568
00:47:18,363 --> 00:47:20,283
Just a bit...

569
00:47:20,283 --> 00:47:22,813
Get off first. Get off first.

570
00:47:41,043 --> 00:47:43,483
- The children aren't here.
- The children?

571
00:47:43,483 --> 00:47:45,153
They're gone.

572
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:48,593
He must've hidden them nearby. Let's split up and find them.

573
00:47:58,043 --> 00:47:59,593
What now?

574
00:47:59,593 --> 00:48:01,463
Go check it out!

575
00:48:10,373 --> 00:48:12,503
 Mr. Kang! 

576
00:48:12,503 --> 00:48:14,093
What the?

577
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:21,513
Huh?

578
00:48:25,803 --> 00:48:27,963
Y-You bastard. What the hell?

579
00:48:27,963 --> 00:48:29,423
Huh?

580
00:48:40,593 --> 00:48:43,243
Kids! Kids!

581
00:48:47,203 --> 00:48:49,153
Where are the kids?

582
00:48:49,153 --> 00:48:51,253
I don't know, bastard.

583
00:48:57,653 --> 00:49:00,033
Where are the kids?

584
00:49:02,613 --> 00:49:04,563
Kids?

585
00:49:04,563 --> 00:49:06,183
Kids.

586
00:49:20,693 --> 00:49:22,003
Kids!

587
00:49:22,003 --> 00:49:23,553
Kids-

588
00:49:30,443 --> 00:49:32,413
Are they there?

589
00:49:32,413 --> 00:49:35,943
- They're not.
- Where the hell did he hide them?

590
00:49:38,423 --> 00:49:39,953
Tell me.

591
00:49:41,023 --> 00:49:42,573
If I die...

592
00:49:43,683 --> 00:49:46,213
those brats will die, too.

593
00:50:09,353 --> 00:50:13,573
Kill me! Try to kill me, you bastard. Go ahead!

594
00:50:13,573 --> 00:50:15,333
Come on!

595
00:50:16,503 --> 00:50:18,833
This is how to save the kids.

596
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:21,093
This is how to keep them from dying.

597
00:50:21,093 --> 00:50:23,473
This is why I love kids.

598
00:50:23,473 --> 00:50:27,423
I protect those brats, and those brats protect me.

599
00:50:27,423 --> 00:50:28,953
Win-win.

600
00:50:28,953 --> 00:50:30,943
You know what that is?

601
00:50:47,903 --> 00:50:50,083
Unni...

602
00:50:55,363 --> 00:50:57,103
If you...

603
00:50:57,103 --> 00:51:00,213
happen to die here right now,

604
00:51:00,213 --> 00:51:02,983
then I'll let those brats live.

605
00:51:02,983 --> 00:51:04,803
But if you happen to dodge,

606
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:08,853
every single one of those brats will die.

607
00:51:10,703 --> 00:51:12,313
Okay?

608
00:51:38,364 --> 00:51:41,944
 Mr. Kim Do Gi, we found the kids. 

609
00:51:45,414 --> 00:51:46,734
You blocked me?

610
00:51:46,734 --> 00:51:48,694
Let go, you bastard.

611
00:51:48,694 --> 00:51:50,284
You blocked me?

612
00:52:04,854 --> 00:52:08,854
Whoa, this is one crazy bastard.

613
00:52:08,854 --> 00:52:11,754
You want all those kids to die?

614
00:52:15,714 --> 00:52:17,094
What?

615
00:52:18,824 --> 00:52:20,274
Wait...

616
00:52:20,274 --> 00:52:21,914
You found them?

617
00:52:31,594 --> 00:52:33,104
 
What the hell?

618
00:52:33,104 --> 00:52:34,914
Where is this?

619
00:52:37,044 --> 00:52:39,954
It stinks! This is nasty!

620
00:52:43,634 --> 00:52:47,194
What do you think? Do you like it here?

621
00:52:47,194 --> 00:52:50,244
I thought about which house would be perfect for you,

622
00:52:50,244 --> 00:52:51,794
but I could only think of this place.

623
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:53,664
If you need anything, take a good look.

624
00:52:53,664 --> 00:52:55,984
You'll find almost anything here.

625
00:52:58,694 --> 00:53:02,524
Okay! I'll give you a house.

626
00:53:02,524 --> 00:53:05,264
On the VIP floor with a Han River view near the subway stations!

627
00:53:05,264 --> 00:53:08,064
You know it's not easy in Korea, right?

628
00:53:08,064 --> 00:53:10,244
Look here, Taxi Driver.

629
00:53:10,244 --> 00:53:12,804
You're Korean. You need a house of your own.

630
00:53:12,804 --> 00:53:15,164
I'll get you a big, fat, nice one.

631
00:53:15,164 --> 00:53:17,304
So hurry and untie me.

632
00:53:17,304 --> 00:53:19,524
I don't think you have a house like that.

633
00:53:19,524 --> 00:53:21,654
What are you saying? I have countless houses.

634
00:53:21,654 --> 00:53:23,524
Untie me, come on.

635
00:53:33,514 --> 00:53:36,454
They organized everything so nicely, so we could take them.

636
00:53:36,454 --> 00:53:40,094
- Don't forget to grab his legal seal.
- I'll give you one last chance.

637
00:53:40,094 --> 00:53:44,354
If you answer my question honestly, I'll get you out of here.

638
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:46,964
- Really?
- I promise.

639
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:51,884
Okay, I'll truthfully tell you everything.

640
00:53:56,224 --> 00:53:58,224
Did you ever once...

641
00:53:58,224 --> 00:54:02,274
feel bad for all those children?

642
00:54:02,274 --> 00:54:06,934
Why in the world! Why the hell are you curious about that now!

643
00:54:06,934 --> 00:54:09,744
Tell me, honestly.

644
00:54:10,824 --> 00:54:14,394
Those kids were abandoned anyway.

645
00:54:14,394 --> 00:54:19,084
It's nice to use those abandoned kids where I need them since I fed and sheltered them.

646
00:54:19,084 --> 00:54:23,924
There's no better way to accumulate points. Each kid is worth significant points.

647
00:54:23,924 --> 00:54:27,634
If you just use a few kids, a house drops from the sky.

648
00:54:27,634 --> 00:54:29,324
Would you skip out on that chance?

649
00:54:29,324 --> 00:54:31,674
Would you not take advantage?

650
00:54:33,194 --> 00:54:35,624
What about the wounds those kids will carry?

651
00:54:35,624 --> 00:54:39,754
What does that matter? They won't remember it anyway.

652
00:54:41,504 --> 00:54:43,294
I told you truthfully,

653
00:54:43,294 --> 00:54:46,444
so untie me now.

654
00:54:46,444 --> 00:54:48,154
I don't want to.

655
00:54:48,174 --> 00:54:51,634
You'll never be able to take even a single step out of here.

656
00:54:51,634 --> 00:54:52,994
out of here.

657
00:54:52,994 --> 00:54:56,594
What do you mean? You said you'd let me go!

658
00:54:56,594 --> 00:54:58,434
Did you keep your word?

659
00:54:58,434 --> 00:55:03,324
Your countless promises to the kids, saying you'll let them meet their parents.

660
00:55:03,324 --> 00:55:05,454
Did you ever once keep your word?

661
00:55:05,454 --> 00:55:09,084
- Damn it. Sir...
- I guess...

662
00:55:09,084 --> 00:55:12,624
you won't remember anything after today, so what does it matter?

663
00:55:12,624 --> 00:55:15,854
What do you mean? What bullshit-

664
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,264
Hey!

665
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:22,984
Congratulations. This house is yours.

666
00:55:26,124 --> 00:55:28,674
W-What are you... Stop!

667
00:55:35,504 --> 00:55:38,124
Don't do this!

668
00:55:39,394 --> 00:55:41,064
Hey!

669
00:55:41,064 --> 00:55:43,224
Wait, don't go!

670
00:55:43,224 --> 00:55:44,954
Don't go!

671
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:17,114
Wow.

672
00:56:17,114 --> 00:56:20,674
My favorite squash juice.

673
00:56:20,674 --> 00:56:22,384
There's such a thing as squash juice?

674
00:56:22,384 --> 00:56:24,264
You're the one who made it for me.

675
00:56:25,344 --> 00:56:28,084
Mr. Kim Do Gi, you're going to call in, right?

676
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:29,734
Yes.

677
00:56:29,734 --> 00:56:33,574
Then before you do so, shall we get divorced first?

678
00:56:34,844 --> 00:56:37,654
It's a shame, but shall we?

679
00:56:37,654 --> 00:56:41,834
Sounds good. Divorce by agreement. Bam-bam-bam!

680
00:56:41,834 --> 00:56:43,484
Good?

681
00:57:00,564 --> 00:57:02,704
Do Gi hyungnim.

682
00:57:02,704 --> 00:57:04,764
You're here early.

683
00:57:04,764 --> 00:57:07,564
Or are you... leaving work?

684
00:57:07,564 --> 00:57:09,104
Leaving work.

685
00:57:09,104 --> 00:57:12,204
I'm jealous. I'm just getting to work.

686
00:57:12,204 --> 00:57:15,064
Vehicle number 5678 ready for dispatch.

687
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:17,384
Sure, drive safely.

688
00:57:17,384 --> 00:57:19,104
Get a good rest.

689
00:57:22,904 --> 00:57:27,614
♫  Before it's late, before it's too late  ♫

690
00:57:27,614 --> 00:57:35,094
♫  Don't take the stairs, take the elevator  ♫

691
00:57:46,154 --> 00:57:53,874
♫  Don't take the stairs, take the elevator  ♫

692
00:58:21,374 --> 00:58:24,604
- Just complete seven rides today.
- Understood, sir.

693
00:59:08,254 --> 00:59:09,704
 

694
00:59:09,704 --> 00:59:11,054
 

695
00:59:12,804 --> 00:59:14,454
 

696
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:26,074
 We recently learned that an organization of illegal brokers who arranged 

697
00:59:26,074 --> 00:59:28,534
 false adoptions and dissolutions have been caught. 

698
00:59:28,534 --> 00:59:31,704
 This time, we're delivering heartwarming news. 

699
00:59:31,704 --> 00:59:35,944
 It's becoming hot news that an anonymous contributor 

700
00:59:35,944 --> 00:59:39,334
 donated a large sum to a children's institution. 

701
00:59:39,334 --> 00:59:40,564
Yeah.

702
00:59:40,564 --> 00:59:43,284
Mr. Jang, you contributed everything? Even our taxi fare?

703
00:59:43,284 --> 00:59:47,774
These kids are growing, so they need to eat a lot of good food.

704
00:59:47,774 --> 00:59:51,644
A lot of money goes into raising them until they become adults.

705
00:59:51,644 --> 00:59:53,494
Okay?

706
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:15,114
- You came so far.
- It's such a great neighborhood.

707
01:00:15,114 --> 01:00:16,654
Grandpa!

708
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:19,374
Aigoo, Seo Yeon. Have you been well?

709
01:00:19,374 --> 01:00:21,154
I missed you, Grandpa.

710
01:00:21,154 --> 01:00:24,194
I missed you, too.

711
01:00:24,194 --> 01:00:25,994
Happy birthday.

712
01:00:25,994 --> 01:00:28,824
So Mang, you should greet Grandpa.

713
01:00:28,824 --> 01:00:30,114
Hello.

714
01:00:30,114 --> 01:00:34,344
Aigoo, you must be So Mang.

715
01:00:34,344 --> 01:00:36,484
Hello, nice to meet you.

716
01:00:36,484 --> 01:00:39,364
We waited to blow out the candles until you came.

717
01:00:39,364 --> 01:00:43,064
You did? Shall we hurry up and celebrate your birthday together?

718
01:00:43,064 --> 01:00:45,784
Okay, okay. Let's go.

719
01:00:45,784 --> 01:00:47,324
Okay.

720
01:00:58,954 --> 01:01:03,124
 

721
01:01:06,154 --> 01:01:07,894
Why did we come here?

722
01:01:07,894 --> 01:01:09,614
Go Eun, aren't you looking for a house?

723
01:01:09,614 --> 01:01:12,614
Jin Eon and I picked this place with great care.

724
01:01:12,614 --> 01:01:15,454
It's my house. Why would you two...

725
01:01:15,454 --> 01:01:18,264
The CF model of this place is very famous.

726
01:01:18,264 --> 01:01:21,434
- Which famous person?
- Someone slightly more handsome than me.

727
01:01:21,434 --> 01:01:25,044
Oh, that slightly more handsome person?

728
01:01:25,044 --> 01:01:28,044
Well, I'd love to live somewhere like this,

729
01:01:28,044 --> 01:01:31,414
- but it's still a bit too pricey for me.
- Come on, Go Eun.

730
01:01:31,414 --> 01:01:35,064
You don't buy a house. You live in it.
("Buy" and "live" sound the same in Korean.]

731
01:01:35,064 --> 01:01:37,114
What are you saying?

732
01:01:37,114 --> 01:01:38,824
Let's go. I'm hungry.

733
01:01:38,824 --> 01:01:41,814
That won't do. Let's go, let's go.

734
01:01:43,394 --> 01:01:46,874
This place does look nice.

735
01:01:48,024 --> 01:01:50,324
What will you do? He took our house right under our noses!

736
01:01:50,324 --> 01:01:51,384
Damn it!

737
01:01:51,384 --> 01:01:54,764
- Be quiet.
- Are you just going to sit there?

738
01:01:56,804 --> 01:01:59,444
Who is it at this hour?

739
01:02:06,314 --> 01:02:07,874
Who are you?

740
01:02:07,874 --> 01:02:12,074
Seo Yeon has two wounds that haven't healed.

741
01:02:12,074 --> 01:02:14,754
You're going to explain to me...

742
01:02:18,004 --> 01:02:21,014
how she got those wounds.

743
01:02:30,854 --> 01:02:32,794
What is this, huh?

744
01:02:32,794 --> 01:02:35,384
I have over 33 houses! 33 houses!

745
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:37,634
Assistant Choi! Assistant Choi, take care of this!

746
01:02:37,634 --> 01:02:41,024
Who are you treating like a beggar? Take care of them...

747
01:02:43,154 --> 01:02:45,104
Who are you treating...

748
01:03:19,464 --> 01:03:21,174
Whoa.

749
01:03:21,174 --> 01:03:24,264
I-I didn't do it.

750
01:03:24,264 --> 01:03:26,544
I can explain.

751
01:03:26,544 --> 01:03:28,594
That taxi-driving bastard...

752
01:03:28,594 --> 01:03:31,394
That bastard stole everything!

753
01:03:42,354 --> 01:03:44,454
Taxi driver?

754
01:03:46,054 --> 01:03:48,144
Can you tell me...

755
01:03:49,874 --> 01:03:52,454
that story in more detail?

756
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,600
 

757
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:09,100


758
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:12,200
♫  Take me back, it's over!  ♫

759
01:04:12,234 --> 01:04:16,034
♫  Put the pain that's been trapping you behind  ♫

760
01:04:16,034 --> 01:04:20,054
♫  And I'll fight, fight for you  ♫

761
01:04:20,054 --> 01:04:27,664
 

762
01:04:27,664 --> 01:04:31,194
 There's the priest at church. Then there's the father. 

763
01:04:31,194 --> 01:04:33,414
 No, no, no! 

764
01:04:33,414 --> 01:04:36,424
 You should never go to a place like a hospital. 

765
01:04:36,424 --> 01:04:37,224
 Unni! 

766
01:04:37,224 --> 01:04:38,504
 You can't go in. 

767
01:04:38,504 --> 01:04:41,734
 You're simply stalking her in the name of the family. 

768
01:04:41,734 --> 01:04:43,964
 Please help my unni. 

769
01:04:43,964 --> 01:04:45,284
 Is it painful? 

770
01:04:45,284 --> 01:04:48,104
 This is the will of god! 

771
01:04:48,104 --> 01:04:49,544
 You can tell it's a cult at one glance. 

772
01:04:49,544 --> 01:04:51,654
 Mr. Park, please hit me five times. 

773
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:53,694
 Always watch out for what's above your head. 

774
01:04:53,694 --> 01:04:55,654
 You're fated to die early. 

775
01:04:55,654 --> 01:04:58,154
 You have managed to stay alive. 

776
01:04:58,154 --> 01:05:00,724
 Mr. On, what on earth are you doing there? Pretend play? 

777
01:05:00,724 --> 01:05:02,234
 What do you mean, pretend play? 

778
01:05:02,234 --> 01:05:04,564
 They might already be watching us. 

779
01:05:04,564 --> 01:05:07,004
 From closer than we think.
