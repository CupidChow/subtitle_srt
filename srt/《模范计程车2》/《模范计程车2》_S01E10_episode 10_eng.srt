1
00:00:26,257 --> 00:00:32,047
 

2
00:00:33,127 --> 00:00:37,057
You'll be taken to the OR now.
 

3
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:48,580
 !

4
00:00:48,587 --> 00:00:51,357
I'll have the same condition Han Soo Ryeon had.

5
00:00:51,357 --> 00:00:53,787
What if they accidentally operate on you?

6
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,497
You'd be put to sleep first.

7
00:00:55,497 --> 00:00:59,337
If that happens, you should watch for me.

8
00:00:59,337 --> 00:01:03,157
Find out whether it's crime scene or not.

9
00:01:03,157 --> 00:01:06,737
I upgraded it to a super-wide lens. It'd no longer have blind spots.

10
00:01:06,737 --> 00:01:09,587
But the camera detector must still be there.

11
00:01:09,587 --> 00:01:11,557
Turn it on three minutes after I go in.

12
00:01:11,557 --> 00:01:14,307
If it goes off later, they'd think it's a malfunction.

13
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,347
You'd make them turn it off themselves?

14
00:01:16,347 --> 00:01:19,237
It'll smell a bit bad for a second.

15
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,400
 

16
00:01:33,417 --> 00:01:35,697
Open your eyes, sir.

17
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,347
Anesthesia is complete.

18
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:46,327
No one noticed that the patient was wearing glasses?

19
00:01:46,327 --> 00:01:48,057
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:54,557
Geez, what's going on? I waited long enough.

21
00:02:00,447 --> 00:02:03,067
Why is that going off again?

22
00:02:12,307 --> 00:02:15,137
I thought I was going to die.

23
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:19,687
Let's get started, Dr. Gong.

24
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:26,217
Dr. Gong?

25
00:02:35,437 --> 00:02:39,807
I'll be inside. Give me a call if anything happens.

26
00:02:42,937 --> 00:02:44,507
What the?

27
00:02:44,507 --> 00:02:47,357
Where did this person come from?

28
00:03:15,117 --> 00:03:17,767
Is he performing the surgery?

29
00:03:31,537 --> 00:03:33,297
Yes, this is the OR.

30
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:36,907
 Patient Park Dong Sung is outside complaining about when his surgery will begin. 

31
00:03:36,907 --> 00:03:40,317
Patient Park Dong Sung is currently in the middle of surgery.

32
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:44,007
 Sorry? The patient is currently waiting outside. 

33
00:03:53,427 --> 00:03:56,057
What do you mean we have the wrong patient?

34
00:03:56,057 --> 00:03:58,947
I'm not sure... either...

35
00:04:21,757 --> 00:04:26,077
Transfer the patient inside to a room and administer a banana bag.

36
00:04:26,077 --> 00:04:27,377
All right.

37
00:04:31,327 --> 00:04:36,747
 

38
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:40,477
 

39
00:04:44,837 --> 00:04:47,497
How do you feel? Are you all right? Any pain?

40
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:51,487
Any preexisting pain would be all the better after that deep sleep.

41
00:04:55,677 --> 00:04:58,007
The OR layout is different from its blueprint.

42
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:01,107
There's a back door that was never there.

43
00:05:01,107 --> 00:05:03,197
Dr. Gong...

44
00:05:03,197 --> 00:05:07,147
There's no way anyone could find out about his existence from outside the OR.

45
00:05:07,147 --> 00:05:11,047
I think that's what they intended, and they changed the layout.

46
00:05:11,047 --> 00:05:13,977
We'd never have known if we hadn't gone inside ourselves.

47
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:17,147
In that regard, Mr. Kim Do Gi, I commend you.

48
00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:20,417
You're the one who saw it. I was sleeping.

49
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:22,207
In that regard,

50
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:24,287
Go Eun, I commend you.

51
00:05:31,927 --> 00:05:34,467
You were admitted as an emergency last night.

52
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,077
For a motor vehicle accident?

53
00:05:37,077 --> 00:05:42,537
Yes. This place was a bit closer to my house.

54
00:05:42,537 --> 00:05:46,197
Wow, you're walking perfectly well.

55
00:05:47,407 --> 00:05:51,897
With your diagnosis, you should be in a lot of discomforts.

56
00:05:53,717 --> 00:05:58,037
No wonder... it hurt so much.

57
00:05:58,037 --> 00:06:00,687
I think there was a computer error.

58
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:03,587
As the director, I give you my apologies.

59
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:08,527
But our hospital specializes in surgery,

60
00:06:08,527 --> 00:06:10,667
so we don't take MVA patients.

61
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,697
You should transfer to a different hospital.

62
00:06:12,697 --> 00:06:17,007
You're walking without a problem, so being discharged is even better.

63
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:19,177
But I'm in pain.

64
00:06:19,177 --> 00:06:22,857
- Let's get you discharged.
- I'm really in pain.

65
00:06:22,857 --> 00:06:24,417
I know you're not in pain.

66
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,317
I'm serious!

67
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:31,527
Have you been stabbed with a knife in the OR?

68
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:34,687
It really hurts! A lot!

69
00:06:35,977 --> 00:06:39,937
So are you asking me to give you settlement money?

70
00:06:39,937 --> 00:06:43,317
No way. I'm not a bad person.

71
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:46,507
I just want to get treated.

72
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,647
All right.

73
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:53,117
What should we prescribe Patient Kim Do Gi?

74
00:06:53,117 --> 00:06:55,627
Just administer a bunch of routine injections.

75
00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:57,537
Okay.

76
00:06:57,537 --> 00:06:59,167
Aigoo...

77
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:01,637
Aigoo.

78
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:15,187
Time for your injections.

79
00:07:16,997 --> 00:07:20,117
Nurse, Patient Kim Do Gi isn't in his bed.

80
00:07:20,117 --> 00:07:22,997
- Just pretend he was never there.
- Sorry?

81
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:26,347
He's a nylon patient*.
(Patients who are faking illness.)

82
00:07:26,347 --> 00:07:28,017
Oh, a nylon patient...

83
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:19,167
 
Meditopia.

84
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:22,097
Meditopia...

85
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:31,387
It's a domestic medical device and supplies company.

86
00:09:24,207 --> 00:09:25,567
Yes, Director.

87
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:27,857
Yes.

88
00:09:27,857 --> 00:09:30,187
I'll be right there.

89
00:10:19,207 --> 00:10:22,937
Meditopia Medical Sales Team Manager, Gong Su Ho.

90
00:10:22,937 --> 00:10:25,847
This just proved he's not a medical doctor.

91
00:10:36,707 --> 00:10:39,117
No way...

92
00:10:39,117 --> 00:10:41,877
Are those all surgery dates?

93
00:10:52,477 --> 00:10:54,717
Aren't you curious?

94
00:10:54,717 --> 00:10:59,147
If the person performing the most surgeries in this region is Director Ahn Young Sook,

95
00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:00,847
or...

96
00:11:03,677 --> 00:11:06,137
if it's Manager Gong Su Ho?

97
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:18,587
 

98
00:11:18,587 --> 00:11:23,857
Is this symbiotic relationship what you call the crocodile and plover bird?

99
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:27,427
If she couldn't do the job, she could've just recruited a different doctor who could.

100
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:30,067
Why ask a salesman without a license to perform proxy surgery?

101
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:31,737
It's because of money.

102
00:11:31,737 --> 00:11:33,777
Doctors' incomes are costly.

103
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,437
If she could get a salesman to do the work,

104
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:38,697
that's not exactly cheap, either.

105
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,897
Please take a look at this.

106
00:11:45,357 --> 00:11:48,667
I didn't realize it since Director Ahn Young Sook had changed her name.

107
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,187
But I discovered a funny fact.

108
00:11:53,207 --> 00:11:57,567
 
She changed her name from Ahn Ji Eun to Ahn Young Sook four years ago.

109
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,787
A change of name?

110
00:11:58,787 --> 00:12:01,517
So I looked up her previous name,

111
00:12:01,517 --> 00:12:04,637
and she used to run a private hospital in the countryside.

112
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:07,977
 

113
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:13,367
She did the same thing back then and even got fined.

114
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:16,167
Wow, she's a total repeat offender.

115
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:19,167
Shouldn't they revoke her medical license for this?

116
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:22,017
Her medical license was only suspended for six months.

117
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:24,847
- What?
- It was only suspended for six months?

118
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:26,177
She could resume her medical career?

119
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:31,027
What do you think Director Ahn Ji Eun did after her suspension was lifted?

120
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:35,207
She changed her name from Ahn Ji Eun to Ahn Young Sook and erased her past.

121
00:12:35,207 --> 00:12:36,967
Bingo.

122
00:12:40,697 --> 00:12:44,907
Then she founded this hospital and continued to do what she did.

123
00:12:44,907 --> 00:12:49,197
She let a salesman perform surgery and ran the hospital like a factory, and they call her "nice."

124
00:12:49,197 --> 00:12:54,137
The court ruling ended up planting more confidence in her.

125
00:13:02,117 --> 00:13:04,467
I'm sorry I'm late, Director Ahn.

126
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:06,787
Was there traffic?

127
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,407
Or you didn't want to come?

128
00:13:08,407 --> 00:13:12,117
Oh, no, Director. I ran over as soon as possible.

129
00:13:18,927 --> 00:13:22,277
If you need anything, please look for Cha Eun Woo at the bar.

130
00:13:22,277 --> 00:13:24,337
Please enjoy your time.

131
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:35,657
We have seven OP cases the day after tomorrow,

132
00:13:35,657 --> 00:13:38,277
so you'll have to come earlier than usual.

133
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:40,587
Yes, well...

134
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:44,547
I was going to talk to you about that. That's my mother's memorial day,

135
00:13:44,547 --> 00:13:48,967
so I don't think I can perform any surgeries that day, Director Ahn.

136
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:50,927
Then don't come.

137
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:52,527
I'll look elsewhere.

138
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:55,977
- Wait, that's not what I meant-
- If that's not the case,

139
00:13:55,977 --> 00:14:00,097
then should I just bill you for the cost of seven surgeries?

140
00:14:00,097 --> 00:14:02,767
You know I don't have that kind of money-

141
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:05,447
Then you're telling me to just accept the losses?

142
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:07,857
I'm disappointed in you, Manager Gong.

143
00:14:07,857 --> 00:14:13,007
This is a small field. You know better than I do what happens once rumors spread.

144
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:15,267
Yes, I-I was being rash.

145
00:14:15,267 --> 00:14:17,217
I'll make it on time the day after tomorrow.

146
00:14:17,217 --> 00:14:20,097
People like us...

147
00:14:20,097 --> 00:14:23,197
need to prioritize surgeries.

148
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:24,797
Right?

149
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:27,287
Yes, you're right.

150
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:32,657
It's all thanks to you turning down other companies and using our company's equipment.

151
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:34,027
Thank you, Director Ahn.

152
00:14:34,027 --> 00:14:38,437
We must become more famous than we are now.

153
00:14:38,437 --> 00:14:41,407
Our hospital will become more famous, too.

154
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:46,377
Then I'll make you the head of administration.

155
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,187
- On that note, drinks are on me tonight.
- It's fine.

156
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:51,807
I brought the company card.

157
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:55,677
If you do this every time, what if your boss summons you?

158
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:57,837
It's all right, Director Ahn.

159
00:14:57,837 --> 00:15:00,997
All right, let's get going now.

160
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,637
- Time to earn money.
- Sorry?

161
00:15:05,637 --> 00:15:07,207
We had one today, too?

162
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,997
We only have two cases today.

163
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:14,407
Oh, how silly of me. I guess I didn't tell you.

164
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:16,917
Pack your equipment from your office and wait.

165
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,517
I'll send you a car, so ride that over.

166
00:15:19,517 --> 00:15:23,087
And pay for two more whiskey bottles on your way out.

167
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:24,977
See you later.

168
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:34,507
She used another company's funds to drink.

169
00:15:34,507 --> 00:15:36,557
No wonder bars didn't come up on her card history.

170
00:15:36,557 --> 00:15:39,387
Now we're certain Director Ahn Young Sook isn't the one

171
00:15:39,387 --> 00:15:41,817
performing the most surgeries in the region.

172
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:44,117
But if what we just heard is correct,

173
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:47,177
those people are on their way to perform surgery drunk again.

174
00:15:47,177 --> 00:15:50,037
Exactly. They shouldn't go.

175
00:15:50,037 --> 00:15:51,877
Never.

176
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:05,387
Gosh, she could just call him a taxi. She always makes me come.

177
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:08,337
That cheapskate director.

178
00:16:09,547 --> 00:16:10,837
Whoa...

179
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:13,527
So sleek.

180
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:19,207
Fine, I'll hold back for you, Baby.

181
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:22,097
What's this?

182
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:25,447
Who... Who did this to you, Baby?

183
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:27,947
Gosh, how dirty.

184
00:16:30,627 --> 00:16:33,477
Why isn't he coming down?

185
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:49,647
Hey, you bastard!

186
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:53,247
You bastard! You're dead when I catch you.

187
00:17:15,037 --> 00:17:17,647
Manager Gong Su Ho, I'm here to pick you up.

188
00:17:17,647 --> 00:17:19,317
Please get in.

189
00:17:32,887 --> 00:17:35,297
I'd appreciate it if you made that call later.

190
00:17:35,297 --> 00:17:37,767
I have a few questions to ask you.

191
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,227
Sorry?

192
00:17:50,717 --> 00:17:52,787
W-Who are you?

193
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:02,207
You know Patient Han Soo Ryeon, right?

194
00:18:04,157 --> 00:18:07,577
Seeing how you recognize her name, I guess you did perform her surgery.

195
00:18:07,577 --> 00:18:11,387
P-Please don't kill me.

196
00:18:11,387 --> 00:18:14,757
Tell me everything about what happened...

197
00:18:15,707 --> 00:18:17,827
in the OR that day.

198
00:18:21,257 --> 00:18:23,517
 

199
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:27,477
 

200
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:35,737
 

201
00:18:35,737 --> 00:18:37,577
Give me the gauze.

202
00:18:42,717 --> 00:18:45,207
W-What's happening?

203
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:49,577
Patient Han Soo Ryeon's BP is dropping rapidly.

204
00:18:49,577 --> 00:18:52,017
We can't stop the bleeding.

205
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:53,977
Notify Director Ahn. Hurry!

206
00:18:53,977 --> 00:18:55,877
Get me some gauze!

207
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:00,087
This is the OR. Please call Director Ahn.

208
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:02,327
Get me more gauze! Gauze!

209
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:04,517
Give me more gauze. Hurry.

210
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:08,827
What is it, huh?

211
00:19:08,827 --> 00:19:11,087
She's suddenly hemorrhaging...

212
00:19:11,087 --> 00:19:12,907
I think I messed up.

213
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:14,967
Okay, move aside.

214
00:19:26,537 --> 00:19:29,557
Why are her veins so ugly?

215
00:19:32,987 --> 00:19:34,547
Transfuse more blood.

216
00:19:34,547 --> 00:19:36,187
We used all the blood we had prepared...

217
00:19:36,187 --> 00:19:38,927
- Then go and get some more.
- Okay.

218
00:19:53,607 --> 00:19:55,137
 

219
00:19:59,477 --> 00:20:02,357
Spread it more. A little more.

220
00:20:02,357 --> 00:20:03,817
Clamp.

221
00:20:06,117 --> 00:20:08,627
Spread it. More.

222
00:20:09,637 --> 00:20:12,397
Okay... What the hell?

223
00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:23,377
Close her up.

224
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:29,707
The surgery's over, so sew her up.

225
00:20:29,707 --> 00:20:33,597
Dr. Gong, can I see you for a moment?

226
00:21:02,347 --> 00:21:03,957
Have a glass.

227
00:21:03,957 --> 00:21:06,377
I-I'm fine.

228
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:10,857
I said, drink.

229
00:21:12,277 --> 00:21:13,907
O-Okay.

230
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:28,487
It was the side effect of the anesthesia.

231
00:21:29,477 --> 00:21:30,907
Sorry?

232
00:21:30,907 --> 00:21:34,647
It's a misfortunate event that can happen to anyone.

233
00:21:34,647 --> 00:21:39,847
Just forget about what happened today and just make it on time for tomorrow's surgeries.

234
00:21:42,257 --> 00:21:45,777
You understand what I'm saying, right?

235
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:48,927
Yes...

236
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:51,637
Y-Yes, Director Ahn.

237
00:21:51,637 --> 00:21:53,247
Drink up.

238
00:21:57,277 --> 00:21:58,597
 

239
00:22:01,017 --> 00:22:02,797
Soo Ryeon.

240
00:22:02,797 --> 00:22:05,877
Aigoo... Aigoo, Soo Ryeon.

241
00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:09,917
Patient Han Soo Ryeon's surgery went well.

242
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:12,037
Thank you.

243
00:22:12,037 --> 00:22:15,267
She'll be in the recovery room, and when she wakes up,

244
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,047
we'll transfer her to her room.

245
00:22:17,047 --> 00:22:19,047
Thank you, Doctor Ahn.

246
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,717
Yes, yes.

247
00:22:58,507 --> 00:23:03,627
You kept silent even while watching her father protest for over a year.

248
00:23:03,627 --> 00:23:06,017
Even though you were aware of everything.

249
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:08,797
What difference would it make if I hadn't kept silent?

250
00:23:09,787 --> 00:23:12,327
My predecessor...

251
00:23:12,327 --> 00:23:15,287
do you know what happened to him after confessing out of guilt?

252
00:23:16,287 --> 00:23:19,147
He got fired from the company.

253
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:23,467
No one in the same industry will accept him because he's on the blacklist. So...

254
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:28,057
So how could I?

255
00:23:28,057 --> 00:23:30,797
I'll probably face the same fate.

256
00:23:32,067 --> 00:23:34,997
I'm better off doing as I'm ordered.

257
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,617
That's the problem.

258
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:41,757
You think you're innocent if you're just doing as you're told.

259
00:23:41,757 --> 00:23:45,677
"Since you don't have power. Since there's nothing you can do."

260
00:23:45,677 --> 00:23:47,807
"Since it won't work out in the end."

261
00:23:47,807 --> 00:23:50,347
"Let's just join forces."

262
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:56,157
"Since it won't happen to me anyway."

263
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:05,637
That attitude of yours is what makes someone like Ahn Young Sook more vigorous.

264
00:24:10,527 --> 00:24:13,397
In the end, you're an accomplice.

265
00:24:31,907 --> 00:24:33,917
I-I'm sorry, Director Ahn.

266
00:24:33,917 --> 00:24:36,807
Some bastard hit my baby-

267
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:40,547
- Hit my car and ran.
- And did you catch that bastard?

268
00:24:40,547 --> 00:24:42,047
No.

269
00:24:43,337 --> 00:24:45,417
You still can't reach Manager Gong?

270
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,447
His phone has been off since earlier.

271
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:51,327
I'll change the medical supplies company, so bring me a list.

272
00:24:51,327 --> 00:24:53,617
Then what about Meditopia?

273
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,457
- Just change it as I said.
- All right.

274
00:24:56,457 --> 00:24:58,307
How about the remaining balance payment?

275
00:24:58,307 --> 00:25:00,327
Don't give them a penny.

276
00:25:02,927 --> 00:25:06,607
Cancel all the remaining surgeries today.

277
00:25:10,307 --> 00:25:12,907
This patient is fasting.

278
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:17,917
This is a nylon patient, so he won't be here.

279
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:21,887
 

280
00:25:22,727 --> 00:25:25,177
You were still in the hospital.

281
00:25:25,177 --> 00:25:27,407
A patient should be in the hospital.

282
00:25:27,407 --> 00:25:29,147
Sure...

283
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:33,917
But haven't we met somewhere?

284
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:36,777
You haven't seen me before? I've seen you a few times.

285
00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:38,117
Right?

286
00:25:38,887 --> 00:25:40,847
But where have we met before?

287
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:42,777
I don't really remember...

288
00:25:42,777 --> 00:25:44,427
I'm disappointed.

289
00:25:44,427 --> 00:25:47,387
I'm upset. I won't tell you.

290
00:25:52,487 --> 00:25:53,707
I remember!

291
00:25:53,707 --> 00:25:56,667
Taxi! You're that taxi driver, right?

292
00:26:05,877 --> 00:26:08,557
We even checked the crime scene.

293
00:26:08,557 --> 00:26:11,177
Is there a reason for you to remain there?

294
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:15,457
There's a missing puzzle piece.

295
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:20,387
Director Ahn Young Sook is goal oriented and hides her thoughts very well.

296
00:26:20,387 --> 00:26:26,017
But as someone who prioritizes surgeries, her hand tremors because of alcohol.

297
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,517
She spends a lot of time...

298
00:26:28,517 --> 00:26:31,817
volunteering?

299
00:26:31,817 --> 00:26:33,787
Something doesn't add up.

300
00:26:33,787 --> 00:26:36,847
That's why you had a dark expression all this time.

301
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:42,317
But that could just be a hobby or something she does to gain fame.

302
00:26:42,317 --> 00:26:43,917
Do Gi hyungnim?

303
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:46,697
Hyungnim!

304
00:26:49,687 --> 00:26:51,207
Are you hurt somewhere?

305
00:26:51,207 --> 00:26:54,007
Oh, I'm almost better.

306
00:26:54,007 --> 00:26:56,387
But what are you doing here?

307
00:26:56,387 --> 00:26:59,497
Oh, I came to visit someone I knew and was just about to leave.

308
00:26:59,497 --> 00:27:02,407
Do Mr. Park and Mr. Choi also know you're here?

309
00:27:02,407 --> 00:27:05,237
- I'll be discharged soon.
- Come on, Hyungnim.

310
00:27:05,237 --> 00:27:09,527
You need a good rest while you're admitted if you don't want to suffer aftereffects.

311
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,687
Thanks for your concern.

312
00:27:13,137 --> 00:27:16,157
How did it go with your friend?

313
00:27:16,157 --> 00:27:17,787
Friend?

314
00:27:19,377 --> 00:27:24,087
Oh, the friend I was contemplating breaking ties with?

315
00:27:27,627 --> 00:27:30,257
I think what you said was right.

316
00:27:31,287 --> 00:27:34,937
We weren't meant to be friends in the first place.

317
00:27:40,317 --> 00:27:42,777
I need to pick up a customer, so I'll get going.

318
00:27:42,777 --> 00:27:45,187
Rest up, and I'll see you at the office, Hyungnim.

319
00:27:45,187 --> 00:27:46,707
Sure.

320
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:55,147
Isn't Mr. On so nice?

321
00:27:55,147 --> 00:27:57,587
He even visits his sick friend.

322
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,277
Visiting...

323
00:28:01,277 --> 00:28:03,407
That's it.

324
00:28:03,407 --> 00:28:04,847
What?

325
00:28:04,847 --> 00:28:08,307
People come to visit their admitted friends and family.

326
00:28:08,307 --> 00:28:09,867
That's right.

327
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:12,367
Isn't it strange?

328
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:16,017
Surgeries are going on an entire day like some factory.

329
00:28:21,457 --> 00:28:25,317
But why isn't there a single person in the waiting room?

330
00:28:25,317 --> 00:28:27,437
Now that I think about it, you're right.

331
00:28:27,437 --> 00:28:31,427
 Someone usually waits until the surgery is over. 

332
00:28:31,427 --> 00:28:34,427
Just like Han Soo Ryeon's father...

333
00:28:34,427 --> 00:28:36,197
someone is usually...

334
00:28:36,197 --> 00:28:38,577
I think I know why.

335
00:28:40,757 --> 00:28:44,757
 
Sir, I'm going to take a look.

336
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:45,897
How does this feel?

337
00:28:45,897 --> 00:28:47,487
It just feels a bit numb.

338
00:28:47,487 --> 00:28:50,637
Could you try moving your toes?

339
00:28:50,637 --> 00:28:52,157
Aigoo.

340
00:28:52,157 --> 00:28:55,737
You're lucky we found out early, or it could've gotten worse.

341
00:28:55,737 --> 00:29:01,007
I'm not really bothered by it. Must I undergo surgery?

342
00:29:01,987 --> 00:29:03,937
Oh, never mind.

343
00:29:03,937 --> 00:29:07,527
You know best. What would I know?

344
00:29:07,527 --> 00:29:11,087
Yes. Shall we set a surgery date?

345
00:29:11,087 --> 00:29:16,147
I'll treat you with surgery before your condition worsens.

346
00:29:16,147 --> 00:29:20,597
I've arranged four more surgeries, so keep Room 2 available.

347
00:29:20,597 --> 00:29:22,957
Why? You can't?

348
00:29:22,957 --> 00:29:26,217
Contact the head of the department and tell him to rearrange the surgery schedules.

349
00:29:26,217 --> 00:29:29,797
What do you mean you can't when we have this many surgeries?

350
00:29:29,797 --> 00:29:30,947
 Get it together, will you? 

351
00:29:30,947 --> 00:29:34,857
She's tricking the elderly into receiving surgeries they don't need, right?

352
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:37,737
This was her method of running the OR like a factory.

353
00:29:37,737 --> 00:29:40,207
How many times do I need to tell you, huh?

354
00:29:40,207 --> 00:29:44,567
- Oh, my. Shall we move on?
- Yes.

355
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:48,337
The majority of the elders Ahn Young Sook approaches are medical welfare recipients.

356
00:29:48,337 --> 00:29:50,847
- How do you feel these days?
- Doing well.

357
00:29:50,847 --> 00:29:54,587
She focuses on the fact that most of the surgery costs are covered by the state.

358
00:29:54,587 --> 00:29:57,717
All Director Ahn had to do after the surgery was billing the state.

359
00:29:57,717 --> 00:29:59,537
No matter how much she loves money,

360
00:29:59,537 --> 00:30:03,017
how could she take someone who isn't even ill...

361
00:30:03,017 --> 00:30:05,267
and still not get caught?

362
00:30:05,267 --> 00:30:07,377
There's no way their families would stand for that.

363
00:30:07,377 --> 00:30:09,457
That was her second reason.

364
00:30:09,457 --> 00:30:12,067
The reason there wasn't anyone in the waiting room.

365
00:30:12,067 --> 00:30:16,817
 
 I don't have any family, but you're treating me 

366
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:18,717
 without taking any money. 

367
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:21,737
She targeted single elderlies without families.

368
00:30:22,977 --> 00:30:24,687
That means...

369
00:30:25,977 --> 00:30:29,527
even if the surgery didn't go well...

370
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:34,047
Since Ahn Young Sook is the perpetrator as well as the patient's guardian,

371
00:30:34,047 --> 00:30:39,037
there was no one to disrupt or suspect her.

372
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,437
She used the law's blind spot

373
00:30:41,437 --> 00:30:44,517
to create the perfect crime chain.

374
00:30:58,577 --> 00:31:02,647
- Huh?
- But why are we doing this?

375
00:31:03,747 --> 00:31:06,587
He said it's a birthday gift.

376
00:31:25,727 --> 00:31:29,967
♫  I'll take a short break here  ♫

377
00:31:29,967 --> 00:31:37,677
♫  I have been walking for too long  ♫

378
00:31:37,677 --> 00:31:45,297
♫  It will only be a moment, just enough to catch my breath  ♫

379
00:31:45,297 --> 00:31:52,117
♫  I just have to lightly fill my stomach  ♫

380
00:31:52,117 --> 00:31:56,387
♫  I will start walking again  ♫

381
00:31:56,387 --> 00:31:58,897
♫  It will be all right  ♫

382
00:31:58,897 --> 00:32:02,737
I heard you were supposed to go with your father.

383
00:32:02,737 --> 00:32:05,057
Your father told me.

384
00:32:06,117 --> 00:32:12,757
♫  With a word of encouragement, I will stand back up  ♫

385
00:32:12,757 --> 00:32:19,947
♫  How beautiful is that ocean at sunrise?  ♫

386
00:32:19,947 --> 00:32:27,597
♫  That fine wind to cool my sweat will feel so refreshing  ♫

387
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:31,537
♫  I will not stop here for good  ♫

388
00:32:31,537 --> 00:32:38,647
♫  I want to go to the place I saw in my dream  ♫

389
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:47,267
♫  No matter where that place may be  ♫

390
00:32:51,677 --> 00:32:56,877
I heard you've been continuing to pay for Soo Ryeon's hospital bills.

391
00:32:56,877 --> 00:33:00,467
I don't know how to thank you.

392
00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:02,697
I sincerely thank you.

393
00:33:02,697 --> 00:33:04,507
It's no problem.

394
00:33:04,507 --> 00:33:07,787
I'm just lending it to you, and I will get paid back.

395
00:33:07,787 --> 00:33:12,437
Yes, I'll do whatever it takes to pay you back.

396
00:33:13,847 --> 00:33:17,007
We'll take care of getting paid back,

397
00:33:17,007 --> 00:33:19,467
so there's no need for you to worry about that.

398
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:20,627
Sorry?

399
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:23,507
She's a strong child.

400
00:33:24,427 --> 00:33:26,787
She must take after you.

401
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:39,147
Geez, why is it so off?

402
00:33:44,297 --> 00:33:48,487
CEO Kim didn't hold back on your compliments. He said you're quite clever.

403
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:50,537
Thank you, Director Ahn.

404
00:33:55,077 --> 00:33:56,997
Any surgical experience?

405
00:33:56,997 --> 00:34:00,327
Surgical? No.

406
00:34:00,327 --> 00:34:02,517
Do you know Meditopia's Manager Gong?

407
00:34:02,517 --> 00:34:04,437
Yes, I've heard about him.

408
00:34:04,437 --> 00:34:06,647
I trained him myself.

409
00:34:06,647 --> 00:34:09,457
He's old news now, though.

410
00:34:12,377 --> 00:34:16,667
If you search the internet, there are kits for practicing surgery.

411
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:19,037
They don't cost much. Buy them and practice.

412
00:34:19,037 --> 00:34:22,187
If you try it a few times, you'll get used to it in no time.

413
00:34:23,587 --> 00:34:26,297
You don't want to? Then tell me right now.

414
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,457
I'll need to contact a different company.

415
00:34:28,457 --> 00:34:33,177
I-It's no problem. I-I'll practice.

416
00:34:34,437 --> 00:34:36,777
Okay.

417
00:34:36,777 --> 00:34:39,047
Then go back to your office, make a business credit card,

418
00:34:39,047 --> 00:34:40,907
and give it to our head of administration.

419
00:34:40,907 --> 00:34:42,907
Yes, all right, Director Ahn.

420
00:34:42,907 --> 00:34:46,267
- You may leave.
- Okay. I'll take my leave.

421
00:34:52,777 --> 00:34:55,617
Gosh, why do I keep missing?

422
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,307
Good shot.

423
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:06,897
Yeah.

424
00:35:08,017 --> 00:35:10,107
He said he'll do it.

425
00:35:10,107 --> 00:35:14,097
That woman is hiring another proxy surgeon, isn't she?

426
00:35:14,097 --> 00:35:18,267
Gosh, more effort is put into hiring a part-timer in the neighborhood.

427
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:21,837
- Jin Eon, did you see that just now?
- What?

428
00:35:21,837 --> 00:35:24,337
The ball flew straight ahead.

429
00:35:24,337 --> 00:35:28,217
I've finally found my true talent.

430
00:35:32,707 --> 00:35:35,107
He's still unconscious?

431
00:35:35,107 --> 00:35:36,817
Geez.

432
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:42,867
Hyungnim, she's leaving. She's leaving.

433
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:48,787
All right...

434
00:35:52,307 --> 00:35:56,057
Sir, can you hear my voice?

435
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:59,217
Let me take a look.

436
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:08,517
All right.

437
00:36:10,517 --> 00:36:11,697
Hello.

438
00:36:13,317 --> 00:36:16,437
He's of old age, so please continue to keep an eye on him.

439
00:36:16,437 --> 00:36:20,547
His vital signs are weakening, and we can't even insert an IV.

440
00:36:20,547 --> 00:36:23,057
- And?
- Sorry?

441
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:28,927
Are you disregarding my diagnosis of old age and claiming there's a different cause?

442
00:36:28,927 --> 00:36:32,427
- Will you take responsibility for that?
- No, Director Ahn.

443
00:36:38,227 --> 00:36:39,317
Yes.

444
00:36:39,317 --> 00:36:42,937
If the patient dies, contact the district police station in the afternoon,

445
00:36:42,937 --> 00:36:46,497
and tell them an elderly who lives alone died of chronic illness.

446
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:48,707
Yes, I understand.

447
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,887
And once the death certificate is issued,

448
00:36:50,887 --> 00:36:53,897
arrange the funeral with the District Welfare Division.

449
00:36:53,897 --> 00:36:57,427
Collect every single nurse's chart and bring them to me.

450
00:36:57,427 --> 00:36:58,827
Yes, ma'am.

451
00:37:14,537 --> 00:37:16,817
This is insane.

452
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:20,767
How could she be so nonchalant when she

453
00:37:20,817 --> 00:37:23,547
drove a helpless old man into that state?

454
00:37:23,547 --> 00:37:27,977
Light administrative measures and fines, simple re-issuance of her license...

455
00:37:27,977 --> 00:37:32,457
She's learned enough when she was still Ahn Ji Eun.

456
00:37:32,457 --> 00:37:35,697
That's how this hospital model was formed.

457
00:38:05,297 --> 00:38:06,987
What's going on?

458
00:38:08,837 --> 00:38:10,897
Who's there?

459
00:38:10,897 --> 00:38:13,287
There's still someone here!

460
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:23,357
You should check before turning off the lights-

461
00:38:24,777 --> 00:38:26,647
Who are you?

462
00:38:26,647 --> 00:38:28,577
Excuse me.

463
00:38:28,577 --> 00:38:31,737
This is off-limits to outsiders. Please leave.

464
00:38:31,737 --> 00:38:33,877
What do you plan to do by prohibiting outsiders?

465
00:38:33,877 --> 00:38:35,477
What the hell?

466
00:38:35,477 --> 00:38:37,497
Hey, stop.

467
00:38:37,497 --> 00:38:40,157
Who the hell are you?

468
00:38:48,977 --> 00:38:52,247
Help... please help me!

469
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,917
I'm going to call the police!

470
00:38:59,217 --> 00:39:01,047
 

471
00:39:02,517 --> 00:39:04,437
Yes, Mr. Kim.

472
00:39:06,317 --> 00:39:11,037
I want to make Jeil Chakhan's Director Ahn Young Sook famous.

473
00:39:11,037 --> 00:39:12,897
Do you need helping hands?

474
00:39:12,897 --> 00:39:14,777
The more, the merrier.

475
00:39:14,777 --> 00:39:16,537
I'll be right there.

476
00:39:29,057 --> 00:39:31,177
Someone would think you're the hospital owner.

477
00:39:31,177 --> 00:39:33,967
Just go and pick up some trash.

478
00:39:35,057 --> 00:39:37,517
Gosh, it's a nylon patient.

479
00:39:42,987 --> 00:39:46,247
 

480
00:39:48,417 --> 00:39:51,347
I finished getting my IV.

481
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,777
Once you go back, I'll remove it for you.

482
00:40:06,587 --> 00:40:08,057
 

483
00:40:08,057 --> 00:40:09,867
 

484
00:40:12,927 --> 00:40:15,147
Did I leave the door unlocked?

485
00:40:25,217 --> 00:40:27,027
 

486
00:40:27,027 --> 00:40:29,627
You can't come this way.

487
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:32,217
Then when can I go?

488
00:40:32,217 --> 00:40:36,597
There's a serious matter right now, so please come back later.

489
00:40:36,597 --> 00:40:37,987
All right.

490
00:40:44,187 --> 00:40:48,007
Hang in there a bit longer. We'll take you to a new hospital.

491
00:40:52,057 --> 00:40:54,377
I'm finished.

492
00:40:57,277 --> 00:41:00,327
Don't you think this doctor's coat suits me?

493
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,037
I really fit in, don't I?

494
00:41:06,037 --> 00:41:08,157
This way, this way.

495
00:41:10,797 --> 00:41:15,647
Director Ahn Young Sook ought to enjoy this special day.

496
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:19,617
 She'll enjoy it. Since she'll become more famous. 

497
00:41:19,617 --> 00:41:21,807
- Nurse.
- Yes?

498
00:41:22,657 --> 00:41:25,037
I'm all better. I want to be discharged now.

499
00:41:25,037 --> 00:41:27,717
You're all better? All of a sudden?

500
00:41:27,717 --> 00:41:30,277
Yes, suddenly...

501
00:41:30,277 --> 00:41:32,067
All of a sudden.

502
00:41:32,067 --> 00:41:34,277
Then take care.

503
00:41:42,197 --> 00:41:43,877
 

504
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:46,107
Hello.

505
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:48,317
- Seung Wan?
- I'm your fan.

506
00:41:48,317 --> 00:41:50,627
Thank you. What's your name?

507
00:41:50,627 --> 00:41:52,267
Son Myung Lim.

508
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:55,147
- Here you go. Take care.
- Thank you.

509
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:58,157
Hello.

510
00:41:58,157 --> 00:41:59,557
 

511
00:41:59,557 --> 00:42:01,337
Can I take one photo?

512
00:42:01,337 --> 00:42:02,547
I'll do this.

513
00:42:02,547 --> 00:42:04,557
 
 

514
00:42:05,777 --> 00:42:07,797
- Thank you. Take care.
- Thank you.

515
00:42:07,797 --> 00:42:08,977
Sure.

516
00:42:10,097 --> 00:42:12,997
- Hello.
- I respect you.

517
00:42:18,277 --> 00:42:20,437
Director Ahn, you published a book recently?

518
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,687
Yes, I'm embarrassed.

519
00:42:22,687 --> 00:42:25,127
The title of the book is so nice.

520
00:42:25,127 --> 00:42:28,567
"The Hillside Village Schweitzer." Please introduce it to us.

521
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:32,457
Yes, this book is something I have planned ever since I started-

522
00:42:32,457 --> 00:42:34,477
Wait a moment.

523
00:42:34,477 --> 00:42:38,987
Before you start, we can't proceed without mentioning this first.

524
00:42:38,987 --> 00:42:43,977
A report about you has been made just now.

525
00:42:43,977 --> 00:42:47,287
I don't know what you're talking about all of a sudden.

526
00:42:47,287 --> 00:42:51,057
You don't need to be modest about doing something so kind.

527
00:42:51,057 --> 00:42:53,887
I heard you promised to donate the entirety

528
00:42:53,887 --> 00:42:59,967
of this year's hospital revenue to the welfare of the entire nation's elderly.

529
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,827
- I did?
- Wow.

530
00:43:08,057 --> 00:43:12,457
We just spoke on the phone with hospital staff to confirm the details

531
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:14,927
and that person had no idea, either,

532
00:43:14,927 --> 00:43:18,177
until he received the contract.

533
00:43:18,177 --> 00:43:20,897
There's no other Schweitzer in all of Korea.

534
00:43:20,897 --> 00:43:23,417
Please give it up once again!

535
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:26,957
Thank you...

536
00:43:28,067 --> 00:43:29,947
Thank you.

537
00:43:33,407 --> 00:43:34,957
Hey, Manager Kim.

538
00:43:34,957 --> 00:43:37,807
The Head of Administration can't be reached right now.

539
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:42,917
Did you approve a donation under my name?

540
00:43:42,917 --> 00:43:47,827
Yes, I deposited this year's revenue to the National Welfare of the Elderly.

541
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:53,457
So you're saying my wet signature was on the donation contract?

542
00:43:53,457 --> 00:43:57,847
I never signed a contract like that.

543
00:43:57,847 --> 00:43:59,347
Hello.

544
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:03,547
- I'm a big fan.
- Thank you.

545
00:44:05,697 --> 00:44:06,977
Oh, yes.

546
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,507
 

547
00:44:09,507 --> 00:44:11,277
It's working.

548
00:44:11,277 --> 00:44:13,007
Thank you.

549
00:44:14,177 --> 00:44:16,497
Are you crazy? What's your job?

550
00:44:16,497 --> 00:44:18,887
How could you make this kind of mistake?

551
00:44:18,887 --> 00:44:21,007
Your head is full of shit!

552
00:44:21,007 --> 00:44:22,597
The signature matched yours and

553
00:44:22,597 --> 00:44:25,947
you're usually passionate about volunteering and...

554
00:44:25,947 --> 00:44:29,467
 the broadcast agency kept calling, too. 

555
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:31,407
Can we get it back?

556
00:44:31,407 --> 00:44:33,937
If we ask them to return it, will they?

557
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:38,047
By due process, I'm aware the donation amount can't be refunded.

558
00:44:38,047 --> 00:44:41,757
And people have been praising you for discreetly doing good deeds

559
00:44:41,757 --> 00:44:45,437
- as expected of Schweitzer-
- Good deeds my ass!

560
00:44:45,437 --> 00:44:49,597
When the head of administration returns, tell him to call me immediately, got it?

561
00:44:49,597 --> 00:44:52,317
- Do you understand?
 - Yes, I understand. 

562
00:44:56,407 --> 00:44:59,127
What's with my luck today?

563
00:45:01,147 --> 00:45:02,827
What is it now?

564
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,317
 

565
00:45:27,617 --> 00:45:29,407
Yeah.

566
00:45:29,407 --> 00:45:32,537
There should be a reason they came for an inspection.

567
00:45:32,567 --> 00:45:34,767
 

568
00:45:48,607 --> 00:45:50,907
What brings you here?

569
00:45:50,907 --> 00:45:53,237
I'm the director of this hospital.

570
00:45:53,237 --> 00:45:56,557
I'm from the Joint Investigation Team of the Review and Assessment Service.

571
00:45:56,557 --> 00:46:00,557
There was an internal complaint about the reuse of one-time disposable needles.

572
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:03,457
- Reuse of needles?
- Yes.

573
00:46:03,457 --> 00:46:06,247
I think you're mistaken.

574
00:46:06,247 --> 00:46:09,527
We don't do that here. They don't even cost that much.

575
00:46:09,527 --> 00:46:11,547
I found them.

576
00:46:22,467 --> 00:46:26,987
How could you play a joke like this in the hospital?

577
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:29,977
These gentlemen are going to misunderstand.

578
00:46:29,977 --> 00:46:33,257
Who is it? Who's responsible for this ridiculous joke?

579
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:35,187
Where do you store psychoactive drugs?

580
00:46:35,187 --> 00:46:37,457
We also received a report claiming quantity manipulation.

581
00:46:37,457 --> 00:46:41,157
Wait a minute. What exactly are you implying?

582
00:46:41,157 --> 00:46:42,287
Huh?

583
00:46:42,287 --> 00:46:43,517
 

584
00:46:53,547 --> 00:46:57,337
Who took the psychoactive drugs that were in here?

585
00:46:57,337 --> 00:46:59,777
Bring me the disbursement log!

586
00:46:59,777 --> 00:47:02,547
We checked the program and went through the entire disbursement log.

587
00:47:02,547 --> 00:47:07,237
You're the one who's been steadily prescribing them.

588
00:47:07,237 --> 00:47:08,567
Me?

589
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:12,507
You're telling me I took all the narcotics that were in here?

590
00:47:12,507 --> 00:47:15,117
There are medications one year past the expiration date?

591
00:47:15,117 --> 00:47:17,167
Geez.

592
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,997
Whoa, all kinds of things happened in one place.

593
00:47:19,997 --> 00:47:22,017
My goodness.

594
00:47:23,197 --> 00:47:24,717
This is a conspiracy.

595
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:27,667
Someone manipulated everything.

596
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:32,187
Someone manipulated all this to set me up.

597
00:47:32,187 --> 00:47:36,717
If we check the CCTV, we can see who's been in and out of here.

598
00:47:36,717 --> 00:47:40,877
If we check the CCTV, we can catch the culprit.

599
00:47:43,487 --> 00:47:45,827
Hey. It's been reset?

600
00:47:45,827 --> 00:47:50,957
Yes, our system usually reformats itself periodically.

601
00:47:50,957 --> 00:47:53,577
And it was reformatted at midnight last night.

602
00:47:54,737 --> 00:47:58,727
Which bastard set up the system like that, huh?

603
00:47:59,657 --> 00:48:02,387
I-It was... you.

604
00:48:02,387 --> 00:48:04,887
You ordered us to set up an automatic reset every two weeks,

605
00:48:04,887 --> 00:48:06,997
so they can't even be recovered.

606
00:48:07,967 --> 00:48:09,217
There's nothing more to see here.

607
00:48:09,217 --> 00:48:11,687
Hey, why don't you believe me?

608
00:48:11,687 --> 00:48:13,757
Hey, you think being a civil servant is everything?

609
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:16,557
This is all a lie. How many times do I need to tell you?

610
00:48:16,557 --> 00:48:20,047
Who the hell are you? Who's your boss? Who did you conspire with?

611
00:48:20,047 --> 00:48:23,617
Who are you working with, and why are you causing a disturbance?

612
00:48:23,617 --> 00:48:26,427
You know Meditopia's Manager Gong Su Ho, right?

613
00:48:29,587 --> 00:48:32,247
He confessed everything to the police last night.

614
00:48:46,947 --> 00:48:49,477
Excuse me, what brings you here?

615
00:48:50,837 --> 00:48:52,967
I came to turn myself in.

616
00:48:57,447 --> 00:48:59,867
 It has been revealed Jeil Chakhan Hospital Director Ahn Young Sook 

617
00:48:59,867 --> 00:49:01,857
 has been ordering an employee of 

618
00:49:01,857 --> 00:49:05,207
 a medical supplies company to perform proxy surgeries all this time. 

619
00:49:05,207 --> 00:49:08,557
 As the truth behind Driector Ahn Young Sook's proxy surgery became exposed, 

620
00:49:08,557 --> 00:49:11,057
 the court ruling regarding Ms. Han Soo Ryeon's medical accident 

621
00:49:11,057 --> 00:49:14,347
 has been requested for retrial. 

622
00:49:14,347 --> 00:49:17,527
 Thus, the operation of Jeil Chakhan Hospital has been suspended 

623
00:49:17,527 --> 00:49:21,447
 and is currently undergoing closing procedures. 

624
00:49:21,447 --> 00:49:24,237
 Ms. Han Soo Ryeon, the victim of a proxy surgery medical accident 

625
00:49:24,237 --> 00:49:27,567
 is currently being treated at another hospital. 

626
00:49:27,567 --> 00:49:29,767
 

627
00:50:18,877 --> 00:50:20,927
 

628
00:51:08,407 --> 00:51:10,097
 

629
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,917
 

630
00:51:27,967 --> 00:51:32,867
I'll just pay the fine, change my name, and open a new hospital.

631
00:51:32,867 --> 00:51:37,057
They're making such a big fuss when they'll forget everything in no time.

632
00:51:39,867 --> 00:51:42,567
 
Those stupid idiots.

633
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:44,947
Who do they think I am?

634
00:52:17,214 --> 00:52:21,944
After this surgery factory closes down, what do you think will happen to you?

635
00:52:22,944 --> 00:52:24,904
Who the hell are you?

636
00:52:24,904 --> 00:52:28,414
Would you realize your sins or...

637
00:52:28,414 --> 00:52:31,034
would you prepare for another change of name?

638
00:52:33,594 --> 00:52:35,394
If it's the latter,

639
00:52:35,394 --> 00:52:37,824
then you have an incurable disease.

640
00:52:42,814 --> 00:52:45,354
Oh, my goodness.

641
00:52:47,614 --> 00:52:49,014
The nylon patient?

642
00:52:49,014 --> 00:52:52,514
Don't worry, Patient Ahn. That disease of yours...

643
00:52:52,514 --> 00:52:56,064
I'll lead the surgery and treat it.

644
00:52:56,064 --> 00:52:59,234
Are you the one who did this? Everything?

645
00:53:00,734 --> 00:53:05,954
Are you the fool who pulled this bullshit on me?

646
00:53:09,284 --> 00:53:12,414
You want to die, huh?

647
00:53:20,284 --> 00:53:24,304
There was a garlic scent as the anesthesia kicked in.

648
00:53:24,304 --> 00:53:29,134
Hey, Nylon. What's your reason for doing this?

649
00:53:39,004 --> 00:53:41,044
One time in my battalion, we had new sand

650
00:53:41,044 --> 00:53:43,654
brought in for the wrestling arena.

651
00:53:44,464 --> 00:53:48,974
The new sand has no impurities and is very smooth,

652
00:53:48,974 --> 00:53:51,604
so it feels good on our bare feet.

653
00:53:52,574 --> 00:53:57,774
But a junior soldier dropped a needle in the sand while sewing

654
00:53:57,774 --> 00:54:00,314
his military uniform in the wrestling arena.

655
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:05,254
Do you know what happened after that?

656
00:54:06,364 --> 00:54:10,964
No one could enter that sand arena.

657
00:54:10,964 --> 00:54:14,194
The sand arena, which was once spacious and clean

658
00:54:14,194 --> 00:54:17,354
became a dangerous place because of that one needle.

659
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:20,054
Just because of that one needle.

660
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:24,054
Because of you.

661
00:54:27,094 --> 00:54:29,764
 

662
00:54:29,764 --> 00:54:31,764
 

663
00:54:36,584 --> 00:54:39,914
How does it feel to be lying there?

664
00:54:39,914 --> 00:54:43,734
I'll make you Assistant Director.

665
00:54:43,734 --> 00:54:46,014
It was brief, but while lying there,

666
00:54:46,014 --> 00:54:48,884
all kinds of thoughts passed through my mind.

667
00:54:48,884 --> 00:54:51,164
If I was really a patient,

668
00:54:51,164 --> 00:54:55,084
what could I have done as I lay here?

669
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:58,354
The answer was trusting in you.

670
00:54:58,354 --> 00:55:00,504
We can split the profit...

671
00:55:00,504 --> 00:55:02,534
Six for you...

672
00:55:03,344 --> 00:55:05,314
four for me.

673
00:55:05,314 --> 00:55:10,064
While you drank after ordering a sales manager to perform surgery,

674
00:55:10,064 --> 00:55:13,934
the only thing I could do as I lie here

675
00:55:13,934 --> 00:55:16,894
was to trust you with my body.

676
00:55:17,864 --> 00:55:22,834
Just as Han Soo Ryeon did and just as her father did, too.

677
00:55:24,634 --> 00:55:27,824
Six for you... four for me.

678
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,544
No.

679
00:55:29,544 --> 00:55:32,654
- You can just take everything.
- Seven to three!

680
00:55:32,654 --> 00:55:34,234
Please spare me.

681
00:55:34,234 --> 00:55:35,894
Please spare me.

682
00:55:36,944 --> 00:55:40,584
Please... please spare me!

683
00:55:47,394 --> 00:55:50,374
 Dad! When did you get here? 

684
00:55:50,374 --> 00:55:53,014
 What's that? Red bean fish buns! 

685
00:55:53,014 --> 00:55:55,704
 Daebak, the red bean fish buns look so good. 

686
00:55:59,864 --> 00:56:03,484
 I'm kind of afraid of getting surgery. 

687
00:56:03,484 --> 00:56:14,594
♫  I take in the smile of you who watches me  ♫

688
00:56:14,594 --> 00:56:18,904
 Should I get a driver's license and go to the East Sea like we used to 

689
00:56:18,904 --> 00:56:21,634
 and go to the grass field, too? 

690
00:56:21,634 --> 00:56:24,674
 I'm excited just thinking about it. 

691
00:56:24,674 --> 00:56:28,584
♫  My memories of the past that keeps fading away  ♫

692
00:56:28,634 --> 00:56:38,384
♫  The sight of you that illuminates my heart  ♫

693
00:56:38,384 --> 00:56:44,034
♫  It seeps through and moves my heart  ♫

694
00:56:44,094 --> 00:56:52,074
♫  I see the truth you tried to hide  ♫

695
00:56:52,074 --> 00:56:59,794
♫  The moment that dwelled at the end of the day  ♫

696
00:56:59,794 --> 00:57:02,054
Soo Ryeon!

697
00:57:02,054 --> 00:57:03,654
Soo Ryeon!

698
00:57:06,254 --> 00:57:08,504
It's me! Your dad!

699
00:57:08,504 --> 00:57:12,224
Can you recognize me? It's dad.

700
00:57:15,374 --> 00:57:17,974
Dad...

701
00:57:17,974 --> 00:57:19,624
Yes.

702
00:57:19,624 --> 00:57:23,764
I dreamt of walking through the grass field...

703
00:57:23,764 --> 00:57:25,674
with you.

704
00:57:25,674 --> 00:57:27,214
Yes!

705
00:57:27,214 --> 00:57:30,694
Thank you! Thank you!

706
00:57:30,694 --> 00:57:32,974
Thank you!

707
00:57:32,974 --> 00:57:34,694
Thank you, God.

708
00:57:34,694 --> 00:57:37,414
You did great. You did great.

709
00:57:37,414 --> 00:57:42,524
Excuse me! My daughter's awake! My daughter's awake!

710
00:57:51,224 --> 00:57:53,924
I'll send you a photo, so get started right away.

711
00:57:53,924 --> 00:57:57,844
Oh, I did get it ready,

712
00:57:57,844 --> 00:58:00,684
but must we go this far?

713
00:58:01,684 --> 00:58:03,614
I told you.

714
00:58:03,614 --> 00:58:06,184
We'll take care of things their way.

715
00:58:09,144 --> 00:58:11,404
I know Kim Do Gi best.

716
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:14,044
 You just get your job done right. 

717
00:58:14,044 --> 00:58:15,834
And be careful.

718
00:58:17,734 --> 00:58:19,394
Careful?

719
00:58:24,164 --> 00:58:26,084
That's not what I mean.

720
00:58:26,084 --> 00:58:29,744
Carefully do your job right.

721
00:58:34,104 --> 00:58:36,444
That f***ing asshole!

722
00:58:39,434 --> 00:58:41,024
Dispatch complete.

723
00:58:41,024 --> 00:58:43,404
Everyone did a great job.

724
00:58:43,404 --> 00:58:47,414
- Good job.
- Great work.

725
00:58:47,414 --> 00:58:48,914
No mention of a company dinner tonight?

726
00:58:48,914 --> 00:58:51,044
Do you want to eat hanwoo?

727
00:58:51,044 --> 00:58:54,384
Of course. I was wondering when you'd bring up hanwoo.

728
00:59:01,234 --> 00:59:04,654
Mr. Kim Do Gi, is everything good there?

729
00:59:10,174 --> 00:59:11,824
That's weird.

730
00:59:12,724 --> 00:59:17,544
I keep getting weird noise signals from the Premium Taxi.

731
00:59:17,544 --> 00:59:19,604
Noise signals?

732
00:59:26,774 --> 00:59:29,204
Mr. Kim, can you hear me?

733
00:59:29,204 --> 00:59:32,084
Go Eun. Go Eun?

734
00:59:34,434 --> 00:59:37,254
- Mr. Kim.
- Can you hear me?

735
00:59:52,104 --> 00:59:53,644
Wait, why...

736
01:00:32,384 --> 01:00:33,254
 

737
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:38,304
Kim Do Gi...

738
01:00:39,134 --> 01:00:40,844
We have to get him...

739
01:00:45,864 --> 01:00:46,754
 

740
01:00:46,754 --> 01:00:47,714
 

741
01:00:47,714 --> 01:00:51,744
 

742
01:01:22,644 --> 01:01:24,684
 

743
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:37,934
 We weren't meant to be friends in the first place. 

744
01:01:41,414 --> 01:01:44,414
 I need to pick up a customer, so I'll get going. 

745
01:01:44,414 --> 01:01:45,904
 Sure. 

746
01:02:02,604 --> 01:02:06,444
 

747
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:24,740
 !

748
01:02:24,744 --> 01:02:28,424
 

749
01:02:31,924 --> 01:02:37,304
♫  The other day, is it a different fate?  ♫

750
01:02:37,304 --> 01:02:43,694
♫  When I open my eyes in my next life  ♫

751
01:02:43,694 --> 01:02:50,664
♫  When you come again, will you be able to recognize me when I've changed so much  ♫

752
01:02:50,664 --> 01:02:58,514
 

753
01:02:58,534 --> 01:03:00,394
 No way... 

754
01:03:00,394 --> 01:03:02,744
 Mr. Kim Do Gi can't be dead. 

755
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:07,160
 If there's someone behind this motley crew, 

756
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,190
 he would do something since their muscleman died. 

757
01:03:09,194 --> 01:03:10,904
 he would do something since their muscleman died. 

758
01:03:10,904 --> 01:03:15,324
 Someone really doesn't like us. 

759
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:18,654
 I've identified the unfamiliar people who attended Mr. Kim Do Gi's funeral. 

760
01:03:18,654 --> 01:03:20,794
 They all work here. 

761
01:03:20,794 --> 01:03:23,034
 Black Sun. That popular club in Gangnam. 

762
01:03:23,034 --> 01:03:24,694
 Why would a club target Mr. Kim Do Gi? 

763
01:03:24,694 --> 01:03:26,224
 Should I kill one more person? 

764
01:03:26,224 --> 01:03:29,144
 Live a long life. And don't try too hard. 

765
01:03:29,144 --> 01:03:32,584
 Are you saying Mr. On tried to kill Mr. Kim Do Gi? 

766
01:03:32,584 --> 01:03:35,414
 He approached us with different intentions from the start. 

767
01:03:35,414 --> 01:03:37,954
 Good thing we didn't become friends. 

768
01:03:39,454 --> 01:03:42,134
 I think it's time to make a move.
