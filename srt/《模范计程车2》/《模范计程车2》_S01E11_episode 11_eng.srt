1
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,830
 

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,670
 

3
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,750
 

4
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:55,020
♫  Was it intentional? Did I forget?  ♫

5
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:02,710
♫  I kept it deep inside my bag  ♫

6
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  When we were about to say goodbye  ♫

7
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:15,380
♫  That's when I took out the letter I wrote for you  ♫

8
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,490
 

9
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,760
It makes no sense...

10
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,260
that Mr. Kim died.

11
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,060
♫  I took my time opening the letter  ♫

12
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:34,750
♫  The handwriting on pretty paper  ♫

13
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,960
What should we do now?

14
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,080
What are we going to do?

15
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,510
♫  Engraving each line in my heart  ♫

16
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:50,970
♫  I revealed my heart without any lies  ♫

17
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,870
I'll clean it up.

18
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,990
♫  Looking at me with teary eyes  ♫

19
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:08,150
♫  The eyes that I see are filled with tears  ♫

20
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:22,610
♫  We trust each other without needing to say any words  ♫

21
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:37,040
 Thanks for watching Taxi Driver 2 on Viki! 

22
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,000
 A detective named Jang who doesn't even exist in Korea 

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,850
 sent a package to an office that doesn't exist 

24
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,320
 and a taxi driver ended up getting it? 

25
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,570
 It's hard to figure it out because all the lines were cut off- 

26
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,300
 We can bring things to the surface to find out if there's more. 

27
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,100
I told you that we'd take care of things in their style.

28
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,960
I know Kim Do Gi better than anyone.

29
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,980
Mr. Kim...

30
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,210
Mr. Kim.

31
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,680
- Let go!
- No, it's dangerous!

32
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,080
- It's okay!
- No, it's dangerous!

33
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,310
No, you can't! No, Go Eun!

34
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,730
Let go!

35
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,230
Let me see the face...

36
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,510
of the person who's hiding behind Hyungnim.

37
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,250
 

38
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,990
 

39
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,440
We did everything Mr. On wanted to do. It's all over now, right?

40
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,690
Why is Hyun Jo...

41
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,800
so angry?

42
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,400
Did I hurt his pride by asking him to install an explosive?

43
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,550
You're the one who's playing with dirt,

44
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,630
but only my hands keep getting dirty.

45
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,260
 You want to burn a house to catch a fly? 

46
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,410
Did we have to go that far?

47
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,590
You're talking like you're a stranger. You're hurting my feelings.

48
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,400
Anyway, well done.

49
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,530
And while you're at it,

50
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:10,140
find out every single mourner who comes to the funeral.

51
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,000
- Including their financial records.
- What?

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,880
Are you joking right now?

53
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,260
 Hey, Mr. On. 

54
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,190
If there's someone behind this motley crew,

55
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,310
he would do something since their muscleman died.

56
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,740
He could easily stop by since it's a funeral and all.

57
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,620
Use someone other than your subordinate cops so you don't get attention.

58
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,940
Welcome, Hyungnim.

59
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,820
Here you go.

60
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,570
Load it in the car.

61
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,950
Bye.

62
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,640
Find these people's financial records and personal information.

63
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,240
Take this and get all the fingerprints, too.

64
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,530
By the way,

65
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,040
what kind of case is this?

66
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,160
Just read what it says here.

67
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,590
It says "Top Secret" on it.

68
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,140
Why are you asking, then? You bastard!

69
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,170
Are you acting like a boss now?

70
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,890
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize and bring me that stuff quickly.

71
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,900
Yes, got it.

72
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,860
Chief On, you son of a bitch.

73
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,800
What time is it?

74
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,720
It's 9.

75
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,220
Why isn't he here yet?

76
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,060
He'll come.

77
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,000
He's not here yet?

78
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,490
Didn't he say he'd come by 9?

79
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,540
 

80
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,830
Mr. Kim. Are things okay there?

81
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,060
How strange.

82
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,440
I keep detecting noise signals from your cab.

83
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,610
Noise signals?

84
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,540
Can you hear me?

85
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,560
Go Eun. Go Eun?

86
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,090
Can you hear me?

87
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,560
What?

88
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,820
Kim Do Gi...

89
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,680
Mr. Kim!

90
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,400
Mr. Kim.

91
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,370
- Mr. Kim!
- Go Eun, no, no.

92
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,370
Let go! Mr. Kim is...

93
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,220
No, Go Eun! It's dangerous. Don't go.

94
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,460
- Let go of me!
- I said you can't!

95
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,050
No! No, it's dangerous!

96
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,320
Let go!

97
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,070
No!

98
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,160
- Mr. Kim Do Gi!
- Mr. Kim!

99
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,930
Are you okay?

100
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,680
M-Mr. Kim!

101
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,100
Mr. Kim.

102
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,000
Are you okay?

103
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,900
Did I get caught?

104
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,520
Your hand must hurt a lot.

105
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,740
Mr. Kim!

106
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,340
Mr. Kim.

107
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,760
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

108
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,000
There might be more explosions.

109
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,460
Let's hurry up and leave.

110
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,980
Hurry up!

111
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,980
Let's go to the car.

112
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,010
What happened? Answer me!

113
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,070
Okay.

114
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,590
I'm so glad that

115
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,760
no one's hurt.

116
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,130
Is it a chemical symbol?

117
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,070
Trinitrotoluene.

118
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,760
In short, it's called TNT.

119
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,640
They must've removed the cover to hide the source.

120
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,720
It's an element symbol for the TNT bomb.

121
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,190
It's simpler than you think.

122
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,080
It's made with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.

123
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,410
We're not on a field trip.

124
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,750
This hideous thing just blew up our cab.

125
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,970
It's not time to study right now.

126
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,880
The fact that they put that on the cab means they already know us.

127
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,560
They don't just know us.

128
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,940
They hate us a lot.

129
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,580
Somebody...

130
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,110
hates us...

131
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,660
very much...

132
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,190
Somebody hates us a lot.

133
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,030
We should at least know who it is, right?

134
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,680
Let's have a look at their face.

135
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,580
How?

136
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,290
I died. We need to have a funeral.

137
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,720
A funeral?

138
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,830
Keep an eye on the person who makes moves after I die.

139
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,050
Mr. Kim.

140
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,580
No way...

141
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,400
He didn't die, though.

142
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,440
Why are you crying so much?

143
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,450
Doesn't that photo

144
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,680
make you feel sad?

145
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,000
Yeah, it kind of does when you keep looking at it.

146
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,700
I think it's time to make a move.

147
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,300
I'm ready.

148
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,880
The more I know her, the scarier she is.

149
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,620
I should listen to her.

150
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,950
Let's have a look and see if there are any strangers

151
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,800
who came.

152
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,020
Geez.

153
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,470
I'm sorry.

154
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,030
- Thank you.
- Yes.

155
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,490
What are you doing?

156
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,260
Huh?

157
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,430
- Me?
- Ah, no...

158
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:21,460
Why would you go to the library?

159
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,700
I told you to go have fun. Why would you go to a library...

160
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,820
Why would you take that?

161
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,290
Why would you take a backpack?

162
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,480
You're going on a vacation!

163
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:47,340
There are two people who are not eating in front of Mr. Park.

164
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,610
Let me put it away.

165
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,270
I can't read the license plate because of the CCTV's picture quality.

166
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,330
 Let me go there right now. 

167
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:59,830
Whoa! Looks like our roles changed a bit.

168
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,590
Mr. Kim. How does it feel to take my spot?

169
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,910
I can feel how you must've felt

170
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,430
all this time.

171
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,520
How did I feel?

172
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,310
You must've been very worried.

173
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,090
I'm glad you know now.

174
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,270
Take care now!

175
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,590
 

176
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:53,010
 

177
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,060
 

178
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,130
 

179
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,690
All right.

180
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,620
You can leave now.

181
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,820
He became ashes and was sent to an ossuary.

182
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,870
I looked into every single person who came to the funeral.

183
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,930
But I couldn't find anything.

184
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:04,110
Are you satisfied now?

185
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,180
Why does it feel so off?

186
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,570
Should I try killing another one?

187
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:17,620
Bishop is coming back soon. Would you have time for that?

188
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,620
Bishop is coming back?

189
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,480
What? Didn't you know that he was coming back?

190
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,580
Did he only tell me?

191
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,950
You probably didn't hear this, either, then.

192
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,310
He gave you an order.

193
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:37,700
He told you to stop playing like a child and focus on your real job.

194
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:49,550
If you were joking, that was terrible timing.

195
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,720
Did Bishop really say that?

196
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,210
"Quit all this nonsense

197
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,720
and focus on your real job."

198
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,630
Those are his own words.

199
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,330
- Everyone is here.
- Yes, let them in.

200
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:22,130
Oh, Bishop told the Gold Society's executives to have a meeting.

201
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,630
I forgot to...

202
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,370
let you know about it.

203
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:01,270
Our Jesu. Sacratisimo.

204
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,730
 

205
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,140
Mr. On, what brings you here?

206
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,180
It's nothing.

207
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,160
You aren't here to tell me something?

208
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,590
I did what I needed to do.

209
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:45,090
Do you remember when I came back after an accident once?

210
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:50,960
You treated me warmly without scolding me.

211
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,620
I liked that.

212
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,600
I think you were the first person

213
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,210
to treat me that way.

214
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,840
Live a long life.

215
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,250
Don't work too hard.

216
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:28,060
That brief confusion saved you.

217
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,930
He's slacking too much because one person died.

218
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,400
I guess he can't do any work right now.

219
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,590
It's fun while playing, but the end feels so futile.

220
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,940
I don't like that.

221
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:36,330
I thought I could become friends with you for some reason, Hyungnim.

222
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,960
What a shame.

223
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:24,650
The dead man is back! The ghost is driving!

224
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,180
You're so not funny.

225
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,650
Imagine a ghost turning the blinkers on and braking.

226
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:33,630
It'd be funny when you're about to sleep. No sleep for you tonight!

227
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,620
Did you get the result?

228
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,920
I identified the strangers who came to your funeral.

229
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,690
They're all from the same service company.

230
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,550
And all of them work for this company.

231
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,390
It's Black Sun.

232
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,120
Black Sun? The famous club in Gangnam?

233
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,780
Why would a club go after Mr. Kim?

234
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,460
I didn't think you were like that, Mr. Kim.

235
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,290
Did you do dine-and-dash there?

236
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,070
Hyungnim!

237
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,520
I guess we upset them somehow.

238
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,880
People in that dark world hate it when others enter their territory or business.

239
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,420
Don't you agree?

240
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,710
What is this?

241
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,300
I made a good point just now, didn't I?

242
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,500
One more thing.

243
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,690
Mr. Kim, you told us to

244
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,900
keep an eye on the person who makes moves after you die.
 

245
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,750
Resignation letter?

246
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,160
 

247
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,440
Did Mr. On quit?

248
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,130
The one who made a move right away was near us.

249
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:49,120
Maybe he quit because he was so sad

250
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,150
that Mr. Kim suddenly got into an accident?

251
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:55,200
There were too many things that were fishy to be that.

252
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,940
 What are you doing in there right now? 

253
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:09,410
He found our secret passageway, too.

254
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,710
 

255
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,840
 

256
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,920
 

257
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,950
I visited the previous workplaces and addresses

258
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,340
he listed on the resume he submitted.

259
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,910
But no one knew anyone named On Ha Joon.

260
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,450
Apparently, his phone number doesn't exist, either.

261
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,880
S-So you mean Mr. On

262
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,470
tried to kill Mr. Kim?

263
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,460
They say you can never know what a person is really thinking.

264
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,750
He approached us with a different motive from the get-go.

265
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,450
I'm glad I didn't make friends with him.

266
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:15,000
This bastard! We treated him so nicely!

267
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,940
This is no good! I won't just leave him alone once we catch him!

268
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,760
How would we catch him? All of this is fake, apparently.

269
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:30,200
The clue is probably over there.

270
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,210
Long time no see! Please come inside.

271
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,480
Okay!

272
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:15,640
Hold on, Mr. Kim!

273
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,080
You aren't going in there dressed like that, right?

274
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,710
Why? Is it weird?

275
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:27,330
Just be honest. You've never been to a club, right?

276
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:30,120
Well, it's not exactly my cup of tea.

277
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,910
You only studied, right? It's so obvious.

278
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,870
How could you dress like that...

279
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,890
Okay!

280
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,570
The ones who didn't study can go instead.

281
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:44,930
Yes. Mr. Kim is dead.

282
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,070
Leave it to us.

283
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:49,240
We just need to go in and tell you the situation there, right?

284
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,940
Will you really go in?

285
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,400
What's that? I've never seen that before.

286
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,070
My gosh!

287
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,780
Since when was this here?

288
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,360
Did...

289
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:06,530
you put this here, Mr. Kim?

290
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:10,520
I thought you could use a friend when you're alone.

291
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,780
What is this?

292
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,450
It's soft and feels nice.

293
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,070
Okay. Let's get it.

294
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,750
Let's get it.

295
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:29,850
Show me the cash...

296
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,870
I'm not sure about this.

297
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,550
- I was a minor ages ago.
- Okay.

298
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,110
Let's show them.

299
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,790
Looks like you don't have a server.

300
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,380
There's no passage this way.

301
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,460
There is one here.

302
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,240
There's a karaoke around the corner.

303
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,340
Please go there instead.

304
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,150
- The thing is-
- Okay, okay, okay.

305
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,120
It's my turn.

306
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,570
Hey!

307
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:24,530
Hey. What's up, man?

308
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:27,880
What's up, my bro! What's up, my bro!

309
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,730
Drink beer with that. Get it?

310
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,050
Stop acting goofy while I'm still nice.

311
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,960
Go to that bar, I said.

312
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,280
We shall go there...

313
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,000
I do love fishcakes.

314
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,520
We're more of a soju type. We need soju!

315
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,940
A place like this doesn't suit us.

316
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,460
- Thank you! Thank you!
- Thank you, Hyung!

317
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,420
- Okay!
- It doesn't suit us.

318
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:08,300
I knew this would happen since you were overconfident.

319
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,770
I guess I've been studying too hard, too.

320
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:13,820
The dead Kim Do Gi would be better off, right?

321
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,120
He had already left.

322
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,660
When? Where? I didn't see him at the entrance.

323
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,250
He said he'd go to the other entrance.

324
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:23,280
He thanked you two for diverting attention.

325
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,650
Yo, yo, yo!

326
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,050
He didn't have to thank us.

327
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,420
Let's get it.

328
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,480
Let's get it!

329
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,670
Stay still, you little punk!

330
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,650
Aigoo!

331
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,090
This annoying little trashy journo.

332
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,530
Hey, which way did you enter this time?

333
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:17,120
I tried to block you off. How come you're so good at finding mouse holes?

334
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,100
You're not a human, are you?

335
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,200
You're a mouse, aren't you?

336
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,900
Even if I let you go, you'd crawl back again anyway!

337
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,120
Let's have a drink before you die.

338
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:37,130
A rat is drinking it up.

339
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,220
Stop!

340
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:43,480
Call 911 and tell them some drunk bastard fell of a building.

341
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,480
Okay.

342
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,210
You bastard!

343
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,920
You bastard!

344
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,360
Bastard!

345
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:56,090
Seriously...

346
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,740
What the hell?

347
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,810
Who are you, you bastard?

348
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,220
Are you okay?q

349
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,930
Who are you?

350
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,120
Can you get up?

351
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,820
What?

352
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,400
Geez!

353
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,220
No!

354
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,140
Hey.

355
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,430
What are you? Huh?

356
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,440
How dare you butt in and ruin everything?

357
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,140
It could've worked!

358
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,620
Geez!

359
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,900
He saved him. What's this now?

360
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,450
He should be thanking him.

361
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,690
Is he into self-inflicted injuries?

362
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:17,060
How annoying.

363
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,890
We should find another entrance.

364
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,950
Should I tell you about the other entrance?

365
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,750
 It's taking a while. 

366
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,780
- We should get a drink!
- Yes.

367
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,980
What's this?

368
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,460
Geez! Hyung!

369
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,360
Hyung! What happened to your face?

370
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,420
Which bastard did this?

371
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,840
 

372
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,050
You know, the man from the rooftop?

373
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,990
His name is Kim Yong Min.

374
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:52,120
He was a reporter for Hanbaek Newspaper.

375
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,840
He won a reporting award, and he was pretty successful.

376
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,860
But he got fired because he got caught accepting a bribe.

377
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,690
He ended up becoming a typical trashy reporter.

378
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:04,220
You'd be better off not getting involved with him.

379
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,660
He didn't look that bad.

380
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:27,530
- It suits you well.
- Would this be acceptable?

381
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:33,690
Wow, it suits you too well. I think everyone at the club will stare at you.

382
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,190
You think so?

383
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:47,520
This way.

384
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,990
 

385
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,370
- Him?
- Yes, this way.

386
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,440
Mr. Kim Do Gi?

387
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:08,600
Let me take you inside. Follow me.

388
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,880
Do you know how much the cheapest table costs?

389
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,090
How much is it?

390
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,090
Three million won.

391
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,400
Apparently, you lose your table if someone else pays 3.5 million.

392
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,780
What is this, an auction?

393
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,810
How strange.

394
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:48,440
It won't be easy to come here twice.

395
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:58,040
I told you that everyone would stare at you.

396
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,230
Oppa, you've never been here before, right?

397
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,080
You should wear a designer jumpsuit next time.

398
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,010
That would be better.

399
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,340
No one wears a suit to go to a club anymore.

400
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:14,070
It'd be uncomfortable to dance on the stage, too.

401
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:16,530
And people might get the wrong idea.

402
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,670
What do you mean?

403
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,610
You're not wearing a name tag.

404
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,990
What's your number?

405
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:24,880
 

406
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,850
He's a guest.

407
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:32,400
Sorry, I thought you were a bodyguard because you dressed like one.

408
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,890
Have a good time!

409
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,390
Go Eun. Be honest with me.

410
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,610
You've never been to a club, right?

411
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,630
Well, I...

412
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:56,260
I was busy studying a lot.

413
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,350
- I don't think studying is the only thing she did, though.
- I know!

414
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:01,190
I can hear you!

415
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,730
Really?

416
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,020
Would you like to sit down?

417
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,290
Beer?

418
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,690
This table costs 3 million won?

419
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,930
I think even 300,000 won would be too much.

420
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,960
That was the cheapest one.

421
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,750
You see the tables facing you?

422
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,550
 That one costs 5 million won. 

423
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:02,810
And the tables in front of the stage are 7 million won.

424
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:05,050
 Try looking above you. 

425
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,280
That table that looks down at the entire stage is exactly

426
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,740
10 million won.

427
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,250
They're so impressive, aren't they?

428
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:19,600
I was torn paying 100,000 for a wooden bench at the mountain valley.

429
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,180
Wow.

430
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,970
Who did he come with?

431
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,930
The two bodyguards who just came in

432
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,430
are the ones who came to the funeral, right?

433
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,190
Just one sec.

434
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,090
Yes, they are.

435
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:53,230
Wouldn't they recognize you?

436
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,630
It's hard to remember a face after seeing the funeral photo once.

437
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:00,790
They're more likely to recognize you than me.

438
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,290
Because you were the chief mourner.

439
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:04,990
Right, I was the chief mourner.

440
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,310
Here's your beer.

441
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:11,110
Thank you.

442
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,190
What do you think? Do you think it's fun?

443
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,390
You're already not having fun, are you?

444
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:19,720
What's with her now?

445
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:24,120
Anything can be scanned with just one object in here.

446
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,790
Scan?

447
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:31,920
Your salary is 40 million won at most.

448
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,650
You used your entire paycheck to get a table here

449
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,590
and even got new clothes, but you're not matching with anyone.

450
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,270
You're starting to think you wasted your money.

451
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:42,510
Right, Oppa?

452
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,840
You're impressive.

453
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,390
I can't lie to you.

454
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,300
Everyone here looks the same because

455
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,910
they're all mingling with each other, right?

456
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,070
No.

457
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,840
This is strictly hierarchical society.

458
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:59,960
Everyone from noblemen to slaves is all here.

459
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,300
The rich are the noblemen and aristocrats

460
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:06,380
and the poor are the commoners and slaves.

461
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,370
What's the deal? Why categorize people like that?

462
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:10,590
How about her?

463
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:13,170
How impressive could she be?

464
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:17,120
You see that table, right?

465
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:21,560
They're pretending to be aristocrats, but they're actually slaves.

466
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,820
They split the payment to get a table.

467
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:26,700
But that won't work anyway.

468
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,260
They get caught right away.

469
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:32,240
You can't fool anyone in here.

470
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,120
So the people who are standing over there are the aristocrats?

471
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,210
Well, they're not aristocrats, but they're noblemen.

472
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,990
Aristocrats don't share space with the commoners.

473
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:23,530
You're an aristocrat if you can order that.

474
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,670
What's this?

475
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,850
Mr. Kim, don't be shocked.

476
00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:01,760
That whole setup costs 18 million won!

477
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,970
Are they out of their minds?

478
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,100
It's the Emperor's Set.

479
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:11,000
That alone costs 180 million won.

480
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,430
What?

481
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,120
1, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, 1 million, 10 million...

482
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,780
It's really 180 million won!

483
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:27,070
The downpayment for my apartment was 160,000 won. Why?

484
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:28,980
What's the deal?

485
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,670
 Here you go. 

486
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,630
 Bye, sir! 

487
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,550
 

488
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:22,630
Another commoner is calling me, trying to climb the class ladder.

489
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,170
When the Peak Time comes, you're going to

490
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:33,630
get screened out anyway.

491
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,650
So have fun until then!

492
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:01,570
You should do your job well.

493
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:05,300
Yes.

494
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:13,380
The people we need are all going that way.

495
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,590
Which room are you going to?

496
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:33,540
Well, I just wanted to look around.

497
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,960
I'm sorry. This place is for VIPs only.

498
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,120
Regular customers aren't allowed in here.

499
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,850
I see.

500
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,110
Okay.

501
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,730
Gyung Hoon!

502
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:45,960
You came!

503
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,710
There're more places you aren't allowed in even after you get in.

504
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:51,140
You'd just waste time by circling around like this.

505
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,040
 What should we do? 

506
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,170
We need to close the distance, as you said.

507
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:59,640
How will we close the distance?

508
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,570
Will you make friends with a VIP or something?

509
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:05,110
Victor oppa, you're here early.

510
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:07,900
- Where is it?
- Over there.

511
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,270
That's a good idea.

512
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,200
- I'll count on you, Go Eun.
- You'll count on me...

513
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:22,780
What? What is it?

514
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,620
 Mr. Kim, I don't think that's a good idea! 

515
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,040
Mr. Kim! Hold on!

516
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,850
Buddy!

517
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:36,510
This is crazy...

518
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:38,600
Good to see you!

519
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,390
 

520
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:50,280
What? Is he a celebrity?

521
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,270
How will he make friends with a celebrity?

522
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,740
Who?

523
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,460
Victor oppa, do you know him?

524
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:03,410
How long has it been?

525
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:08,100
I never would've thought I'd run into you here!

526
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,330
Well...

527
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,730
Do you not recognize me?

528
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,940
Buddy!

529
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,950
It's me, Kim Do Gi! Kim Do Gi!

530
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,930
Geez.

531
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,480
How long has it been?

532
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:35,610
Excuse me. I don't know who you are!

533
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:39,700
How disappointing.

534
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:43,560
- Pork rind!
- I grilled so much pork rind for you.

535
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:51,770
When you won 1st place in the trainees' quarterly announcement,

536
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:54,140
I was so happy for you!

537
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:57,660
Although I was in 11th place, the last place...

538
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:02,770
Mr. Kim! I sent you a photo!

539
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:04,520
This is so embarrassing!

540
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:08,320
I didn't want to show you this photo because it's so humiliating!

541
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,800
Geez.

542
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:17,320
I cheer myself up by looking at this photo whenever things don't work out.

543
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,330
Because you were my role model.

544
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:21,470
And you still are.

545
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:31,590
Geez.

546
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:33,240
Shit. I remember!

547
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,410
It's been a long time, Kim Do Gi!

548
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,650
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you. I'm so sorry!

549
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:39,570
- I thought I was dying.
 - As you know, 

550
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:42,900
there were countless trainees who'd come and go, am I right?

551
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:46,410
Yes! I'm one of those who'd come

552
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,110
and go.

553
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:49,810
Come and go!

554
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:53,240
Kim Do Gi! I remember I was in 1st place. I do.

555
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,620
This is crazy!

556
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:58,720
Yes, I was always in 1st place, and you were always in last place!

557
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,940
- I'm feeling good! Let's drink for now!
- Okay!

558
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,390
- Give me a glass.
- Yes, get him one.

559
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:05,580
Raise your glasses! Geez!

560
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,290
For...

561
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:09,140
 Victor! 

562
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,260
I'm feeling stoked!

563
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,330
That was so quick.

564
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:18,850
You're annoying. Looks like you're feeling it tonight.

565
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:20,310
Is the thing you prepared ready yet?

566
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:22,740
- It's almost done!
- Bring it over quickly!

567
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,820
So, we can make some candy!

568
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,740
It's done. It's all done! Get up!

569
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:29,540
Let's go, let's go!

570
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:36,560
 Let's go! 

571
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:45,370
Hey, how did you manage to get us in?

572
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,670
Hurry up and come up with a solution, man!

573
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,790
What else could there be, man?

574
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:52,090
It's all money.

575
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:56,130
I got us the special pass by maxing out my mom's card.

576
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:58,460
Geez, what a treat for high schoolers.

577
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,620
Let's go!

578
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:03,180
- You're paying, then?
- Of course!

579
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:06,010
This place is full of surprises.

580
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:11,540
 

581
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,300
Hey, tell them to come over here immediately!

582
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,080
Yes, got it!

583
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:40,030
Don't let anyone in Room No. 7!

584
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,130
Put your heads down.

585
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,570
Hey.

586
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,570
I told you to screen out the place because

587
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:56,170
there'll be an important event soon, didn't I?

588
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:57,830
- I'm sorry!
- I'm sorry.

589
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:00,780
How dare you phone in like this?

590
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,250
You'd better get it together!

591
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,790
Hey!

592
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:06,600
You punk.

593
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,340
I told you not to let that trashy journo in again,

594
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,670
but you got beaten up instead!

595
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:15,330
I'll catch that bastard and prepare properly.

596
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:17,850
Okay, get up.

597
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:20,640
Prepare?

598
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,730
Prepare?

599
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,480
Hyungnim, what is it?

600
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,940
Really?

601
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,280
Geez. Fine, then.

602
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,220
Send me the number, then.

603
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,130
Yes.

604
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:42,300
Hey.

605
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:45,180
Be careful not to mess with that trashy journo outside.

606
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,600
He always creates an alibi wherever he goes.

607
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,920
Do you think I told you to get rid of him yourselves for no reason?

608
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,780
Yes, we'll fix the situation.

609
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:54,750
The bastard who beat you.

610
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:57,510
- You don't remember his face?
- No.

611
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:00,380
It all happened too quickly.

612
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,300
Too quickly?

613
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,960
It happened too quickly?

614
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,280
Sorry, I'll use the restroom!

615
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:14,840
Is someone in there?

616
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,070
What are you doing here?

617
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:26,070
I came in because it was empty. It's so...

618
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:27,600
crowded now.

619
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:31,840
What are you doing here? Victor's room is Room No. 3.

620
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,860
I had to use the restroom urgently!

621
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:37,150
There's a restroom in that room, too!

622
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:40,400
Well, someone went in and won't come out!

623
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,100
I had to go so badly.

624
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,870
But still, you can't go into another room.

625
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:48,700
You're right. I'm sorry!

626
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,450
I'm sorry.

627
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:52,220
Follow me.

628
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,100
I'm tired!

629
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:09,060
Aren't you tired, Go Eun?

630
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:11,410
I'm tired.

631
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,660
Not anymore.

632
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:36,750
What are they doing, not going in?

633
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,100
What?

634
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,720
The police.

635
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,820
Mr. Kim reported Black Sun for letting minors in.

636
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:48,940
- They arrived earlier, but that's all they're doing.
- What's the deal?

637
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,540
Why aren't they going in?

638
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,820
- Hello?
- Was it you?

639
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,040
The punk who reported us?

640
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:13,390
Get him!

641
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,310
It wasn't me.

642
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,940
How did you get in?

643
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:32,740
Seriously...

644
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:35,900
Stand him up.

645
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:40,310
Hold on, hold on. At least tell me why I'm getting kicked out.

646
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:41,810
Why?

647
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:46,490
 Why? 

648
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,750
You punk...

649
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:52,070
We protect Mr. Kim!

650
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:53,960
- No!
- What do you mean, no?

651
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,580
He told us not to come, no matter what!

652
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,510
Are you sure we don't have to?

653
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:05,760
Why are the police just sitting there? What are they doing?

654
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,510
What are you doing? Hold him!

655
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:09,380
Geez!

656
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,550
Seriously!

657
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:14,540
My stomach!

658
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,270
Aigoo!

659
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:20,370
Aigoo! I'm dying!

660
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:23,400
Excuse me! Call the police! Call them!

661
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,380
Geez! Is this allowed? You can't do this!

662
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,550
Aigoo!

663
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:30,760
Call the police!

664
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,420
Hyungnim. Come out.

665
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:37,430
Here.

666
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:39,150
Aigoo, who called us?

667
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:40,590
Here.

668
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,740
There's been a report...

669
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,610
- Are you okay? Can you get up?
- Aigoo!

670
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:52,280
Can you get up? Are you okay?

671
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:59,840
- What's going on?
- You're under arrest for obstruction of public business.

672
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:07,880
What kind of situation is this now?

673
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:16,860
We'll get going unless you have other complaints.

674
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,450
Thank you!

675
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:38,980
i saw it with my own eyes, but I still can't believe it.

676
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:45,570
Hello!

677
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:46,910
I was going to visit you myself.

678
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:48,780
Don't say that.

679
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:52,090
I asked you for a difficult favor when you're busy. I should be coming to you.

680
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:54,960
- Let's go in first.
- Shall we? Let's.

681
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,830
I tested different kinds of explosions based on the photos you sent me.

682
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:01,700
It would've been nice to have tested on the same car,

683
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:04,880
but we conducted the test in the same condition.

684
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,940
The explosion pattern varies depending on the kind of gunpowder, amount, and form.

685
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:12,920
We can find out the source of the explosive using this.

686
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:16,250
Is it like a fingerprint in a person?

687
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:19,410
Yes. But this fingerprint is kind of rare.

688
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:22,290
The places that can deal with explosives are

689
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:24,630
the Ministry of National Defense, the National Intelligence Service, and the Ministry of the Interior and Safety.

690
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:26,610
There are just a few.

691
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:31,770
They look almost the same.

692
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:34,100
When I was preparing for a certificate for CFEI,

693
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,490
Certified Fire and Explosion Investigator in the US,

694
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,790
I came across this pattern the most.

695
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:42,390
It's called C4. It's an explosive for special purposes.

696
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:48,340
The place that deals with an explosive of this kind in the country is...

697
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:50,540
It's a small explosive that's usually used for counterterrorism

698
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,760
by the Ministry of the Interior and Safety.

699
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,970
By "counterterrorism by the Ministry of the Interior and Safety..."

700
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:58,280
Is it the police?

701
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:01,290
That is what the evidence says.

702
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:03,060
 You know that Kang Pil Seung case. 

703
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:05,140
 It's a really strange case, as you said. 

704
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:08,920
 The fact that they closed the case as a simple suicide 

705
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:12,280
 means the investigation was already polluted, too. 

706
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,780
Sir?

707
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,220
Yes.

708
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,180
Thank you!

709
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,980
I made a difficult request, but you helped me without even asking me why.

710
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:22,380
Because the reason isn't important.

711
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:25,950
Compared to what Blue Bird did for my family,

712
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:28,750
this is nothing.

713
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,620
I'm even more grateful to hear you say that.

714
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:39,090
The source of the explosive was...

715
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:41,630
the police?

716
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,720
 

717
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:50,230
I'm the one who reported them. Why did you arrest me?

718
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,570
I already told you everything.

719
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:56,260
You were arrested for obstruction of public business and property damage.

720
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:57,910
What damage?

721
01:00:57,910 --> 01:01:01,080
What did I damage exactly?

722
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:05,400
What happened to the report I made regarding the minors?

723
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,480
There is no such a report.

724
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,660
There must be.

725
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:12,020
Stop making stuff up.

726
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:14,780
Just don't damage other people's property.

727
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:18,110
You look like a stand-up guy.

728
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:21,370
You won't trust me, who reported them for letting in minors.

729
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:24,420
But you trust an employee at the club that I damaged their property.

730
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:27,750
But you didn't even go inside the club.

731
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:31,440
Look. Just answer my questions.

732
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:36,190
Hey!

733
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:40,450
We got his testimony. Okay, got it.

734
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,270
Hey!

735
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:46,260
Did you say your name is Kim Do Gi?

736
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:58,790
From now on, you were arrested for sexually assaulting a club worker.

737
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:01,450
You should've just behaved yourself.

738
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:05,490
Why stir things up and bother everyone?

739
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:14,200
You're totally f***ed now.

740
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:26,400
 Thanks for watching Taxi Driver 2 on Viki! 

741
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,000
♫  I'll find out before I awake  ♫

742
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,090
♫  Take me away, take me away  ♫

743
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:34,920
♫  You don't have to tell me  ♫

744
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:42,910
♫  Your eyes already told me clearly  ♫

745
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:53,030
♫  Those painful nights were so cruel to me  ♫

746
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:55,130
♫  I remember clearly  ♫

747
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:57,230
 

748
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:59,220
 Don't ever come near Black Sun anymore. 

749
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:00,890
 How strange. How strange. 

750
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:02,810
 I need to go inside Black Sun one more time. 

751
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:04,480
 Who the hell is he? 

752
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:08,120
 Teach him well. 

753
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,990
 Didn't you say you're not a bodyguard? 

754
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,580
 I am now. 

755
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,720
 You'll be guarding the VIPs from now on. 

756
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,730
 Protect the bottle with your number on it. 

757
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:18,760
 If the bottle breaks, you're breaking, too. 

758
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,410
 The delivery is running late. Hurry up. 

759
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:22,540
 "The delivery is running late?" What's he talking about? 

760
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:26,030
 If you left the woman there, something terrible would happen to her. 

761
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:27,700
 He tested positive for the drug test. 

762
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:31,070
 Why would a club that makes billions of won per year supply drugs? 

763
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:32,120
 Choi Sung Hoon. 

764
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,910
 He was murdered trying to reveal the truth! 

765
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:37,360
 I have nothing left anymore! 

766
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:41,590
 Someone like him, who needs help, is why we exist. 

767
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:45,800
♫  I'll never hesitate before I die  ♫
