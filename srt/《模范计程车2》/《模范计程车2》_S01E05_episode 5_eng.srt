1
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,930
 

2
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,870
 

3
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,800
 

4
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,900
- Up there, up there!
- Yes.

5
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,670
Wasn't she there?

6
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,080
- I don't see her around here.
- Geez...

7
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,490
That little thing is so fast.

8
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,260
Call her mom and tell her to file a missing person report.

9
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,720
Okay.

10
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,170
Let's go.

11
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,100
 

12
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:02,800


13
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,230
Excuse me!

14
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,730
Do Gi hyungnim! Did you live here?

15
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,950
Well, I moved in downstairs.

16
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,930
I heard that you live around here.

17
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,220
I would've brought something nicer if I knew it was you.

18
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,930
Anyway, please take this for now.

19
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,650
I'll treat you properly next time!

20
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,780
Should I help you if you need to move stuff?

21
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,420
No, I just need to bring a few packages from work.

22
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,800
Hyungnim, is it okay if I visit you often?

23
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,670
Okay.

24
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,020
I'll let you rest.

25
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,700
Let's see...

26
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,150
 

27
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:29,480
 

28
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,910
What?

29
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,620
What's this?

30
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,360
There's something underneath.

31
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,240
It looks like it goes down, but it won't.

32
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,470
 

33
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,610
I blocked the entry through the elevator.

34
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,100
Yes, thank you.

35
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,410
Do we need to use this door only from now on?

36
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,470
Yes, let's use that door for now, even though it's inconvenient.

37
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,440
What a bother.

38
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,140
That Driver On is making me work out because of his silly curiosity.

39
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,760
Come on, he's still young. Let's be nice to him.

40
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,200
Yes.

41
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,940
He doesn't look like it, but he's such a troublemaker.

42
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,360
I thought he looked like it, too.

43
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,920
You're jealous because he's handsome.

44
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,010
I'm more handsome. Come on!

45
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,600
I moved most of the big stuff.

46
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,880
Yes, we should've done this already.

47
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,690
This is such a nice, big house.

48
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,350
Should we take this out, too?

49
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,950
Yes, let's take that out, too.

50
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,740
- Let me help you.
- Let's go.

51
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,450
 One, two, three! 

52
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,660
We need to call a moving company.

53
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,760
I'll call a moving company.

54
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,560
Let's move these.

55
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,710
Will you really be okay? You used to like this a lot.

56
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,930
A major cleaning should be spontaneous without too much thinking.

57
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,530
If I think too much, I can neither throw things away,

58
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,940
nor change things.

59
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,280
I ordered a big dining table, too.

60
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,430
We should have meals together and have work dinners, too.

61
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,680
Yes.

62
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,720
It'd be nice if Go Eun lived upstairs, too, instead of living alone outside.

63
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,610
But she said she didn't want to.

64
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,380
What do you say? Do you want to move in instead?

65
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,070
I'll think about it.

66
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,460
Go Eun!

67
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,070
The card reader doesn't work. I think it's broken.

68
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,800
Broken?

69
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,180
Give me your card.

70
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,960
It really doesn't work. It worked fine this morning.

71
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,120
By the way,

72
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,430
you know that storage room?

73
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,520
It worked fine this morning. What's the deal?

74
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,450
What did you say?

75
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,780
Well, nothing!

76
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,660
Just leave your card. I'll make a note.

77
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,260
Yes, I'll go home, then.

78
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,800
Yes.

79
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,990
Right, Mr. On!

80
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,970
You said you moved recently, right?

81
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,110
Yes.

82
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,770
Let's go together, Mr. Kim.

83
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,310
Didn't you say you're checking out apartments?

84
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,640
Mr. On moved recently. I wanted to get help from someone experienced.

85
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,280
Aren't you forcing him to come along?

86
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,840
No, I'm not!

87
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,720
No, right?

88
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,410
- Well, I felt that way a bit until I got in the car.
- Geez!

89
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,520
But I changed my mind after getting in Do Gi hyung's car.

90
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,100
I'll go check things out thoroughly.

91
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,620
See? You're wrong.

92
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,940
This is a bit...

93
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,080
Wow, there's a lot of storage space.

94
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,670
It'd be easy to organize things and live neatly.

95
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,220
What direction does this place face?

96
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,680
It's South that way.

97
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,710
It'd be cool in summer and warm in winter.

98
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:31,020
You look young, but you know a lot about these things.

99
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,850
Nothing blocks the window, right?

100
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:42,070
Even the lower-level units get a lot of sun and airflow.

101
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,620
That's good.

102
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,210
Can I see the master bedroom?

103
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,650
This way.

104
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,680
I thought about applying for the first-time buyer's program,

105
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,380
but the interest went up too much.

106
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,860
I don't know if I can afford the mortgage with my paycheck.

107
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,710
I heard Mr. Jang told you to move in.

108
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,450
How about you move to the second floor?

109
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,550
To be honest, I'd like to,

110
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,840
but I don't think Mr. Jang could relax.

111
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,930
He'd probably go grocery shopping trying to feed me every meal.

112
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,170
It's so obvious.

113
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,990
I think he would, too.

114
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,170
I think I skimmed through most things.

115
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,660
I think that was too thorough to call it "skimming through."

116
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,270
Yes.

117
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,370
- By the way-
- I know that

118
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,450
Rainbow Taxi has only been putting out public service ad

119
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,870
for missing children and charity ads.

120
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,170
But I know the drivers who drive for a long time

121
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,350
suffer a lot from joint pains.

122
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:43,060
Just imagine you have this in the taxi.

123
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,660
How useful would that be?

124
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,220
- Mr. Jang.
- Yes.

125
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,900
I think we need to check on the engine on those cars-

126
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,140
This is...

127
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,470
This is supposed to be good for this, right?

128
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,510
Look. A lot of people already know about it.

129
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,740
- This is a sample, right?
- Yes.

130
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,830
Can I try one, then?

131
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,540
Of course, as much as you want.

132
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,350
What? As much as I want?

133
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,920
Well, that's not what I meant!

134
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,130
Excuse me! Sir! Just one second!

135
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,830
Excuse me!

136
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,500
Aigoo. Mr. Park!

137
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,610
 

138
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,100
I love apartment hunting. You get a lot of gifts, too.

139
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,060
Mr. On is so good and thorough at apartment hunting.

140
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,570
I've checked out many places since I've been on my own since young.

141
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,610
When did you move out?

142
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,200
When you were 20?

143
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,860
When I was really young.

144
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,260
When you were in high school?

145
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,950
Well, when I was really young.

146
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,370
I see...

147
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,290
Gosh...

148
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,450
That apartment below Mr. Kim's was so nice.

149
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,130
I inquired about it,

150
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:55,080
but someone already signed the contract only a few days ago.

151
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,210
The apartment below Do Gi hyungnim's is...

152
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,460
Do you mean Unit 303?

153
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,340
How did you know?

154
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,960
By chance, are you the one who took that apartment-

155
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,660
That's right. It's me.

156
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,020
What the hell? Mr. On!

157
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,040
- Swap with me.
- I can't!

158
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,330
I used to live there!

159
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,730
Mr. Kim, put in a word for me, so it's fair.

160
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,330
How is that fair? I signed the contract first.

161
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,660
Don't you think, Hyungnim?

162
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,010
I don't feel comfortable getting involved...

163
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,150
Geez!

164
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,080
Mr. On, you should give it up since you're nice.

165
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,860
If so...

166
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,080
I'd rather be not nice.

167
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,710
Don't be like that!

168
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,480
I was going to move back in. I just moved out for a moment!

169
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,590
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,370
Seriously, that's my place!

171
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,420
I'm sorry. Are you guys okay?

172
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,690
I'm okay. What was that just now?

173
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,690
Are you okay?

174
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,430
Are you hurt at all?

175
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,210
Did you get hurt at all?

176
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,370
Hold on!

177
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,660
Kid!

178
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,100
Hey!

179
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,110
Come on out, Kid!

180
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,390
- Hello!
- Come on out, Kid!

181
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,480
You must've been very scared.

182
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,180
I'm sorry.

183
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,340
Are you hurt at all?

184
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,720
I need to go to So Mang.

185
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,510
Who's she?

186
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,390
I think she got lost.

187
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,380
You should go to the police station then. Why did you bring her here?

188
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,300
She didn't want to go to the police station.

189
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,240
I left her information at the patrol unit nearby.

190
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,230
We brought her here because Go Eun wanted to,

191
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,530
- but is this okay?
- I'm glad you did.

192
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,170
Hello.

193
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,100
Have a look at that thing on the window over there.

194
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,110
 

195
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,180
We keep children safe here.

196
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,240
So you can rest assured.

197
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,740
I didn't notice that.

198
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,400
Do you know your parents' phone number or address by chance?

199
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,870
You can't just ask her like that.

200
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,790
Stuff like this works for children.

201
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,540
Should I...

202
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,140
show you a magic trick?

203
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,270
Here it comes, here it comes!

204
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,730
There's nothing on it, right? There's nothing on it.

205
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,070
All right...

206
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,740
Look carefully.

207
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:47,540
One, two, three!

208
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,570
What? What? What's this?

209
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,120
What's this?

210
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,860
- Ta-da!
- How did you do it?

211
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,830
Huh? How-

212
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,430
What are you doing with her? You're scaring her!

213
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,860
A magic trick!

214
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,320
Are you okay?

215
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,980
Aren't you hungry?

216
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,630
Here.

217
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,160
Should we have some of this? Do you like milk?

218
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,060
Do you want some?

219
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,150
You don't really like it?

220
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,580
Should I get you something else?

221
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,510
What do you like?

222
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,680
Huh?

223
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,520
What happened?

224
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,690
We're not sure why, but she was afraid to go to the police station.

225
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,710
Afraid?

226
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,150
She lost her younger sibling, too.

227
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,900
The name is So Mang.

228
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,680
Yes.

229
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,360
Yes, yes. We did file the report.

230
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,110
She's with us right now.

231
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,240
The name is Hwang Seo Yeon?

232
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,950
It's okay.

233
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,880
What's going on?

234
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,580
She suddenly got scared by something while eating bread.

235
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,690
She won't come out of there.

236
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,630
Why are you holding that?

237
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:22,610
I was preparing for the next magic trick.

238
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,330
I think you should put that away first.

239
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,050
This?

240
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,590
This is... Ta-da! Something like that.

241
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,440
Is your name...

242
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,060
Hwang Seo Yeon?

243
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,550
Yes.

244
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:47,570
Your mom apparently called looking for you.

245
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,590
I need to go to So Mang.

246
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,130
I need to go give her a hug.

247
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:57,650
Isn't So Mang with Mom right now?

248
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,940
Mom doesn't know who So Mang is.

249
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,250
Please don't tell Uncle!

250
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,630
Uncle?

251
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,180
I won't go to Mom.

252
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,810
I need to hurry up and find So Mang.

253
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,010
You don't need to go anywhere if you don't want to.

254
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,820
I won't ask you any more questions, either.

255
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,230
You didn't forget what kind of place this is, right?

256
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,890
 

257
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,690
I think I should stop by Seo Yeon's parents' place.

258
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,510
I think so, too.

259
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,440
I think it'd be a good idea to check in person.

260
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,190
Yes. I'll be right back.

261
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,520
Okay.

262
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,420
 

263
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,150
You reported Seo Yeon as missing, right?

264
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,480
I did because I was told to,

265
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,900
but nothing bad would happen to us, right?

266
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,950
Of course not!

267
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,450
Don't worry about it.

268
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,250
Mr. Kang told us to bring this to you.

269
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,070
Have some in the evening with your husband.

270
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,180
Yes.

271
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,150
We'll get going now, then.

272
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,850
How did they manage their child anyway?

273
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:31,950
What a hassle.

274
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,830
The elevator!

275
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,100
 - Yes. 
- Go Eun, are you with the child right now?

276
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,570
Yes, Seo Yeon is with me.

277
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,310
Could you send me a picture of her profile?

278
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,140
Why?

279
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,580
What's it about?

280
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,660
I need to check something.

281
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,400
Hello, I'd like to ask you a question.

282
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,010
We're playing hide and seek, but I can't find her.

283
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,390
What? Who is it?

284
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,720
Hello.

285
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,700
Have you seen this child by chance?

286
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,700
No, I haven't.

287
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,950
I haven't, either.

288
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,390
Why is he looking for his child at someone else's house?

289
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,510
Geez, my head! What should we do?

290
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,820
The parents didn't recognize Seo Yeon?

291
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,920
It's hard to recognize someone unless they've seen each other often.

292
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,460
I think they filed a missing persons report through someone else, too.

293
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,380
Through someone else?

294
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,200
Where is this person right now?

295
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,950
In front of me.

296
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,120
I'm sure they'd do something again.

297
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,380
Hurry, hurry!

298
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,680
Hurry up! There's no time!

299
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,420
Who set the table? It's all messed up.

300
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,480
Let me...

301
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,970
Look at this dust! Wipe this, too!

302
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,410
Let's go!

303
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,940
We have great options!

304
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,420
 

305
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,970
 

306
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,400
 

307
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:19,000
 

308
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,100
Welcome!

309
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,090
- You're married, right?
- No.

310
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,190
If you're not, we'll have to pass.

311
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,930
Please go to another booth.

312
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,650
Please go someplace else.

313
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,640
- Take a look at this.
- No, thank you.

314
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,790
Aigoo, sorry for all the trouble!

315
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,890
Don't mention it. I get confused, too.

316
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,230
How about Hwang Seo Yeon, who you've been keeping-

317
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,310
The child they have is Han Seo Hyeon.

318
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,270
And Hwang Seo Yeon is the one we received a report on.

319
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,120
See? You're confused, too.

320
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,000
Han Seo Hyeon reunited with the guardian and went back home.

321
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,460
- I hope you find Hwang Seo Yeon, too.
- Yes.

322
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,060
 

323
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,650
She said her uncles took her.

324
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,900
Did she get kidnapped?

325
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,120
Well, let's go through this again.

326
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,240
Seo Yeon is looking for So Mang right now.

327
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,600
- Where's So Mang?
- Probably with her mom.

328
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,020
The parents didn't recognize Seo Yeon. They probably don't know who So Mang is, either.

329
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,270
They reported her as missing.

330
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,420
The people who don't know her filed the report.

331
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,660
How would they file a report if they don't know her?

332
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,830
- If so, the ones who know her did.
- Like who?

333
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,830
Seo Yeon's parents!

334
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,050
Her parents didn't recognize her, apparently!

335
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,970
How could they file a report if they don't know her?

336
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,830
Stop going in circles! You're confusing me.

337
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,790
I can't figure this out. I don't get it!

338
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,830
I don't get it, either.

339
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,470
Who's taking care of Seo Yeon right now?

340
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,130
Mr. Oh is watching her for now.

341
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,900
Mr. Kim, what do you think?

342
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,730
Thinking about it,

343
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,760
Seo Yeon has only been telling the truth all this time.

344
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,350
We're the ones who didn't understand her.

345
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:15,010
 Do you know your parents' phone number or address by chance? 

346
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:20,800
 Mom doesn't know who So Mang is. 

347
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,710
Shouldn't we contact the police at this point?

348
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,770
If we call the police, they'll contact the parents immediately.

349
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:30,350
To the parents who don't even recognize her? That can't happen.

350
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:34,440
If so, why don't we ask Seo Yeon more carefully?

351
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,580
No. Unless she approaches us first,

352
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,130
we should try not to ask her again.

353
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,490
Why?

354
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,100
The younger the child is, they tend to change their story the way

355
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,880
the questioner wants to hear it depending on how they were asked.

356
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,560
Because it's scary.

357
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,740
We have to wait until we're no longer scary to her.

358
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,900
 

359
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,680
Yes, Mr. Oh.

360
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,230
Pardon?

361
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,390
The child disappeared?

362
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:14,910
I stepped out to get coffee, thinking she was sleeping,

363
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,120
but she disappeared!

364
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,910
- I looked outside, but she wasn't there.
- She wasn't in the building, either.

365
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,410
Maybe she went out further.

366
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,770
She didn't leave the property.

367
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,880
Where did you go?

368
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,730
 

369
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,680
Since when were you there?

370
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,940
You must've heard us

371
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,960
talking.

372
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,650
Ahjussi,

373
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,730
you believe me, right?

374
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,640
Please find So Mang.

375
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,400
 

376
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,860
5283 in operation.

377
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:47,390
We've never been dispatched without any plan like this.

378
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,940
Mr. Kim, where are we going now?

379
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,340
We need to find So Mang.

380
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,130
- Where's So Mang?
- We don't know yet.

381
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,870
Where will we find her if we don't know?

382
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:02,300
We don't know where she is, but I know who I should visit first.

383
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,970
Who?

384
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:15,770
 

385
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:22,300
 

386
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,130
Geez, they blocked all that.

387
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,770
Open it.

388
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,030
The sun is strong.

389
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,650
 

390
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:51,930
Hello, sir!

391
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,680
Should we try moving that to the left?

392
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,780
No, no, my left. My left.

393
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,890
No, this way!

394
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,810
 Mr. Kang told us to bring this to you. 

395
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,910
 That's Mr. Kang, who made them report Seo Yeon as missing, right? 

396
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:17,680
 
Mr. Kang's real name is Kang Pil Seung.

397
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,430
Is that why the company name is "Feel Consulting?"

398
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,630
How thoughtless.

399
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,210
What's all this?

400
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:34,650
My gosh! Daebak!

401
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:39,640
Wow, the number of luxury apartments he owns in central Seoul is 37?

402
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,840
Wow, I've never seen anyone who owns this many apartments.

403
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,430
Wow, he owns buildings, too!

404
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:47,030
He's super-rich!

405
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,970
It was better before.

406
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,490
 

407
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,850
 

408
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:00,720
 

409
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,940
 

410
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,030
 

411
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,580
 

412
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,900
Is he really that great?

413
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:24,520
The ones who were picked by Mr. Kang 100% get an apartment!

414
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:28,480
But he only picks a few people he likes, apparently.

415
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,340
He's really impressive!

416
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,950
I know.

417
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,050
- Mr. Kang!
- Get in line.

418
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:37,120
You're overdoing it again. It's okay!

419
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,190
I came from Jeju Island to get your advice!

420
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,370
I'd like your autograph, please.

421
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:45,740
You came all this way just to see me?

422
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,800
Thank you so much!

423
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,550
It's such an honor. Please let me shake your hand.

424
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,130
Yes.

425
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,220
Thank you!

426
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,190
I hope you find my advice useful.

427
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:58,080
- Thank you! Thank you so much!
- Sure.

428
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,990
Come inside the lecture hall now. This way.

429
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,640
Everyone, be orderly.

430
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,220
Let's form two lines.

431
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:14,990
She was right in front of me. You acted too late! I'm not blind.

432
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,360
I'm sorry.

433
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,740
Here.

434
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,860
Block them sooner next time.

435
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,420
I'll be careful from now on.

436
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,420
You're all talk.

437
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,250
You can't go in without the tickets.

438
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:44,090
We were invited, but we forgot the tickets.

439
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:46,080
I'm sorry, you can't go in without the tickets.

440
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,620
We came a long way to see him. Can't you let us in?

441
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,300
- There are so many people like you. I'm sorry.
- I know, but...

442
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,110
Go ahead.

443
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:59,620
 

444
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,100
Go ahead.

445
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,940
Stop drinking it!

446
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,380
You have to drink it while it's fresh.

447
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,890
I looked into the parents who filed the missing person's report.

448
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,380
They supposedly adopted Seo Yeon recently.

449
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,220
She was adopted? Why didn't they recognize her then?

450
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,940
What does the real estate consulting company have to do with adoption?

451
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,460
Not much.

452
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,470
Not normally. But I think there's something in this case.

453
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,010
What?

454
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,540
Isn't that Se Yeon?

455
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,950
That's Seo Yeon! It's her!

456
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,440
This girl might be So Mang.

457
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,760
- What is this?
- What's this about?

458
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,320
Should we torture him to make him tell the truth?

459
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,750
Yes, Mr. Jang.

460
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,320
Hold on a sec!

461
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,060
Talk to me.

462
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,450
 I'm saying this out of concern. 

463
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,100
I think we need to be extra careful this time.

464
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,840
No matter what the truth is, it's all about the child in the end.

465
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,260
Yes, we can't torture him! We need to talk to him.

466
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,340
This is about a child.

467
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,210
You think he'll just tell us the truth?

468
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,670
Looks like he doesn't just consult anyone, either.

469
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,800
Is there a good solution?

470
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,290
Go Eun.

471
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,190
Could you do me a favor?

472
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,140
Of course! What is it?

473
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,280
Could you...

474
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,050
marry me?

475
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,520
Huh?

476
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,790
What?

477
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:05,810
I just guessed your size. I'm glad it fits.

478
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,140
Thank you.

479
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,510
I learned this as a kid.

480
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,510
You have to dress cleanly, so you don't get picked on.

481
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,190
Okay?

482
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,470
Seo Yeon got new clothes!

483
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,800
I bought it because it reminded me of her.

484
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,810
I was thinking of stopping by a clothing store first.

485
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,670
Thank you for caring for her.

486
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,160
I'll get to work then.

487
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,500
Okay, drive safely!

488
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,790
Yes.

489
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:54,660
Seo Yeon, you said you'd give So Mang a hug if you saw her, right?

490
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:59,830
Don't you think she'd like it even more if you gave her a toy when you hugged her?

491
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:02,340
Since you're dressed prettily,

492
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:06,480
should we go out to buy a toy your sister would like?

493
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,790
Is that okay?

494
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,420
Of course, it is!

495
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,150
Here, let's go! Hurry!

496
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,520
Okay!

497
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,910
Okay. Shall we go?

498
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,100
Let's go, let's go!

499
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:49,600
♫  Light is shining on your shaky eyes  ♫

500
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:57,060
♫  My heart is dancing under the starlight in the dark  ♫

501
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:07,260
♫  I'm thinking of destroying the world you created one step at a time  ♫

502
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,090
♫  You didn't question yourself  ♫

503
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:15,180
♫  That's the reason why you're being punished  ♫

504
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,650
Did you wait long?

505
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,960
I got ready pretty quickly, you know.

506
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,570
Looking good.

507
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:27,390
What kind of wife do you want?

508
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:30,360
Why did they report Seo Yeon missing when they were not her parents?

509
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,700
What's their relationship with Seo Yeon?

510
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,600
And a wise wife who could find where So Mang is.

511
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,780
That's hard.

512
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,960
I'll still give it a try.

513
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,730
Shall we go?

514
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,280
 

515
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,000
Welcome! Please come take a look.

516
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,910
 

517
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,230
How can I help you?

518
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,540
What do you mean?

519
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,440
We're here to get an apartment.

520
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,750
For us to live together.

521
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:20,330
Mr. Lim, a pair of lovebirds graced us with a visit.

522
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,810
What do you mean, "How can I help you?"

523
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,000
What kind of thing is that to say?

524
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,510
- Hurry up and get them drinks!
- Yes, sir.

525
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,940
Please have a seat.

526
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,010
Hold on, please.

527
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,580
Here.

528
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,820
You're such a sweetheart!

529
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,510
- Thank you.
- Have a seat!

530
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:49,050
We want to get an apartment, but we don't know anything about this stuff!

531
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,260
I'm glad you came.

532
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,760
Our specialty is dealing with people who don't know anything.

533
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,730
Well, what Mr. Lim meant is...

534
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:01,320
we can explain things in detail from beginning to end!

535
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,780
That's what he meant.

536
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,660
I see.

537
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:08,180
- That person over there. Will he talk to us?
- Excuse me?

538
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:13,120
So, you don't know who Mr. Kang is?

539
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:17,640
No way! He's the No. 1 lecturer in real estate consulting!

540
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,450
He has a huge following on social media, too!

541
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,640
My goodness, Honey! Sounds like he's famous!

542
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,710
- I think we came to the right place!
- I think so!

543
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:32,940
Well, how long have you been married?

544
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,000
- Three years-
- Last month.

545
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,520
Pardon?

546
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,920
Our first marriages were three years ago.

547
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,620
But we got married last month.

548
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,710
It's my second marriage.

549
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:52,650
Well, who cares if it's the second or first marriage?

550
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:55,450
We still count as newlyweds, right?

551
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:59,090
Of course! You're newlyweds! No problem at all.

552
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:03,250
If so, what's your current financial situation?

553
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,960
Is it above 300 million won? Or below?

554
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,160
- Above!
- Below.

555
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:14,410
Including the alimony.

556
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,280
I see.

557
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,930
I have no money, but you do, Honey!

558
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,720
You have me!

559
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,590
Thank you.

560
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:27,640
You're so charmingly transparent.

561
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,600
Would you guys...

562
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,250
like to attend Mr. Kang's lecture?

563
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:39,310
I'm giving you special treatment since you're newlyweds.

564
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:51,960
- Wow, a special treatment?
- Yes, a special treatment.

565
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,430
- Whoa!
- Gold!

566
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,760
- Daebak!
- Wow!

567
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,440
 

568
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,520
Thank you.

569
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,300
Welcome. This is a survey.

570
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,090
You just need to write it as is.

571
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:24,560
The Real Estate Purchase Plan at the end needs to be filled out in detail.

572
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,670
If you don't do it properly, you won't get a 1:1 consulting session.

573
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:31,900
I'll fill that one out.

574
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,170
 

575
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:41,100
Current living situation?

576
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,840
What should we say?

577
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,310
 

578
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,830
Hello!

579
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,850
Thank you.

580
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:14,720
I'm CEO Kang Pil Seung of Feel Consulting.

581
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,060
People call me Mr. Kang for short.

582
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,110
Let me ask you directly.

583
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:24,340
What do you need to do to purchase a home?

584
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,130
- You need to save money.
- For sure.*
(He said "carrot" which is slang for "for sure")

585
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,040
This is orange.

586
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,980
The best way for most people to buy a home

587
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,960
is to get qualified for the first-time buyer's program.

588
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,270
What do you have to do to get qualified for it?

589
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,480
- You have to apply as quickly as possible.
- Yes, that's correct!

590
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,210
Apply for the good-faith deposit early, reside for a long time,

591
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:48,880
be newlyweds, and have many children.

592
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,980
- Is that correct?
- Yes!

593
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,620
All right.

594
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:56,500
These are the homes we all dream of.

595
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:10,100
Let's say you collected enough scores for the first-time buyer's program,

596
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:15,590
got lucky, and got approved for one of those apartments.

597
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:19,510
Would you be happy or not?

598
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:22,190
- Happy!
- Don't be ridiculous!

599
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,770
Thank you.

600
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,060
But...

601
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,400
would you just be happy?

602
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,630
 

603
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,390
Okay.

604
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:39,190
Here are the prices of the homes I just showed you.

605
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,680
One, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand,

606
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,950
hundred thousand, million, 10 million, 100 million...

607
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,030
One billion won?

608
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:51,650
Can any of you prepare that much money right now?

609
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,400
Could you raise your hand if you can?

610
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,510
I can! I'll get a loan.

611
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:00,880
A loan? Unfortunately, that apartment unit costs over 900 million won.

612
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,490
So you won't even get 10 won for the interim payment loan.

613
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:07,640
That means, in order to successfully move into one of those homes,

614
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:14,670
you have to have more than 1 billion won, and even in cash.

615
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:19,910
How does that make any sense to regular people like you?

616
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,980
Who can afford it, then?

617
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,500
Who on earth can afford to live in a place like this?

618
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,980
That'd be...

619
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:33,150
the people who have wealthy parents who can provide billions of wons in cash.

620
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:37,450
The ones who were born with a silver spoon can afford places like that.

621
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:39,810
The parents are wealthy, but the children don't own a place.

622
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:41,610
That makes you a long-term non-homeowner.

623
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:44,610
That means you're qualified for the first-time buyer's program.

624
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:48,100
They pay the downpayment, interim payment, and balance with their parents' help.

625
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,470
All the perks from the rising housing market?

626
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:53,500
The ones born with a silver spoon will take all of them.

627
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,590
Can you believe it?

628
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:00,030
Your chance of owning one of these homes

629
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:04,330
is less than the chance of a camel going through the eye of a needle.

630
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:08,870
To put it simply, you're hopeless unless you were born with a silver spoon.

631
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:17,840
That's the conclusion of today's lecture

632
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,100
and the reality you're facing.

633
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,390
Geez.

634
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:25,210
There was a reason why I'm not a homeowner.

635
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:28,520
But is it really hopeless?

636
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,320
I've had this thought whenever I drove past Han River.

637
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:37,470
There are so many homes in this world, but how come I'm the only one without one?

638
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:41,890
I want it so, so badly.

639
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:44,390
Is it really impossible?

640
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,880
I thought about it over and over again. And finally,

641
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,200
I found the solution.

642
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:57,450
Are you curious about what the solution is?

643
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,520
 Yes! 

644
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,840
- Do you really want to know?
 - Yes! 

645
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,410
I will see you at the 1:1 consulting session.

646
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,300
Daebak!

647
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,370
Hyung, Hyung, where are you going?

648
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:25,460
I'm taking the 1:1 session.

649
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:28,130
You're crazy! You're not going anywhere! Get back in!

650
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:32,240
I want an apartment like that. I want it!

651
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,630
- Did you finish?
- Well, yes.

652
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,510
I'll call your name if you hand in the survey.

653
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:46,120
Just listening to him really makes me want to rely on him.

654
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,490
It really feels like he'd make me a homeowner.

655
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,140
The toy store is all the way to the end there.

656
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:05,500
But there's a ride I really want to try on the way there.

657
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,450
Can we try it before we go?

658
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:09,920
Okay. Let's go!

659
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:22,080
♫  A warm and vast land of adventure  ♫

660
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:29,680
♫  A small fantasy land that's full of mysterious things  ♫

661
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:36,350
♫  Like a small bird, I want to fly far away  ♫

662
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:38,840
Was it fun?

663
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:42,680
Should we try another ride over there?

664
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,410
Let's go!

665
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:52,540
♫  We became friends, and my dream came true  ♫

666
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:55,830
♫  Like in a fairy tale...  ♫

667
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:57,210
Come on in.

668
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:00,020
Hello, hello!

669
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,170
Hello.

670
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,060
Have a seat, Honey.

671
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:09,650
Gosh, come on!

672
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:29,330
Mr. Kang, you're so handsome in person.

673
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:31,690
You look so handsome in the photo, too.

674
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:34,570
- Isn't this girl so pretty, Honey?
- Yes, so cute!

675
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:37,730
Is she your niece? Or a daughter?

676
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,950
Please don't ask irrelevant questions.

677
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:43,720
- Don't be like that.
- Oh, yes.

678
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,650
Why do you ask?

679
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:48,160
Do you want a daughter like her?

680
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:53,230
That's not something we can control.

681
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,320
It could be.

682
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,490
Are those matching outfits?

683
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:02,640
- Yes!
- Yes, we just bought them!

684
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,190
They suit you well.

685
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:07,990
The wife is a bookkeeper at a taxi company.

686
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:09,650
And the husband is a taxi driver, too.

687
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:13,510
It's not just a taxi! It's premium. A premium taxi.

688
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:14,820
Yes.

689
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:19,500
You applied early for the first-time buyer's program.

690
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,870
And you haven't been married for long, either. But you have 300 million wons?

691
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:28,690
I guess a bookkeeper's salary is high. Or does he make a lot by driving?

692
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:32,290
Anyway, if you get approved, you won't have to worry about the downpayment.

693
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:33,420
Yes.

694
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,870
I worked part-time jobs to buy a house, too!

695
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:37,350
Whoa.

696
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:39,160
What kind of part-time job?

697
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:45,150
The most recent one was a singing job!

698
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:49,060
- You're such an amazing singer!
- Stop it!

699
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,460
Seriously...

700
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,050
You must feel so secure, sir.

701
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:58,190
I think you can become homeowners without my help.

702
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:02,140
Thank you. You can leave now.

703
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,900
We just failed, didn't we?

704
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,190
I think so.

705
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,750
I think I filled out the form wrong.

706
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,640
It's okay. The form can...

707
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,770
just disappear.

708
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,430
 

709
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,410
What?

710
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:51,820
Seriously!

711
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,160
 

712
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,490
Geez!

713
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,150
 You can go in now! 

714
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:04,590
Geez! It all went out here, too!

715
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:06,970
- Yes, this one went out, too.
- Why is it malfunctioning anyway?

716
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:09,760
- I hope it didn't go out.
- I know.

717
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,400
Who are you...

718
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,900
- Mr. Kim already went in! What are you doing?
- Already?

719
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,010
Okay! We'll fix it quickly. Just wait a moment!

720
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:19,890
Please wait.

721
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:27,500
 

722
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,290
 

723
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,440
 

724
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,390
 

725
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,320
Please check if they have information about Seo Yeon and So Mang.

726
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,030
I'll look for the surveys.

727
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,730
There's nothing useful to us.

728
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:00,920
All I see is real estate information.

729
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,980
So these were the correct answers.

730
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:27,190
What are the correct answers?

731
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:28,930
Married couples who are financially insecure

732
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:31,690
or don't qualify for the first-home buyer's program.

733
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:36,100
Are all the answer sheets on the servers?

734
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,570
No. I don't think they have uploaded them yet.

735
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:50,150
Do you know why you shouldn't put off today's job until tomorrow?

736
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:53,380
No, why?

737
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:57,680
Because you have to start all over.

738
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:25,860
 

739
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,520
- What?
- Hello.

740
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,000
What's going on?

741
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,550
What happened?

742
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:35,660
What?

743
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,620
 

744
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:40,840
It's all wet.

745
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,900
Hello, sir.

746
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:49,770
What happened to the answer sheets?

747
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:52,420
The thing is... It all got wet.

748
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,960
Did you save it as data?

749
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,690
I haven't done it-

750
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:03,740
- Let's try to wake up!
- Yes!

751
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,260
Why do you make us do the same job twice?

752
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:08,130
I... should've saved it as data-

753
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:10,350
He hasn't come to his senses yet.

754
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,350
Start from the beginning.

755
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:21,430
Yes! Got it, sir!

756
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,380
I still don't see the catch.

757
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,290
The catch?

758
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:29,880
What they get out of us when we become homeowners.

759
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,380
I don't think they'd be doing this just to get the broker's fee.

760
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:38,580
I think there is another problem with Seo Yeon, too.

761
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,600
Another problem?

762
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:48,190
It's a drawing of her playing in the playground in the rain.

763
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:51,670
I think these kids are still together.

764
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:53,850
The rain is kind of strange.

765
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:58,170
It's not raining. She drew prison bars.

766
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,500
Prison bars?

767
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:04,620
She's not playing in the playground. She's watching them.

768
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:07,000
While trapped somewhere.

769
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:15,470
 

770
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:30,760
Oh, Honey!

771
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,000
Look.

772
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,360
I'm so happy that we got to see you again, Mr. Kang.

773
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:41,390
Your portfolio went down so much in the meantime.

774
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:46,740
Honey lost all of it by investing in crypto.

775
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:49,890
The Puppy Coin...

776
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:51,580
Geez.

777
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,540
Looking at your file, it won't be easy for you to buy a home.

778
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:01,470
Do you mean we can't, then?

779
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:04,230
I don't just help everyone.

780
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:09,560
I only help the people who meet my criteria.

781
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,500
I hate wasting time more than anything.

782
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,700
- What are your criteria...
- Desperation.

783
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:19,490
People who are genuinely desperate.

784
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:23,290
We're desperate!

785
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:25,190
I don't think so.

786
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:28,240
How desperately do you want to become a homeowner?

787
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,740
As much as the size of the sky and the earth!

788
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:33,060
We're very desperate!

789
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:35,640
Let me tell you one more time.

790
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:41,190
I don't want to waste my time for people who are not desperate.

791
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:45,290
So you can't lie.

792
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:49,110
- We know we're not supposed to lie!
- Of course not!

793
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:50,580
Yes, yes.

794
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:55,090
Ma'am.

795
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:56,080
Yes.

796
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,940
Can you do anything I tell you to do?

797
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:03,160
Are you ready to do anything to become a homeowner?

798
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,970
- Yes!
- Yes!

799
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:08,380
Are you willing to do anything?

800
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:26,200
 Please find So Mang. 

801
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,900
There's nothing I can't do to become a homeowner!

802
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,550
With all my heart,

803
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:37,700
I desperately want you, Mr. Kang!

804
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,220
Yes!

805
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:50,080
He's still a young man. Didn't he look so paranoid?

806
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,200
It was like he was testing us!

807
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:55,070
 

808
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,650
Yes, Mr. Kang! How are you?

809
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:03,760
Yes?

810
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,920
Not at all! It's an honor for us.

811
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,960
Got it. I'll see you later then.

812
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,030
See you! Click!

813
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,400
"Click?"

814
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:18,510
I think he is testing us.

815
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:19,560
Why?

816
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,940
What did we write down as our address?

817
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,730
I wrote Mr. Jang's address. Why?

818
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:28,100
He's coming right now.

819
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,760
To our starter home.

820
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,550
What? Right now?

821
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:36,000
What should we do? We didn't prepare anything.

822
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:40,120
Do you know how to decorate a newlyweds home?

823
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:43,790
We don't have a lot of time. Let's put our heads together.

824
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:45,160
- Again?
- Hurry!

825
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,980
I guess I should hurry. Here we go! I'm stepping on it.

826
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,810
Mr. Kang! Mr. Kang!

827
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:18,030
Aigoo! We should've come sooner and waited for you! You came to our humble home!

828
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:19,700
Thank you so much.

829
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:23,370
By the way, your house is nicer than I thought.

830
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:27,250
Aigoo! What are you talking about? We're not renting the whole house.

831
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,820
We're paying monthly for just one room.

832
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:31,800
I see.

833
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,060
- Come on in!
- Yes, come inside.

834
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,460
Ta-da-da-da-da!

835
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:42,340
Ta-da-da-da-da!

836
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:00,010
Huh?

837
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,380
I think it's her.

838
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:57,350
How can I help you?

839
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:59,240
Well, uh...

840
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:03,170
Didn't a kid about this big come here?

841
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:06,630
Let me see. The youngest one here is...

842
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:08,030
Junior!

843
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:10,960
Yes, Junior is here!

844
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,500
Did you want to see me?

845
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,730
I'm the second youngest.

846
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:16,370
Are you here to see me?

847
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:17,500
Well...

848
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:20,850
I guess I was mistaken.

849
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:23,170
Get back to it, then! Bye.

850
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:37,480
Seo Yeon!

851
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,050
Weren't you scared?

852
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:43,000
I wasn't.

853
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:48,010
Because this is a place where I'm protected.

854
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:51,570
Yes, that's right!

855
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:54,190
Aigoo, I'm so proud of you. Let's go!

856
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:57,970
Right, how about the house? Did you decorate it well?

857
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:00,840
Of course, we did!

858
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:04,800
It's just my guess, but I'm sure they're very satisfied!

859
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,430
Just thinking about it makes me happy.

860
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,130
Come on in!

861
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:26,760
- Excuse us.
- Yes.

862
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:39,710
Wow, this is a unique

863
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:41,860
decorating concept.

864
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,980
We're...

865
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:46,860
full of love.

866
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:48,870
So full!

867
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,030
Come on in.

868
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,790
Aigoo! I feel dizzy.

869
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:15,080
Ta-da! I prepared a surprise for you, Honey.

870
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:19,490
When did you do all this? My goodness!

871
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,680
This way.

872
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:47,040
So this is the room you rent?

873
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,200
Yes, that's correct.

874
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:53,340
I'll have a look.

875
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:03,640
You have a single bed.

876
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:09,100
The smaller the bed is, the better for newlyweds.

877
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,460
You only have one pillow, too.

878
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:16,740
I use his arm as a pillow!

879
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:20,760
My arm pillow.

880
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,280
- Have some coffee.
- Yes.

881
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:36,050
Hold on a second!

882
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:50,400


883
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,900
You aren't married, are you?

884
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:12,450
♫  Take me back, it's over!  ♫

885
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:16,070
♫  Put the pain that's been trapping you behind  ♫

886
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:20,090
♫  And I'll fight, fight for you  ♫

887
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:23,830
♫  I will run to the end of the world  ♫

888
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:26,300
♫  Fight to the end  ♫

889
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:30,270
♫  Cold glances and smirks toward you  ♫

890
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:34,040
♫  Even the endless pain  ♫

891
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:42,020
♫  So I can get up again like hot flame  ♫

892
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:45,310
♫  I'm gonna fight, fight! Stop me now, stop me.  ♫

893
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:48,210
 

894
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:51,800
 Where did all these kids come from anyway? 

895
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,440
 Get up! 

896
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,800
 - Are you ready to become a dad?
- Pardon? 

897
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:58,770
 A baby will be born here today. 

898
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:02,560
 This is how they've been collecting the kids. 

899
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:06,130
 You guys need a beating. 

900
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:08,580
 Where are the kids? 

901
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,390
 Where are they? 

902
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:12,940
 - The kids are gone.
- Where are the kids? 

903
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:15,700
 Be quiet! Quiet! 

904
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:21,300
 You won't be able to take a single step out of here. 

905
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:23,270
 Mr. Kim, are you okay? 

906
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:27,120
 Don't come here and chase Kang Pil Seung first. The kids come first. 

907
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:33,610
 I'm so sorry... 

908
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:35,080
 on behalf of the adults. 

909
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:39,140
♫  I'll fight with my everything  ♫

910
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:43,140
♫  I'm gonna fight, fight! Stop me now, stop me. No way  ♫

911
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:43,200
♫  I'm gonna fight, fight! Stop me now, stop me. No way  ♫
