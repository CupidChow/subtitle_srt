00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The more professional the professional is, the more professional the professional is.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The one that all three of us are using, the King of All Spots,

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
is here to show you the most exciting part of the Super Theater.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Who are you?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I am the Princess of the Guardian Council.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I am here to take the order from His Majesty

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
to come with the state's treasure.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In the face of the King of Zhao's treason,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the King of Zhao committed a crime.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The world's courtiers can all be punished.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If you continue to stop us,

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
it will be the same crime.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You will be beheaded and be buried in the tomb.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If you immediately put down your sword,

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
His Majesty will surely punish you.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Ling Yan?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You didn't die?

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There are probably other people

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
who have left the world to escape punishment.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The people will only know

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that the Princess of the Guardian Council and the Eastern Palace

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
have committed a crime.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Come!

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Kill the subordinates and bring more blood!

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yes!

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Ling Yan,

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I have raised you for 17 years.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
17 years!

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You are still so ungrateful

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and ungrateful.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You are the one who

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
fell into this death trap.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Fine.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
If you still don't kill my son,

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I will give you my life!

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yes!

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You are not Ling Yan.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Where is Ling Yan now?

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So, An Ran's father

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
is the Jing Zhao Yan that everyone called him?

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Your whole family was killed by King of Zhao.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Now that King of Zhao is going to rebel,

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
you must fight with him.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Why do you trust me so much?

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Such a secret,

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
if I tell King of Zhao about it,

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
if he succeeds,

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I can make it clear.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Will you?

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I will sell my friends

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and do what the world does not allow.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I will not do this.

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
In this life,

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I have a friend

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
who kills a traitor.

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It is enough to kill him.

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Of course, I am sending you

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
to the way of redeeming your crime.

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I will go.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Mr. Lu,

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
King of Zhao has succeeded today.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Although Noble Consort Dou is in a relationship with you,

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
she will not take revenge on you.

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You must know that

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
King of Zhao is going to kill

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
his accomplices today.

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You are not familiar with the Yong'an law, are you?

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You only know that rebellion is a death penalty.

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But the Yong'an law

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
is clearly written in the 13th chapter.

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
A traitor

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
can be punished

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
before he is exposed.

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You mean

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I am still alive?

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I only want King of Zhao to be punished.

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
King of Zhao will attack the inner palace

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
to avoid the news from spreading.

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
After the mission is accomplished,

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
he will be a traitor to the city.

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But he can only use the military strategy.

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Noble Consort will also use this method.

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But in order to get Noble Consort,

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
King of Zhao left a letter

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
from Qi Laiwang

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
hidden in his study.

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Thank you.

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
About that day,

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
the Yong'an law is only written 12 times.

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
12 times?

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Lin Ye,

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
how dare you trick me?

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I will kill you!

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I have been expecting this.

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I have ordered the 16th Guards to wait for my order.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I am not afraid to risk my life

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
to let you relax

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and let my men leave the capital.

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Otherwise,

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
if you still have one or two

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
meat nets left,

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
it will be bad for the people.

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Nian Shaoyi has already gone to Su Shui City.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I think he has already got

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
the evidence of your relationship with Noble Consort Dou.

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You can't escape

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
from this.

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The military uniform is in my hands.

112
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I am listening to your orders.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Today, I will call for King of Zhao to help me.

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Save King of Zhao!

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Go.

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Go.

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Your Majesty.

118
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Your Majesty.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Go.

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Go.

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Hurry up.

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Hurry up.

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We finally got you out of the funeral.

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Otherwise, the Wolf Army will be so anxious.

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We can only leave the palace later.

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I have to go back.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I can only send you to here.

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Thank you, Wolf Army.

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Please protect yourself.

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Go.

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Hurry up.

132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Go.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Hurry up.

134
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Go.

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Go.

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Go.

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Go.

138
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Go.

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Go.

140
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Go.

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Go.

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Go.

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Go.

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Go.

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Go.

146
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Go.

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Go.

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Go.

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Go.

150
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
King of Chuan, Li Yao.

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Run.

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Hurry up.

153
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Li Yao.

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Dad, mom, A'Qi.

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Go.

156
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Dad, mom.

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't let them run away.

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes.

159
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Go.

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Go.

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Go.

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Go.

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Go.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Go.

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Hurry up.

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hurry up.

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Hurry up.

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
A'Qi.

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Hurry up.

170
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Hurry up.

171
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
A'Qi.

172
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Hurry up.

173
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Hurry up.

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
A'Qi.

175
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Hurry up.

176
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
A'Qi.

177
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Hurry up.

178
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Hurry up.

179
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
A'Qi.

180
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Come on.

181
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Li Yao.

182
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You dare to stop me again?

183
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Don't come over.

184
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Look at me.

185
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Go.

186
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Run.

187
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Run.

188
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Go.

189
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Young lady.

190
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Dad.

191
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Don't touch me.

192
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You dare to stop me.

193
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Hurry up.

194
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Li Yao, go.

195
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's all the fault of Bei Lian's.

196
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You have to pay for his.

197
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I...

198
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Li Yao.

199
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Li Yao.

200
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Hurry.

201
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,600
You will pay for her!

202
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,400
Lin Yan!

203
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Let Li Yang go!

204
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
Or I'll kill her!

205
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,000
No!

206
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,800
Let her go!

207
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,600
Let her go!

208
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Let her go!

209
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,200
Young Master!

210
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,800
Let her go!

211
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,600
Don't move!

212
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,400
I'll take her in.

213
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,400
Cui Che.

214
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,800
I was soft-hearted back then.

215
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,200
I spared your life.

216
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,600
Today, I'll give you my life.

217
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,000
Let her go!

218
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,000
Young Master.

219
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,800
Don't move!

220
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,800
Let her go!

221
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,600
Let her go!

222
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,600
Let her go!

223
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Let her go!

224
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,000
Let her go!

225
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,800
Let her go!

226
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,600
Let her go!

227
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Let her go!

228
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Let her go!

229
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Let her go!

230
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,600
Let her go!

231
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,400
Go.

232
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,200
Uncle!

233
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Go!

234
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,540
Today is my death day.

235
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,300
So,

236
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,400
let them

237
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,940
die with me.

238
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,020
Surrender!

239
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:42,220
AfterMUSIC

240
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,040
Am afraid that he is too deep

241
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,320
Everybody

242
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Father.

243
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm here.

244
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm here.

245
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm here.

246
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Don't worry.

247
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You'll be fine as long as I'm here.

248
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
No one will ever bully you.

249
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,020
The end funded products are never spoken of,

250
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,300
only dozen.

251
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,060
Actually I did not gray opinions from them.

252
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,680
Their message is dissimilar.

253
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,620
Me like them.

254
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,620
I have nothing to see myself.

255
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,900
Although it is I

256
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,700
and untried one thing,

257
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,860
Look at the right side

258
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,900
The right side is the most important

259
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,100
Why are you so stupid?

260
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,100
You

261
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,340
You put this red silk in your face

262
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,500
Don't move

263
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,620
Let me see how it is

264
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,300
How is it?

265
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:09,900
OK

266
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,780
Be careful

267
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,500
I heard that your Shen Family's Li Liang Dagu

268
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,300
has won the title of the best writer

269
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,700
The winner and the Princess

270
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,300
are still in the Sun of the Shen Family

271
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,300
The world is perfect

272
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,300
The world is perfect

273
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,300
Don't try it

274
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,300
What does the winner and the winner

275
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,300
feel like?

276
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,100
That's right

277
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,100
The Princess

278
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,100
is still there

279
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,700
Try it

280
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,700
Try it

281
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,700
Try it

282
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,700
Try it

283
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,700
Try it

284
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,700
Try it

285
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,700
Try it

286
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,700
The former King of Zhao, Cui Ning

287
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,700
was a loyal and filial man

288
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,700
when he was in the palace

289
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,700
Today, the former Emperor, Jing Xue

290
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,700
is the son of the loyal and filial son of Cui

291
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,700
He found out that the King of Zhao

292
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,700
was the real murderer of the Imperial Court case

293
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,700
17 years ago

294
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,700
He fought against the Imperial Consort

295
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
and committed treason

296
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,700
He was even named as the murderer

297
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,700
He was even named as the murderer

298
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,700
In the court

299
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,700
those who are involved in the second case

300
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,700
have already been punished

301
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,700
I rely on Your Majesty

302
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,700
The loyal and filial son

303
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,700
can be punished for his crimes

304
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,700
Get up

305
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,700
Thank you, Your Majesty

306
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,700
Your Majesty

307
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
Cui's case is a good one

308
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,700
But I have to

309
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,700
impeach the young master of Jing Zhao, Lin Yan

310
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,700
Lin Yan's original name is Cui Che

311
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,700
He was a criminal

312
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,700
when he was in the palace

313
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,700
He was charged with

314
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,700
the crime of deceiving the King

315
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,700
He can't be pardoned

316
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,700
Your Majesty

317
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,700
Your Majesty

318
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,700
The change of Lin's identity

319
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,700
was actually to

320
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,700
turn the case against my father

321
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
It's a good thing

322
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,700
Cui's family is in the wrong

323
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,700
The original one is Cui's

324
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,700
Hasn't the Imperial Court investigated it?

325
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,700
Zhao's plot has been broken

326
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,700
The Imperial Court knows everything

327
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,700
Why did they catch and release

328
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,700
Lin's family?

329
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,700
According to Zhao's plot

330
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,700
Lin's family should be the main one

331
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,700
It's a good thing

332
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,700
to pursue the past

333
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,700
Your Majesty

334
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,700
The state should reward the criminal

335
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,700
to make the law more fundamental

336
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,700
The reward should be good

337
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,700
and the punishment should be bad

338
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,700
Otherwise, the law will be unfavorable

339
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,700
and the foundation will be shaken

340
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,700
If after this

341
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,700
everyone laughs at Lin's change of identity

342
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,700
and the criminal is brought to court

343
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,700
The court should be brought to court

344
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,700
Your Majesty, please punish me

345
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,700
Please punish me

346
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,700
Please punish me

347
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,700
Your Majesty, please punish me

348
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,700
Please punish me

349
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,700
Don't eat

350
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,700
Serve the dishes

351
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,700
There are two dishes left

352
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,700
Today is a good day

353
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,700
Come on

354
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,700
What's wrong, Gongsun?

355
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,700
Fatou

356
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,700
What's wrong?

357
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,700
What's wrong?

358
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,700
Dad

359
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,700
I'm fine

360
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,700
Since Li Yang

361
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,700
hit my head with something

362
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,700
I always feel headache

363
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,700
and my head is still

364
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,700
full of things

365
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,700
You should go to see a doctor

366
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,700
Yes, should we go to see a doctor?

367
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,700
No

368
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,700
Mr. Tan

369
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,700
Do you know what I'm going to see a doctor?

370
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,700
No, it will be fine in a few days

371
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,700
You're right

372
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,700
Didn't His Majesty say we have work to do?

373
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,700
He wants to reward us

374
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,700
What should we do?

375
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,700
Yes, I'm thinking about it

376
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,700
Let's go to the heaven

377
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,700
So brave

378
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,700
No, no

379
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,700
Then we can just

380
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,700
get a few thousand cars

381
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,700
and red pepper and some donations

382
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,700
Fine

383
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,700
A few thousand cars

384
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,700
Ji, you're a lion

385
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,700
You should open your mouth

386
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,700
We've done such an important thing

387
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,700
I think

388
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,700
we should wait for a few days

389
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,700
Look, I'm here to be the chief

390
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,700
I'm here to be the chief

391
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,700
Okay

392
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,700
That's good

393
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,700
I'll be the chief in the future

394
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,700
Help

395
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,700
What's wrong?

396
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,700
The old man is in jail

397
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,700
He's been accused of deceiving the emperor

398
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,700
He's going to be the chief

399
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,700
Thank you

400
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,700
Thank you

401
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,700
It's already the time of the news

402
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,700
Why did you spend so much money?

403
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,700
Yes

404
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,700
I spent a lot of money

405
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,700
to send you a meal

406
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,700
It's a big price

407
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,700
This is made by my father

408
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,700
My mother made it

409
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,700
It's a gift from Shen Shao Jie

410
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,700
But it's better not to eat it

411
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,700
This is rice

412
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,700
This is a happy duck egg

413
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,700
Yang Yang taught it to Yu San and Yuan

414
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,700
He learned it for a long time

415
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,700
Did you make this?

416
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,700
It's sweet

417
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,700
I'll make it for you

418
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,700
Eat it

419
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,700
Is it good?

420
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,700
Yes

421
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,700
My mother made it for a long time

422
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,700
I've thought about it

423
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,700
I have to beg them

424
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,700
I really can't make an excuse

425
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,700
Ah Jie, listen to me

426
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,700
You still have a family

427
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,700
No matter what

428
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,700
You can live well

429
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,700
Liar

430
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,700
You are a liar

431
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,700
I don't believe in you

432
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,700
Ah Jie

433
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,700
Before I had you

434
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,700
Before you

435
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,700
I had only one thought of revenge

436
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,700
I was miserable

437
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,700
And you

438
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,700
It's enough.

439
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,700
His Majesty said he would give us a rope.

440
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,700
I want His Majesty to give me your life.

441
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,700
Your life is mine.

442
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,700
No one can take it away.

443
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,700
Your Highness, can't you let Lin Yan go?

444
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,700
Of course I don't want to hurt An Ran.

445
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,700
But the better An Ran does, the more people he'll offend.

446
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,700
Someone will definitely support him.

447
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,700
Deceiving His Majesty is the best way to do it.

448
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,700
The evidence is certain.

449
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,700
His Majesty will definitely follow the law.

450
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,700
Your Highness, I'm begging you.

451
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,700
Think of a way.

452
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,700
I'm begging you.

453
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,700
I'm begging you.

454
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,700
I'm begging you.

455
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,700
I'm begging you.

456
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,700
I'm begging you.

457
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,700
Your Highness, I'm begging you. Think of a way.

458
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,700
Lady Shen, think about it carefully.

459
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
Your Highness, I'm begging you.

460
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,700
His Majesty will follow the law.

461
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,700
If you want to save An Ran,

462
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,700
you have to think about it carefully.

463
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
The law is the rule.

464
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,700
Do you understand?

465
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,700
Your Highness has been talking about the rule.

466
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,700
If the law wants to kill Lin Yan,

467
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,700
the law can also save Lin Yan.

468
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,700
Your Highness, you mean...

469
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,700
You mean...

470
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,700
you want to ask for the help of the Shen Family

471
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,700
to ask for the help of the Shen Family

472
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,700
to let Lin Yan marry you.

473
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,700
Then Lin Yan will not die.

474
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,700
Yes.

475
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,700
Lin Yan has been living for days.

476
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
I beg Your Majesty to ask Lin Yan to act quickly

477
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,700
to prove the law.

478
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,700
You can't drag it out anymore.

479
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,700
You can do it.

480
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,700
Your Majesty.

481
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
Your Majesty, if you want to kill Lin Yan,

482
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
you should show the power of the law.

483
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
However, I have to face Your Majesty

484
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,700
and say it without trust.

485
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,700
I'm sorry.

486
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,700
Lin An Ran and I will have a marriage.

487
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,700
An Ran is the son-in-law of the Shen Family.

488
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,700
He will be the son-in-law of the Shen Family.

489
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,700
He will be the son-in-law of the Shen Family.

490
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,700
He will have the right to the Token of the Single Book.

491
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,700
The Token of the Single Book

492
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,700
is first regulated by other laws

493
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,700
in the previous dynasty and today.

494
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,700
Today, Your Majesty is asking Lin Yan to be punished.

495
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,700
It's illegal.

496
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,700
It's ridiculous. Even if there is a Token of the Single Book,

497
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,700
it's also given to the Shen Family.

498
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,700
Lin Yan has never been married.

499
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,700
The whole court knows it.

500
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,700
How can you say that?

501
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,700
Even if he gets married,

502
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,700
the Shen Lady will marry the Lin Family.

503
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,700
The Shen Lady should be punished.

504
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,700
The Token of the Single Book can only

505
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,700
protect her from death.

506
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,700
Your Majesty, I have the marriage certificate

507
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,700
and the marriage certificate of the Shen Family

508
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,700
with Lin Yan.

509
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,700
As the elder, I personally witnessed the marriage certificate

510
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,700
and the marriage certificate.

511
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,700
Your Majesty.

512
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,700
Please have a look.

513
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,700
This is the marriage certificate

514
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,700
of the Shen Family with Lin Yan.

515
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,700
He is a prisoner.

516
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,700
He is the prisoner of the Token of the Single Book.

517
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,700
How can he be imprisoned?

518
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,700
Why does the Young Master of Jingzhao

519
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,700
want to be imprisoned?

520
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,700
Your Majesty, this must be Lin Yan's trick.

521
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,700
Your Majesty, this must be Lin Yan's trick.

522
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,700
The state should reward the law

523
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,700
to be the basis of the law.

524
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,700
Since there is the Token of the Single Book,

525
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,700
it should be the basis.

526
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,700
Otherwise, the law is not valid.

527
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,700
Everyone will be laughing.

528
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,700
How can we know?

529
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,700
You...

530
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,700
Your Majesty.

531
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,700
Your Majesty.

532
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,700
This is good.

533
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,700
The law, rules and the heaven and earth

534
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,700
will not permit these two shameless men.

535
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,700
If I were to be jailed,

536
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
I would go alone.

537
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,520
I only have this one way to save you, Lin Ye.

538
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,600
But a fake marriage contract can't be true in the end.

539
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,520
Luckily, you've already been transferred to your official post.

540
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,160
I've already talked to my parents.

541
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,160
Once this matter has been resolved, we will move out of Yong An.

542
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,480
I will go far away.

543
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,480
I won't see you again.

544
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,480
Xiao Guang.

545
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,280
The future generations of Shen Family have offended you.

546
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,320
I even beg the ancestors

547
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,160
to spare my sins.

548
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,700
Spare my sins.

549
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:34,500
With river of tears thinning my und

550
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:39,740
May one day,

551
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:46,660
I shall master no more than thisかな

552
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,820
Mastery !

553
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,320
You're really a master.

554
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,580
It is impossible for Li and Li to meet again.

555
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,780
But His Majesty insisted on letting her be the second wife.

556
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,860
Isn't that right?

557
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,740
This is like a wedding photo.

558
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,100
I almost lost my hair.

559
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,180
That's not right.

560
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,500
What are you thinking about?

561
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,740
Young Master, the painting is done.

562
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,780
Old Wu.

563
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,620
They...

564
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:49,580
The paintings with the

565
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,860
purple hair.

566
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,300
I'm going to be a history teacher

567
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,100
No way

568
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,220
A Ji

569
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,700
Listen to me, lift your head

570
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,660
and say something

571
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,740
If you think it's funny

572
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,780
you should add an apple

573
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,940
Yes, listen to your mom

574
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,060
Add an apple

575
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,380
It will look better

576
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,940
Turn your head to the side

577
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,900
It's nothing

578
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,060
A Ji, turn your head this way

579
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,300
Look, you forgot the apple

580
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,140
You should add an apple

581
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,780
It will look better

582
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,420
Sorry

583
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,260
Turn your head back a little

584
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,300
It will look better if you smile

585
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,620
Look at your face

586
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,900
Okay, stop

587
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,060
What's wrong with your face?

588
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,540
What's wrong with your face?

589
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,180
Like this

590
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,660
Okay, good

591
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,460
Be a good boy

592
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,540
You're so...

593
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,300
Well

594
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:36,940
Go, go, go

595
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,180
Wait

596
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,100
Sir, your painting is ready

597
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,340
Lord

598
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,740
Excuse me

599
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,380
This is a raised apple

600
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,100
Adorable

601
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,700
Why do I feel like there's something wrong with it?

602
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,700
Yes, yes.

603
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,700
A'Qing, come, let me see.

604
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,700
Auntie, it looks like you.

605
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,700
I can't tell if there's something wrong with it.

606
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,700
What does it look like?

607
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,700
I'm not fat, I'm just...

608
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,200
The rain is pouring down in the rain

609
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,200
The wind is swaying, the clouds are in the forest

610
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,600
Listen, when we meet, we'll be together

611
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:52,860
True love or

612
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,860
Only memories

613
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,860
The words are still the same, the heart is not at ease

614
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,860
Can we walk forward and look at each other

615
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,860
I thought the coldness in front of my eyes

616
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,860
But it turned red and cold

617
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,860
Even the ice cream is not clear

618
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,860
It's a heart that is not hot

619
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,860
You are the sound of laughter, you are the logic

620
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,860
I still need to put you in my life

621
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,120
There is a step that is hard to walk

622
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,120
The track is the same

623
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
The track?

624
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,120
It's the same as the one you can't touch.

625
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,120
The thoughts that we have in our hearts

626
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,120
Turn into you

627
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,120
You look at me and know that I'm being watched

628
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,120
The starlight is the wind that blows

629
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,120
The horizon is the hidden place of the world

630
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,120
The shadow that is left behind

631
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,120
This, this, this

632
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,120
Is this the one that the man is painting?

633
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
Where is A'Qing?

634
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,120
Auntie

635
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,120
The more you look at it, the closer you get

636
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,380
You are the light that reminds me of you

637
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,380
I'm not afraid

638
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,380
Hurry up

639
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,380
How is it?

640
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,380
What's wrong?

641
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,380
What's wrong?

642
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,380
The real wife and her husband love each other

643
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,380
They are a couple

644
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,380
You brat

645
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,380
Listen

646
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,380
If A'Qing didn't go to that interest class

647
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,380
I wouldn't care

648
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,380
Sit down

649
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,380
If you keep doing this

650
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,380
I won't tell you the most important truth

651
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,640
If you don't tell me, I won't tell you

652
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,640
How about this?

653
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,640
As we agreed before

654
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,640
Is that okay?

655
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,640
Grandpa has to give me three yuan

656
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,640
You brat

657
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,640
You are just like your father

658
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,640
Sit down

659
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
Let me tell you

660
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,640
The most important truth is

661
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,640
It's all fake

662
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
It can't be said that it's fake

663
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
The story is real

664
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,900
The young master of Jingzhao

665
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,900
Did marry a lady named Shen

666
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,900
But she is definitely not our ancestor

667
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,900
Our ancestor

668
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,900
Is actually the good friend of young master Lin

669
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,900
Pei Fei, Pei Yushi

670
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,900
Pei Yushi was later involved

671
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,900
In our ancestor's wife

672
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,900
But I think

673
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,900
She is not as good as young master Jingzhao

674
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,900
So she said it on purpose

675
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,900
I remember

676
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,900
What's wrong?

677
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,160
Our ancestor is not young master

678
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,160
It's Pei Fei

679
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,160
What?

680
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
Grandpa thinks young master is better

681
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,160
So he said it on purpose

682
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,160
So you are totally unrelated to young master

683
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,160
You can get married
