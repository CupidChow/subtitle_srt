1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Welcome back!"

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Open the door, stop and wait...

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Fake!?

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Fake!?

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Open up the door, stop and wait...

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
split

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
How did they recognize us?

34
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,000
You should keep an eye on them for the next few days.

35
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,520
I'll find a chance to find out their whereabouts.

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,280
In order to make our ancestors relax and be alert,

37
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,280
Jin'er found a way to go home in the Silver Water House.

38
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,760
Next, our whole family pretended to be

39
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,600
a poor gold-digger who was climbing up the new osmanthus tree.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,280
It's so numb.

41
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,280
Ji! Ji! Ji!

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,120
Go with me.

43
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,040
There's a bathroom there.

44
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,080
It's the same as the one in the hair salon.

45
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,040
I've never seen such a nice hair salon before.

46
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,280
Are you crazy, Shen Gongcai?

47
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,840
I'll go with you to the hair salon this morning.

48
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,800
You've never seen one like that before.

49
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,520
I'm not going.

50
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,200
Come here. Come here.

51
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,840
Look.

52
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,040
I'm telling you, it's very pretty.

53
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,480
You've never seen one like that before.

54
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,040
Come here. Come here.

55
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,720
Look. Look.

56
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,240
It's right here.

57
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,280
It's so clean.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,440
The fingers are even fragrant.

59
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,280
And look at the bottom of the toilet.

60
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,040
It's covered with a layer of fine ink.

61
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,400
You can't see the details.

62
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,280
Feel it. Feel it.

63
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,160
One piece. One piece.

64
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,160
Oh, my.

65
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,720
You're so good at talking.

66
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,320
I can guarantee that I won't be a horse sitting here.

67
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,120
You don't even have a good horse bucket.

68
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,320
Look at this huge yard.

69
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,840
How much did it cost?

70
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,440
You're indeed our young master.

71
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,320
Of course.

72
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,680
Look, there's even a water line.

73
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,920
This is much better than the houses in our country.

74
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,920
That's right. That's right.

75
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,480
Good.

76
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,240
We've put three rounds of acid in here.

77
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,720
My legs are sore.

78
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,400
You lack exercise.

79
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,400
How about we play a blind date for them?

80
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,600
Like this.

81
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,120
That's enough.

82
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,440
Why are you pushing me?

83
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,400
Keep your voice down.

84
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,160
They're watching.

85
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,800
I want them to see you.

86
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,080
I want them to see you.

87
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,720
It hurts a little.

88
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,800
One.

89
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,440
Two.

90
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,120
Three.

91
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,040
Come here.

92
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,520
Dad.

93
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,240
Dad.

94
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,080
I can't tell that the ginger and yellow flag

95
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,800
are in the toothpaste.

96
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,240
It's for protecting your teeth.

97
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,480
It is.

98
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,000
The toothbrush's hair looks like it's from Ma Zongbao.

99
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,440
The doctor said that

100
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,320
only silkworms can use Ma Zongbao.

101
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,760
It's all because we were poor before.

102
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,160
I'm not afraid of sugar if I use this toothbrush.

103
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,520
I'll kill three times.

104
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,960
That's too much.

105
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,960
At least five times.

106
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
Thanks.

107
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,760
Thanks.

108
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,760
Young Master is here.

109
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,160
Get up.

110
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,520
Young Master.

111
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,520
Young Master.

112
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,640
We've been here for a long time.

113
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,520
The cook is slow in cooking.

114
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,520
You haven't started cooking yet.

115
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,640
It's already started.

116
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,640
Here's the thing.

117
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,800
We don't like to waste our time on food.

118
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,960
If you're not used to it,

119
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,520
you can leave on your own.

120
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,440
Liu Cheng.

121
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,840
This...

122
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,600
Take it.

123
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,240
Yes.

124
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,800
Actually, we're the ones who disturbed Young Master.

125
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,400
Actually, we can do anything.

126
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,320
We'll follow the chief editor.

127
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,080
Follow the chief editor?

128
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,200
Does Uncle really follow him?

129
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,760
For example,

130
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,960
I didn't ask Uncle and Aunt about their health today.

131
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,320
I'm afraid I'd have been invited to ask them

132
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,280
if I were an ordinary elder.

133
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,640
No, no.

134
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,960
Please have a good night.

135
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,320
I'm not good at etiquette.

136
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,760
I'll make up for it now.

137
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,360
I'll ask Uncle and Aunt about their health.

138
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,400
Please have a good meal.

139
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,000
No, no, no.

140
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,240
Don't, don't.

141
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,920
Please have a good meal.

142
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,320
Don't, don't.

143
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,840
Good, good.

144
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,800
Young Master.

145
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,800
No, no.

146
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,280
This is not good.

147
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,280
Uncle and Aunt, this is not right.

148
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,760
No, it's okay.

149
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,520
No, no, no.

150
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,680
Young Master, we have to do this.

151
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,320
Otherwise, we'll lose weight.

152
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,480
Yes, yes.

153
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
It's not right.

154
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Young Master.

155
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,520
What did Uncle and Aunt think?

156
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,560
Why did they bow to me?

157
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,440
Well...

158
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,480
Forgive us, Young Master.

159
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,240
We're from Jingzhao.

160
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,320
They can't stand it when we bow to our parents.

161
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,840
We're all white.

162
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,240
We're eating, drinking and living in vain.

163
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,040
How can we be so embarrassed to bow to them?

164
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,440
Yes.

165
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,480
Yes.

166
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,800
We should be the ones to bow to them.

167
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
Sorry.

168
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,160
This is my home.

169
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,600
I'm just a junior, not Young Master.

170
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,240
You don't have to mind these things.

171
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,680
Young Master, that's great.

172
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,440
We won't mind these etiquettes anymore.

173
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,880
Let's eat.

174
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,440
Let's eat.

175
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,240
Young Master, sit.

176
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,240
Sit, sit.

177
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,440
Young Master, sit.

178
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Young Master, sit.

179
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,400
Young Master, don't mind us.

180
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,720
We're from the countryside.

181
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,840
We're used to being in the crowd.

182
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,680
It's not right to eat.

183
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Yes, yes.

184
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Yes, yes.

185
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
Yes.

186
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,240
It seems that you didn't come to the Cui family

187
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,680
after the engagement.

188
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,040
It's them again.

189
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,800
They didn't tell me everything about the Cui family.

190
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,840
But I heard the ancestors didn't say much.

191
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,320
They must have come to Yongan when they were young

192
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,560
to learn it.

193
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,760
Didn't the Cui family enter the capital later?

194
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,480
They came to the old family less naturally.

195
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,040
Do you know

196
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,880
what happened

197
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,040
after the Cui family entered the capital?

198
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,640
Our family is low-class.

199
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,040
We don't deserve to be in the Young Master's family.

200
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,080
We guessed that we would be retiring in a few years.

201
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,600
So we didn't bother them.

202
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,240
Later, I heard that something happened to the Cui family.

203
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,680
I didn't dare to ask about the details.

204
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,680
If it wasn't for the difficulties,

205
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,240
I wouldn't have bothered to bring them here.

206
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
So,

207
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,600
after the Cui family entered the capital,

208
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,080
the two families were not together.

209
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,520
You didn't know about the Cui family.

210
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,840
Yes, yes.

211
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,240
Now I've changed my name.

212
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,440
How did you

213
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,800
find me?

214
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,880
Young Master, did you forget?

215
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,600
It was that day.

216
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,080
Young Master entered the capital to serve the Cui family.

217
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,000
We met the Cui family in the market.

218
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,200
We recognized each other.

219
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,560
Yes, yes.

220
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,600
Although we haven't seen each other for many years,

221
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,360
we are relatives.

222
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,680
I think

223
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,480
we are future son-in-law.

224
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,000
Yes, yes.

225
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,680
We are not the Cui family.

226
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,240
We are the Cui family.

227
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,960
We are the Cui family.

228
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,480
We are the Cui family.

229
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,880
We are the Cui family.

230
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,160
Yes, yes.

231
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,600
I recognized you too.

232
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,200
I'm so excited.

233
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,280
I'm so excited.

234
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
I'm so excited.

235
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,280
I'm going to the stage.

236
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,680
Enjoy yourselves.

237
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,320
Young Master, take care.

238
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,640
Take care, Young Master.

239
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,600
Dad, why don't you stand up?

240
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,480
I'm tired.

241
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
I can't move.

242
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,360
Thank you for your hard work.

243
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,760
You pretended not to see the world in the morning.

244
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,960
You wandered around.

245
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,680
In fact, you were exploring the terrain of the Cloud Water House.

246
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,040
Your pre-work was very good.

247
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,720
I really think the workshop is good.

248
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,640
We should keep this bold analysis

249
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,480
and be careful to find the right style.

250
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,040
Try to find the modern door

251
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,880
to the Cloud Water House.

252
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,840
Well said.

253
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,000
Next,

254
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,520
I will also boldly

255
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,480
make a constructive statement.

256
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,800
If you want to find out the truth,

257
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,680
first, we need to review

258
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,760
what happened on the day of the crossing.

259
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,280
According to Comrade Aji,

260
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,120
he went to this corridor

261
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,800
to chase a man.

262
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,160
After passing the corridor,

263
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,240
he came to the back door.

264
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,000
He opened the back door and went through.

265
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,880
If we walk again along the original path,

266
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,440
can we go back through?

267
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,280
That makes sense.

268
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,080
Mr. Kou.

269
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,040
Level 9

270
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,880
Hi.

271
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,040
The place we stayed together before we crossed the bridge

272
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,880
was the ancestral hall.

273
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,480
Do we have to go back there?

274
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,040
We've been there.

275
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,440
This ancestral hall

276
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,800
was changed by this small study.

277
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,200
Your dad and I went around this area this morning.

278
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,760
There are people who take care of this area.

279
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,120
It's not easy to get in.

280
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,480
What should we do?

281
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
Why are you not talking?

282
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,480
What's your name, Shen Jiansheng?

283
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,480
I'm Shen Jiansheng.

284
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,480
I think

285
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,480
there are people who keep an eye on this ancestral hall.

286
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,480
If we go there together,

287
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
it's easy to be found.

288
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
If we can send someone there,

289
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
the goal is small.

290
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
It's very likely that we can break through the block.

291
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,480
What do you mean?

292
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,480
Me?

293
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
No, no, no.

294
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
No, no, no.

295
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,480
I can't.

296
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
I'm not going.

297
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,480
It's fair.

298
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,480
How about voting?

299
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,480
Come on, let's vote.

300
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
Okay.

301
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,480
Mom, they're doing something stupid again.

302
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,480
They're cheating.

303
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
Who agrees to go to the funeral?

304
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,480
Raise your hand.

305
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,480
Come on.

306
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
Look, three votes.

307
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
I'll vote for you.

308
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,480
It's me again.

309
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
Mom.

310
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,480
Ji, you should go.

311
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,480
You're the smartest and the most intelligent person in our family.

312
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,480
Look at your dad and your brother.

313
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
Who can count on you?

314
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
Me?

315
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,480
What?

316
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,480
Ji.

317
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
Okay?

318
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,480
You can all go.

319
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,480
Yes.

320
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
Oh, no.

321
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,480
Mr.

322
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
I just thought of something.

323
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
The Shen family recognized you through your appearance.

324
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,480
That means there will be someone in the court to investigate this matter in the future.

325
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,480
It's been a long time since I've been in the capital.

326
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,480
It's hard for you to think of it.

327
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
Don't worry about this.

328
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,480
I didn't plan to hide my identity until the end since I came back.

329
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
I found it in the document.

330
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
This secret document is the number used by the Fire Tribe.

331
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,480
The corresponding number is one, two, three, four, six, seven, eight, nine.

332
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
It's actually a number.

333
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,480
This is a mark.

334
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,480
The corresponding mark can be opened when the correct number is found.

335
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,480
Nine numbers, eight blank pages.

336
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,480
There are a total of ten million possibilities.

337
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,480
Ten million possibilities?

338
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,480
That means it's impossible to push it out.

339
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
Sir, ten million possibilities are a bit...

340
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,480
Quiet.

341
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,480
Sir, I'll do it.

342
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,480
I, Liu Chang, will never eat, drink, or get angry.

343
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,480
I will also realize the ten million possibilities.

344
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
Sir.

345
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
Quiet.

346
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,480
Oh.

347
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,480
Oh.

348
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
I remember now.

349
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,480
A'Lang taught me how to unlock the door.

350
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,480
If you can find it...

351
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,480
I think I need to learn how to cure the demon.

352
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,480
One, two, three, four, five.

353
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Two, two, three, four, five.

354
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,480
There's no one here.

355
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,480
I'm so lucky.

356
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,480
I'm so lucky.

357
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,480
I'm so lucky.

358
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,480
I'm so lucky.

359
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,480
I'm so lucky.

360
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,480
I'm so lucky.

361
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
I'm so lucky.

362
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,480
I'm so lucky.

363
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
Someone's here.

364
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,480
The portrait of the ancestor was in here.

365
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,480
The portrait of the ancestor was in here.

366
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,480
No wonder 100 dramas are so scary.

367
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,480
So this is how the ancient mechanism works.

368
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,480
This room...

369
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
It's here.

370
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,480
How can the time tunnel that can take us back be in there?

371
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,480
8888

372
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,480
The door was locked.

373
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
It opened so easily.

374
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,480
Why didn't he go back?

375
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,480
But this is the lock.

376
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,480
He came with us.

377
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,480
I guess he's right.

378
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,480
This station is the link to the future time tunnel.

379
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,480
We can get home through here.

380
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,480
Young Master.

381
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,480
What are you doing?

382
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,480
I...

383
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,480
I got lost.

384
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,480
I walked into the study.

385
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,480
I came into this room.

386
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,480
I opened the lock.

387
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,480
And I'm in.

388
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,480
You were careless?

389
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,480
I'm sorry.

390
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,480
This is the number of the Fire Tribe.

391
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,480
Ordinary people don't know it.

392
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,480
How can you be careless with such a good skill?

393
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,480
I don't know what you mean by the number of the Fire Tribe.

394
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,480
But I know these numbers.

395
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,480
We used to run a restaurant.

396
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,480
We don't know much.

397
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,480
But the numbers are the most familiar.

398
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,480
8888

399
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,480
It's the meaning of making money.

400
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,480
It's a good guess for businessmen.

401
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
Young Master.

402
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,480
You let him...

403
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,480
I can't run away.

404
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,480
If it wasn't for the cooperation,

405
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,480
the old case wouldn't have been so easy.

406
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,480
The Cui family is dead.

407
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,480
How can we save the Shen family?

408
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,480
Do you mean...

409
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,480
They just took the risk.

410
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,480
They had an engagement with you.

411
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,480
The real engagement is someone else.

412
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,480
They were engaged with me.

413
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,480
But they didn't ask for the engagement.

414
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,480
They might be in the other person's secret.

415
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
No wonder.

416
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,480
This woman knows the number of the Fire Tribe.

417
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,480
I don't know.

418
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
They might have been in the Western Regions.

419
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,480
What should we do next?

420
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,480
Should we arrest them and influence them?

421
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,480
The lock on the door of the Old House is the lock on the back door of the Shen family.

422
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
Then we should lock it.

423
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Then it's safe.

424
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,480
Now you are here.

425
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,480
The Cloud Water Court is the time tunnel.

426
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
Absolutely.

427
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,480
But Young Master Lin is suspicious of us.

428
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,480
I think it's troublesome.

429
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,480
But he is a choreographer.

430
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,480
He can't kill us.

431
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,480
There should be a time limit.

432
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,480
It makes sense.

433
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,480
We should avoid the danger before the ancestors come.

434
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,480
How about this?

435
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,480
Let's recall the details of that day.

436
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,480
What happened on the day of the trial?

437
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,480
For example, what we touched and said.

438
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,480
We can't let go of any details.

439
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,480
Maybe we can go back to the past.

440
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
Maybe it will work.

441
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
Grandma.

442
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,480
I didn't write homework when I was crossing the river.

443
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,480
Maybe I can go back without writing homework?

444
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
You...

445
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,480
You don't want to write homework, do you?

446
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
Liu Chang.

447
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,480
The sky is clear in the spring.

448
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,480
The sun is setting.

449
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,480
The wolf is coming.

450
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,480
The wolf is coming.

451
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,480
The wolf is coming.

452
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
The wolf is coming.

453
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,480
The wolf is coming.

454
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
This is my grandpa's phone.

455
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
By the way, Gongcai.

456
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,480
I remember you wore a man's hat when you crossed the river.

457
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,480
You didn't cut your nails.

458
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,480
But when you tried to cross the river that day,

459
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,480
you didn't wear a man's hat.

460
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,480
You still didn't cut your nails.

461
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,480
It's not a big deal.

462
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
Does it have anything to do with him?

463
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
You cut your nails.

464
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,480
Do you have that much energy to cross the river?

465
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,480
Let me think about it.

466
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,480
I need to find a reason for myself.

467
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
What are you doing?

468
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,480
I remember now.

469
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,480
We were in the ancestral hall.

470
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,480
We worshiped the image of the ancestors together.

471
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,480
We wanted to seek blessings.

472
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,480
Yes.

473
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,480
Then this time,

474
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,480
will we worship the real person again

475
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,480
and go back?

476
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
Wait.

477
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,480
I think he's right.

478
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,480
If we can worship the real person this time,

479
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,480
we can make this event more grand

480
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
and more spectacular.

481
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,480
Then we can definitely go back.

482
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,480
That makes sense.

483
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,480
Three years after the Heavenly Punishment.

484
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,480
The car was burnt.

485
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,480
Six years after the Heavenly Punishment.

486
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,480
When did the fool die?

487
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,480
He had already found someone selling the coffin on March 26.

488
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,480
The handkerchief was already in the ice.

489
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,480
He found someone

490
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,480
who was operating the ice department.

491
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,480
That's why he sent me and my mother

492
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
to the old home in Qingyang in May.

493
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,480
He predicted that

494
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,480
something would happen if he investigated it.

495
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,480
He thought that he could protect his family.

496
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,480
Who knew that the mastermind behind all this

497
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
would be him?

498
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,480
Father died in the rain.

499
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,480
Father died in the rain.

500
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,480
The Cui family in Qingyang

501
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
was destroyed.

502
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,480
I'm sorry.

503
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,480
This handkerchief

504
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,480
won't even help if we get it wrong.

505
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,480
If we want to find a solution,

506
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,480
we need to find more evidence.

507
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
I don't think he's back.

508
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,480
What's going on?

509
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,480
Have we gone back?

510
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
I don't know.

511
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,480
Ah Ji,

512
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
what are you doing?

513
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,480
Go away!

514
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,480
Don't be afraid.

515
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,480
Don't be afraid, Yang Yang.

516
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,480
Don't be afraid.

517
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,480
Don't be afraid.

518
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
Don't be afraid.

519
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,480
Oh.

520
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,480
Lady Shan, please.

521
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,480
Young Master,

522
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
last night's incident was a misunderstanding.

523
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
I can explain.

524
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
Young Master.

525
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
Last night,

526
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,480
your family sneaked into a certain room.

527
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
You were trying to kill them.

528
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
No.

529
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
It's not a misunderstanding.

530
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,480
Misunderstanding?

531
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,480
We sneaked into Young Master's room

532
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
to pray for Young Master.

533
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
Pray for Young Master?

534
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
My grandfather once told us a magic door.

535
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,480
It can wash away the smell of the grave,

536
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:43,880
make the

537
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
magic door open.

538
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
Actually,

539
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,480
Lady Shan

540
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
is not the one who signed the engagement.

541
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,480
Right?

542
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,480
That secret document

543
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,480
is not a magic door

544
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
that can be guessed.

545
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,480
How could you know what the secret document is?

546
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,480
Why don't you be honest

547
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,480
and tell me what you are up to?

548
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,480
If you tell me,

549
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,480
maybe I can help you.

550
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,480
Help me?

551
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,480
Do you have to bully me like this?

552
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,480
I...

553
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
I'm in Qingyang.

554
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,480
I'm not a political person.

555
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,480
I won't be a coward to Luonan.

556
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
I'm not a good person.

557
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,480
I can't help you.

558
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,480
But I still want to ask for your help.

559
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,480
But you want to overthrow my status

560
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
and leave me completely.

561
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,480
If we don't deserve it,

562
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,480
we will leave.

563
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,480
Meng.

564
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,480
I...

565
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
I didn't mean that.

566
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
You...

567
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,480
Don't cry.

568
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,480
It seems that the play

569
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,480
is also from the ancient times.

570
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,480
If Young Master wants me to leave,

571
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,480
I will take my family away.

572
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,480
I just want you to say something.

573
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
I didn't mean that.

574
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,480
But I don't know what you and the Shen Family are up to.

575
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,480
There are many things to be confirmed.

576
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,480
I understand.

577
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,480
You are a difficult person.

578
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,480
It's hard to trust others.

579
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
It doesn't matter.

580
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
If you want to ask me,

581
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,480
just ask.

582
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,480
We will meet again.

583
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,480
You will know who we are.

584
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,480
I...

585
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
I...

586
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,480
What are you going to say?

587
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,480
You have a question so soon?

588
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,480
I want to ask...

589
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,480
You...

590
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,480
Do you want to eat fried tea?
