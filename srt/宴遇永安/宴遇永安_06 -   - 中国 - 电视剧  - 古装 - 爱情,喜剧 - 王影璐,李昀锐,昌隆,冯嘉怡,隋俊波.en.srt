1
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,990
=Yummy Yummy Yummy=

2
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,060
I disagree.

4
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,280
You absolutely mustn't take this job.

5
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,900
Our family just needs to earn
some money selling at the stall.

6
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,560
Hosting this kind of noble banquet...

7
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,200
One wrong move and it
could cost us our heads.

8
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,620
Jicai,

9
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,040
your mom is right.

10
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,890
Even if we pull off
this banquet successfully,

11
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,580
it'd be

12
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,040
too conspicuous.

13
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,860
Our return date is approaching soon.

14
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,340
Play it safe. Be prudent.

15
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,640
- Yeah.
- Right. Makes sense.

16
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,260
Let's drop it then.

17
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,200
Meeting adjourned.

18
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,800
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

19
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,960
Oh, right,

20
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,220
the ancestor said

21
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,760
the reward for hosting the banquet

22
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,840
is a gold brick.

23
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,780
Now that you mention it,

24
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,020
this thing...

25
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,160
I remember that,

26
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,880
as the saying goes,

27
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,080
"Great wealth comes from great risks."

28
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,920
- Yes.
- Right.

29
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,700
It's not like we can't try this.

30
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,560
Your mom is right again!

31
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,300
Think about it. Back in modern times,

32
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,280
- how many big banquets did we host?
- Exactly.

33
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,180
Did anything go wrong?

34
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,260
No!

35
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,740
So what could possibly go wrong

36
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,860
with an ancient banquet?

37
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,800
Right.

38
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,420
Did we host banquets in modern times?

39
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,680
Of course we did.

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,740
That one.

41
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,680
Then...

42
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,940
I remember.

43
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,640
You mean that Gongcai got married

44
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,100
in that little restaurant

45
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,380
on our first floor.

46
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,740
Why... bring up
that embarrassing history again?

47
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,680
Dad,

48
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,980
was your and Mom's wedding

49
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,460
in a little restaurant?

50
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,440
Yeah.

51
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,340
My good friend told me

52
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,100
their parents' weddings were all

53
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,580
in beautiful, luxurious,

54
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,700
big hotels.

55
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,340
Theirs was all show and no substance.

56
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,500
- Exactly.
- Besides,

57
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,280
you don't understand
adult matters, Yangyang.

58
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,160
You don't get it.

59
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,620
So, everyone's thought it through?

60
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,740
Since it's over,

61
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,660
no time like the present.
Let's start preparing.

62
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,260
Good. It's settled then.

63
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,300
(On the Qixi Festival,
people need to make flower cakes.)

64
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,030
(Since we want something fresh,)

65
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,020
(let's use cheese to make cheese buns.)

66
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,500
Shen Gongcai is really something.

67
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,020
No sign of him all day.

68
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,860
Who wrote this?

69
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,540
Worse than me.

70
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,420
Shen Gongcai!

71
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,220
Shen Gongcai.

72
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,900
Get up!

73
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,820
Stop playing dead!

74
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,860
What?

75
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,100
I've been busy till now!

76
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,420
Mom and Dad took Yangyang out

77
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,460
shopping all day,

78
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,180
and you're lying here?

79
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,460
- Get up!
- Head...

80
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,620
Head hurts...

81
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,420
- Get up!
- Heart... heart hurts.

82
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,300
Really.

83
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,020
I want to throw up.

84
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,940
Feel awful.

85
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,100
Really awful.

86
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,860
Might as well be lazy to death!

87
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,180
Wasting food, too.

88
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,460
I really feel awful.

89
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,780
Want me to work?

90
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,220
Not a chance.

91
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,900
Shen Gongcai

92
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,220
doesn't sprout crops when farming.

93
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,540
Lazy to death, I say!

94
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,180
Shen Gongcai,

95
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,140
you finally decided...

96
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,540
Vice Prefect?

97
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,420
In your eyes,

98
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,320
how thick-skulled must Shen be?

99
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,220
I wouldn't actually hit him.

100
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,940
I couldn't let you do this kind of work.

101
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,500
You are...

102
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,100
You are the Vice Prefect.

103
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,000
After all, these are

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,860
preparations for Her Highness.

105
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,850
I also gave my guarantee.

106
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,620
I need to handle it personally
to feel assured.

107
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,220
What?

108
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,580
Why are you laughing?

109
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,060
Is... is there something on my face?

110
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,540
No... Don't...

111
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,420
I'm laughing
because you're really a good person.

112
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,260
You clearly just want to help.

113
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,340
Afraid I'd feel burdened,
so you make up an excuse.

114
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,100
You're overthinking it.

115
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,180
Wait...

116
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,700
Vice Prefect, that robe
must be expensive, right?

117
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,900
Don't get it dirty.

118
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,540
The robe doesn't matter.

119
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,740
But what about you?

120
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,580
Stop fidgeting.

121
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,900
You can't tie it.

122
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,780
My mother made these herself.

123
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,730
They're called sleeve covers.

124
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,780
She made this apron

125
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,940
I'm wearing, too.

126
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,260
She's very skillful.

127
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,100
Alright.

128
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,300
You...

129
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,300
It's fine.

130
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,740
You're a natural hero,

131
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,780
a man of valor.

132
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,340
How could a mere maiden's pink color

133
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,860
diminish that?

134
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,940
Here, try this Qixi flower cake

135
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,500
before it even reaches

136
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,900
Her Highness's table.

137
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,820
Good for you.

138
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,220
It seems my luck is good.

139
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,860
Here.

140
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,340
Delicious.

141
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,220
This time for Qixi,

142
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,740
most would prepare fruits.

143
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,680
There are also pastries.

144
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,200
But since it's for begging for skill,

145
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,420
beautifully crafted pastries
are more suitable

146
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,100
than melons, pears,
peaches, or other fruits.

147
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,140
So I made this Qixi flower cake.

148
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,540
Is such care

149
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,020
because of the Qixi Festival?

150
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,900
It's for the Princess.

151
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,160
Sounded like there would be a benefit.

152
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,860
I don't like the Qixi Festival.

153
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,980
The cowherd lusted
after the weaver girl.

154
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,500
He hid her clothes,

155
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,430
and under the guise of love,

156
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,450
he tricked her into staying there
to bear children.

157
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,380
What love legend?

158
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,420
Right from the start,

159
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,300
he gave the weaver girl
no freedom of choice.

160
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,220
You make a valid point.

161
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,420
However,

162
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,740
most who wrote the stories were men.

163
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,260
Whether intentionally glossing over

164
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,460
or unintentionally doing so,

165
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,100
most wouldn't consider what you said.

166
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,500
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

167
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,900
I think the flavor is quite good.

168
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,820
And it's cheap, too.

169
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,980
Listen,

170
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,520
the very first person to write
the story of cowherd and weaver girl

171
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,490
definitely wasn't a girl.

172
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,780
Otherwise, how could
the weaver girl fall in love

173
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,240
with the cowherd
after he stole her clothes

174
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,100
and bound her to the mortal world?

175
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,620
Just think about it,
she must have been forced.

176
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,980
But the cowherd did it

177
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,180
because he liked her.

178
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,740
But the prerequisite
for liking is respect.

179
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,900
He should at least respect

180
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,420
others' freedom to not like him.

181
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,260
(+5 moves)

182
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,420
Dead again.

183
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,940
Why is this level so hard?

184
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,140
You're just watching a show.

185
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,180
How annoying.

186
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,940
What does it matter
what the show's like?

187
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,300
Eat it.

188
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,220
Truly worthy of being

189
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,160
the youngest Vice Prefect
of Capital Prefecture in history.

190
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,860
Perspective.

191
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,980
What does it mean?

192
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,220
It means you're magnanimous

193
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,820
and broad-minded.

194
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,610
Unlike some people who,
even after passing the exam,

195
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,720
their essential nature isn't good.

196
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,100
Must be our family genes are good.

197
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,340
What?

198
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,700
Passing the exam?

199
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,220
Genes? What do these mean?

200
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,260
These are some words I made up.

201
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,500
Passing the exam...

202
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,260
It means "rely on".

203
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,620
Some people are good at weaving tales.

204
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,690
They rely on it to make a living.

205
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,220
Genes...

206
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,620
Basically, because our family is good,

207
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,620
and you're part of our family,

208
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,820
so you're good, too.

209
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,480
Liar.

210
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,980
I think you're the one

211
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,340
who is spouting utter nonsense.

212
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,700
I can't pass.

213
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,820
Truly can't pass.

214
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,940
(Princess Fuhui's Mansion)

215
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,100
Twelfth Master, did you get lice on you?

216
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,100
This robe you lent me

217
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,700
is too elegant.

218
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,700
It highlights

219
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,860
the grace of me,
a descendant of the Pei clan.

220
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,540
If my clansmen saw me,

221
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,140
they probably wouldn't recognize me.

222
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,900
Mr. Zhou, you have such fine taste.

223
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,500
Clothes make the man.

224
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,300
You do look

225
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,300
somewhat respectable now.

226
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,620
Right?

227
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,900
Is that a compliment?

228
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,300
Third Master.

229
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,980
I have fine wine,

230
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,460
with which to feast
and delight my honored guests.

231
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,980
I have fine wine,

232
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,380
with which to gladden
the hearts of my honored guests.

233
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,980
At today's poetry gathering,

234
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,020
I fear only that I'm a mere commoner.

235
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,020
(Liu Feng, Young Master of Guixiang Tavern)
I never thought

236
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,060
a mere merchant like myself

237
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,300
would be here.

238
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,700
You jest.

239
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,900
You are Liu Feng,

240
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,980
the Third Master Liu.

241
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,820
Your Guixiang Tavern

242
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,980
prides itself on elegance.

243
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,350
Only those capable
of producing timeless masterpieces

244
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,260
may inscribe poems
on your tavern's wall.

245
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,140
You were personally invited
by the Princess.

246
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,340
If you hadn't come,

247
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,860
it would have diminished
the banquet significantly.

248
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,900
Yes. Third Master, please.

249
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,820
After you.

250
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,340
So this is the "floating cups along
the winding stream" from the books.

251
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,260
So beautiful.

252
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,980
Lady Shen, please wait.

253
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,660
Could I trouble you to brew
a bowl of tea for me?

254
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,500
Vice Prefect, I...
I'm not very good at brewing tea.

255
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,900
I know.

256
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,820
Sit.

257
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,140
Twelfth Master,

258
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,560
nowadays people stress meter and rhyme.

259
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,460
The Yuefu poems, free and unrestrained,

260
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,220
have a unique charm.

261
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,140
What do you think?

262
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,140
You like Yuefu poems?

263
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,780
So, inside, Anran,

264
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,730
you dislike constraints?

265
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,700
Are you free-spirited and unrestrained?

266
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,300
But I believe

267
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,300
the Book of Poetry is best.

268
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,500
Yes.

269
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,180
With Taoyao and Guanju poems among them,

270
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,480
you would find it hard
not to like them, I think.

271
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,980
Anran, you jest.

272
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,060
A message from Her Highness:

273
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,620
The Shen family has worked hard
organizing the banquet.

274
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,500
If they enjoy listening
to poetry and discourse,

275
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,980
they are invited to stay for the feast.

276
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,700
Thank you, Your Highness.

277
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,340
Thank you, Lady.

278
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,060
(Pavilion of Jade
in the Fairy Mountains)

279
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,980
Thank you for your trouble.

280
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,780
Her Highness

281
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,740
invites all the guests to enter

282
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,780
and sample the delicacies.

283
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,500
Wait...

284
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,860
Didn't expect Her Highness
to be so humane.

285
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,140
She's inviting us, too?

286
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,820
Look at the word you used.

287
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,660
So uncultured.

288
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,900
Fengxia,

289
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,180
she is so human.

290
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,860
Might as well go take a look.

291
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,420
What kind of talk is that again?

292
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,780
Since the Princess has invited us,

293
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,500
we can't be disrespectful
and refuse her face.

294
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,260
That's right.

295
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,980
I'm definitely confident in Jicai.

296
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,980
But you two...

297
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,700
I have absolutely no problem.

298
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,140
But you must remember

299
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,660
that this is the Princess's mansion.

300
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,660
Rules are strict.

301
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,820
And the guests today

302
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,580
- are all people of status.
- Right.

303
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,900
Must be low-key and careful.

304
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,540
Must be low-key and careful!

305
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,380
Did you hear?

306
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,620
I'll definitely be fine, too.

307
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,260
Especially you, Shen Gongcai!

308
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,980
Later, you must keep
that mouth shut tight.

309
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,720
Otherwise, they'll
chop your head off first.

310
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,340
Chop your head off first!

311
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,700
Enough! You shut up, too.

312
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,580
Fine.

313
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,780
Quick! Get ready.

314
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,820
Let's hurry over.

315
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,060
Let's go.

316
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,240
- Be cautious and careful.
- Hurry.

317
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,600
- Third Master, please.
- After you.

318
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,500
So beautiful.

319
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,900
Her Highness hasn't chosen
Guixiang Tavern

320
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,740
to host the poetry gathering this year.

321
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,500
She said there had been too many times,

322
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,860
and she wanted a change.

323
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,900
Mr. Liu,

324
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,820
what do you think
of the newly hired chef?

325
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,820
It's unique.

326
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,740
This pastry has a taste
of Western Region grape wine.

327
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,420
This one has peppercorn flavor.

328
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,110
I never imagined

329
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,020
these could be used in pastries.

330
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,500
Bet you didn't expect that.

331
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,320
I'm telling you,

332
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,860
only I could come up with

333
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,700
this idea.

334
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,900
So this was made by you people?

335
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,100
May I ask, from where did Her Highness

336
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,220
invite you all?

337
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,860
Well...

338
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:03,780
Mr. Liu,

339
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,500
someone recommended that our family

340
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,020
host this banquet.

341
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,900
Yes.

342
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,120
It was Vice Prefect Lin, right?

343
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,380
I heard he recommended

344
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,240
the Shen family
from the stall on Juxian Alley.

345
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,420
Her Highness was also very satisfied.

346
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:17,980
Really?

347
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,180
Even... even the Princess is satisfied?

348
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,260
Yes.

349
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,740
I've also tasted your family's

350
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,060
Jianbing Guozi, Lamb Skewers,

351
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,540
and drinks.

352
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,660
Quite ingenious.

353
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,900
I've also wanted

354
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,700
to consult with you
on the art of cuisine.

355
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,420
Too polite.

356
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,900
"Consult" is too much.

357
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,260
Let's exchange...

358
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,420
exchange ideas.

359
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,300
Shen Jianshe.

360
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,660
Shen Jianshe!

361
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,860
We're all brothers here.

362
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,780
It's fine.

363
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:44,900
Here. Drink!

364
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,580
I've long heard of your literary fame.

365
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,420
Vice Prefect, I wanted to invite you
to dine at my home.

366
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,660
Might you honor us?

367
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,060
What kind of poetry do you like?

368
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,320
Would you attend the poetry gathering
hosted by the Wangs and Xies?

369
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,620
Do you enjoy playing polo?

370
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,100
Not fond of horseback polo?

371
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,100
What about cuju?

372
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,320
Next time, let's play together.

373
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,240
Vice Prefect, I'm of the Lu clan,
one of the seven famous families.

374
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,420
I especially request your presence

375
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,520
to discuss philosophy at my home.

376
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,420
Thank you.

377
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,100
Drink!

378
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,620
Drink.

379
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,700
A mere merchant

380
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,700
actually managed
to cling to the Vice Prefect?

381
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,500
Mr. Shen,

382
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,660
why are you pouring the wine
into that bottle?

383
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,460
Ah, you wouldn't understand.

384
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,220
This is called awakening the wine.

385
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,620
You must awaken

386
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,140
the grape wine.

387
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,300
It means you have to wake the wine up.

388
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,940
Understand?

389
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,860
Is this awakening it?

390
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,600
Listen,

391
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,020
- Dad!
- if you don't believe me, taste it.

392
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,340
The flavor of awakened wine

393
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,500
is completely different.

394
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,340
Try it.

395
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,260
How is it?

396
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,060
The astringency is less.

397
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,180
The aftertaste is richer.

398
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,140
See?

399
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,770
I told you...

400
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,220
- Shen Jianshe!
- The grape wine...

401
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,490
Look at your dad!
Everything I told him before was wasted.

402
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,880
It's mainly about grapes...

403
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,780
Shen!

404
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,820
There are red grapes

405
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,220
and white grapes.

406
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,900
The skins of grape wine...

407
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,340
You vile merchant's wife.

408
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,880
How dare you sully me with your sleeve?

409
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,820
I...

410
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,700
What's wrong with you?

411
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,580
How...?

412
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,940
Mere merchants! Street rats!

413
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,740
How dare you set foot
in this grand hall!

414
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,260
Putting on airs.

415
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,300
Pretending to be cultured!

416
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,700
What did you say?

417
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,700
You make a fair point.

418
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,380
We common folk

419
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,860
wouldn't dare sit

420
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,180
without Her Highness' permission.

421
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,660
We've displeased you.

422
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,900
But is this public outburst

423
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,820
dissatisfaction with Her Highness?

424
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,400
You worthless wench.

425
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,480
Stop stirring trouble here!

426
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,420
- I...
- You stop!

427
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,300
What are you doing?

428
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,860
- What?
- Stop!

429
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,720
Vice Prefect Lin, you arrive in time.

430
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,180
Look at these merchants!

431
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,860
What insolence.

432
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,780
Are you unharmed?

433
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,300
Her Highness will arrive shortly.

434
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,020
Mr. Lu,

435
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,870
do you truly wish
to continue this disturbance?

436
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,340
Mr. Lu is intoxicated.

437
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,060
He'll take his leave immediately.

438
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,340
Esteemed guests,

439
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,820
let us pretend nothing occurred.

440
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,140
So that was it.

441
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,700
Apologies

442
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,780
for disturbing...

443
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,390
You've done nothing wrong.

444
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,920
One who repays injustice with integrity

445
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,780
owes no apology to others.

446
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,390
- It's nothing.
- Thank you, Vice Prefect.

447
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,320
Thank you, Vice Prefect.

448
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,180
Everyone, please sit.

449
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,820
Sit. Fengxia, sit quickly.

450
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,830
- Sit.
- Are you alright?

451
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,380
- Are you alright, Jicai?
- Sit.

452
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,400
- It's fine.
- Sit here.

453
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,940
What a commotion this caused.

454
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:21,580
Please.

455
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,420
Why must he look down on others?

456
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,420
Merchants conduct themselves honorably.

457
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,420
If people wish to eat,

458
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,860
we bring goods to sell.

459
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,260
This trade is perfectly fair.

460
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,940
Must people be ranked high and low?

461
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,780
Enough.

462
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,300
It's often said that merchants, artisans,
and itinerants occupy low status

463
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,420
and bear vulgar reputations.

464
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,380
How could they stand
shoulder-to-shoulder with gentlemen

465
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,620
or share a table as equals?

466
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,300
Excuse me, are you speaking to me?

467
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,060
I... I don't quite understand.

468
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,260
I was just talking nonsense earlier.

469
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,180
Nonsense.

470
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,700
Previously,

471
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,260
our Guixiang Tavern always handled this.

472
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,220
This time, Her Highness invited you.

473
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,540
I was puzzled.

474
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,550
Guixiang Tavern?

475
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,980
But after tasting your family's fare,

476
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,380
I'm thoroughly convinced.

477
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,380
Hearing Shen's views

478
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,940
further reveals an insightful man.

479
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,660
That phrase earlier,

480
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,220
"This trade is perfectly fair.

481
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,740
Must people be ranked high and low?",

482
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,500
is simple,

483
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,460
yet profound.

484
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,780
Profound?

485
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,660
Me?

486
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,900
Profound?

487
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,620
Give me a break.

488
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,420
(Oh my.)

489
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,100
(High-stakes commerce)

490
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,100
(often relies on simple flattery.)

491
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,500
No, I just mean

492
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,980
everything should be fair.

493
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,340
Take our family's pancake stall...

494
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,740
Many have eaten there!

495
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,900
Officials have eaten,

496
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,980
and laborers have eaten.

497
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,060
Food doesn't discriminate by status.

498
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,020
Must people be divided into ranks?

499
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,140
I respect you; you should respect me.

500
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,300
That's all there is to it.

501
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,220
Gongcai!

502
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,820
What a line, "I respect you;

503
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,100
you should respect me."

504
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,500
But if that were truly so,

505
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,100
wouldn't the world be equal,

506
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,220
with no injustice?

507
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,260
How absurd!

508
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,380
If all people regarded
each other as equals,

509
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,540
wouldn't chaos ensue?

510
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,540
Father commands, son obeys.

511
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,460
Husband leads, wife follows.

512
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,660
Men are strong, women are weak.

513
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,900
Thus it has always been,

514
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,180
forming propriety.

515
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,700
Sir,

516
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,420
you're unwed and childless, aren't you?

517
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,580
Indeed unmarried.

518
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:20,660
Then I advise you,

519
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,380
never speak

520
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,780
like that again.

521
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,100
Truly, you'll become undesirable.

522
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,500
Look at me,

523
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,100
I'm not chauvinistic at all,

524
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,460
yet my wife left me.

525
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,980
Dare you promote such notions?

526
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,700
I tell you, finding a match
will be harder.

527
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,260
Even your children would resent you!

528
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,100
Shen,

529
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,860
what is "chauvinistic"?

530
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,500
How to explain...?

531
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,940
Male chauvinism means

532
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,180
believing that as a man,

533
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,140
you should dominate.

534
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,300
Like what this gentleman just said,

535
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,700
"father commands son,

536
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,660
wife follows husband".

537
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,740
That whole philosophy

538
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,060
is male chauvinism.

539
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,780
In truth, when two people live together,

540
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,100
the most important things
are equal communication

541
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,020
and mutual tolerance.

542
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,500
I only realized this

543
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,500
afterward.

544
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,660
A husband

545
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,420
must respect his wife.

546
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,380
Ask what she truly desires.

547
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,820
Treat her well in the way
she finds meaningful,

548
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,500
not by imposing your own way.

549
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,580
Otherwise,

550
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,500
she will surely leave you.

551
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,620
Truly unexpected.

552
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,340
- Indeed.
- Excellently spoken!

553
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,100
What a devoted man!

554
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,460
Who'd have thought

555
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,580
one cast aside would still
reflect on himself?

556
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,620
Exactly!

557
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,020
Mr. Shen, you speak so rightly!

558
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,260
You strike straight to my heart!

559
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,300
What? I...

560
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,980
Mr. Shen, you're absolutely correct!

561
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,260
Truly! Mr. Shen,

562
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,580
you're absolutely correct!

563
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,940
No, no! I...

564
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,480
Choosing a husband should be like this!

565
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,140
Excellently said,

566
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,060
Mr. Shen!

567
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
Her Highness arrives!

568
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,740
Greetings, Her Highness.

569
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,420
Mr. Shen, you possess

570
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,820
unique perspectives.

571
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,380
Each word is like a pearl of wisdom.

572
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,900
Quite intriguing.

573
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,940
(Princess Fuhui)

574
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,900
What a pity. His features are coarse.

575
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,130
Otherwise, appointing him

576
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,740
as my close advisor

577
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,860
would hold distinct appeal.

578
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,100
Your Highness, you're right.

579
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,260
My elder brother is unworthy

580
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,780
to serve as your advisor.

581
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,180
Yes.

582
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,020
Well...

583
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,900
Yong'an women

584
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,260
are heavenly perfection.

585
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,140
I fear that

586
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,420
I'm unworthy of even one.

587
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,100
Speaking thus

588
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,020
only reveals your virtue further.

589
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,420
Mr. Shen,

590
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,570
share more

591
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,820
of your unique insights.

592
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,660
I shall have them recorded

593
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,220
for other gentlemen to learn eloquence.

594
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,740
No more.

595
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,580
I dare not...

596
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,500
I dare not.

597
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,880
Continue.

598
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,380
Does my presence

599
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,020
stifle the gathering?

600
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,980
Continue.

601
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,020
Thank you, Your Highness.

602
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,900
Continue.

603
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,020
Continue...

604
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,420
Am I truly ugly?

605
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,900
This exceeds
the agreed amount by fivefold.

606
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,540
You hosted the banquet superbly.

607
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,420
It's deserved.

608
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,320
Her Highness also bestowed
several bolts of silk fabric

609
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,860
for Liu Chang to bring back for you.

610
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,100
Thank you, Vice Prefect.

611
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,700
Lady Shen,

612
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,660
Her Highness summons you.

613
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,100
Greetings, Her Highness.

614
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,220
Please rise.

615
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,740
Your family's cuisine

616
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,740
pleases my palate exceedingly.

617
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,100
I summoned you to ask:

618
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,740
would you consider becoming chefs
in my residence?

619
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,140
No need to alter your commoner status.

620
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,740
Should you wish to leave,

621
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,180
simply inform me.

622
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,300
Your Highness honors us greatly.

623
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,220
But my family is rustic folk,

624
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,260
accustomed to freedom.

625
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,740
Moreover, we won't
remain long in Yong'an.

626
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,100
We fear failing to properly serve you.

627
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,700
You're leaving?

628
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,060
How regrettable.

629
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,740
With your culinary skills,

630
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,640
even without joining my household,

631
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,080
opening any eatery in Yong'an

632
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,580
would promise great success.

633
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,940
Your Highness flatters us.

634
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,500
My family behaved improperly
at the gathering today.

635
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,180
Yet Your Highness not only overlooked it

636
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,100
but rewarded us.

637
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,940
I feel undeserving.

638
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,700
At the Qixi Poetry Gathering,

639
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,900
worthies debate principles.

640
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,240
Moreover,

641
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,580
your brother spoke
with undeniable reason.

642
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,900
If anyone was discourteous,

643
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,820
it was Mr. Lu.

644
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,970
You executed the service admirably.

645
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,500
A few extra bolts of silk are no cause

646
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,860
for feeling undeserving.

647
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,330
Vice Prefect,

648
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,820
I inquired of Her Highness.

649
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,210
She bestowed only several bolts of silk.

650
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,540
The remainder must be

651
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,700
from your own funds?

652
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,180
We can't accept this money.

653
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,420
Commissioning you for the gathering

654
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:06,970
was also in my self-interest.

655
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,860
Her Highness appreciates fine cuisine.

656
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,220
You excel at cooking,

657
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,500
and you're my recommendation.

658
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,980
Pleasing her naturally

659
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,220
gains me favor.

660
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,900
Lady Shen, as a businesswoman,

661
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,060
you understand

662
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,140
this connection is

663
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,380
worth more than gold bricks.

664
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,540
Well then, many thanks, Vice Prefect.

665
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,260
For future such matters,

666
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,220
seek me again.

667
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,730
You've received
a significant portion of my assets.

668
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,940
For the foreseeable future,

669
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,540
I couldn't possibly afford
your services again.

670
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,780
Truthfully,
I'm deeply grateful to you today.

671
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,700
Without your intervention,

672
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,380
we mere merchants

673
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,060
offending nobility
at the Princess's banquet

674
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,700
would have spelled disaster.

675
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,580
Then why did you dare speak up?

676
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,820
What else could I do?

677
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,720
I couldn't let anyone

678
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,020
bully my family.

679
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,620
Indeed.

680
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,740
The fault lay entirely with others.

681
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,420
Your rebuttal was justified.

682
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,900
Vice Prefect, might you have time free
in the coming days?

683
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,740
Why?

684
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,580
We wish to invite you to dine.

685
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,260
Agreed.

686
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,180
It's settled then!

687
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,730
I shouldn't

688
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,780
disturb you further.

689
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,700
Was that...

690
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,330
all your salary
since entering service?

691
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,740
Given away just like that?

692
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,420
Though we've returned to the Capital

693
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,500
and His Majesty raised your salary,

694
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,890
you have only received two months' pay.

695
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,060
That much gold

696
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,190
could sustain their family back

697
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,860
in their hometown for a lifetime.

698
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,340
Young Master,

699
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,140
when will you be so generous to me?

700
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,060
Very well.

701
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,380
Retire immediately.

702
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,300
I'll prepare your pension funds at once.

703
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,400
How's that?

704
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,500
No need.

705
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,380
I'll just faithfully serve you,

706
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,500
drawing my monthly pay.

707
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,580
However,

708
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,860
now that Lady Shen faces

709
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,420
no further worries.

710
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,940
Young Master, you can propose

711
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,540
dissolving the engagement, right?
