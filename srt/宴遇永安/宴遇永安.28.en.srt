and it was shaped into a Xie's stick.

30
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,380
The people from the West came to China.

31
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,580
They were told to come to our place.

32
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,180
It was a very unique experience.

33
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,380
My grandfather suggested that we should improve the Biro.

34
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,580
He said that after a thousand years, people will change their mind.

35
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,780
Maybe the taste will change.

36
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,780
People will forget the Biro.

37
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,780
But if we keep innovating,

38
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,580
maybe this food will be passed on.

39
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,180
Innovate?

40
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,380
Create new ideas?

41
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,180
This word is interesting.

42
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,380
It seems that your grandfather has made the Shenzhen restaurant so well.

43
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,380
He has not only created new food,

44
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,980
but also has a unique idea.

45
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,980
How can there be no tea in Biro?

46
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,380
I want to drink your tea.

47
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,980
I asked them to buy it.

48
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,180
Your Highness, let me do it.

49
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:16,980
No need.

50
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,380
I'll do it myself today.

51
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,780
Okay.

52
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,980
I ordered your big, dirty, and green drinks.

53
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,980
I told you not to mind me.

54
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,380
I told you not to mind me.

55
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,780
I told you not to mind me.

56
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,180
The court is in a fight with Lin Shao Ying.

57
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,980
She is good at boxing.

58
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,180
She was suspended by my brother.

59
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,380
What?

00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,180
The court is in a fight with Lin Shao Ying.

61
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,780
She is good at boxing.

62
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,380
She was suspended by my brother.

63
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,580
What?

64
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,180
Your Highness, the Minister of Defense is here.

65
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,380
Minister Meng.

66
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,980
I came to see how you are.

67
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,980
You are still alive.

68
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,180
Don't worry.

69
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,980
I came from the backyard.

70
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,580
No one saw me.

71
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,180
Okay.

72
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,580
I'll go to the kitchen.

73
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,980
I'll go to the kitchen.

74
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,180
Okay.

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,980

76
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,380
Ada.

77
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,980
Can you tell me

78
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,380
what happened to the enemies

79
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:32,380
encountered by Aruhail ...

80
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,480
tens of thousands

81
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,480
But that's why they dared to stab you.

82
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,480
You want to persuade me to marry Mu?

83
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,480
But I want to marry a good son.

84
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,480
If Anran becomes my grandson-in-law,

85
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,480
he will never suffer from the whip again.

86
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,480
I don't want to marry a good son.

87
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Go back.

88
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,480
You haven't got off work yet, but you still come to see me off.

89
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,480
Do you think there's too little work?

90
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:52,180

93
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
Yes, yes, yes.

94
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,880
Young Master, Lady Shen is here!

95
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,280
Father and I made some new-tasting birch.

96
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,880
We're going to sell them in the shop.

97
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,880
Please help us with the work.

98
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,280
You know everything?

99
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,680
Young Master, the shop is closed.

100
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,480
Shall we go back and check the shop?

101
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,480
Yes.

102
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,480
Let's go.

103
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,480
Let's go.

104
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,480
Let's go.

105
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,480
Let's go.

106
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,480
Let's go.

107
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Let's go.

108
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
Let's go.

109
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
Let's go.

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
Let's go.

111
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
Let's go.

112
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
Let's go.

113
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,480
Let's go.

114
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
Let's go.

115
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
Come on.

116
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,040
I'm afraid I'll get you involved in the case.

117
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,760
You've helped me a lot with the case.

118
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,360
Now,

119
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,760
you must protect yourself.

120
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,400
A family is in danger.

121
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,880
How can you not protect yourself?

122
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,840
Shao Ying, I have something to tell you.

123
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,240
That day Lu Yun set up a trap for you in Yunlai.

124
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,120
Someone leaked the news.

125
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,080
The new cook, Yu San,

126
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,560
is the man of King Zhao.

127
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Yu San?

128
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,200
What about him?

129
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,120
Is everyone in your family all right?

130
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,960
Yu San is not a bad person.

131
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,720
He was forced by King Zhao.

132
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,440
King Zhao trapped his parents in the Wind Wailing Formation.

133
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,640
So he had to help King Zhao.

134
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,400
If we can save his parents,

135
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,920
he'll be willing to help us.

136
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,120
Wind Wailing Formation?

137
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,480
Can you trust Yu San?

138
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,800
I've been doing business for years.

139
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,720
I've learned to read people's minds.

140
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,960
I think I can.

141
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,000
But it's...

142
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,880
I trust you.

143
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,920
Leave the rest to me.

144
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,920
I'll go to Wind Wailing Formation as soon as possible.

145
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,840
It's raining heavily.

146
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,080
Lady Shen, get on the carriage.

147
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,960
The rain stopped suddenly.

148
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,960
Is it related to the case?

149
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,560
Is it King Zhao's brush?

150
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,400
I'm sorry.

151
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,200
I have to go back.

152
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,560
I forgot to tell Lady Shen.

153
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,760
The umbrella!

154
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,880
Lady Shen, the umbrella!

155
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,600
Thank you.

156
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
Wind Wailing Formation

157
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,400
Don't come here!

158
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,960
Father.

159
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,360
Father, are you dead?

160
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,520
Am I going to...

161
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,400
Am I going to turn around?

162
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,760
So I can see my father again?

163
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,680
So I can see my father again?

164
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,760
Father...

165
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,160
So I can see my father again?

166
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,360
Father...

167
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,920
From now on,

168
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,920
you are my adopted son.

169
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,800
You are my adopted son.

170
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,520
You are called...

171
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,360
Ye.

172
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,160
Yes.

173
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,120
Good.

174
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,720
You are getting better at archery.

175
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,960
Your Highness, you are the one who taught me how to use it.

176
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,040
I hope you are not disappointed.

177
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,800
You will never let me down.

178
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,840
Are you tired?

179
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
Have some tea.

180
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,880
Here.

181
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
Thank you, Your Highness.

182
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,400
Your Highness, I heard you want to move to Yongan.

183
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,200
I thought if I could enter the capital and make a great contribution,

184
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,040
I wouldn't disappoint Your Highness.

185
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Good.

186
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,560
Your Highness, I gave you your name.

187
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,720
Do you know what it means?

188
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,720
Do you know what it means?

189
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,720
I don't know.

190
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
I don't know.

191
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,720
I don't know.

192
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,560
Do you know what it means?

193
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,640
Your Highness, I hope I can live a peaceful life.

194
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,440
Now the capital is in a bad shape.

195
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,720
How can you make me feel at ease?

196
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,960
I have lost my beloved son.

197
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,760
I don't want to lose you again.

198
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,400
My love.

199
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,440
The whole world is under my control.

200
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,480
Only the people my love love me.

201
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,880
Go song or 34 years old.

202
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,480
I want to ask Isla Long Que.

203
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,520
All right.

204
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,240
I will find her.

205
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,280
Aaahhh!

206
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,520
Why me?

207
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,320
You're too calm.

208
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,360
But there are things

209
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,080
that make you sick.

210
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,600
So, Young Master,

211
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,720
you'd better tell me

212
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,960
what's going on.

213
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,280
My Keye

214
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,280
is so sad.

215
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,200
He said

216
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,040
Liu Changchu and I

217
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,240
spread out

218
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,080
and sick.

219
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,760
He said

220
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,520
I need to learn fencing

221
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,920
when I pass away.

222
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,560
He looked

223
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,320
so upright

224
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,040
and taught me

225
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,340
that you must

226
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,940
He speaks correct law surely.

227
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,060
I know

228
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,820
because he did the same to me.

229
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,580
Li suo who fuxible as I am now

230
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,620
took those course in a meal.

231
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,300
He got the place of light and love from it.

232
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,300
Even the word Anran,

233
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
was prepared by him for Li Sheng.

234
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,300
But I still thank him.

235
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,300
I thank him for saving me from the flood.

236
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,300
For teaching me to fight the dream.

237
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,300
But I never thought that...

238
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
Never thought that...

239
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
That Li Sheng would be able to save me.

240
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,300
He took over my family.

241
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,300
And pretended to be my family.

242
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,300
Seventeen years.

243
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,300
Seventeen years.

244
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,300
He was full of immoral people.

245
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,300
But he caused the Cui family to be destroyed.

246
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,300
And the whole family was destroyed.

247
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,300
I don't know how many...

248
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,300
Innocent and innocent people were killed.

249
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,300
I don't know.

250
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,300
But I think...

251
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,300
Fortunately, you look like the son he cares about.

252
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,300
Fortunately, when you don't have the ability to protect yourself,

253
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,300
you were sincere to him.

254
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,300
And you survived.

255
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,300
If you found out the truth early on,

256
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,300
even if you can pretend,

257
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,300
you will suffer too much.

258
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,300
Once a person suffers too much,

259
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,300
he will lose the ability to be happy.

260
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,300
My family and yours,

261
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,300
don't want you to only get revenge.

262
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,300
Now you know the truth.

263
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,300
You have the ability to protect yourself.

264
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,300
And to deal with the bad guys.

265
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,300
This is the most worth it.

266
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,300
You care about me.

267
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,300
I care about you.

268
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,300
Anjie.

269
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,300
I will solve everything.

270
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,300
I will never let your family worry.

271
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,300
And I will never let you suffer.

272
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,300
When everything is settled,

273
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,300
I will beg you.

274
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,300
Okay?

275
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,300
It shouldn't be me.

276
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,300
The training center said...

277
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,300
Don't believe those rumors.

278
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,300
Just believe me.

279
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,300
If Anran becomes my grandson-in-law,

280
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,300
she will never suffer again.

281
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,300
Thank you, Tan.

282
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,300
But you have not only seen me clearly,

283
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,300
but also underestimated your granddaughter.

284
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,300
The training center is in trouble.

285
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,300
I have a solution.

286
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,300
Otherwise, I wouldn't be qualified to be the governor.

287
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,300
As for Shen Jingwen,

288
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,300
she has her own world.

289
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,300
You should ask her,

290
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,300
what she really wants.

291
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,300
There is a liar.

292
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,300
I don't have one.

293
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,300
I will never be friends with anyone.

294
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,300
Why?

295
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,300
I can't figure out what you are thinking.

296
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,300
But I know myself.

297
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
I know.

298
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,300
I know.

299
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,300
I know.

300
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,300
I know.

301
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,300
I know.

302
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,300
I know.

303
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,300
I know.

304
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,300
I know.

305
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,300
I know.

306
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,300
If it were you,

307
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,300
I would never be happy.

308
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,300
What about you?

309
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,300
Lin Yan.

310
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,300
Do you remember?

311
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,300
I told you that I come from

312
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,300
a place called the future.

313
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,300
The future has a chance.

314
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,300
There are many things

315
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,300
that are beyond this age.

316
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,300
You asked me why

317
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,300
I always say strange things

318
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,300
and do strange things.

319
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,300
That's because

320
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,300
my family and I

321
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,300
are not from this age.

322
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,300
We came from a thousand years ago.

323
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,300
If you want to reject me,

324
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
you don't have to go through

325
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,300
this absurd situation.

326
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,300
The Cloud Water House is our ancestral house.

327
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,300
We came here through the ancestral house.

328
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,300
The Cloud Water House is our ancestral house.

329
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,300
Our ancestral house is the only one

330
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,300
in the world.

331
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,300
The only one in the world.

332
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,300
The only one in the world.

333
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,300
According to the map

334
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,300
that we saw in the city,

335
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
the Cloud Water House is over there.

336
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,300
We came from there.

337
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,300
We have to find a way to enter.

338
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,300
You are actually my fiancee!

339
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,300
I am lying to you.

340
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,500
There's no other way.

341
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,820
But we've failed many times.

342
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,740
There's no other way. We can only stay here.

343
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,020
And you...

344
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,900
We're related.

345
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,260
Because the Cloud Water House is your place,

346
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,980
it's our ancestral house.

347
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,980
So you're our...

348
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,460
Your關robe,....

349
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,100
Lini,

350
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:34,940
thanks for your multànも糹

351
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,820
when my grandfather died.

352
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,780
The story my grandfather told us

353
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,780
when he died

354
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,460
was just a dream.

355
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,860
That's why I knew you would chain me,

356
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,620
The white clouds are in the sky

357
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,780
The clouds are in the sky

358
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,220
It's too ridiculous

359
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,260
It's too ridiculous

360
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,940
It's impossible

361
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,260
Do you remember the lock in the study?

362
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,940
Why can't you break it?

363
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,140
But I can open it easily

364
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,420
Because the lock

365
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,300
It comes from our time

366
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,340
Why can't I break it?

367
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,100
The lock can be opened so easily

368
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,820
Today I see three stars

369
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,580
Three stars

370
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,980
No, no, no

371
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,260
Let's go, let's go, let's go

372
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,500
Come on

373
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,860
Let's go, let's go

374
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,180
Let's go, let's go

375
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,460
The future is good

376
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,180
The future is good

377
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,500
It just needs to be developed for another thousand years

378
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,180
Then you can see the future is good

379
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,180
The world is good

380
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,180
The world is good

381
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,180
The world is good

382
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,180
The world is good

383
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,180
The world is good

384
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,180
The world is good

385
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,180
The world is good

386
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,180
The world is good

387
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,180
The world is good

388
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,180
The world is good

389
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,180
The world is good

390
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,180
The world is good

391
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,180
The world is good

392
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,180
The world is good

393
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,180
The world is good

394
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,180
Uh

395
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,180
Enough

396
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:02,860
Naive

397
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,620
People don't win

398
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,380
Then I won't kill you

399
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,100
Want someone to kill you

400
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,980
The child's health is important.

401
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,260
How about letting him vent his anger?

402
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,540
He was fine when he jumped into the pond.

403
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,700
He was skinny.

404
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,580
But his body is strong.

405
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,820
He needs to vent his anger.

406
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,060
But when he's upset, he always troubles himself.

407
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,300
I understand.

408
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,020
He was like this when mom left.

409
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,700
Yangyang, you're right.

410
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,380
That was the only time the Communist Party taught him.

411
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,220
Dad...

412
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,380
Enough. Don't worry.

413
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,540
I know my daughter.

414
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,620
Give her some time. She'll get better.

415
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,820
You're right.

416
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,740
Mr.Snowflake

417
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,980
Xie Mingyi.

418
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,420
Mr. Snowflake.

419
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,140
What are you looking for?

420
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,740
It's dirty. Let me help you.

421
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,740
I found it.

422
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,740
Tang Jun, Tang Jun, I'm listening to you.

423
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,740
The gold that was stolen by Lian Ritong and Zhao Xingzhi

424
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,740
the night before his disappearance

425
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,740
was set on fire.

426
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,740
You...

427
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:17,740
Tang Jun, are you okay?

428
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,740
Let's get down to business.

429
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,740
I invited those gold Ape to have a few drinks.

430
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,740
Finally, I got the answer.

431
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,740
After the city gate was closed,

432
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,740
the car that was supposed to deliver food

433
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,740
was out.

434
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,740
The city gate was open at night?

435
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,740
Even if it's good for the gold Ape, how dare they?

436
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,740
That's the point.

437
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,740
The car that was supposed to deliver food

438
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,740
had a public entrance.

439
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,740
It was for the benefit of the gold Ape.

440
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,740
No wonder the gold Ape didn't say a word.

441
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,740
Zhao Xingzhi must be in that car.

442
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,740
Hurry up!

443
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,740
Tang Jun ordered that

444
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,740
these goods must be transported to Fenglin Town tomorrow.

445
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,740
If the gold Ape comes, it'll be a problem.

446
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,740
Hurry up!

447
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,740
Hurry up!

448
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,740
Hurry up!

449
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,740
Fenglin Town again.

450
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,740
It seems that their destination is there.

451
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,740
Why did you ask me to come?

452
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,740
I'll go to the palace tomorrow morning.

453
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,740
Then I'll go to Fenglin Town.

454
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,740
You stay here.

455
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,740
Take care of the Shen Family.

456
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,740
Take care of the Shen Family.

457
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,740
Very good.

458
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,740
Go!

459
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,740
Why are you here, Mr. Shen?

460
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,740
I'm looking for Young Master.

461
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,740
Young Master is not here.

462
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,740
Just tell me what you need.

463
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,740
Actually,

464
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,740
Ji told us everything.

465
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,740
I know

466
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,740
that Young Master is in a bad mood

467
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,740
after being suspended from his post.

468
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,740
He also had a little problem with our Ji.

469
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,740
I can understand all of this.

470
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,740
But I can't stop

471
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,740
my evil business.

472
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,740
What should I do with my talent?

473
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,740
So I asked Young Master

474
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,740
if he had anything to do with me.

475
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,740
He told me that

476
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,740
you should take care of yourself

477
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,740
if he is here.

478
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,740
How can I do that?

479
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,740
I'll ask him myself.

480
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,740
Mr. Shen,

481
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,740
Young Master is not here.

482
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,740
If he is not here,

483
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,740
I'll wait for him.

484
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,740
Don't you know

485
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,740
how we worked together

486
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,740
when we were in the cloud?

487
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,740
We had a great chemistry.

488
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,740
We had a great feeling.

489
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,740
And now

490
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,740
the key to the case is

491
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,740
how can he not have me?

492
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,740
Young Master is not here.

493
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,740
So it's useless for you to wait for him.

494
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,740
Young Master was expelled from the capital so quickly.

495
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,740
Our Young Master

496
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,740
went to Fenglin Town.

497
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,740
Fenglin Town?

498
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,740
What a familiar name!

499
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,740
When Young Master went to Fenglin Town,

500
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,740
he went to Zhao Fu Zi and Yu San's parents.

501
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,740
You don't know

502
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,740
that I went to Fenglin Town

503
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,740
when I went to the martial arts.

504
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,740
At that time,

505
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,740
I was begging for food.

506
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,740
I was begging for life!

507
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,740
I walked across every inch of the land there.

508
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,740
So I could feel the love

509
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,740
and the love of the land

510
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,740
before I left.

511
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,740
I was so proud of it!

512
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,740
No one is more suitable than me to help him.

513
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,740
Before my husband left,

514
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,740
he was so kind to me.

515
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,740
He asked me to take good care of you.

516
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,740
How can I be like you?

517
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,740
How can I explain to him?

518
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,740
Lady Shen!

519
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,740
Lady Shen!

520
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,740
Please persuade your brother.

521
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,740
I have to go to Lin Ye.

522
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,740
Where is Zhao Xun?

523
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,740
It's all here.

524
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,740
Shao Yin!

525
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,740
Zhao Fu Zi!

526
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,740
Are you okay?

527
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,740
I'm fine.

528
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,740
Do you know

529
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,740
where they keep the others?

530
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,740
I heard about it.

531
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,740
They are in Fenglin Town.

532
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,740
Follow me!

533
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,740
Go!

534
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,740
Hurry up!

535
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,740
I didn't know you would come here.

536
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,740
Lu Yun, you fool!

537
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,740
You told me you didn't find anything.

538
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,740
It seems that I know you better.

539
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,740
Lin Ye,

540
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,740
I've been waiting for you here.

541
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,740
I've been waiting for you here

542
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,740
because you look like my brother.

543
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,740
So I let you live for a few years.

544
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,740
I'll kill this bastard

545
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:48,740
who was supposed to go to hell 17 years ago.

546
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,740
Mother,

547
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,740
why are you talking so much?

548
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,740
Who can hear the end?

549
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,740
I'll kill him!

550
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,740
He must go back to his room!

551
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,740
Stop!

552
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,740
I taught you how to use swords.

553
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,740
He never did this to me.

554
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,740
Today I'll kill you

555
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,740
and bring you to my father

556
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,740
so that he can see

557
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,740
your miserable death.

558
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,740
I'll kill you!

559
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,740
I'll kill you!

560
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,740
I'll kill you!

561
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,740
I'll kill you!

562
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,740
I'll kill you!

563
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,740
You're a loser!

564
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,740
Get out!

565
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,740
Slow down.

566
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,740
Slow down.

567
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,740
Mr. Li,

568
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,740
hold on a little longer, okay?

569
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,740
Come on.

570
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,740
