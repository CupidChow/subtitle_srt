00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,940
=Episode 2=

3
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,680
Be careful!

4
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,740
(Yunshui Manor)

5
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,400
Vice Prefect Lin, sorry.

6
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,150
Sir, sorry.

7
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,280
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,120
Get up.

9
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,030
Who are you?

10
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,860
Greetings, Vice Prefect Lin.

11
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,420
I am Shen Shaoguang.

12
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,000
My family has a stall in Juxian Alley.

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,300
I heard that you've taken office.

14
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,200
Your food on the way
might not be good enough,

15
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,000
so I came to make
Jianbing Guozi for you,

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,140
delivering pancakes to you.

17
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,100
It's straight
to the Vice Prefect's face.

18
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,060
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,500
You are

20
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,700
Shen Shaoguang?

21
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,140
I'll give you another chance.

22
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,560
Reveal the ringleader,

23
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,940
restore the normal market price,

24
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,860
and never do it again.

25
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,260
Reveal the mastermind.

26
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,460
Mastermind?

27
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,380
I know. It's my sister Shen Shaoguang.

28
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,460
It was all her idea.

29
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,580
She said to have an auction,

30
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,700
and then we'd make a fortune.

31
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,460
Vice Prefect, you know me?

32
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,140
I've become so famous so quickly?

33
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,060
The Pancake Belle?

34
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,860
Alright.

35
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,020
Go back now.

36
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,020
Don't inflate the prices ever again.

37
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,780
Otherwise, you'll be flogged.

38
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,580
What do you mean?

39
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,260
Don't you know

40
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,300
what you've done?

41
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,900
(Yunshui Manor)
Vice Prefect Lin, I...

42
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,900
Stop!

43
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,260
Auntie.

44
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,340
So, you just sold out your sister

45
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,100
right in front of our ancestor?

46
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,700
I didn't.

47
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,060
Isn't he our ancestor?

48
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,020
I knew our family

49
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,720
would definitely love Jianbing Guozi.

50
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,820
So, he had a bad impression

51
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,220
of me from the start.

52
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,900
Shen Gongcai, you've ruined everything.

53
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,180
Jicai, instead of complaining about me,

54
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,260
why don't you

55
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,900
think of a way

56
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,060
to get close to our ancestor

57
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,380
and sneak into Yunshui Manor?

58
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,420
I had a plan, okay?

59
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,580
Well.

60
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,260
Do you have money?

61
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,340
- I'll buy some other food.
- What?

62
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,100
All you can do is eat, huh?

63
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,860
Mom and Dad are working
in the inn's kitchen.

64
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,800
Get up and go help them.

65
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,060
Sure, I'll go in a bit.

66
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,220
Now.

67
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,500
I'll go at once.

68
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,340
I'll go.

69
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,820
Get up!

70
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,820
Get up now!

71
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,780
Get up!

72
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,540
You ruined my plan, and you won't help?

73
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,540
Shen Gongcai!

74
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,380
Did I say I wouldn't go?

75
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,660
Come on.

76
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,220
(A rough start.)

77
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,060
(Yunshui Manor)
(But our family has loved)

78
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,580
(Jianbing Guozi for three generations.)

79
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,780
(I just can't believe it.)

80
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,920
(If I show up
before the ancestor every day,)

81
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,380
(he'll surely notice me.)

82
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,140
Here.

83
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,220
The latest flavor we've developed.

84
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,260
Jianbing Guozi.

85
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,940
Salty and sweet options are available.

86
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,900
One qian each for Jianbing Guozi.

87
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,060
First blood.

88
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,260
(Hold on,
the ancestor will come eventually.)

89
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,740
Hold tight.

90
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,500
The latest five-colored Jianbing Guozi.

91
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,380
Don't miss out as you pass by.

92
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,780
Strike while the iron is hot.

93
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,580
Opportunities don't come every day.

94
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,180
What a delicious five-colored pancake.

95
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,040
Five-colored pancake.

96
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,140
Double kill.

97
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,620
Auntie, you're amazing.

98
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,740
I'll take this pancake.

99
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,740
- Tasty.
- Sure.

100
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,120
- I'll take it.
- No pushing.

101
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,820
The curfew is approaching.
Hurry home now.

102
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,300
Triple kill.

103
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,240
We'll leave now.

104
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,100
He's coming.

105
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,220
Jianbing Guozi!

106
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,820
Freshly baked Jianbing Guozi!

107
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,980
Delicious and affordable!

108
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,300
Young Master.

109
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,180
It's not pricey.

110
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,620
- I woke up late.
- Jianbing Guozi.

111
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,680
Why didn't you wake me up?

112
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,000
- Delicious Jianbing Guozi.
- I'll prepare the carriage.

113
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,400
Delicious and affordable.

114
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,340
Defeat.

115
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,540
Our ancestor

116
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,460
must be the person who dislikes

117
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,660
Jianbing Guozi the most in the world.

118
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,620
(Xuanzheng Gate)

119
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,700
Vice Minister Zhang.

120
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,300
Please wait.

121
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,760
I am Pei Fei,
the newly appointed Censor.

122
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,520
(Pei Fei, Censor of the Censorate)
To create a register for Mr. Lin,

123
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,820
I need the document

124
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,220
from the Ministry of Personnel.

125
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,580
I wonder if you

126
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,180
could do me a favor.

127
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,020
How could it not be given to you?

128
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,420
They're probably too busy.

129
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,700
Censor Pei, please wait.

130
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,380
Vice Minister Zhang.

131
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,060
I work for His Majesty.

132
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,020
I don't have time to deal
with a document.

133
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,140
Censor Pei, if you keep pestering me...

134
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,700
Vice Minister Zhang.

135
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,260
Vice Prefect Lin.

136
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,980
What do you need?

137
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,660
I've just taken office.

138
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,500
Without a register at the Censorate,

139
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,700
it might affect the evaluation.

140
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,660
If you're too busy,

141
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,900
I can get the document myself

142
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,180
and deliver it to Censor Pei.

143
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,940
My subordinates are just too busy.

144
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,940
How could I trouble you
with such a trifle?

145
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,020
Tomorrow morning,

146
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,500
I will send someone
to deliver the document

147
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,980
to the Censorate asap.

148
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:10,980
Thank you.

149
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,940
Thank you, Vice Prefect Lin.

150
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,500
I've heard that you live far away.

151
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,980
Did you have breakfast before court?

152
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,420
(Capital Prefecture)

153
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,860
Every time I went to the Personnel,

154
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,300
(Capital Prefecture)
Mr. Zhang could always find an excuse.

155
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,660
And you asked me to share your carriage

156
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,340
and have a meal at your residence.

157
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,700
If others see this,

158
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,820
they will surely think we are close.

159
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,140
If anyone wants
to make things hard for me,

160
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,180
they will have to think twice.

161
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,300
I really don't know

162
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,140
how to repay your kindness.

163
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,180
I'm also someone
in a foreign land alone.

164
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,660
I can really empathize.

165
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,940
Censor Pei, don't take it to heart.

166
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,540
Young Master.

167
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,580
Censor Pei.

168
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,500
Thank you.

169
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,740
Censor Pei,

170
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,700
please.

171
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,780
You prefer light flavors?

172
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:17,940
Not particularly.

173
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,540
I just don't think it's necessary
to fuss over food.

174
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,040
Food is to fill my stomach.

175
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,380
If you're not used to it,

176
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,740
I can arrange something else.

177
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,420
No, no, I'm used to it.

178
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,980
I grew up in the countryside.

179
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,140
I'm very used to eating like this.

180
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,100
You helped me a lot today

181
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,580
and even treated me to a meal.

182
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,340
I should return the favor.

183
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,980
There's no need to be so polite.

184
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,740
No, no, I must insist.

185
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,380
You can't possibly refuse a meal,
can you?

186
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,580
(Yunshui Manor)

187
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,460
Fortunately,

188
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,300
Father bought Yunshui Manor

189
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,580
under someone else's name.

190
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,120
It wasn't listed
in the confiscation inventory,

191
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,300
so I could buy it back.

192
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,780
17 years ago,

193
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,840
when your father served as the Prefect,

194
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,120
he was imprisoned
for selling official positions.

195
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,220
The Censorate at that time
was all over him.

196
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,680
The Cui family was slandered,

197
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,700
and they had no small part in it.

198
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,380
Why bother with Pei Fei?

199
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,260
At that time, Censor Pei
was still at home mourning

200
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,820
and hadn't taken up his post here.

201
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,660
What does this

202
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,500
have to do with him?

203
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,060
If we're talking about zodiac signs,

204
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,660
you should be a vengeful one.

205
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,100
How could you not care?

206
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,820
You think Pei Fei might be useful
when you need

207
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
to investigate the Censorate, right?

208
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,300
(Be cautious.)

209
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,260
My father used to keep all his books

210
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,260
and notes in the study.

211
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,300
Perhaps we can find some clues there.

212
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,220
Everyone outside
has been taken care of, right?

213
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,380
Don't worry.

214
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,260
Even a mouse

215
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,500
wouldn't get in here.

216
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,260
(Langhuan Chamber)

217
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,140
Father built this hidden door secretly.

218
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,200
Yunshui Manor
has been abandoned for years,

219
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,380
so no one has discovered it.

220
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,460
What kind of lock is this?

221
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,220
Your father made it.

222
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,020
He found it years ago.

223
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,860
Seemingly from the Western Regions.

224
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,180
Only my mother and he
knew how to open it.

225
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,140
They never allowed me to play in here,

226
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,540
always keeping this place locked.

227
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,860
So, you don't know

228
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,160
how to open it?

229
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,440
It shouldn't be too hard.

230
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,540
There's no keyhole.

231
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,500
Very well.

232
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,280
Interesting.

233
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,340
(Congrats on getting a free tasting)

234
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,220
Auntie, you're so amazing.

235
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,120
How did you come up with this idea?

236
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,320
It's because of our ancestor.

237
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,180
I don't believe

238
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,340
he can resist the temptation
of a free meal.

(Jingsi Study)

240
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,460
Young Master,

241
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,100
are we really stuck

242
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,460
by a Western Regions lock?

243
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,900
Don't worry.

244
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,120
We'll figure it out eventually.

00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,260
(Jingsi Study)

246
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,780
What is this?

247
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:09,540
(Congrats on getting a free tasting
at Shen's Diner)

248
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,900
Didn't you say

249
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,540
not even a mouse would get in here?

250
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,940
I'll go find them right now.

251
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,980
Come back.

252
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,280
Shen's Diner?

253
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,020
The ones who were selling pancakes

254
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,100
are the Shens, right?

255
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,020
That's right.

256
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,660
If it really is them,

257
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,300
the way they write, fold things,

258
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,780
run their business, and they talk...

259
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,920
Everything seems a bit odd.

260
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,140
It's as if they're trying

261
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,140
to get my attention.

262
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,980
Could it be

263
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,780
that someone has discovered your secret?

264
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,860
(Minfu Inn)

265
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,660
I've drawn for four hours.

266
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,300
How could someone
not be interested in a free meal?

267
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,380
Auntie, should we give up?

268
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,260
Let's think of another way.

269
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,180
My god, give me a miracle.

270
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,380
Tell me how I can get in touch

271
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,300
with our ancestor.

272
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,740
How should I treat
the Vice Prefect to a meal?

273
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,980
This is all too expensive.

274
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,620
My monthly salary won't cover it.

275
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,660
(Congrats)
Anyone holding this flyer

276
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,460
can enjoy a free tasting

277
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,260
at Earth Room I, Minfu Inn.

278
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,740
Censor Pei,
where are you taking me to eat?

279
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,100
You're new here.

280
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,180
You probably don't know much
about Yong'an.

281
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,420
As the saying goes,

282
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,000
the best delicacies in the world
are in Yong'an,

283
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,380
and the best dishes of Yong'an
are in Juxian Alley.

284
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,020
The place we're going to eat at

285
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,780
is a diner that's about to open

286
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,860
in Juxian Alley.

287
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,380
Before it officially opens,

288
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,620
they're offering

289
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,260
free tastings.

290
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,540
Free tastings?

291
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,580
Yes.

292
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,380
Did you receive

293
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,980
that winning flyer?

294
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,660
You also know that?

295
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,300
I was actually worried

296
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,540
that I'm short on money,

297
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,780
and inviting you to a meal

298
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,260
that's a free tasting

299
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,420
might upset you.

300
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,500
Judging by your expression,

301
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,940
could it be that you also
kept that flyer,

302
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,940
thinking of going
for a free tasting someday?

303
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,620
That's perfect.

304
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,500
Let's go for the free tasting right now.

305
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,580
It's almost curfew time.

306
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,180
The ancestor won't come.

307
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,040
Yangyang,

308
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,420
go to the kitchen and tell Grandpa
not to heat the dishes.

309
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,740
It's been reheated many times.

310
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,420
Let's just eat already.

311
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,460
Auntie, cheer up.

312
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,620
Grandma always said

313
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,620
that sighing
would let fortune slip away.

314
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,020
There we go; the fortune is back.

315
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,820
Is this the place for the free tasting?

316
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,460
- Vice Prefect Lin.
- Vice Prefect Lin.

317
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,900
Please come in.

318
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,500
(Earth Room 1)
To Mr. Pei and Mr. Lin,

319
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,420
let's drink.

320
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,420
Come on, come on.

321
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,420
Cheers.

322
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,500
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

323
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,060
- We'll drink first.
- Cheers.

324
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,540
Mr. Lin, why didn't you drink?

325
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,980
This is kinda inappropriate, right?

326
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,020
Mr. Lin,

327
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,780
it was indeed wrong of us

328
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,300
to inflate the prices before.

329
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,220
Drink this cup,

330
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,940
and don't hold it
against us anymore, okay?

331
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,820
Yes.

332
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,860
Sorry.

333
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,140
I don't drink alcohol.

334
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,460
- Let me tell you something.
- Auntie,

335
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,780
what does he mean?

336
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,960
He doesn't drink alcohol.

337
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,400
People in this era like to say that.
It's more pretentious.

338
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,820
What is this?

339
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,860
You're being boring.

340
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,740
This is called lobster.

341
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,260
It's the highest honor
we offer to our guests.

342
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,660
- Try it.
- But

343
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,260
since we can't get the ingredient,

344
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,780
we can only use steamed buns
as a substitute.

345
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,620
How about it?

346
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,820
Give it a try.

347
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,380
Yes, try it.

348
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,900
Please try it.

349
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,980
- Lobster?
- Here.

350
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,820
Yes.

351
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,260
- Vice Prefect, try it.
- Try it.

352
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,220
Delicious.

353
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,300
You're not eating or drinking.

354
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,380
That's not okay.

355
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,780
You have to drink.

356
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,700
Yes.

357
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,620
I don't drink alcohol.

358
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,260
We can't drink anymore.

359
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,940
Curfew is coming soon.

360
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,740
We can't leave the living area
during curfew.

361
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,460
I have to go back before curfew.

362
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,300
There's even less to worry about.

363
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,180
Just stay here and drink.

364
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,020
If you're drunk,

365
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,640
- stay here.
- Yes.

366
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,620
We can make room, right?

367
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,460
Just stay here for the night.

368
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,420
Vice Prefect,

369
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,380
you have to drink for my sake.

370
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,940
There's no official
who doesn't drink, right?

371
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,580
- Yes.
- If you don't drink this wine,

372
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,500
that means

373
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,860
you haven't forgiven us, right?

374
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,800
You haven't forgiven us.

375
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,740
I didn't mean it that way.

376
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,180
Then just drink this.

377
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,380
- Just one cup.
- Just one cup.

378
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,000
It seems you are determined

379
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,620
to persuade me to drink this cup.

380
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,900
That's not true.

381
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,900
I'll drink first.

382
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,220
Look, she's drinking.

383
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,140
Good, good.

384
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,060
You can indeed drink.

385
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,360
We'll join you.

386
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,500
- We'll join you.
- Come on.

387
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,220
- Mr. Pei, join us.
- I'll have some soup.

388
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,700
Vice Prefect, let me tell you.

389
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,340
Where there's a first, there's a second.

390
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,540
Let's drink again.

391
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,940
I can't hold my drink.

392
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,460
You can.

393
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,940
Then I shall drink with you.

394
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,660
Great, come on.

395
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,220
Come on.

396
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,460
Vice Prefect Lin?

397
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,300
Vice Prefect?

398
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,340
- Vice Prefect Lin?
- Vice Prefect?

399
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,100
Finally touched the real person.

400
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,580
What are you doing?

401
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,180
This is our ancestor.

402
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,100
Jicai and I have already found out.

403
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,880
In the backyard of Yunshui Manor,

404
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,060
there's a gap when the guards
change shifts at night.

405
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,460
If we can find the key

406
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,860
and avoid the curfew patrol,

407
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,740
we'll have a chance

408
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,940
and sneak in before he sobers up.

409
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,780
Hurry up, or he'll sober up.

410
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,180
- Hurry up.
- Come on.

411
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,500
Be quiet.

412
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,380
Slow down.

413
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,980
It's okay; keep going.

414
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,780
I can't find the key.

415
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,340
We can't find it.

416
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,740
Can you two do this?

417
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,340
Let me do it.

418
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,460
- Jicai.
- You do it.

419
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,380
(In this era,)

420
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,540
(does the master even carry keys?)

421
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,060
(Should we get
his attendant drunk instead?)

422
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,920
(Maybe it's hidden inside his clothes?)

423
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,420
What are you going to do to me?

424
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,940
Stop!

425
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,980
This isn't really happening, is it?

426
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,820
Grandma.

427
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,420
(Our ancestor didn't pick)

428
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,580
(those things to target us, did he?)

429
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,380
(Yes, yes.)

430
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,860
(He can't mean to hurt us, can he?)

431
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,860
(Grandpa said)

432
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,660
(that before Lin Yan married)

433
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,780
(Lady Shen,)

434
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,420
(he used to be quite ruthless.)

435
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,100
Gongcai, wake up.

436
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,660
- What's wrong with you?
- Dad.

437
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,500
So easily frightened.

438
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,540
Then let's start with him.

439
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,380
Yes.

440
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,500
Gongcai, Gongcai.

441
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,780
No, Dad.

442
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,380
Wake up, Dad!

443
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,940
- Don't touch him.
- Dad.

444
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,180
After all this trouble,

445
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,300
you just wanted to get me drunk.

446
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,820
How about this?

447
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,360
I'll kill one of you first

448
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,660
to serve as a warning.

449
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,900
Then,

450
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,140
you'll be willing to reveal

451
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,180
your identities and purposes, right?

452
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,540
No, no, no.

453
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,420
Don't, don't.

454
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,300
Ancestor, Ancestor.

455
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,980
Please, have mercy.

456
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,820
Don't kill us,
especially not me, Ancestor.

457
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,960
Who said I'm your ancestor?

458
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,220
- Dad.
- I'm sorry. We're sorry.

459
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,740
Please, I'm begging you.

460
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,960
- Let go of my aunt.
- What are you up to?

461
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
We're sorry, we're sorry.

462
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,740
Auntie.

463
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,380
Please spare my daughter.

464
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,300
Please don't.

465
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,700
We aren't up to anything.

466
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,260
- Vice Prefect.
- I'll count to three.

467
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,330
- Vice Prefect.
- No, no.

468
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,380
- Three.
- No.

469
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,420
We aren't up to anything.

470
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,820
Two.

471
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,940
Vice Prefect.

472
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,340
One.

473
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,100
Actually, you're my fiancé.

474
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,260
(Jicai, are you crazy?)

475
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,580
(This is our ancestor.)

476
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,100
(When your grandpa told you
about our ancestor,)

477
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,220
(did he say he had a fiancée
before he married into our family?)

478
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,100
(He didn't mention it,)

479
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,860
(but those romance novels my mom loves)

480
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,820
(are always like this.)

481
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,180
(The ruthless tycoon)

482
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,580
(always has a mysterious fiancée.)

483
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,480
(It's a common plot.)

484
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,480
(I admit I'm taking a gamble.)

485
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,780
(Oh, no, it's all over.)

486
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,580
(Don't panic yet.)

487
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,220
(Judging by the ancestor's look,)

488
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,700
(did Jicai actually guess right?)

489
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,700
You say

490
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,980
you're my fiancée?

491
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,020
Do you have any proof?

492
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,540
I know your real identity.

493
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,580
Qingyang,

494
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,340
Cui Che.

495
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,100
Vice Prefect Lin,

496
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,860
originally named Cui Che,

497
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,140
was from Qingyang County.

498
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,940
When he was eight years old,

499
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,300
his father

500
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,460
committed a capital offense.

501
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,620
The Cui family was exterminated.

502
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,060
Only he

503
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,780
was fortunate enough to be saved.

504
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,700
He changed his name,
registered elsewhere, and survived.

505
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,740
Go on.

506
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,220
The Cui family was exterminated.

507
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,740
You changed your name
and registered elsewhere

508
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,940
to be safe.

509
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,180
But the family I was engaged to

510
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,340
didn't have the surname Shen.

511
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,680
We were promised
in marriage before birth.

512
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,340
When the tragedy happened,

513
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,220
you were only eight years old.

514
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,260
It's not strange
that you forgot my family name.

515
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,580
Poor you,
losing your family at a young age.

516
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,420
You can't remember many things, can you?

517
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,740
But please, rest easy.

518
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,340
We in business

519
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,540
know what to do.

520
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,300
Since I'm your fiancée,

521
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,820
we're practically relatives.

522
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,260
Why? We're not married.

523
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,300
It doesn't matter.

524
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,780
Anyway,

525
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,860
we won't breathe a word

526
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,100
about your secret to anyone.

527
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,380
Think about it.

528
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,480
We're related by marriage.

529
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,540
If we harm you,

530
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,140
we'd be implicated too, right?

531
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,020
Yes, yes.

532
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,100
When you interrogated us earlier,

533
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,740
we indeed hid something.

534
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,340
Please let us stay

535
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,900
in Yunshui Manor.

536
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,540
You want to use me

537
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,980
to live in Yunshui Manor?

538
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,220
You could have just asked.

539
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,700
Why go through all this trouble?

540
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,740
So, you mean...

541
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,260
Absolutely impossible.

542
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,500
I've actually thought of this answer.

543
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,260
A dignified Vice Prefect,

544
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,900
who eats a free meal at others' expense,

545
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,900
yet doesn't allow others
to do the same to him.

546
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,500
In that case,

547
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,460
to have a place to stay,

548
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,300
I have to use unconventional methods.

549
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,420
Mr. Pei, Mr. Pei.

550
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,780
Please get up and help me.

551
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,700
- Vice Prefect Lin abandoned me.
- Nonsense.

552
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,760
Mr. Pei, speak up for me.

553
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,220
- Mr. Lin got promoted...
- Shut up.

554
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,660
He abandoned his wife.

555
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,100
Young Master.

556
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,380
Do you want to die?

557
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,780
You touched my mouth.

558
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,660
Now, we're not only engaged

559
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,900
but also have physical intimacy.

560
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,500
You must take responsibility for me.

561
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,420
If you don't let us stay
in Yunshui Manor,

562
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,780
I'll go to the streets and cry
about your abandonment.

563
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,580
I'll count to three.

564
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,100
One.

565
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,620
Two.

566
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,860
Three.

567
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,580
Everyone, please judge for me.

568
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,580
Vice Prefect Lin, he...

569
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,660
I agree.

570
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,580
How virtuous of you.

571
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,420
You won't stoop to my level.

572
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,900
I'm truly grateful.

573
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,980
You're a gentleman
who values your promises.

574
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,900
I believe you won't go back
on your word.

575
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,020
I also promise you

576
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,060
that I won't reveal

577
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,540
anything I know to anyone else.

578
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,500
Not a third person...

579
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,140
Not an eighth person in this world

580
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,300
will know about our relationship.

581
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,720
(With important matters at hand,)

582
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,160
(this family is really suspicious.)

583
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,620
(I'll take them back)

584
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,420
(and clear things up.)

585
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,700
(Yunshui Manor)

586
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,700
(Virtue and Fragrance)

587
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,700
Yunshui Manor

588
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,140
is not quite the same

589
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,500
as the modern one.

590
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,620
Yes, it's not the same.

591
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,120
Can we really stay here for free?

592
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,180
I'm afraid Vice Prefect Lin

593
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,140
won't ask for money,
but he'll ask for our lives.

594
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,420
Don't talk nonsense and scare Yangyang.

595
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,780
Here he comes.

596
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,940
Here he comes.

597
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,380
Vice Prefect.

598
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,020
Vice Prefect.

599
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,540
If you stay in Yunshui Manor for now,

600
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,420
others will surely gossip.

601
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,740
Although we were engaged,

602
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,060
we're not married after all.

603
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,600
I really don't know

604
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,940
what basis there is for us
to live under the same roof.

605
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,260
Are you going back on your word?

606
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,540
We've already moved

607
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,100
all our luggage here.

608
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,100
- You...
- No way.

609
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,640
- Yes.
- I have to carry it all back?

610
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,940
I'm just worried

611
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,060
that if there's not even a proper basis,

612
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,860
when my colleagues find out,

613
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,980
they'll impeach me for a messy life.

614
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,100
How should Lady Shen
and I explain ourselves?

615
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,980
I read Dream of the Red Chamber...

616
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,540
I read in a book

617
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,780
that relatives can live together

618
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,520
in an emergency,
even if they're unmarried.

619
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,700
Besides, we have so many elders here.

620
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,380
You can just tell people

621
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,500
that I'm your cousin.

622
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,700
We've fallen on hard times
and came for help.

623
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,980
- Yes.
- Yes, yes.

624
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,540
We're all relatives.

625
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,820
Alright.

626
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,420
It can hold off for a while.

627
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,700
Thank you, Vice Prefect.

628
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,900
(This guy)

629
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,780
(clearly guided us to propose)

630
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,060
(to live as relatives)

631
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,580
(and made us feel
like we're troubling him.)

632
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,340
(As expected of our ancestor.)

633
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,100
(Also a cunning merchant.)

634
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,900
You reluctantly took us in,

635
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,500
and we're reasonable people.

636
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,740
The youngest Vice Prefect in history

637
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,020
can't have an unmarried wife

638
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,420
from the countryside like me.

639
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,580
Calling us cousins is the best solution.

640
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,700
I understand the rules.

641
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,000
The first step to success is
to cut ties with your lover.

642
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,180
The first step to success is
to cut ties with your lover?

643
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,180
It means I know you don't want

644
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,580
to marry me.

645
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,860
You're not like an ordinary young lady.

646
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,100
You don't seem sad

647
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,940
after losing your marriage.

648
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,820
No.

649
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,540
I'm just putting on a brave face.

650
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,900
She's very sad.

651
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,500
Yes, quite upset.

652
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,540
The west wing is ready.

653
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,380
Everyone,

654
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,940
you can settle down here for now.

655
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,540
Thank you, Vice Prefect.

656
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,060
Thank you, thank you.

657
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,020
Liu Chang.

658
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,100
Everyone,

659
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,420
please.

660
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,580
Alright, alright.

661
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,580
Let's go pick rooms.

662
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,420
What about me? You're leaving?

663
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,780
Auntie, hurry up.

664
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,920
- Slow down.
- Hurry.

665
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,260
At least help me carry something.

666
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,460
(Start Near to Go Far)

667
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,380
Lady Shen.

668
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,420
Vice Prefect Lin.

669
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,540
Ancestors,

670
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,340
we've offended you.

671
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,420
Please forgive us.

672
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,660
Lady Shen, I had no other choice

673
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,020
but this desperate measure.

674
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,860
Who knew it'd actually work?

675
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,820
Yes.

676
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,060
If we hadn't said that,

677
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,860
Vice Prefect Lin would've killed us.

678
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,580
We were left with no other option.

679
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,660
But it was mostly Jicai's idea.

680
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,740
She's the mastermind.

681
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,260
You brat.

682
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,180
Ancestors,

683
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,260
we truly had no idea

684
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,180
that Vice Prefect Lin had a fiancée

685
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,540
before he married into our family.

686
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,140
You two

687
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,980
will have to sort it out

688
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,980
down there in the afterlife.

689
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,780
What's the matter now?

690
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,140
Is this the point?

691
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,100
You can't even repent properly.

692
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,380
Ancestors,

693
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,260
we will find a way back asap

694
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,060
to end this absurdity.

695
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,600
We've offended you greatly.

696
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,700
Please forgive us.

697
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,980
Forgive us.

698
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,020
We're really sorry.

699
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,900
Sorry, sorry.

700
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,670
- Sorry, Ancestors.
- I'm sorry.

701
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:24,940
I'm sorry.

702
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,740
Jicai,

703
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,180
do you think that such a big lie

704
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,260
might cause a butterfly effect?

705
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,700
Because we changed the past,

706
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,100
it might affect the future?

707
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,580
That would be bad.

708
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,060
Then there wouldn't be us, right?

709
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,100
Yes. Well...

710
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,400
There's no other way.

711
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,420
If we hadn't said that,
there would be no future.

712
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,860
We'd have been killed at once.

713
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,380
Yangyang, come here.

714
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,040
- What's that sound?
- Someone seems to be there.

715
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,020
As expected.

716
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,900
What do you mean?

717
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,980
He's spying on us as expected.

718
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,860
What do you mean?

719
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,320
I only understood "black".

720
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,060
It's he.

721
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,940
(Permutations and combinations)

722
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,820
Young Master.

723
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,500
This family

724
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,860
hasn't slept.

725
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,380
They're huddled together, muttering.

726
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,580
I can't quite make out
what they're saying.

727
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,340
What do you plan to do next?

728
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,940
They went through all this trouble
to get here.

729
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,940
They won't just stay quietly.

730
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,140
Wait for them to move.

731
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,180
Liu Chang,

732
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,940
my parents did arrange
a marriage for me,

733
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,620
but as far as I can remember,

734
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,580
she was a Zheng,

735
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,060
not a Shen.

736
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,440
Do you remember anything?

737
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,860
I've been in the Cui family
since I was young,

738
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,620
but I've always been doing odd jobs.

739
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,220
I've never heard of these things.

740
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:31,980
Look.

741
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,100
I just taught him
how to make a Sinan chariot,

742
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,340
and he's been busy with it all day.

743
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,340
Father, Mother.

744
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,060
Father, I've learned how to make this.

745
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:45,900
Let me see.

746
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,500
This is so exquisite.

747
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,060
Good, good.

748
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,900
The Sinan chariot can be used

749
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,180
for transporting goods during war,

750
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,820
but it doesn't mean
it's always a good thing.

751
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,580
Our family

752
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,420
should be good generals during wartime,

753
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,060
protecting our country,

754
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,820
- but we still hope...
- But we still hope

755
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,100
that every day is as peaceful as today,

756
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,300
and we only need to be loyal,

757
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,280
- protecting the people.
- Protecting the people.

758
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,020
Alright, I won't say more.

759
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,900
Your mother will tell you.

760
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,780
Che, actually,

761
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,380
we have arranged
a marriage for you today.

762
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,020
When you grow up,

763
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,900
you must treat the young lady well.

764
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,380
Why arrange a marriage?

765
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,220
What's the use of a wife?

766
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,860
She can't make a Sinan chariot for me.

767
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,300
Che,

768
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,740
because we

769
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,300
can't be with you forever,

770
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,740
so we hope you can have your own family.

771
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,980
Don't you always want to be a great man?

772
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,180
A great man should be like your father,

773
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,620
accountable to friends,
relatives, and family,

774
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,580
and live up to the people and the world.

775
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,500
Check thoroughly.

776
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,360
Don't leave anyone behind.

777
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,700
Mother.

778
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,900
Young Master, calm down.

779
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,380
My leg seems to be broken.

780
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,380
I can't walk.

781
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,260
Search carefully.

782
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,940
Leave no one alive.

783
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,300
Young Master,

784
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,580
why don't you

785
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,380
just leave me behind?

786
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,300
I'm just a servant
in the outer courtyard.

787
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,740
Your family

788
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,700
has always treated me well.

789
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,820
I can't let

790
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,020
the last Cui die

791
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,460
because of me.

792
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,380
Shut up, Liu Chang.

793
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,220
Look further inside.

794
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,740
Do you want to draw everyone here?

795
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,580
We're not at a dead end yet.

796
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,180
Let me carry you.

797
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,540
Che,

798
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,860
your father would never do such a thing.

799
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,660
You must survive,

800
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,220
find out the truth,

801
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,980
and clear our family's name.

802
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,740
But so many years have passed.

803
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,540
Your appearance has changed greatly.

804
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,580
How did this family

805
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,620
recognize you?

806
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,440
For the next few days,

807
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,700
keep a close eye on them.

808
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,980
I'll also find an opportunity

809
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,660
to probe their background.
