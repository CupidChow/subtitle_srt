In the Juxian Lane,

all the food

18
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,000
will move

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,680
the hearts of thousands of people.

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,640
In this era,

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,280
there are still dishes like fried food.

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,480
Cooking such dishes

23
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,920
will either open a big river

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,760
or emphasize a elegance.

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,960
In the two most famous restaurants in Juxian Lane,

26
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,160
the first one is

Here comes the pork leg.

30
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,840
The wound inside the pork has not healed.

31
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,720
Now, the food

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,440
will be served.

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,000

40
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,160
Thank you for your hospitality!

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:25,420
Please don't

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,640
Yes.

43
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,760
We don't belong to this era.

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,480
But why

45
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,120
did we open a restaurant in Yong'an?

46
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,000
This matter

47
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,920
has to start from two months ago.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000

Shen Ji Polish

73
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,980
You know I'm your brother?

74
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,180
You scared me.

75
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,060
You look like a brother.

76
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,980
The food is here.

77
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,580
Hurry up.

78
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,140
Ji.

79
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,220
Are you going to

80
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,860
let us go back to the ancient times

81
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,500
and cook for our ancestors?

82
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,860
Can we do that?

83
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,740
Of course.

84
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,580
I've taken out all the money

85
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,420
I've spent on the writing of the script

86
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,220
for MCN.

87
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,540
But it's enough for us to make a video.

88
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,980
So, we must succeed.

89
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,300
We must not fail.

90
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,820
We must bring back our restaurant.

91
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,660
I'm not afraid of you.

92
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,300
Hurry up.

93
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,780
But where are we going to make a video?

94
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,820
Go to our family's house.

95
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,900
This is the popular

96
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,940
internet celebrity's restaurant,

97
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,060

Travel around the world.

99
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,300
The environment is so beautiful.

100
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,020
The environment is so beautiful.

101
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,980
Yang Yang, come here.

102
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,820
I'm Shen Jianshe.

103
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,900
I'm a wife of Li Fengxia.

104
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,180
I'm the granddaughter of

105
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,460
Shao Jie, Shaoguang,

106
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,060
and the granddaughter of Yang Yang.

107
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,860
I bow to my ancestors.

108
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,500
I hope that you can bless

109
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,340
our Shen Family's restaurant

110
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,740
to be well-run

111
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,700
and to be reborn.

112
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,660
Grandma.

113
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,020
What kind of person

114
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,380
are our ancestors?

115
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,020
You have to ask your dad

116
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,860
and your aunt

117
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:14,980
about the story of our ancestors.

118
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,020
Grandpa Zeng only told them.

119
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,620
This one.

120
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,700
You must remember

121
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,940
the story of our ancestors.

122
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,300
More than a thousand years ago,

123
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,580
Lin Yan, the young master of Jingzhao,

124
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,420
moved to Yun Shuiyue

125
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,980
after he got the job.

126
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,620
Lin Shao Yin

127
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,020
also joined our Shen Family.

128
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,980
What happened next?

129
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,860
I'll tell you later.

130
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,700
We'll hurry up and shoot.

131
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,620
It's going to be dark soon.

132
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,260
That's right. Hurry up.

133
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,140
Ji.

134
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,700
Do we still need

135
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,380
someone who can play the role of our ancestors?

136
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,620
Wait here.

137
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,620
I'll go get a nail.

138
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,140
Duan Lian has been working out for so many generations.

139
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,420
I wonder what happened in the middle.

140
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,500
It's not a good idea to get a nail.

141
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,380
What?

142
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,860
I'm in the city.

143
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,780
I'll go find you later.

144
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,420
Okay.

145
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,260
Okay.

146
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:07,860
Got it.

147
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,860
One more.

148
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,700
Another one.

149
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,500
Okay.

150
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,340

151
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,100
Hong You.

152
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,740
I'm not a bad person.

153
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,980
I just want to ask you for a favor.

154
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,060
Hong You.

155
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,780

162
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,100
He went out from the back door?

163
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,780
Fried garlic.

164
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,980
Ready to have a steamer son.

165
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,460

172
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,140
Is there a mountain outside the back door of the Cloud Water Court?

173
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,740
What's going on?

174
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,140
Something's wrong.

175
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,260
Is there anyone?

176
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,700
Is there anyone?

177
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,980
Is there anyone?

178
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,140
What's going on?

179
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,380
A Ji!

180
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,980

184
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Brother!

185
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,100
What's going on?

186
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,100
The Cloud Water Court is gone.

187
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,900
Gone?

188
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,900
The Cloud Water Court is gone?

189
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,700
Why are you here?

190
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,700
We were looking for you.

191
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,700
We suddenly saw something.

192
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,700
Yes.

193
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,700
We walked and walked and walked.

194
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,700
It's a ghost.

195
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,700
Brother, is that Jing Qi's new item?

196
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,700
Let me tell you, A Ji.

197
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,700
Don't be anxious.

198
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,700
Jing Qi must be busy.

199
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,700
She sneaked in without spending money.

200
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,700
Let's go.

201
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,700
Let's go for a ride.

202
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,700
It's so lively.

203
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,700
Let's go and have a look.

204
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,700
It's so beautiful.

205
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,700
This place?

206
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,700
Where did they get it?

207
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,700
Look at your clothes.

208
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,700
You left it here.

209
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,700
A Ji.

210
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,700
It's so special.

211
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,700
What kind of dance are they dancing?

212
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,700
If I'm not wrong,

213
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,700
this should be

214
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,700
a big-scale action script killing.

215
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,700
What is a script killing?

216
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,700
You don't even know what a script killing is.

217
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,700
Have you killed before?

218
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,700
I haven't.

219
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,700
Let's go.

220
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,700
Let's go.

221
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,700
Look at how much they spent.

222
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,700
It's so cool.

223
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,700
This...

224
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,700
It's so nice.

225
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,700
Look over there.

226
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,700
There's a detective.

227
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,700
He's a big shot.

228
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,700
It's so fun.

229
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,700
Look at this.

230
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,700
It's so fun.

231
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,700
This is a little sister.

232
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,700
A sister?

233
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,700
Really?

234
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,700
What's the character?

235
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,700
A Ji.

236
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,700
No.

237
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,260
It's so cool.

238
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,260
It's so cool.

239
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,260
It's so cool.

240
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,260
It's so cool.

241
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,260
It's so cool.

242
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,260
It's so cool.

243
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,260
It's so cool.

244
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,260
It's so cool.

245
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,260
Where's the actor?

246
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,260
Why does he look so alike?

247
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,260
He does look alike.

248
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,260
He does look alike.

249
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,260
In a script killing,

250
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,260
people don't call him an actor.

251
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,260
They just call him a NPC.

252
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,260
Go into the room and arrest them.

253
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,260
Search the place.

254
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,260
The detective game has started.

255
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,260
It's started.

256
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,260
Go.

257
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,260
Go.

258
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,820
Go.

259
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,820
Oh my god.

260
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,820
It's so cool.

261
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,820
It's so cool.

262
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,820
Oh my god.

263
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,340
Oh my god.

264
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,900
Good.

265
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,500
Good.

266
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,300
Good.

267
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,900
You did a great job.

268
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,780
Really.

269
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,500
Really.

270
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Really.

271
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Look at her performance.

272
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,860
Dad, mom.

273
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,900
I feel something is wrong.

274
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,500
Silly.

275
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,900
You haven't played this game before.

276
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,900
You're so sensitive.

277
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,700
You're so good at acting.

278
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,500
How could it be true?

279
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:24,980
It must be fake.

280
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,500
Just this money.

281
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,100
Just this money.

282
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,660
Brother.

283
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,940
Brother, it's time to get off work.

284
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,460
Brother, brother.

285
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:34,980
Brother.

286
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,660
Brother.

287
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,260
Brother.

288
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:36,860
Brother.

289
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,860
Gongcai.

290
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,420
Dad.

291
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:38,900
What's wrong?

292
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,380
Dad.

293
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:39,900
Get off.

294
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,060
Dad, I'm scared.

295
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,580
Hurry.

296
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,220
Get off.

297
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,220
Move.

298
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,380
Yang Yang.

299
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:45,980
Hurry.

300
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,700
My grandpa.

301
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,420
Come here.

302
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,540
Yang Yang.

303
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,180
Take me back.

304
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,740
Come here.

305
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,900
What's going on?

306
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,220
What's going on?

307
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:55,940
Hurry.

308
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,580
Hurry.

309
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,740
Hurry.

310
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,340
Hurry.

311
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,100
Hurry.

312
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,100
The police station.

313
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,300
The police station.

314
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,700
Brother.

315
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,300
Someone is here.

316
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,580
Where is the police station?

317
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,620
People are dead here.

318
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,700
We have to report it.

319
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,020
What are you talking about?

320
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,060
What are you doing?

321
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,220
The police station is catching the thief.

322
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,340
Of course they will kill him.

323
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,460
You should go.

324
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,260
It's getting dark.

325
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,060
It's getting dark.

326
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,780
I'll go first.

327
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,020
I'll go first.

328
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,060
This is not a police station.

329
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,260
This is not a game.

330
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,460
What's going on?

331
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,500
What's going on?

332
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,180
Hurry.

333
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:22,780
Hurry.

334
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,460
Hurry.

335
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,580
Hurry.

336
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,380
What are you doing?

337
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:25,820
Hurry.

338
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,660
This is not a dream.

339
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,300
Hurry.

340
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:27,820
Hurry.

341
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,820
Hurry.

342
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,140
What's going on?

343
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,380
We...

344
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,220
We are...

345
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,900
We are crossing the line.

346
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,140
Crossing the line?

347
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,460
If I'm not wrong,

348
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,660
this is...

349
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,060
Yong...

350
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,140
An...

351
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,140
City.

352
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,020
This is Yong An City.

353
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,460
It's so far.

354
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,420
It's so far.

355
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,260
We are crossing the line.

356
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,740
We need a sign.

357
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,780
We...

358
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,700
We need to squeeze in.

359
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,380
What sign?

360
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,300
A small sign in the guest room.

361
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Yes.

362
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,260
This...

363
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,580
Can we pay the room fee with this?

364
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,260
24K. Pure gold.

365
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,140
Sure.

366
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,140
No problem.

367
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,700
Great.

368
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,540
The challenge we faced today

369
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,140
is the most difficult one

370
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,540
we've faced

371
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,860
in our family.

372
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,860
So,

373
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,660
we need to discuss

374
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,940
what we should do

375
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,340
at today's family meeting.

376
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,820
How about this, Mr. Xun?

377
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,820
What do you think?

378
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,820
What do you think?

379
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,820
What do you think?

380
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,820
What do you think?

381
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,420
Mr. Xun,

382
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,860
please give us some constructive comments.

383
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,660
I'll put it simply.

384
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,140
The challenge we faced today

385
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,620
is the most difficult one

386
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,940
we've faced in our family.

387
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,980
We need to look at it from the outside

388
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,340
and objectively.

389
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,460
As for what we should do next,

390
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,620
I think we should go back first.

391
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,620
Are you done?

392
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,500
I'm done.

393
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,940
You're talking nonsense.

394
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,060
I knew I couldn't count on you.

395
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,900
Who's that?

396
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,900
Mr. Shen, say it.

397
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,900
Say it.

398
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,340
How to go back is very important.

399
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,420
We need to analyze it carefully.

400
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,500
But I really can't.

401
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,220
But,

402
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,900
thank God, Ji is here.

403
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,900
He has a good history.

404
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,460
He knows how to exchange money for gold.

405
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,980
Otherwise, we might be in jail now.

406
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,820
It's all nonsense.

407
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,620
I knew I couldn't count on you.

408
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,460
Honey, I'm very educated.

409
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,700
No one will take you as a mute if you don't talk.

410
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,260
Ji, you should say it.

411
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,700
According to the map we saw in the city,

412
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,660
the Cloud Water Courtyard is in that direction.

413
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,820
We came from the Cloud Water Courtyard.

414
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,220
We need to find a way in there.

415
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,860
Cloud Water Courtyard?

416
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,860
Adding Three Devils Period

417
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,620
Ruan.

418
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,300
Can we go inside?

419
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,300
We'll have to try anyway.

420
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,260
Wait.

421
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,020
This is the Fourth House ofisao meditation.

422
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,780
Don't sneak in.

423
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,260
Security,

424
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,780
please forgive me.

425
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,700
This is 24K pure gold.

426
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,260
Go.

427
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,060
Madam is not interested in the meeting.

428
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:15,820
She wants to break into the mansion

429
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,060
of the young master of Jingzhao.

430
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,940
She's just trying to do it.

431
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,140
Don't move.

432
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,900
My mother has a depression.

433
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,140
I'll take her home.

434
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,260
Madam,

435
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:24,780
the sun is going down.

436
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,300
Hurry up.

437
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,500
Go home.

438
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,060
Here you are.

439
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,100
Thank you.

440
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,820
Take it.

441
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,540
Are you stupid?

442
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,340
What are you doing?

443
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,660
It has nothing to do with me.

444
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:47,700
Stop.

445
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,580
It has nothing to do with me.

446
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,980
Young master.

447
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,860
Young master.

448
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,780
It seems that no one is here.

449
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,860
If no one is here,

450
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,420
get out of my way.

451
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:19,940
Let me do it.

452
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,980
Leave half of the cake

453
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,540
for tomorrow.

454
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,100
I eat cake every day.

455
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,100
I eat cake every day.

456
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,660
I'm about to eat a mental disease.

457
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,460
I can't eat it at all.

458
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,500
You don't eat it?

459
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,780
If you don't eat it, I'll eat it.

460
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,420
It's good to have a cake.

461
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,420
Besides,

462
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,780
our whole family

463
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,100
is relying on your mother's

464
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,740
little gold jewelry.

465
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:50,980
We have to save it.

466
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,860
Right, Fengxia?

467
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,380
You're right.

468
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,420
Family,

469
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,780
I asked the shopkeeper.

470
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,060
Our ancestor Lin Yan

471
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,180
is about to take office.

472
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,140
He'll be in the capital soon.

473
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,820
Really?

474
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,180
Our ancestor is here.

475
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,540
How can our ancestor be responsible for us?

476
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,900
He doesn't know how to control the body.

477
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,300
Family,

478
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,060
I hope you'll come.

479
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,140
Meeting.

480
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,580
Meeting.

481
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,420
Well,

482
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,140
A Ji.

483
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:17,780
Come on.

484
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,780
You sit here.

485
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,260
You sit here.

486
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:19,580
A Ji.

487
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,980
I'm fine here.

488
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,060
We're fine.

489
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,380
Right.

490
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:22,940
Young master.

491
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,660
What are you doing?

492
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,140
A Ji.

493
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:24,860
It's okay.

494
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,060
Uncle, come here.

495
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:26,900
Listen to me.

496
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,460
Okay.

497
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,460
We didn't let you in

498
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,820
because the owner wasn't here.

499
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,660
If Lin Yan comes,

500
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,500
and we put on our clothes,

501
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,340
we'll have hope when we get home.

502
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,460
That's what I mean.

503
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,660
There's a more serious problem.

504
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,020
What is it?

505
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,860
Gold will eventually go to waste.

506
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,460
We'll run out of money soon.

507
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,260
We have to save it.

508
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,860
Right.

509
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,780
We have to save it.

510
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,380
Right.

511
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,220
We have to save it.

512
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,780
We have to find a way to get some money.

513
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,740
Shen Jiansheng.

514
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,620
About how to make money,

515
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,700
I hope you can give me some constructive advice.

516
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,860
Me?

517
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,380
Me?

518
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,220
Why me again?

519
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,020
I think

520
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,700
it's not worth it to make money.

521
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,620
We have to save money.

522
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,020
You have to eat less if you save money.

523
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,180
You have to eat less and move less.

524
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,060
It's better not to move.

525
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,460
If you don't move, he won't be hungry.

526
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,900
If you're not hungry, he won't spend money.

527
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,100
Listen to me.

528
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,260
What are you talking about?

529
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,580
Now you know how our restaurant

530
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,060
was opened by you, right?

531
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,460
You're so stupid.

532
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,260
What's wrong with you?

533
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,540
Mom, don't.

534
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,940
Don't get excited.

535
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,860
My dad wants to express

536
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,380
a kind of open-mindedness.

537
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,300
Right.

538
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,140
My dad is a stupid person.

539
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,980
Dad, you're wrong.

540
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,620
Get up.

541
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,420
What are you talking about?

542
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,540
I'm so mad.

543
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,500
Don't you understand?

544
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,540
How can you say that?

545
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,820
Old rules.

546
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,220
I'm going to listen to you.

547
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,140
Give me 20 more.

548
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,380
I have no money.

549
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,380
Will you give it or not?

550
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,860
I really don't have any.

551
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,580
Mom, my dad always wants to...

552
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,380
Enough.

553
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,740
What you said just now

554
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,100
makes sense.

555
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,900
My dad actually wants to say

556
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,700
if he knew it was like this,

557
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,300
he should have brought some gold and silver

558
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,060
to help you save money, right?

559
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,660
Right.

560
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,180
He can use that brain.

561
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,740
I want to...

562
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,380
I have a heart, too.

563
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,340
Grandpa Zeng gave me this.

564
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,940
Before the ancestors took over,

565
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,860
we have to think of a way to survive.

566
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:35,820
How about

567
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,020
being a boss?

568
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,060
How about

569
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,780
we set up a stall

570
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,140
and get some snacks?

571
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,500
I can do that.

572
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,220
Can we make fried rice?

573
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,020
I love fried rice.

574
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,860
It makes sense.

575
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,180
Let's split up.

576
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,220
Yang Yang and I

577
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,340
will approach the ancestors

578
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,940
and find a way to enter the Yunshui Courtyard.

579
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,060
You will be responsible for making money.

580
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,380
I have an idea.

581
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,380
I'm sure we can bring the fried rice to the fire.

582
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,420
I heard that the new young master of Jingzhao, Lin Yan,

583
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,220
is not from the Shi family.

584
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,020
He is also a famous scholar.

585
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,420
In the journey,

586
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,260
he is all most skilled,

587
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,500
Nobody lim UC

588
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,940
makes him take over the layout.

589
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,660
A special belt sent by his cell phone

590
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,860
and one jade belt

591
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,260
excreses three taking over the place.

592
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,940
It is said that

593
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,100
his Feng Lu

594
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,860
is one of the most litigants of the century.

595
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,460
he is unpredictable.

596
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,220
Is he

597
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,100
capable of the handiwork?

598
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,180
Mr. Meng's only granddaughter

599
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,220
is already old enough.

600
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,980
Can you ask the young talent?

601
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,980
The one who wants to marry will only break his door.

602
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,980
I may not be able to help him.

603
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,980
You're joking.

604
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,980
Young Master Li.

605
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,980
Everyone, please have a look.

606
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,980
The banquet is outside.

607
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,980
You should pay your respects to the Lord first.

608
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,740
Cheers.

609
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,740
His Majesty is in good health today.

610
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,740
Please go back first.

611
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,740
His Majesty can't hear the memorial service today.

612
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,740
Young Master Lin, please wait.

613
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,740
His Majesty has asked Young Master Li to enter the hall.

614
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,740
Young Master Li.

615
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,740
Your Majesty.

616
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,500
Your Majesty.

617
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Your Majesty is in good health.

618
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,500
You should rest.

619
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
Why do you call me to perform the first performance?

620
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
Please accept it.

621
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
I can't.

622
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
Forget it.

623
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,500
I don't want to play.

624
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,500
I have to finish this sentence.

625
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500
I have entered the capital.

626
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,500
I should be ready at any time.

627
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,260
I have something more important to ask you.

628
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,260
You want to bet on me?

629
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,260
Tell me.

630
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,260
The corruption of the disaster relief fund in Huayuan County

631
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,260
was ordered by His Majesty.

632
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,260
The first criminal is the local magistrate.

633
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,260
He wants to atone for his crimes with ten thousand gold.

634
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,260
But I have already taken it back.

635
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,260
He has already asked me the other day.

636
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,260
This is done very well.

637
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:04,260
But this magistrate's surname is Dou.

638
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,260
Dou is the relative of the Fei family.

639
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,260
Ying Yan, how dare you!

640
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,260
Your Majesty,

641
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,260
the number of pepper in the house

642
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,260
of the magistrate Dou is quite large.

643
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,260
It's enough to use four years

644
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,260
to cover the East and West.

645
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,260
The price of pepper is far more than the gold.

646
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,260
The refugees were deeply affected.

647
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,260
They even lost their children.

648
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,260
It's not worth to die in such a big mess.

649
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,260
I really don't know how to deal with it.

650
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,260
This matter has been out of question for many years.

651
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,260
How did you get the evidence?

652
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,260
The magistrate Dou has a little boy from the Yun family.

653
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,260
He is a love-hate relationship.

654
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,260
How dare you use private torture against me!

655
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,260
I'll kill you first when I go out!

656
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,260
You...

657
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,260
Mr. Yun,

658
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,260
I won't use private torture against you.

659
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,260
But there is something

660
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,260
that is not convenient to show in front of people.

661
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,260
So please give me a private lecture.

662
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,260
Are you familiar with it?

663
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,260
Why is this letter in your room?

664
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,260
Give it to me!

665
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,260
Give it to me!

666
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,260
You've been with the magistrate Dou for a long time, right?

667
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,260
You've been with his concubine for a long time.

668
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,260
You've been together for many lives.

669
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,260
Guess how he will treat you.

670
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,260
Why don't you take out the evidence

671
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,260
and send it to him?

672
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,260
Then you can

673
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,260
be with your lover

674
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,260
in a good mood.

675
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,260
You're really a bad person.

676
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,260
Forget it.

677
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,260
It's also appropriate

678
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,260
to kill a criminal in secret.

679
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:17,260
You mentioned the East-West方氏.

680
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,260
It seems that you know the use of the方氏 every year.

681
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,260
But did you know about it before you married your wife?

682
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,260
The East-West方氏 is a common business in the West.

683
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,260
It's a mess.

684
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,260
It's the inner work of the capital.

685
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,260
It's a place of business and profit

686
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,260
based on the name of the wife.

687
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,260
The situation is complicated.

688
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,260
It's important to know

689
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,260
whether the方氏 can be used in the capital.

690
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,260
The previous one was a man of the Jin and Zhao.

691
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,260
He took this position.

692
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,260
He was worried that

693
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,260
the key could not be understood.

694
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,260
If you were in charge,

695
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,260
what would you do?

696
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,260
People are born to be fair.

697
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,260
Chen Yuxian's governance

698
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,260
is based on the big image of the hidden civilization.

699
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,260
It's a small thing.

700
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,260
There are many people in the court

701
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,260
who see you as a thorn in their eye.

702
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,260
But I

703
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,260
have high hopes for you.

704
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,260
The方氏 is a monster.

705
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,260
But you can't be too hasty.

706
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,260
You're now mainly on patrol.

707
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,260
When you sit in this position,

708
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,260
you will be punished.

709
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,260
I'm willing to be a horse.

710
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,260
Your Majesty,

711
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,260
the big image is in front.

712
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,260
Do you want to go down and look for it?

713
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,260
Come on, everyone.

714
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,260
We've already passed the border.

715
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,260
We've passed it.

716
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,260
Let's take a look.

717
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,260
The unique

718
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,260
legendary cake of Yongan City.

719
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,260
The pancake fruit.

720
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,260
Let's take a look.

721
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,260
Come on, everyone.

722
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,260
Take a look.

723
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,260
Let's take a look.

724
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,260
Today,

725
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,260
the Shen family's pancake fruit auction

726
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,260
officially begins.

727
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,260
A cake costs five thousand.

728
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,260
The number is limited.

729
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,260
First come, first served.

730
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,260
How is it five thousand?

731
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,260
What does it mean?

732
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,260
What does it mean?

733
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,260
It means that

734
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,260
the price of the cake is five thousand.

735
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,260
What about the other customers?

736
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,260
You can bid in public.

737
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,260
The highest bidder gets the highest price.

738
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,260
The highest bidder?

739
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,260
Isn't this a bad person?

740
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,260
Five thousand is not a small amount.

741
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,260
And you're adding more price.

742
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,260
Let's go.

743
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,260
Everyone, everyone.

744
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,260
Everyone,

745
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,260
calm down.

746
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,260
Do you know

747
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,260
my dad,

748
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,260
that man.

749
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,260
Grandpa.

750
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,260
My grandpa.

751
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,260
He is a good man.

752
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,260
I tell you,

753
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,260
he is

754
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,260
the best food in the world.

755
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,260
He is the only one in the world.

756
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,260
He is the first person

757
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,260
to be the best pancake in the world.

758
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,260
Is it that amazing?

759
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,260
Of course it is.

760
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,260
And look,

761
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,260
this food is called pancake fruit.

762
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,260
Have you ever heard of it?

763
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,260
I have never heard of it.

764
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,260
That's because

765
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,260
my grandpa

766
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,260
traveled around the world

767
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:18,260
and went to a legendary place.

768
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,260
It's called Tianjin.

769
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,260
Where is it?

770
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,260
It's a very prosperous

771
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,260
port.

772
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,260
Where is Tianjin?

773
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,260
I've never heard of it.

774
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,260
If you want to go to Tianjin,

775
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,260
you have to go through

776
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,260
a lot of difficulties.

777
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,260
Back then,

778
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,260
my grandpa took my mom,

779
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,260
my sister,

780
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,260
and my daughter.

781
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,260
It's really

782
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,260
You are so beautiful

783
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,260
I'm so beautiful

784
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,260
It's a little bit interesting.

785
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,260
I'm so beautiful

786
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:54,260
I'm so beautiful

787
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,260
I'm so beautiful

788
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,260
Then I came to Tianjin.

789
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,260
They suddenly thought

790
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,260
they put the pancake

791
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,260
and their favorite fruit

792
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,260
in their local people.

793
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,260
They were so happy

794
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,260
that they were able to

795
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,260
blend together.

796
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,260
So the best food

797
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,260
in history,

798
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,260
pancake and fruit,

799
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,260
was born.

800
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,260
So great.

801
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,260
Good.

802
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,260
This is good.

803
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,260
Pancake and fruit

804
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,260
are really

805
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,260
interesting.

806
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,260
It's really delicious.

807
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,260
I'll pay five thousand.

808
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,260
You can try it.

809
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,260
Excuse me, sir.

810
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,260
Didn't we just say

811
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,260
that our pancake

812
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,260
is on sale at a good price.

813
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,260
At a good price?

814
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,260
Five thousand.

815
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,260
And our chef Shen

816
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,260
can only make

817
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,260
five pancakes a day.

818
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,260
He can only make one pancake

819
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,260
in an hour.

820
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,260
So if you two

821
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,260
want to try this pancake,

822
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,260
you need to pay more.

823
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,260
Pay more?

824
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,260
He doesn't want me to pay.

825
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,260
No, no, no.

826
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,260
Come on.

827
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,260
I didn't say that.

828
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,260
How about this?

829
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,260
Six thousand.

830
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,260
Six thousand.

831
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,260
Six thousand.

832
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,260
Six thousand.

833
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,260
Six thousand.

834
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,260
Six thousand.

835
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,260
Six thousand.

836
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,260
Six thousand.

837
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,260
Six thousand.

838
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,260
Six thousand.

839
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,260
Six thousand.

840
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,260
Six thousand.

841
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,260
This guy

842
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,260
has done some dirty tricks.

843
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,260
He just bullied the people

844
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,260
and went out.

845
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,260
I don't know why,

846
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,260
but he has no idea

847
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,260
about the world.

848
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,260
11, 12, 12.

849
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,260
I said 12.

850
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,260
I said 12.

851
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,260
My ancestors are on duty today.

852
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,260
I'm sure

853
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,260
I can meet them here.

854
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,260
Brother,

855
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,260
are we here

856
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,260
to wait for our ancestors?

857
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,260
Yes.

858
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,260
We're just at the door

859
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,260
of his house

860
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,260
making delicious food.

861
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,260
We're here to attract his attention

862
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
and do his business.

863
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,260
We're here to teach him how to be a brother

864
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,260
and let him invite us home.

865
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,260
Brother,

866
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,260
have you ever thought

867
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,260
what if our ancestors

868
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,260
don't like the fruit of the sword?

869
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,260
The three generations of our family

870
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,260
all like the fruit of the sword.

871
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,260
It's written in the script.

872
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,260
Our ancestors

873
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,260
probably don't like it.

874
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,260
What are you doing?

875
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,260
What are you doing?

876
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,260
Sir,

877
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,260
I have some questions.

878
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,260
Wait.

879
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,260
The batter is made of flour.

880
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,260
You can buy one of them for 20 yuan.

881
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,260
One of them costs 2,000 yuan.

882
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,260
The sesame seed and salt are expensive,

883
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,260
but they're not expensive.

884
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,260
The pancake

885
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,260
costs 12,000 yuan.

886
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,260
Are you crazy?

887
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,260
Are you...

888
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,260
Are you messing with me?

889
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,260
If the world

890
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,260
is so high,

891
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,260
it's not a small thing.

892
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,260
You're threatening me.

893
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,260
Do you think I'm a coward?

894
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,260
What world?

895
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,260
What world?

896
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,260
What are you doing?

897
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,260
Why are you grabbing me?

898
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,260
What are you doing?

899
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,260
What are you doing?

900
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,260
I'm painting the wall.

901
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,260
Painting the wall?

902
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,260
I'm painting the wall.

903
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,260
If so,

904
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,260
I won't be polite.

905
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,260
So much money.

906
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,260
Yes.

907
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,260
You're so ungrateful.

908
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,260
Yes.

909
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,260
Calm down.

910
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,260
Calm down.

911
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,260
It's normal.

912
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,260
I'm...

913
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,260
I'm a coward.

914
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,260
Young Master Lin.

915
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,260
Please wait.

916
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,260
Young Master Lin.

917
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,260
I'm sorry, Young Master Lin.

918
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,260
We didn't mean to do that.

919
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,260
We're just doing business.

920
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,260
We just want to make more money.

921
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,260
Can you give us more opportunities?

922
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,260
I...

923
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,260
I'm Shen Jianshe.

924
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,260
I'm lucky to meet you today.

925
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,260
I'm lucky.

926
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,260
It's normal.

927
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,260
Calm down.

928
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,260
Do you recognize me?

929
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,260
I didn't recognize you just now.

930
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,260
But if I look at you again,

931
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,260
you're so beautiful and elegant.

932
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,260
How could I not recognize you?

933
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,260
You're so beautiful and elegant.

934
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,260
Oh my god.

935
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,260
Young Master Lin.

936
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,260
I...

937
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,260
I'm sorry.

938
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,260
It's okay if you know you're wrong.

939
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,260
I'll give you another chance.

940
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,260
I'll give you another chance.

941
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,260
I'll give you another chance.

942
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,260
Otherwise,

943
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,260
I'll go to the city office

944
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,260
and make you pay.

945
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,260
What are you talking about?

946
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,260
I'm just kidding.

947
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,260
These pancakes

948
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,260
are all for one yuan.

949
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,260
One yuan?

950
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,260
Yes.

951
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,260
Yes.

952
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,260
Master.

953
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,260
I'm so happy to see you.

954
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,260
Master.

955
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,260
Oh my god.

956
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,260
I'm so happy.

957
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,260
Don't push.

958
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,260
Don't push.

959
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,260
Don't push.

960
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,260
Don't push.

961
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,260
Don't rush.

962
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,260
We have all of them.

963
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,260
Brother.

964
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,260
Brother.

965
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,260
Hold on.

966
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,260
Hold on.

967
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,260
Hold on.

968
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,260
Sorry.

969
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,260
Yang Yang.

970
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,260
I'm not done yet.

971
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,260
Don't go.

972
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,260
There are more.

973
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,260
Young Master Lin.

974
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,260
Don't go.

975
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,260
There are more.

976
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,260
There are more.

977
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,260
Be careful.

978
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,260
Let go.

979
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,260
I'm so happy.

980
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,260

00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,260
I'm so happy.

999
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,260
I'm so happy.

1000
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,260

So happy.

1024
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,260
I can only respond to your true feelings.

1025
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:13,260
You are my dream, you are my true love.

1026
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,260
I can't sigh, I see you under the moon.

1027
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,260
I can't help but feel anxious when I think of you.

1028
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:25,260
Can we walk forward and look at each other?

1029
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,260
I thought we would meet by chance.

1030
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,260
But you turned red.

1031
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,260
Even the ice cream is cold.

1032
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,260
It's my heart that's broken.

1033
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:43,260
You are my smile, you are my logic.

1034
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:47,260
I need to put you in my life.

1035
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,260
My feelings are hard to get rid of.

1036
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:56,260
How can I give up on you?

1037
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,260
When I run towards you, my mind is confused.

1038
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,260
I'm obsessed with you.

1039
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,260
I'm still her family.

1040
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,260
My heart is moving.

1041
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,260
The wind blows the latest meaning.

1042
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:14,580
It's a hidden meaning that is

1043
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:18,260
I want to wander around and come back to be alone.

1044
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,260
It's irreversible.

1045
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:26,260
We have to change our lives.

1046
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:30,260
Maybe we are too emotional.

1047
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:39,260
I'm willing to wait for love to never come back.

1048
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:44,260
I'm going to travel a hundred miles to get you.

1049
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,260
I'm going to wander around and come back to be alone.

1050
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,260
It's irreversible.

1051
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,260
But I still dare to get closer.

1052
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:54,260
I'm going to change my life.

1053
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:59,260
It's irreversible.
