00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,990
=Yummy Yummy Yummy=

2
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 7=

3
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,460
(Good night)

4
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,900
(Good night)

5
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,510
We're finally going back.

6
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,710
Somehow,
I feel a bit reluctant to leave.

7
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,690
Indeed.

8
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,810
I've almost gotten used

9
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,710
to living in Yong'an.

10
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,780
Once I'm back,

11
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,350
I'll surely miss the ancestor.

12
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,600
Here it comes!

13
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,760
Smells amazing.

14
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,440
The moon is full now.

15
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,250
As long as our ancestor here is won over

16
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,690
by this Spring Water Lamb,

17
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,790
we can go back.

18
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,160
He's coming.

19
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,880
Hurry.

20
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,160
Welcome, Vice Prefect.

21
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,180
I thought

22
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,440
it was just an ordinary meal.

23
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,000
It's so lavish.

24
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,380
You've even made so many lanterns.

25
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,740
It has to be special
because you're here.

26
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,650
- Yes.
- Ancestor...

27
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,290
Vice Prefect, please sit down.

28
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,340
- Sit.
- Sit here.

29
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,260
Everyone sit.

30
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,780
Liu Chang,

31
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,780
sit. Here.

32
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,660
- I...
- Together.

33
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,860
Uncle Liu Chang, hurry and sit.

34
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,180
Please sit, Mr. Liu.

35
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,260
Okay.

36
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,780
Vice Prefect, you must try

37
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,780
this Spring Water Lamb

38
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,900
we specially made for you.

39
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,060
Please.

40
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,780
Well...

41
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,420
I won't stand on ceremony then.

42
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,940
Delicious.

43
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,740
Calm down!

44
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,500
Now that Lady Shen faces
no further worries.

45
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,220
Young Master, you can propose

46
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,170
dissolving the engagement, right?

47
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,500
Since everyone is here,

48
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,020
I have a matter

49
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,380
I wish to discuss with you all.

50
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,660
What a coincidence.

51
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,140
We also have some things

52
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,540
to tell you.

53
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,370
Vice Prefect, you speak first.

54
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,540
What I have to say isn't urgent.

55
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,420
Please, Uncle, you go first.

56
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,620
No, no!

57
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,340
You speak first.

58
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,700
Uncle, you should speak first.

59
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,260
Vice Prefect, you should speak first.

60
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,500
Then Auntie should speak.

61
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,940
I'll speak then.

62
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,260
Vice Prefect, we've prepared
a farewell gift for you.

63
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,060
Farewell...?

64
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,180
This is clothing we specially made.

65
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,460
We designed the pattern ourselves

66
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,280
and had it made.

67
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,540
We hope you will always
have splendid robes to wear.

68
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,380
Yes, Vice Prefect.

69
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,740
We also made

70
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,980
these lanterns especially.

71
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,660
We hope they can illuminate your future.

72
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,300
Right! Vice Prefect,

73
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,860
I also have a gift for you.

74
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,900
(Our Family)
This is a family portrait I drew myself.

75
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,460
And I drew you right in the center.

76
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,460
Center?

77
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,260
I guess

78
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,980
that means I've been stuffed

79
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,220
into this spot.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,940
What it means is

81
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,620
you hold the most important position

82
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,500
in our family's hearts.

83
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,180
(Our Family)

84
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,300
Thank you.

85
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,300
But

86
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,020
just now, you said this was

87
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,300
a "farewell gift"?

88
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,780
Yes.

89
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,660
It's like this, Vice Prefect.

90
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,900
We've been imposing on you here

91
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,780
for quite some time now.

92
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,100
We should be returning to our hometown.

93
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,260
So we prepared

94
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,420
some gifts for you.

95
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,260
They're all small items we made by hand.

96
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,500
We also hope your life in the future

97
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,780
will be more comfortable.

98
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,140
Today, we also tidied up your courtyard

99
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,860
and the inside of the house.

100
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,940
Hope you don't mind.

101
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,740
Vice Prefect,

102
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,380
all this time,

103
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,380
we've truly troubled you.

104
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,380
Our whole family is deeply grateful.

105
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,260
We should toast

106
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,700
this cup to you.

107
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,380
- Here.
- Here.

108
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,300
Here.

109
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,220
Toast to Vice Prefect.

110
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,380
Well...

111
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,900
Everyone, stop standing up.

112
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,340
- Hurry and eat!
- Come here.

113
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,380
Sit!

114
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,660
Come and sit. Eat!

115
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,720
- Help yourself.
- Eat quickly.

116
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,100
- Yangyang, here.
- Here.

117
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,620
Thank you, Uncle.

118
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,860
Earlier, you said

119
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,180
you had something to tell us.

120
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,300
What was it?

121
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,660
Minor matters.

122
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,690
Perhaps not worth mentioning.

123
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,980
Then have some food.

124
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,460
Here.

125
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,980
Mr. Liu, try this.

126
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,900
Thank you, Auntie.

127
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,660
This is the recipe for rice tofu.

128
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,820
We'll leave it with you.

129
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,700
Keep it.

130
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,200
After we leave,
don't forget to eat properly.

131
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,300
Don't be busy with official duties

132
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,700
and dryly gnaw
on steamed buns every day.

133
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,940
(Rice Tofu Recipe)

134
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,180
Auntie,

135
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,420
these lanterns swaying
look just like fireflies.

136
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,140
What are...

137
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,540
fireflies?

138
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,700
They're

139
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,620
glowworms.

140
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,860
Glowworms!

141
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,700
Yangyang,

142
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,620
I know a place to see fireflies.

143
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,540
Want to go?

144
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,700
Want to!

145
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,620
Where is it?

146
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,260
Then after dinner, I'll take you.

147
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,300
Okay!

148
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,380
Then it'll be troublesome for you

149
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,860
to look after Yangyang for me later.

150
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,980
Let's go together.

151
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,980
But if we go out now,

152
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,420
isn't that violating the curfew?

153
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,880
We'll go out the back gate.

154
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,170
Without going to Vermilion Bird Avenue,

155
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,660
we can avoid the patrols.

156
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,680
The fireflies by the Cang River
are Yong'an's most famous night view.

157
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,820
You will be leaving soon.

158
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,980
If you miss it this time,

159
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,100
it might be hard to have another chance.

160
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,020
Here. Eat first.

161
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,130
Eat your fill and then we'll talk.

162
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,220
So beautiful.

163
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,340
So many.

164
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,100
Uncle Vice Prefect,

165
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,920
when I go back,

166
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,890
whenever I see fireflies,

167
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,260
I'll definitely remember you.

168
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,540
What's Uncle Vice Prefect?

169
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,620
Don't call him that.

170
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,700
It's alright.

171
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,540
Auntie, I caught a firefly!

172
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,220
Yangyang, don't catch them.

173
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,340
Fireflies will die within a day
if you trap them.

174
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,460
It's better to let them be free.

175
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,220
May you

176
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,420
be free, too.

177
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,860
Freedom

178
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,620
is my greatest wish in this life.

179
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,220
To be honest,

180
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,580
when I first met you,

181
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,820
I thought you were...

182
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,620
I thought you were a high official.

183
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,540
I thought you should be enshrined.

184
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,540
But after spending time together,

185
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,540
I found you have a cold face
but a warm heart.

186
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,860
Now I actually feel like

187
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,260
you are a friend.

188
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,260
It's a pity
I'm just a passerby in Yong'an.

189
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,740
I don't belong here.

190
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,060
So I decided long ago

191
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,660
not to make friends here.

192
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,220
What a coincidence.

193
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,900
Me too.

194
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,300
Then...

195
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,180
we are not friends.

196
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,090
♪Red clay surrounds the hearth fire♪

00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:50,400

Auntie, look at the fireflies.

202
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,500
So beautiful.

203
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,080

208
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,260
Mr. Liu,

209
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,540
I have a major matter,

210
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,820
even a lifelong matter,

211
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,740
that I'd like to ask

212
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,660
for your help with.

213
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,860
Alright.

214
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,260
So,

215
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,820
after that poetry gathering,

216
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,220
I received

217
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,300
quite a few poetic letters
from noble ladies of Yong'an.

218
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,940
My usual focus is

219
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,340
deciphering oracle bone scripts.

220
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,060
I'm not very knowledgeable

221
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,220
about poetry and such things.

222
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,900
So I'd like to ask you

223
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,780
to help me parse them.

224
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,180
- Here.
- I'll just...

225
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,340
take a look.

226
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,090
(Kneeling down; Reading book;
Eat well; Miss you always)

227
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,980
This one

228
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,460
praises

229
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,860
your outstanding talent

230
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,780
and that day's "battle of wits".

231
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,140
This one praises you

232
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,220
as suave, handsome,

233
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,380
and dashing.

234
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,860
Is that so?

235
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,700
What?

236
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,660
Handsome and dashing?

237
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,740
This one is even more impressive.

238
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,060
This young lady

239
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,340
has a secret affection for you.

240
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,820
Here. Let me see.

241
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,580
Give me one.

242
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,660
(Dreamed you were near;
Woke to you gone.)

243
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,660
Couldn't they have been delivered
to the wrong place?

244
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,400
This is too unbelievable.

245
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,540
If I'd known it would be like this,

246
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,580
I should have made some comments

247
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,860
at the poetry gathering, too.

248
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,480
Maybe I could have
gotten some fans, too.

249
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,420
What are you stirring up trouble for?

250
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,340
And so on.

251
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,060
Here's another one.

252
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,140
What truly makes a confidante?

253
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,220
What truly makes a beauty?

254
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,140
Oh my.

255
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,300
Didn't expect people here

256
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,340
to have such taste.

257
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,300
I'm actually a bit reluctant to leave.

258
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,130
I'll take this affection
with me when I leave.

259
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,580
No matter how bad life gets later,

260
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,420
I'll rely on these

261
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,020
to keep going strong.

262
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,900
Listen,

263
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,820
I...

264
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,500
Where are the people?

265
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,700
This...

266
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,100
this...

267
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,420
You simply don't understand me!

268
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,980
According to the script I wrote,

269
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,540
we were supposed to move our ancestor

270
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,540
with a perfect bowl of Spring Water Lamb

271
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,740
on a full moon night.

272
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,980
Then we bathe in the moonlight,

273
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,260
fall asleep,

274
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,380
and wake up back in the modern era.

275
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,380
You know, the money we earned here

276
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,260
is enough for us
to live on for years back home.

277
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,260
Honestly,

278
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,100
I feel earning money in ancient times

279
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,980
was so much easier
than in the modern era.

280
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,660
I'm actually reluctant to leave Yong'an.

281
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,820
Yeah.

282
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,220
Although you can't
play video games here,

283
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,890
and there aren't
many modern conveniences,

284
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,620
the money is easy to make here.

285
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,180
Mom, it'll be even harder

286
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,180
for someone like me

287
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,060
to find a job back in the modern era.

288
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,920
And our family restaurant
isn't doing well now.

289
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,060
Keep looking at me.

290
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,180
It's still going under.

291
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,740
- Hey!
- You know, here,

292
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,430
if we just make a little bit
of modern-style food,

293
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,580
the money comes whooshing in.

294
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,220
And I could have so many fans.

295
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,740
Isn't that great?

296
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,500
None of what you say is important.

297
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,020
I heard that next year,

298
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,180
Yong'an will host

299
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,660
the first Culinary Master Competition.

300
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,660
If we really stay until then,

301
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,460
perhaps I could win us

302
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,460
a ranking.

303
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,740
If I really could get a ranking,

304
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,140
I would have a bunch of fans, too.

305
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,220
If I became popular,

306
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,420
my fans would definitely
be more than yours.

307
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,460
Enough.

308
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,620
Enough with you.

309
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,380
How capable you are, don't I know?

310
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,220
Endless nonsense.

311
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,980
Culinary Master?

312
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,300
Actually, I think
what Dad said isn't bad.

313
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,540
Look at Dad's presence.

314
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,820
With a little grooming,

315
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,420
he's an absolute
middle-aged idol material.

316
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,300
Right, Dad?

317
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,300
Dad!

318
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,820
Actually,

319
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,460
I also like Yong'an.

320
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,220
Because the ancestor plays with me.

321
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,100
So,

322
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,500
why don't we just not go back?

323
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,460
No, I... I was just saying it casually.

324
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,220
No other meaning.

325
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,660
Actually,

326
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,900
it might not be impossible.

327
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,220
Actually,

328
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,100
it has some logic.

329
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,300
But

330
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,460
Auntie told the ancestor
a monumental lie.

331
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,940
What if he finds out?

332
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,460
Time is almost up.

333
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,490
Stop all this wishful thinking.

334
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,750
Let's all accept our fate and go back.

335
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,700
After all, we have so much gold.

336
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,980
Life will get better.

337
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,700
Fine.

338
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,620
I'll go back carrying
the love from my fans.

339
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,820
Take it.

340
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,020
(Our Family)

341
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,940
You hold the most important position

342
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,860
in our family's hearts.

343
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,600
(Remember to drink water. Eat on time)
After we leave, don't forget to eat.

344
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,700
Don't be busy with official duties

345
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,060
and dryly gnaw
on steamed buns every day.

346
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:21,100
(Yunshui Manor. Welcome Home)

347
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,940
Finally back to a place
with wireless internet.

348
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,100
And we need to find a place
that buys gold at a high price.

349
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,380
Lady Shen.

350
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,540
Why am I still here?

351
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,780
Lady Shen,

352
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,580
last night,
everyone somehow got so drunk

353
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,880
and fell asleep in the courtyard.

354
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,420
Steward Liu worried you'd catch a chill
from drunkenness,

355
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,820
so he quickly sent you all back

356
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,940
to your respective rooms.

357
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,940
Thinking from another angle,

358
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,540
actually, from the very beginning,

359
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,420
all the methods for going back

360
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,140
were ones we thought up.

361
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,700
And we tried them all.

362
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,340
Since there's truly no way back now,

363
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,940
doesn't it mean

364
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,500
we can only face reality?

365
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,340
Staying here

366
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,260
might be quite good.

367
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,260
Someone like me

368
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,140
has nothing

369
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,260
in the modern era.

370
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,620
But here, in ancient times,

371
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,260
I really am quite popular.

372
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,500
And it seems that

373
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,220
our ancestor's character
isn't bad either.

374
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,700
So,

375
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,900
why don't we just really stay?

376
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,380
Open a small restaurant and enjoy

377
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,460
the ancestral patronage
we don't have in the modern era.

378
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,780
Maybe we'll end up
as the richest family.

379
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,940
Shen Gongcai, what time is it!

380
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,370
And you're still thinking about this?

381
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,340
I'm not...

382
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,940
Yeah.

383
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,420
What your sister said is right.

384
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,140
Your relaxation mentality

385
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,300
is definitely wrong.

386
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,430
One has to be positive and striving
when doing things.

387
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,380
Right?

388
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,660
But

389
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,900
if there truly is

390
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,260
some force majeure

391
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,180
causing us

392
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,500
to really not be able to return,

393
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,820
if I could enter
a Culinary Master Competition

394
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,820
and get a title

395
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,380
of Top Chef of Yong'an,

396
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,140
that would be quite good.

397
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,620
Top Chef of Yong'an?

398
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,580
So...

399
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,980
none of you wants to go back anymore?

400
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,220
Jicai,

401
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,620
all these years,

402
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,900
your father hasn't brought

403
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,220
much money back home.

404
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,700
Our whole family

405
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,140
has had it quite tough.

406
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,500
If we can really stay in Yong'an,

407
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,620
at the very least,

408
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,660
our whole family will have
financial security.

409
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,980
- It makes sense.
- It makes sense.

410
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,380
(Yunshui Manor)

411
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,540
Food is served!

412
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,500
Vice Prefect.

413
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,700
Round and Reunion.

414
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,180
Reunion soon.

415
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,140
Take your time.

416
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,820
Fresh Reunion.

417
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,620
Sweet Reunion.

418
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,540
Eat.

419
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,200
Grand Reunion.

420
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,180
Small Reunion.

421
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,100
Take your time.

422
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,540
Finally Reunited.

423
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,660
Never to Part.

424
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,420
Uncle, you've been too generous.

425
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,300
Vice Prefect,

426
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,540
after you finish eating,

427
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,900
I have another presumptuous request.

428
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,180
Uncle, what do you want?

429
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,420
Feel free to speak.

430
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,340
Alright.

431
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,820
I...

432
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,740
This...

433
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,860
Actually...

434
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,380
It's better for Shaojie to tell you.

435
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,020
Wait a moment.

436
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,660
Please enjoy.

437
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,980
Shen,

438
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,900
you speak.

439
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,180
Actually, we want to...

440
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,340
It's just...

441
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,860
Forget it.

442
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,100
Just consider me sleepwalking.

443
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,740
Vice Prefect,

444
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,400
we have something to tell you.

445
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,140
We have something to tell you.

446
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,220
Speak freely.

447
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,660
Vice Prefect, are you hungry?

448
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,180
I'll go make you some more food.

449
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,420
This looks sufficient

450
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,780
for me.

451
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,020
Yes.

452
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,420
Then...

453
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,540
Vice Prefect, take your time.

454
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,900
What could be so difficult?

455
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,220
It couldn't be

456
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,080
you said you were leaving,

457
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,510
and now you're saying
you want to come back

458
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,580
and keep living at Yunshui Manor?

459
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,860
I...

460
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,220
I guessed it right?

461
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,940
Actually,

462
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,220
we have indeed encountered
some circumstances.

463
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,140
We might not be able

464
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,340
to leave for the time being.

465
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,060
We're truly sorry, Vice Prefect.

466
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,180
We can't find a place

467
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,540
to go immediately.

468
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,940
So, for now, we can only
stay temporarily at your place.

469
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,700
Of course, we've also
thought it through.

470
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,630
We've earned quite a bit

471
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,930
of money recently from our stall, right?

472
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:56,900
We plan to rent a shop

473
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,830
and open a restaurant.

474
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,300
Then we can earn even more money.

475
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,940
In that way, we don't live
at your place in vain.

476
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,940
We'll pay rent.

477
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,140
What do you think?

478
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,060
Renting Vice Prefect's home...

479
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,900
If that word gets out,

480
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,140
it would sound like I'm accusing

481
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,020
His Majesty of an inadequate salary.

482
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,380
This...

483
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,180
Take it back.

484
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,140
Stay.

485
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,540
When you have time,

486
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,100
just make me a portion of rice tofu.

487
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,700
Rest assured!

488
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,060
Vice Prefect, from now on,

489
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,260
your meals are all on us.

490
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,620
You two!

491
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,740
Thank you, Vice Prefect.

492
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,660
Knowing the Shen family isn't leaving

493
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,940
puts your mind at ease, right?

494
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,260
No.

495
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,940
No?

496
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,260
Young Master, you just got
all clumsy walking.

497
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,780
I...

498
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,700
I just walked all clumsy myself?

499
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,540
Why are you hiding so far away?

500
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,820
If I didn't hide this far,

501
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,120
I'd be waiting for you to deal with me.

502
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,260
How could I?

503
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,620
We came out of the Cui family together.

504
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,700
You are the best brother
I've had in my life.

505
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,700
How could I hold a grudge

506
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:26,980
over a joke?

507
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,260
I wouldn't.

508
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,220
Really?

509
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,380
You still say I'm your best brother?

510
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,460
You liar!

511
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,220
I'm truly not lying

512
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,660
to you.

513
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,620
You really are my best brother

514
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,410
in this life.

515
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,020
Again?

516
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,420
You've used this trick
since we were kids.

517
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,720
I've been guarding against you for ages.

518
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,820
You've improved.

519
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,180
However,

520
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,140
I haven't seen you like this
for many years.

521
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,180
Since the Shen family arrived,

522
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,620
you have actually
become much more relaxed.

523
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,980
But this marriage

524
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,540
still has to be canceled.

525
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,500
Censor Pei has no ill intent.

526
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,940
If he finds out, he won't spread it.

527
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,540
But if it were someone else,

528
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,300
tracing things back
through the Shen family,

529
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,540
your identity would be in danger.

530
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,980
Vice Prefect,

531
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,460
it's so late.

532
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,580
You're not resting yet?

533
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,340
There are still documents to review.

534
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,980
What's wrong?

535
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,900
Nothing.

536
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,420
It's just that I've had trouble
sleeping these past few days.

537
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,620
Vice Prefect, you go back first.

538
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,100
I'll sit in the courtyard for a while
and then go back.

539
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,740
If there's any difficulty,

540
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,940
after all, I'm the Vice Prefect.

541
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,060
Perhaps I can help you.

542
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,660
Thank you.

543
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,420
I'm really fine.

544
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,460
I'll head back first.

545
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,020
(Juxian Alley)
Come here.

546
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,100
This way, please.

547
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,980
Look! How lively.

548
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,140
Yes.

549
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,660
Look, so many delicious things.

550
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,580
Indeed.

551
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,000
They say the best delicacies
in the world are in Yong'an,

552
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,680
and the best dishes of Yong'an
are in Juxian Alley.

553
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,220
If you all want to open an eatery,

554
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,140
here is truly the right place.

555
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,500
Look. Up ahead are

556
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,300
the two most famous restaurants
in Juxian Alley.

557
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,540
The first one is

558
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,740
Yunlai Tavern,

559
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,890
the most luxurious restaurant

560
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,500
in all of Yong'an.

561
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,420
It caters to high officials and nobles.

562
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,220
Whatever exotic delicacies
you desire to eat,

563
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,740
you can taste them here.

564
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,500
Look. The second one is

565
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,740
Guixiang Tavern.

566
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,880
(Guixiang Tavern)
Three Liu generations are running it.

567
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,900
Now it's managed by Liu Feng,
Third Master Liu.

568
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,420
- They emphasize elegance.
- How do you like this piece I wrote?

569
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,500
- Scholars love to dine here.
- Excellent.

570
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,840
(Freeing the Eyes and Mind)
On the fan-shaped west wall,

571
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,540
there are inscribed

572
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,580
verses by the most famous poets
in Yong'an today.

573
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,540
Rich oily aroma.

574
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,980
Steamed with light seasoning.

575
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,620
An expert!

576
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,100
You really smell the specialties
of both of them.

577
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,060
Thank you.

578
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,140
Dad!

579
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,180
Father, you're amazing.

580
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,300
You call this amazing?

581
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,140
My goodness.

582
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,050
The chefs at Yunlai Tavern
prefer to cook

583
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,940
mainly with grilling

584
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,020
and deep-frying.

585
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,140
Guixiang Tavern, on the other hand,
mostly uses steaming

586
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,500
to preserve the original flavor.

587
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,450
The taste leans towards mild.

588
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,780
If you ask me,

589
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,880
it's not particularly original either.

590
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,140
Wait until my shop opens,

591
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,860
the two of them combined

592
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,780
won't be my match.

593
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,000
Bring me along...

594
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,940
Come here. What we want to see
is right up ahead.

595
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,860
Come.

596
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,340
Mom,

597
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,130
look at my dad, aren't you going
to do something?

598
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,180
(Luo's Grocery Store)
This is the one.

599
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,060
Among the vacant shops in Juxian Alley,

600
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,500
this one is the closest
to the city center.

601
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,820
It only costs 400 qian per month.

602
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,880
- Remember,
- It looks alright.

603
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,900
money isn't the problem.

604
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,860
The problem is that

605
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,380
this shop is too ordinary.

606
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,540
Are there any better ones?

607
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,900
Yes!

608
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,180
Isn't this pretty good?

609
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,100
This way, please.

610
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,860
On the issue of choosing a shop,

611
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,200
you need to firmly support me.

612
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,100
How great is this one?

613
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,100
Right?

614
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,100
Dad, if you'd said that earlier,

615
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,180
I would have understood.

616
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,100
You...

617
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,580
(Dried Fruit Shop)

618
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,500
500 qian.

619
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,780
For this size?

620
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,740
Are there any better ones?

621
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,060
Any better ones?

622
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,420
Yes. There are.

623
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,580
Take me to see them. Let's go.

624
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,500
This way.

625
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,540
(Jinxiu Tavern)
Among the vacant shops in Juxian Alley,

626
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,540
this is the largest and best one.

627
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,260
800 qian per month.

628
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,180
Too small.

629
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,300
Still too small.

630
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,460
Still too small!

631
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,820
Shen Jianshe.

632
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,420
Shen Shaojie.

633
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,260
You two, come here.

634
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,660
What?

635
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,340
Wait. What's wrong now?

636
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,740
I'm busy here.

637
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,620
Time is money.

638
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,820
Shen Jianshe,

639
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,540
have you gotten above yourself?

640
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,100
- Have you gotten above yourself?
- I haven't.

641
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,700
Have you decided what scale
you want to open?

642
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,240
And there you are, picking and choosing.

643
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,820
You think a two-story building is small?

644
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,860
Do you want to ascend to heaven?

645
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,670
I... I haven't.

646
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,860
I'm using tactics.

647
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,920
Do you have the brains for that?

648
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,820
Tactics?

649
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,180
Yes. Dad, don't make excuses.

650
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,160
You definitely have a problem.

651
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,200
And you, Shen Shaojie.

652
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,300
- Mom!
- Why are you joining in?

653
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,540
- Why are you joining in?
- My fault.

654
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,410
Dear, just hit him!

655
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,460
Can you let go of me first?

656
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,120
I'm telling you two,

657
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,220
keep your mouths shut later.

658
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,140
Did you hear me?

659
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,940
- I hear you.
- I hear you.

660
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,540
Grandma!

661
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,900
Ma'am,

662
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,540
sorry about this.

663
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,420
Could you please

664
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,740
help us find another place?

665
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,300
The location doesn't need
to be too prominent.

666
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,850
The building doesn't need
to be too big either.

667
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,340
You should have said so earlier.

668
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,460
Of course, I can.

669
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,120
Money.

670
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,640
Money is something you still need to...

671
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,020
Come. Look at this one.

672
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,460
This originally belonged
to Councilor Kang's family.

673
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,500
He has many properties.

674
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,410
This one is small.

675
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,780
He doesn't pay it much attention.

676
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,620
Only 300 qian

677
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,900
per month.

678
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,060
However, there's one condition.

679
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,380
Councilor Kang

680
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,620
is a food enthusiast.

681
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,500
So, he only wants to rent this

682
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,220
to people in the food business.

683
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,140
Who is Councilor Kang?

684
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,300
You don't know who Councilor Kang is?

685
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,260
No.

686
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,180
He's the most famous food connoisseur

687
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,740
in all of Yong'an.

688
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,100
Do you know about
the annual Culinary Master Competition?

689
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,900
That's his creation.

690
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,900
That competition, right?

691
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,300
Ma'am, how about this?

692
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,540
We'll pay you one year's rent upfront.

693
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,940
Can you give us a little discount?

694
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,060
How about 250 qian per month?

695
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,860
Dear, have you thought this through?

696
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,820
What kind of nonsense is this?

697
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,180
Besides, 250 doesn't sound good either.

698
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,260
It's fine, it suits you.

699
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,460
280.

700
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,460
Really, there's no profit.

701
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,500
You clearly look like
a straightforward person.

702
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,960
You definitely still
have room to negotiate.

703
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,860
Just 250.

704
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,420
265.

705
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,340
The backyard has a loft.

706
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,740
Although it's not renovated,

707
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,180
it can be used as a storeroom.

708
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,580
Let's settle for 250.

709
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,460
Alright.

710
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,940
You really know how to do business.

711
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,220
Not at all.

712
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,260
Let's just consider it
as forming a good connection.

713
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,540
This shop

714
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,740
is truly a bargain.

715
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,940
That backyard connects to the alley.

716
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,700
When you expand later,

717
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,780
it's like getting half a shop for free.

718
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,940
Expand?

719
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,300
You can do that here?

720
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,860
Wait, this isn't regulated?

721
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,820
Who regulates it?

722
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,220
Look how much
the Yunlai Tavern expanded.

723
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,260
It occupies half the back alley.

724
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,700
And it's still doing fine, right?

725
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,860
Don't worry.

726
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,180
Nothing will go wrong.

727
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,260
Fine. Then...

728
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,460
We'll take this one.

729
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,260
Let's sign the contract.

730
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,620
Yes. Let's sign it.

731
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,540
Quickly. Let's go.

732
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,660
Let's go.

733
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,860
(Yong'an)

734
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,340
Young Master, what you just mentioned

735
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,540
is about the shops in Juxian Alley

736
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,660
illegally expanding without permission.

737
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,140
Presumably, people must
have discovered it before.

738
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,140
But why was it

739
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,420
never dealt with?

740
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,100
Yong'an is

741
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,300
more complicated than it is outside.

742
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,400
The interests behind the East
and West Markets are deeply entangled.

743
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,300
The case against Mr. Yun

744
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,460
for embezzlement was easy to solve.

745
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,420
But here,

746
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,700
many people can't be touched.

747
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,620
Exactly.

748
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,900
For example,

749
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,140
the two most famous shops
in Juxian Alley are

750
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,380
Guixiang Tavern

751
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,780
and Yunlai Tavern.

752
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,700
They both have wealth and influence.

753
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,980
If you really investigate,

754
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,820
who knows who might be implicated
behind them?

755
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,260
How about

756
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,220
you just make a token gesture?

757
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,420
Since I'm the Vice Prefect
of the Capital Prefecture,

758
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,740
I can't hold office
without doing my duty.

759
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,940
Come here. Jicai.

760
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,660
Look at the shop we chose.

761
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,420
Isn't it good?

762
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,820
And it's quite big, too.

763
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,460
Listen, Jicai,

764
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,520
you need to quickly find someone

765
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,940
to make me a few cooking pots.

766
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,860
The pots here

767
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,300
don't suit my hands well.

768
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,580
There's still so much to be busy with.

769
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,600
Jicai,

770
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,760
you've always had good ideas.

771
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,620
Take a look.

772
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,020
How should we decorate this place?

773
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,380
By the way, Jicai,

774
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,260
that broker said

775
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,180
we could expand a bit more here.

776
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,260
Of course, I'm afraid
we might get investigated.

777
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,860
You decide.

778
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,860
You guys decide. I'm fine with anything.

779
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,820
Auntie,

780
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,420
you seem a bit unhappy.

781
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,500
Do you still want to go back
to the modern era?

782
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,620
Here's a lollipop for you.

783
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,900
Thanks, Yangyang.

784
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,700
Jicai,

785
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,940
you need to accept reality.

786
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,000
Think about it carefully.

787
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,020
That little restaurant of ours

788
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,100
was bound to go bankrupt.

789
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,260
What would we even go back to?

790
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,820
What is there worth missing?

791
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,660
Huh?

792
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,720
Is it that account of yours

793
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,140
with only 200 followers?

794
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,100
Or that "genius" ex-boyfriend of yours?

795
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,020
That guy...

796
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,260
Jicai,

797
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,620
I didn't think much
of this place at first either.

798
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,020
But thinking about it later,

799
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,060
it's not bad.

800
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,020
Think of our little restaurant
in the modern era,

801
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,500
it wasn't even a third this size.

802
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,700
This place can make money.

803
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,580
And we have the ancestor blessing us.

804
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,700
It's good.

805
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,620
Yes.

806
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,940
Jicai,

807
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,140
talk to me.

808
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,060
Why do you want to go back so badly?

809
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,020
Nothing.

810
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,740
It's okay. Say it.

811
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,660
Don't bottle it up.

812
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,100
Bottling it up is so uncomfortable.

813
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,180
Say it.

814
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,260
I just can't understand.

815
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,660
How could we suddenly come to

816
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,900
this godforsaken place?

817
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,860
Before, I worked day and night
on side jobs.

818
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:11,380
I... I finally saved up a bit of money

819
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,940
and bought a dishwasher for our home.

820
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,780
Over 3,000 yuan.

821
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,620
I never even used it once.

822
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,860
Here, trying to run a good business

823
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,940
still gets looked down upon.

824
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,220
They called us the lower class.

825
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,620
During the day, I have to learn

826
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,740
how to bow to others,

827
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,120
and I can't go out at night either.

828
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,100
Yes.

829
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,500
We can sneak out.

830
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,140
But it's sneaking.

831
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,340
Not free at all.

832
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,100
You've all gotten used to it.

833
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,660
None of you wants to go back!

834
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,580
Auntie.

835
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,940
Don't worry.

836
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,300
Take it slow.

837
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,980
We've only just started here.

838
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,230
Who knows, maybe one day,

839
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,780
we'll suddenly go back.

840
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,500
Jicai, please don't worry.

841
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,740
This thing...

842
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,580
You need to adapt slowly.

843
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,300
Yes. See, isn't everything
slowly getting on track?

844
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,830
Since we're here,
we should make the best of it.

845
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:54,730
Since we can't go back,

846
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:55,620
we'll just...

847
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,300
Auntie.

848
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,180
Maybe.

849
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,740
I'll adapt some more.

850
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,780
I'll be fine in a few days.

851
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,580
Yes. You'll be fine in a few days.

852
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,860
Don't worry.

853
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,860
(We really have to survive)

854
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,180
(in a society like this.)

855
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,940
(But what can I do)

856
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,140
(staying here?)

857
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,060
Somebody!

858
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:03,900
Help!

859
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,140
Someone jumped into the river!

860
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,290
(Shaoguang's Food Notes)

861
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,290
(People in Yong'an brew tea
almost like brewing medicinal herbs.)

862
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:19,190
(They break the tea into pieces,
roast it, then pour in boiling water.)

863
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,320
(Add ingredients for scallions, ginger,
and tangerine peel for repeated boiling.)

864
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,290
(Until Lu Yu appeared, things changed.)

865
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,200
(As China's first KOL
in the tea industry,)

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,290
(he wrote the epic bestseller,
"The Classic of Tea".)

867
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,290
(Tea then became
a proper field of study.)

868
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:36,020
(The method Vice Prefect Lin was using is
the formal tea brewing promoted by Lu Yu.)
