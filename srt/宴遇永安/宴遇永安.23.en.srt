00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Donc Wych Very Shay

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
He has done the most delicious dish,

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
please have dumplings.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,400
I bought you a carriage before, you didn't like it, you scolded me.

47
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,000
I bought you a ring before, but you scolded me again.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,300
Today, I bought you a ring.

49
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,200
I hope you won't scold me anymore.

50
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,200
Happy New Year.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Happy New Year.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Happy New Year.

53
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,200
Your Highness, it's late.

54
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,200
How about I go back first?

55
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,000
Don't miss the entrance of the palace.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,300
Your Highness, you are too kind to accompany me to my home.

57
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,200
It must be hard to spend the New Year's Eve alone.

58
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,000
That's why I asked you to come to my house.

59
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,200
I...

60
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,400
I don't have enough money to go home.

61
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,700
I've already passed it on to you.

62
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,700
I just think that entering the palace is more boring.

63
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,300
Why don't we stay here

64
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,500
and enjoy chess with my friends?

65
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,300
There's also a night tour at the New Year's Eve.

66
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,700
I haven't seen the lantern show for years.

67
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,600
Why don't you accompany me to go with me?

68
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,500
How about it?

69
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,100
That's Tong Nian!

70
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,600
Amazing!

71
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
That's amazing!

72
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,300
I know Tong Nian.

73
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,800
Does that mean that I can have whatever I want in the New Year?

74
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes.

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,600
Then what do you want in the New Year?

76
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,400
Grandfather, congratulations on your success!

77
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,800
This child...

78
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,400
I've already prepared it for Yangyang.

79
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Come, come, come. Take it.

80
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,900
Grandfather, Grandfather.

81
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,100
Grandma, congratulations on your success!

82
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,800
Grandma, you forgot it today. What should we do?

83
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,300
I'm wronged.

84
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,100
I've already prepared it.

85
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,000
Thank you, Grandma.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,800
You're welcome.

87
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,000
Aunt, happy New Year!

88
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,200
Yangyang, happy New Year!

89
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,800
Thank you, Aunt.

90
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,000
Yuan, happy New Year!

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,900
I have one too.

92
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,700
Of course. You're also a member of our family.

93
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,500
Thank you, Madam.

94
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,800
Xiaoming, look.

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,200
Young Master, happy New Year!

96
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,400
I really didn't prepare anything.

97
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,400
Take it all.

98
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,700
That's a lot.

99
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,800
Young Master, that's too much.

100
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,400
It's not too much for me and Liu Chang.

101
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Here, take it.

102
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,600
Yangyang, you have to give me a kowtow.

103
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,300
Thank you, Young Master.

104
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,300
Happy New Year!

105
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,200
This child...

106
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,300
Go on.

107
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,700
Yangyang, look at this.

108
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,100
This is...

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,300
This is what you asked me to give you.

110
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,600
My aunt wrote a letter.

111
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,800
Come, come, take it.

112
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,400
Let's open it and see.

113
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,900
This is what the Communist Party wrote.

114
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,100
Let me see.

115
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,300
Come.

116
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,200
This is what the Communist Party wrote.

117
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,000
Let me read it for you.

118
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,300
Dear family, when you read this letter,

119
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,400
I'm already halfway to the top.

120
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Don't worry.

121
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,000
With my charm,

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,300
I'll be warmly appreciated wherever I am.

123
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,000
Everyone,

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,500
this kind of show is not something you've heard of before.

125
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,200
You called us back for nothing.

126
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,300
Didn't you say you didn't want to be involved in the tea and snacks?

127
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,000
That's right.

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That's right.

129
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,800
That's right.

130
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,500
Of course, that's right.

131
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,900
I'm not going to be involved in the tea and snacks.

132
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,700
But if my little brother is right,

133
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,600
I hope everyone can give me some money.

134
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,800
That's right!

135
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,400
I've seen him before!

136
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,000
What do you mean by equal?

137
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,900
Women should be independent and independent!

138
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,900
Let my wife and I be together!

139
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,500
No, no, no!

140
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,600
Do you want to live?

141
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,900
I don't mean that!

142
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,800
Stop!

143
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,900
Stop!

144
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,600
Stop!

145
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,900
Stop!

146
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,100
Stop!

147
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,900
Stop!

148
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,300
Stop!

149
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,100
Stop!

150
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,300
I'm fine with everything,

151
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,000
but I miss Yang Yang.

152
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yang Yang,

153
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,300
you're my proudest daughter.

154
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,500
You must be like me in the future.

155
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Be a good daughter.

156
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,800
Go in.

157
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,600
Be innovative.

158
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,600
I've had a lot of fans in Yong An

159
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,600
and achieved some small achievements.

160
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,400
But I've never been satisfied because of that.

161
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,800
Instead, I've continued to look for new directions.

162
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,800
Life is full of possibilities.

163
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,100
Yang Yang,

164
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,300
do you know that

165
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,300
I'm doing a great job now?

166
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,900
I earn a lot of money,

167
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,400
I'm decent,

168
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
and I'm stable.

169
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,100
When I'm working,

170
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,400
I always treat others with a shared attitude.

171
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
So,

172
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,600
I can fight with everyone easily.

173
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,200
You don't have to worry about me anymore.

174
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Good!

175
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Good!

176
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,400
Are you going to fight or not?

177
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm going to fight!

178
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,800
I'm going to fight!

179
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,800
I'm going to fight!

180
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
I'm going to fight!

181
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,600
You didn't get hit!

182
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,800
Fine.

183
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm telling you,

184
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,600
you can hit me anywhere,

185
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,400
but don't hit my face.

186
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,600
Otherwise, my female fans

187
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
will be unhappy.

188
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Good!

189
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,100
Go go go.

190
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,700
Wonderful!

191
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,100
My old friend Kim,

192
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,800
the beautiful kid.

193
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,700
Thanks for watching!

194
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,700
End of Chinese New Year!

195
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,700
Applause.

196
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,700
Applause for him.

197
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,700
Our dish is finally getting better.

198
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,700
Don't cry.

199
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,700
Yangyang, you should be happy.

200
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,700
Come on.

201
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,700
Let's continue eating.

202
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,700
I'm telling you, there are many good dishes in this dumpling.

203
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,700
Let's see what you can eat.

204
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,700
Come on.

205
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,700
Let's eat.

206
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,700
Okay.

207
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,700
Come on, young master.

208
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,700
Thank you, aunt.

209
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,700
You're welcome.

210
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,700
Oh, I have one more thing to announce.

211
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,700
Our restaurant

212
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,700
will be finished soon.

213
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,700
It will be open in a year.

214
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,700
Great.

215
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,700
Come on, let's eat.

216
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,700
Let's eat.

217
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,700
Happy New Year.

218
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,700
Happy New Year.

219
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,700
Here comes the Princess Royal.

220
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,700
Princess Royal.

221
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,700
Today is the new year.

222
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,700
You don't have to do these formalities.

223
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,700
Are you going out?

224
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,700
I'm going out with the imperial tutor.

225
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,700
I just finished the lantern show.

226
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,700
I happen to come to your house

227
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,700
to eat some hot pot.

228
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
It seems that it's not a coincidence, right?

229
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,700
No.

230
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,700
My family wants to go to the lantern show.

231
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,700
My parents have taken them there.

232
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,700
I'm not interested in those things.

233
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,700
I'm not interested.

234
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,700
Yuan, you've been talking about the mountain all day.

235
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,700
You should go after them.

236
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,700
Yuan, you go.

237
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,700
I'll stay with your wife.

238
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,700
I'll stay with her.

239
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,700
Liu Chang will follow her. I love her.

240
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,700
Your Highness, please sit down.

241
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,700
Please.

242
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,700
The new hot wine.

243
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,700
Drink some to warm your body.

244
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,700
Your Highness, your tofu is special.

245
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,700
I've never seen

246
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,700
so many holes in the tofu.

247
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,700
Tofu is cut into cubes.

248
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,700
Add salt and blanch.

249
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,700
Then it will make holes.

250
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,700
It will taste like this when it's frozen.

251
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,700
It will be very tasty when put in the soup.

252
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,700
It's really delicious.

253
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,700
It's delicious.

254
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,700
It's good that you like it.

255
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,700
Your Highness,

256
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,700
we don't need to be present today.

257
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,700
Why don't you sit down?

258
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,700
Let's have a good time.

259
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,700
Thank you, Your Highness.

260
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,700
Come on.

261
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
Happy new spring.

262
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,700
Happy new spring.

263
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,700
Young Master,

264
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,700
you're not a good drinker.

265
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,700
You should drink less.

266
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,700
Yes.

267
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,700
Miss Shen,

268
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,700
An Ran is not a good drinker?

269
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,700
Yes.

270
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,700
His drink...

271
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,700
An Ran,

272
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,700
are you lying to me?

273
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,700
What are you talking about?

274
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,700
Am I talking nonsense?

275
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,700
I heard that

276
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,700
An Ran is a good drinker.

277
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,700
I'm sorry.

278
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,700
I don't know how I offended An Ran.

279
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,700
His uncle invited you to his banquet.

280
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,700
He said that An Ran had drunk up

281
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,700
his family's hard-working Shao Chun.

282
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,700
He even changed his face.

283
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,700
It's all in the past.

284
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,700
I won't listen to it.

285
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,700
Thank you.

286
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,700
Young Master, I'm sorry.

287
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,700
I'm sorry.

288
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,700
What happened last night?

289
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,700
I don't remember.

290
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,700
We had a meal together last night.

291
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,700
I was the tree hole.

292
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,700
We drank together.

293
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,700
Then I can't remember

294
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,700
what happened.

295
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,700
I don't remember.

296
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,700
Miss Shen,

297
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,700
it's also hard-working Shao Chun.

298
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,700
You can't drink like that.

299
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,700
You'll get drunk.

300
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,700
Your drink isn't great.

301
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,700
Yes, my drink isn't great.

302
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,700
Young Master,

303
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,700
you don't have to remember anything.

304
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,700
I'm sorry.

305
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,700
I'm going to hold a few parties in my mansion before and after the元宵.

306
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,700
How about giving your family's 14th son to me?

307
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,700
Thank you, Your Highness.

308
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,700
It's delicious, Miss Pei.

309
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,700
Don't mind it, Your Highness.

310
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,700
I'm just curious about...

311
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,700
frozen tofu.

312
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,700
How did you make frozen tofu?

313
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,700
I'm happy that you like it.

314
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,700
How could I mind?

315
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,700
Your Highness, please have a look.

316
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,700
This is frozen tofu?

317
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,700
Where is that?

318
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,700
That's our warehouse.

319
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,700
We store some ingredients that we usually use.

320
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,700
Can I go and have a look?

321
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:17,700
I just want to know if there are any ingredients that are suitable for the banquet.

322
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,700
Of course.

323
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,700
Your Highness, please.

324
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,700
Let's find the light first.

325
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,700
Okay.

326
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,700
Your Highness.

327
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,700
Your Highness.

328
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,700
What are you looking for?

329
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,700
Knife.

330
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,700
I don't know if you misunderstood something.

331
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,700
It's not a good idea for us to stay like this.

332
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,700
Are you afraid that you'll stay with me?

333
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,700
I'm not.

334
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,700
Your Highness likes to make trouble.

335
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,700
If we stay together,

336
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,700
you'll be in trouble.

337
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,700
I'm not afraid of that.

338
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,700
We'll go out first.

339
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,700
Taosi is very dissatisfied.

340
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,700
He's been convinced.

341
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,700
Let's wait for a while.

342
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,700
In Qingyang,

343
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,700
your family also eats dumplings.

344
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,700
My family doesn't eat that much.

345
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,700
So you still go there on purpose.

346
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,700
I have nothing to do.

347
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,700
Family?

348
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,700
I just make something you like to eat.

349
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,700
It can make you feel better.

350
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,700
No matter what happens,

351
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,700
as long as there is someone who will always support you,

352
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,700
you will definitely get through it.

353
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
It's delicious.

354
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,700
I like it very much.

355
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,700
Thank you.

356
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,700
Don't make a sound.

357
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,700
I'll go back to the kitchen.

358
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,700
Wait.

359
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,700
Welcome!

360
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,440
Bless you very much!

361
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,860
Master is a small robot mus compensator

362
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,980
I think we should take a walk

363
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,240
gamma button

364
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,520
It repair the damage that is broken

365
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,360
I'm not interested

366
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,500
Fuck it!

367
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,720
It's pretty

368
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,720
I didn't mean it.

369
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,720
I didn't mean it.

370
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,720
Actually, that month in mid-autumn,

371
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
you remembered it.

372
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
I remembered it too.

373
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,720
What if we can't see the future?

374
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,720
What about the long life?

375
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
The world is a stone and a song.

376
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,720
We'll talk about it at the end of the day.

377
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,720
Don't let the future be empty.

378
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
We'll be together forever.

379
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,720
What are you doing?

380
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
What if we can't see the future?

381
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
What about the long life?

382
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
What if we can't see the future?

383
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
What about the long life?

384
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
What about the long life?

385
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
What about the long life?

386
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,720
Can you understand what I mean?

387
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,720
I know you want to make Anran and Shen Liangze together.

388
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,720
In fact, anyone can see that they both have feelings for each other.

389
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,720
But I don't know why they are all in a daze and don't want to talk.

390
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,720
They are like this.

391
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,720
What about you?

392
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,720
In fact, since the prince consort was seriously ill,

393
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,720
I have been living in chaos every day.

394
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,720
I never expected that the world

395
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,720
could be joined by someone else.

396
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,720
We...

397
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,720
I'm afraid I can't bear to see you.

398
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,720
The prince consort and the prince consort were married.

399
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,720
It's a serious matter, not a beautiful one.

400
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,720
I know you have been worried about this for many years.

401
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:19,720
But I am not capable of making you happy again.

402
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
So,

403
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,720
the world is complicated.

404
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:50,720
Do you have a bit of sincerity for me and me?

405
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,720
Please don't make it difficult for me again.

406
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,720
I will be waiting for you.

407
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,720
I will be waiting for you.

408
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
I will be waiting for you.

409
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
I will be waiting for you.

410
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,720
I will be waiting for you.

411
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,720
I will be waiting for you.

412
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,720
I will be waiting for you.

413
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
I will be waiting for you.

414
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,720
I will be waiting for you.

415
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
I will be waiting for you.

416
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,720
I didn't write it.

417
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,720
I didn't ask.

418
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
What about these?

419
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,720
You didn't do it yourself?

420
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
I didn't do it.

421
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Shen Shaoguang,

422
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:11,720
you want to continue to endure and continue to restrain yourself in this way?

423
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,720
You have me in your heart.

424
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Why do you have to do this?

425
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,720
If you are worried that I will get you involved in what I do now,

426
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
I promise you that

427
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,720
I will go to your family when I finish it.

428
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,720
I will make them feel at ease.

429
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,720
Let them agree that we are together.

430
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Okay?

431
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:05,720
Lin Ye, do you know that I am not the one who has a engagement with you?

432
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,720
My family has never lived in Qingyang.

433
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
What are you talking about?

434
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
What are you talking about?

435
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
I have been lying to you all the time.

436
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,720
At that time, the situation was urgent.

437
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,720
I was afraid that you would really kill us.

438
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,720
That's why I told this lie.

439
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:41,720
Later, I continued this lie to take advantage of you and live in Yunshui Garden.

440
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,720
I was thinking how long I could lie.

441
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,720
But this time,

442
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,720
I met the one who really had an engagement with you at the intersection of Qingyang and Shi'an.

443
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,720
Mrs. Zheng.

444
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:03,720
I have been using the word of the Qingyang incense to lie to you.

445
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,720
But I am not the one who has a engagement with you.

446
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Mrs. Zheng.

447
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
All the time,

448
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,720
you have been lying to me.

449
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
Shen Xiaoguang.

450
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,720
You have been lying to me.

451
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,720
No.

452
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
Never.

453
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
Mr. Lin.

454
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,720
I am a shameless woman who is always in the way.

455
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
Before your parents died,

456
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,720
there was another wife who you took good care of.

457
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
I am not loyal to you.

458
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,720
I am really not loyal to you.

459
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
I am sorry.

460
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
I am sorry.

461
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,720
I am sorry.

462
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,720
I am sorry.

463
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,720
I am sorry.

464
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,720
I am sorry.

465
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
I am sorry.

466
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,720
I am sorry.

467
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
I am sorry.

468
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,720
I am sorry.

469
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,720
I am sorry.

470
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,720
I am sorry.

471
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,720
I am sorry.

472
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
I am sorry.

473
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
I am sorry.

474
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
I am sorry.

475
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
I am sorry.

476
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,720
I am sorry.

477
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
I am sorry.

478
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,720
I am sorry.

479
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
I am sorry.

480
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
I am sorry.

481
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
I am sorry.

482
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
I am sorry.

483
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
I am sorry.

484
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,720
I am sorry.

485
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,720
I am sorry.

486
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
I am sorry.

487
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
I am sorry.

488
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
I am sorry.

489
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,720
Please forgive us.

490
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,720
I once was only made a rich bride,

491
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
And would marry her.

492
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
To that!

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,720

00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,440
and will be renovated

499
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,240
and launch a brand new dish,

500
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,520
the spring dish.

501
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,240
Welcome our new customers to taste the food.

502
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,840
Today's guests will be half-price.

503

Half-price.

504
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,960
Great.

Lady Shen,

529
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,760
your restaurant is so beautiful.

530
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,560
Thank you.

531
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,560
Happy New Year.

532
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,560
Congratulations.

533
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
It's so comfortable.

534
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
Happy New Year.

535
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,560
May you have a happy new year.

536
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
Lady Shen,

537
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,560
happy new year.

538
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,560
Happy new year.

539
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,560
Happy new year.

540
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
This is the spring dish

541
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
of our school's palace.

542
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,560
It's called the spring dish.

543
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
Enjoy.

544
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
Lady Shen,

545
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,560
it's just the beginning of the new year,

546
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,560
and we haven't got warm.

547
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,560
Where did you get

548
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,560
so many fresh melons?

549
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,560
Yes.

550
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,560
Tell us.

551
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,560
There's no greenhouse without a greenhouse.

552
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,560
A greenhouse?

553
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,560
A greenhouse is a good thing.

554
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,560
A greenhouse is a good thing.

555
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,560
Why are you leaving?

556
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,560

00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
Thank you.

563
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,560
Lady Shen,

564
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,560
we came to see

565
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
the specialty dishes of the restaurant.

566
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
They said it's called spring dish.

567
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,560
Can you give us one?

568
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,560
Sure.

569
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
Mother,

570
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
please give us a spring dish.

571
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,560
Okay.

572
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
Okay.

573
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
Please add it yourself.

574
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,560
Here comes the dishes.

575
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
Yu'er,

576
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,560
please prepare more dishes.

577
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,560
Okay.

578
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,560
Here are your fish.

579
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,560
Enjoy.

580
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
Lady,

581
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,560
happy new year.

582
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,560
Happy new year.

583
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Happy new year.

584
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,560
You guys

585
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,560
are so surprised.

586
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,560
The kids are also playing here.

587
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,560
It's good that they like it.

588
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,560
Kids,

589
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,560
would you like some soy milk?

590
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,560
I want soy milk.

591
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,560
Aunt,

592
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,560
I want soy milk.

593
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,560
Come on.

594
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,560
Come on.

595
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,560
I want soy milk.

596
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,560
I want soy milk.

597
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
Be careful.

598
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,560
Line up.

599
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
Look.

600
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Look.

601
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,560
These kids

602
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
are really

603
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,560
very energetic.

604
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,560
Yes.

605
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Come on.

606
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,560
Kids,

607
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,560
be careful.

608
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,560
Aunt,

609
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,560
they allowed me to go to the Red House.

610
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
They all admire me.

611
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Then,

612
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,560
are you going to be a good role model

613
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
for them in the future?

614
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,560
Fu Zi said you are a good girl.

615
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
If you can be a good role model,

616
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
you will be a great role model.

617
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
Then,

618
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
next spring,

619
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,560
will you...

620
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,560
I want to study hard.

621
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,560
I will study hard every day.

622
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
Be careful.

623
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
Your husband

624
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,560
was involved in a family affair

625
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
several times before.

626
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
Now,

627
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,560
he has made up his mind.

628
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,560
Yes.

629
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
The Jingzhao Prefecture has issued a new order.

630
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,560
If you ask the people,

631
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,560
you will make up your mind in seven days.

632
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,560
Be careful.

633
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,560
If you make a mistake,

634
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
the people will go to the ancient city

635
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,560
and ask about it in the Jingzhao Prefecture.

636
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,560
My family has been

637
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,560
in the business for years.

638
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,560
Everyone is against each other.

639
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,560
If the young master of Jingzhao Prefecture

640
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,560
is so powerful,

641
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,560
I don't know what will happen in the end.

642
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,560
No wonder they all praise the young master of Jingzhao Prefecture.

643
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,560
It's rare to see parents.

644
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,560
It's not.

645
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,560
With the young master,

646
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,560
I will be more at ease in the future.

647
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,560
Wait a minute.

648
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,560
The young master will be out soon.

649
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,560
Here.

650
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Have some hot food.

651
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,560
Be careful.

652
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,560
Thank you.

653
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,560
The Shangyuan Festival is not over yet.

654
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,560
They are just talking about it.

655
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,560
Don't complain.

656
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,560
Let me tell you.

657
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,560
Although I am not a big man,

658
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,560
I remember every word

659
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
the young master said clearly.

660
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,560
The people are all the same.

661
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,560
They are all the same.

662
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,560
They are all the same.

663
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
They are all the same.

664
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,560
Look.

665
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,560
The people of Yongan are all the same.

666
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,560
Even the saints are all the same.

667
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,560
They call the young master

668
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,560
Zhao Guanghan of the dynasty.

669
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,560
Think about it.

670
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,560
Even the saints say so.

671
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,560
From now on,

672
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,560
if we have something to talk about

673
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
in Jingzhao Prefecture,

674
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,560
it will be much easier.

675
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,560
You are right.

676
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,560
But the young master has not been home for a few days.

677
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,560
He gets up earlier than the chicken.

678
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,560
I think it's like

679
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,560
when Wang Laosan and his wife are divorced,

680
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,560
they can only be attached to the official affairs.

681
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,560
Don't worry.

682
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,560
Even if it's the official affairs,

683
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,560
Jingzhao Prefecture will not be protected.

684
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,560
Your brother will definitely take it back.

685
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Thank you, young master.

686
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,560
Young master, thank you.

687
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,560
You are welcome.

688
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
Don't talk nonsense.

689
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,560
It's been a long time

690
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,560
since I saw the young master's cousin.

691
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
Let me tell you.

692
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,560
The young master has been away for a few days.

693
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,560
I really miss him.

694
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,560
Young master.

695
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,560
In the first place,

696
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,560
what should I do?

697
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,560
You should...

698
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,560
You can punish him.

699
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,560
As long as you don't punish me, I'll let you go.

700
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,560
Young master, I didn't say that.

701
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,560
All right.

702
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,560
I'll let you

703
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,560
go to rest and recuperate.

704
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,560
You have to deal with me

705
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,560
about the young master's

706
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,560
fight for the land.

707
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,560
Really?

708
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,560
Go ahead.

709
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,560
Thank you, young master.

710
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,560
Wow.

711
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,560
Wow.

712
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,560
Wow.

713
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,560
It's so beautiful.

714
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,560
I still miss my hometown.

715
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,560
But after all these things,

716
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,560
I seem to like it more and more.

717
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,560
There is no end to the Shangyuan Festival.

718
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,560
The city will be more beautiful.

719
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,560
I'll take you there.

720
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,560
Time flies.

721
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
It's the Shangyuan Festival.

722
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
Young master.

723
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,560
Come in.

724
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,560
Young master.

725
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,560
I found it.

726
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,560
How is it?

727
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,560
The lady who told me

728
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,560
that the real wife of the young master

729
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
was going to Shi'an,

730
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,560
I asked around.

731
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,560
The wife was really

732
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,560
from Qingyang.

733
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,560
And in the dialect of Qingyang,

734
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,560
the pronunciation of the word is very similar.

735
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,560
So the Shen family

736
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,560
can lie to us for so long.

737
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,560
Young master.

738
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,560
Just

739
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,560
let it go.

740
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
We will no longer

741
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,560
be in their way

742
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,560
when we break off the engagement with the Shen family.

743
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,560
Today is the Shangyuan Festival.

744
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,560
It's the big festival.

745
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,560
You've been busy for a day

746
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,560
and haven't eaten, have you?

747
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,560
What did I bring you?

748
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,560
The Shangyuan Festival is not over.

749
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,560
The city will be more beautiful.

750
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,560
I'll take you there.

751
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,560
Look.

752
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,560
It's still hot.

753
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,560
Have a bite.

754
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,560
After you finish your work,

755
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,560
go to Shi'an.

756
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,560
Shi'an

757
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,560
A'qi.

758
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,560
Why are you still awake?

759
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,560
Mom.

760
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,560
Did I wake you up?

761
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,560
No.

762
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,560
I'm getting up late.

763
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,560
Did you not sleep well

764
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,560
these days?

765
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,560
It's okay. I can't sleep.

766
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,560
I just put the pickles in the fridge.

767
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,560
I can serve the dishes faster tomorrow.

768
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,560
Okay, okay.

769
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,560
Don't do it.

770
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,560
Go back to sleep.

771
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,560
You go to sleep.

772
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,560
Give me the pickles.

773
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
It's okay.

774
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,560
It's okay, mom.

775
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
Be careful.

776
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,560
Give it to me.

777
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
A'qi.

778
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,560
I can understand you.

779
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,560
As long as you are human,

780
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,560
you will feel bad.

781
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,560
And you need to vent your anger.

782
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,560
But there are many ways to vent your anger.

783
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
I don't want you to hurt yourself.

784
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,560
Do you know?

785
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,560
I didn't mean it.

786
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,560
I just thought of

787
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,560
a way to escape.

788
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,560
When I can't let go,

789
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,560
I just make myself tired.

790
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,560
People are afraid of pain.

791
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,560
They are afraid of pain.

792
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,560
People are afraid of pain.

793
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,560
If she is in pain, she will not want to.

794
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,560
I'm in pain.

795
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,560
I still can't breathe.

796
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,560
I just think about it.

797
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,560
My silly child.

798
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,560
Silly child.

799
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,560
Who said our A'qi has no courage?

800
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,560
You like someone so sincerely.

801
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,560
How brave you are.

802
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,560
It's just a pity.

803
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,560
You have no way.

804
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,560
I...

805
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,560
But do you know, A'qi?

806
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,560
You are so brave.

807
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,560
You are so great.

808
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
I don't.

809
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,560
Don't cry.

810
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,560
Don't cry.

811
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,560
Don't hurt yourself next time.

812
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,560
Do you know?

813
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,560
Come.

814
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,560
Don't cry.

815
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,560
It's okay.

816
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,560
I'll see you later.

817
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,560
You are crying like a boiling water.

818
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,560
Who are you?

819
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,560
I'm afraid I can't see you.

820
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,560
