1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Are you done?

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay, we still have one last thing to do at the meeting.

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We still have a mission for the crew tomorrow.

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The hunt is going to be a wild hunt.

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We need to send a team to do the hot food and food protection.

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Cook for them.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yuan Huan.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You take care of this team.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll drive a wild hunt car tomorrow.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We'll eat and drink the food.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's fine.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But we don't need to drive a car.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What should we drive?

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I suggest we use the old tradition.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We can make food with a pot.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't agree with you.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why don't we use something new?

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We can't lose the old tradition.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If we don't practice making food with a pot,

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
we'll lose, right?

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't think we can do that.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We've been selling the country for years.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We can't lose this tradition.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We can't lose it.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You can't lose it?

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Are you an old comrade?

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Do you have a new comrade?

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Sir.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm applying for the mission.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll learn from the old squad leader to sell the country.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I agree.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Sell it.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If you want to sell it, we'll sell it.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let's go.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's move.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Squad leader, you go first.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll answer the phone.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Okay, I'll go.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hello.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's me.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I've been practicing physical strength lately.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Otherwise, I can't carry this pot.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
If you can carry it, you can carry it more.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I found that you're good at talking.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Go to work.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Squad leader.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The tent has been fixed.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What are you doing next?

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm going to dig a hole.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Okay, where?

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Over there.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Okay, I'll go.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Han Sheng.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's play together later.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's okay.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Didn't we agree?

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You teach me, I'll do the work.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If you do it, you do it, you do it alone.

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Then you hurry up.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Hurry up.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm going to go.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Han Sheng is really good.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He's working hard and curious.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I think he's a little tired of coming to our team.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Tired?

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't feel like Han Sheng is having a good time in our team.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're so rich.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Han Sheng is not in the right state today.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What's wrong?

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I didn't see it.

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Think about it.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Today, Li Ye Bao's training.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He's lying there, staring at the light.

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He's here, poking me.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Can he feel better?

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The most important thing is that he doesn't have to let others see that he's not feeling well.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He's a good man.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He's a good man.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So we shouldn't let him come?

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yes.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Isn't that hurting people?

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's inevitable to be sad.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's time to think about it.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
When you're thinking about it,

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You two go to the market later.

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm going to give this family a lesson.

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Han Sheng, see if it hurts here.

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's hurt.

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay.

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
His military formula for selling the country is a success.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It doesn't seem as complicated as I thought.

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Han Sheng, don't underestimate the law.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's a big deal to put it in a place like this.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Don't look at Li Ye Bao's new skills.

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
If you don't eat good food,

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's all a bunch of sick cats.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I understand.

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's good.

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
For example, when you train,

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
When you're in a fight,

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's a big fish in the wall.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We have to do the law here.

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
As long as it's a hammer, right?

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Thank you, sir.

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You cook today.

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I cook?

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Can you finish it?

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I can.

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I promise to complete the task.

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay, go to the country.

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Cut the goods.

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Squad leader, it's ready to go.

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Squad leader, potatoes.

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Coming.

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Old man, it's been a long time since I ate your cooking.

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
As you said,

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Today's dishes are all made by Chen Han Sheng.

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Han Sheng made it?

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Come on, give me more.

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Let me see what's wrong with Han Sheng's dishes.

129
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay, enough.

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
We three are waiting for you over there.

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay.

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Come on, come on.

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This, this, this.

134
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Long time no see, old man.

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Eat more.

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Okay.

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I haven't eaten a dish made by a wood-fired pot in a long time.

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's delicious.

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You gave me these old squad leaders, it's not a waste.

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Come on.

141
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Chen Han Sheng.

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Morning.

143
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Today is the day I met you.

144
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The day you slept the most.

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Do you know why?

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Cooking is delicious.

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Don't make me look useless.

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Because you are getting more and more like a soldier.

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes.

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This is delicious.

151
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Squad leader.

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Go.

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Go eat.

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Come and sit.

155
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This rice is really delicious.

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's okay.

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What do you mean by cooking so deliciously?

158
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Don't you want to be a soldier?

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I want to, but I don't have the guts.

160
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The amount of food is growing.

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It won't be more than me.

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You are a good student.

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Don't always go to such places.

164
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Han Sheng.

165
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Aren't you curious about how we are doing recently?

166
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
How are you doing recently?

167
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Quite serious.

168
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The training intensity is quite high.

169
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
We have a few missions.

170
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What missions?

171
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
To prevent the virus from spreading.

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Protect the hospital.

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Really?

174
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Go out and keep a record.

175
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't ask me after eating.

176
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Just say a little.

177
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You are being fooled by them.

178
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
There is no mission.

179
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's just training.

180
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Are you being too obvious?

181
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But Han Sheng.

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Although your cooking skills are good.

183
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But it's not a big deal to keep on talking.

184
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But this is a matter of personnel.

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Han Sheng, you have no choice.

186
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's the same everywhere.

187
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Are you hungry, Mr. Yan?

188
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Hurry up.

189
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Two bowls of meat.

190
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Four bowls.

191
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Two bowls.

192
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Clean up the bowls.

193
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Clean up the bowls.

194
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Grandpa.

195
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Are you okay?

196
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I have a mission today.

197
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I just came back from training.

198
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I will go to see you in a few days.

199
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Don't come back.

200
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You do your work.

201
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Don't worry about me.

202
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Grandpa.

203
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I should go with you.

204
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You can train hard.

205
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And live a good life.

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I will be relieved.

207
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Okay.

208
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Grandpa.

209
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You must take care of yourself.

210
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Han Sheng.

211
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You said you have a mission today.

212
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
How did it go?

213
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It went well.

214
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I have to praise him.

215
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's good.

216
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Grandpa has a rest.

217
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Okay.

218
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Goodbye, grandpa.

219
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Goodbye.

220
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
One, two, three.

221
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

222
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

223
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Twenty, twenty.

224
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Twenty, twenty.

225
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
One, two, three.

226
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Twenty, twenty.

227
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Xiling.

228
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Where is Jialian?

229
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Hello, sir.

230
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Don't be so polite.

231
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You should train.

232
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Chief.

233
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What are you doing here?

234
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The instructor asked me to take Chen Han Sheng back to the repair class.

235
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The repair class has too many tasks recently.

236
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
We don't have enough people.

237
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Really?

238
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You don't want to?

239
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I do.

240
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
No.

241
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't want to.

242
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But I will follow the arrangement of the team.

243
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Chief Zhang.

244
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm not in the water class anymore.

245
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You can't bear to leave?

246
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
A little.

247
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Han Sheng.

248
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
At this time,

249
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I have to criticize you as the monitor.

250
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Revolutionary soldiers are a brick.

251
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
We don't need a monitor.

252
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Although we can't bear to leave,

253
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
the repair class needs you more.

254
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You can go back with Chief Zhang later.

255
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Okay.

256
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Pack up quickly.

257
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Come on.

258
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Help Han Sheng pack up.

259
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You two go to the warehouse.

260
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Bring the backpack.

261
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The clothes.

262
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yes, the clothes.

263
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Come on.

264
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Okay.

265
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Han Sheng, work hard.

266
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The repair class is tired and tired.

267
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Take care of yourself.

268
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Monitor, help him take it.

269
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Take it back to the repair class.

270
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's not easy to buy anything there.

271
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Thank you, monitor, for helping me take it.

272
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Thank you, monitor.

273
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Han Sheng.

274
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Although the time to go out is not very good,

275
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
but your clothes are always pulled out from the hammer.

276
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Come back when you have time.

277
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Or I'll come back for dinner, monitor.

278
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yes.

279
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Come on, monitor.

280
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Come on.

281
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Han Sheng, don't say anything.

282
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
From now on, you can see if you have a lot of meat.

283
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Take some tea.

284
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Thank you.

285
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Han Sheng has taught you.

286
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Don't worry.

287
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Thank you.

288
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Monitor, goodbye.

289
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
How do you feel in the repair class?

290
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I was depressed at first.

291
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But after you told me, I understood.

292
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I learned a lot in the repair class.

293
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I thought, since I can't choose the environment,

294
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I can change it.

295
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Good.

296
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Then do you know why the autumn instructor

297
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
arranged you to be in the repair class?

298
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The instructor...

299
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
The instructor wanted me to understand...

300
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Don't think too much.

301
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The instructor's purpose is to let you sink in.

302
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Han Sheng, remember.

303
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You can go up, you can go down, you can bend, you can bend.

304
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Only then can you become a real hero.

305
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yes.

306
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I understand, monitor.

307
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
We're home.

308
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Han Sheng, you're home.

309
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Han Sheng has left.

310
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Do we still have to do this three times in a row?

311
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Sit.

312
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What do you think?

313
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It doesn't matter.

314
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
We're used to it.

315
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We're used to it.

316
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yes, we're used to it.

317
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So we're used to it.

318
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Look.

319
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
We're used to it.

320
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Since Han Sheng has given us a good habit,

321
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
then let's stick to it.

322
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Okay?

323
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Come on.

324
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Move it, move it, move it.

325
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Continue to sit.

326
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Continue to sit.

327
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Sit.

328
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Come on.

329
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I haven't finished 20 of them yet.

330
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's still this room.

331
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But now you're the only one left.

332
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Where do you want to sleep?

333
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You choose.

334
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Monitor.

335
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Do you think this time I'll be transferred

336
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
in a few days?

337
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Han Sheng, don't worry.

338
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
This time it won't be.

339
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Don't think too much.

340
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Rest early.

341
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Yes.

342
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm leaving.

343
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Goodbye, monitor.

344
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Rest early.

345
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Shhh.

346
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Gather.

347
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
To the right.

348
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
To the front.

349
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Xiao Xi.

350
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Wen Zhou Er.

351
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yes.

352
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Zheng Yi.

353
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yes.

354
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Chen Han Sheng.

355
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yes.

356
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Go with me to the car number five.

357
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yes.

358
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You two,

359
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
follow the progress

360
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
and protect and take care of the special vehicles.

361
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yes.

362
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Disperse.

363
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Monitor.

364
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What's the mission?

365
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,400
Support the

366
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
General.

367
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:59,400
老班长,好久不见,您辛苦了 大家辛苦

368
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,000
We are not going to be polite.

369
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,400
The weather has changed a lot in the Huxi region.

370
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
The weather is very extreme.

371
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,400
And this year, the rain has been very heavy.

372
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,400
To ensure that the boat can sail well,

373
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,400
I am planning to do a complete maintenance of the boat.

374
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,800
But the people in our team are not enough.

375
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,200
So we are asking for the support of the base.

376
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,800
I did not expect that the main force would be strong and powerful.

377
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
I am very happy that you are here.

378
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,000
It is you who are strong.

379
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,200
Squad Leader, you have seen Liu Zhe Wen and Zheng Yi.

380
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,400
Hello, Squad Leader.

381
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,200
This is Chen Hansheng.

382
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Hello, Squad Leader Ke.

383
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,000
Chen Hansheng, I have heard about you.

384
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,600
Thank you for your hard work.

385
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,400
You are too kind.

386
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,000
We should do our best.

387
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Let's go inside and talk.

388
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,600
Let's go.

389
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,200
Yes.

390
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,200
Let's go.

391
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,200
Be careful.

392
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,000
Are you okay?

393
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,800
I am fine.

394
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,400
Squad Leader, can we still help people here?

395
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,800
To ensure that we can act at any time,

396
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,800
Squad Leader Ke led all the crews of the old police.

397
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,000
They live on this boat all year round.

398
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It is okay to live here for one day.

399
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,800
It is not easy to live here for a long time.

400
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
It is not easy to live here.

401
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,600
The weather is hot in the winter.

402
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,000
In the summer, at night,

403
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,200
the mosquitoes that the purple light killed

404
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,000
are all made of gold.

405
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,800
So this station has no soldiers.

406
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,600
They are all senior officers.

407
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,600
You have visited all the places.

408
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,400
It is time to work.

409
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,000
Yes.

410
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,400
Let's go.

411
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,600
Don't walk around anymore.

412
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,000
Squad Leader, can we just brush it?

413
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,600
Yes.

414
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,200
Don't use too much oil.

415
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,800
Zheng Yi.

416
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,200
Number 5.

417
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,000
Zheng Wen.

418
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,400
The electric brush.

419
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,000
Okay.

420
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,000
Nan Sheng.

421
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,600
Thank you.

422
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,200
Thank you.

423
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,600
Okay.

424
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,800
Do I have to clean this first?

425
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,200
Yes.

426
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,400
I have so many things to do later.

427
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,400
I will tell you how to do it.

428
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Keep brushing.

429
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Don't use too much oil.

430
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Use a little oil.

431
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,200
Okay.

432
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,000
Okay.

433
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,400
Both are bright.

434
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Han Sheng.

435
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,200
Let's go.

436
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Let's go to the house and take a breath.

437
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
Let's go.

438
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,200
The message is here.

439
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,600
This year,

440
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,800
the defense of the first lake, second river, and third river

441
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,200
is not optimistic.

442
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,600
My plan to release the message

443
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,800
has been approved by the base chief.

444
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,000
Tomorrow, I will take the emergency team

445
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
to make up for the case.

446
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You guys can go back

447
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,800
after you finish.

448
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,800
Old Squad Leader,

449
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,800
I want to stay with you for a few more days.

450
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,600
In the future, there will be more time.

451
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,400
I have recommended you to replace my position.

452
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
In the future,

453
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,000
I will leave my precious things to you.

454
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,800
Old Squad Leader,

455
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,600
let me think about this matter.

456
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,200
What do you want to think about?

457
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,400
You want to leave?

458
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,600
I have thought about it.

459
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,200
It's fine if you want to leave.

460
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,200
You just have to train one of yourself.

461
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,800
Then you can leave.

462
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,400
I wanted to leave too.

463
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,400
But the old squad leader told me

464
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,400
that the bandages of the boat can't be broken.

465
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
I am the soldier he brought,

466
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,400
you are the soldier I brought.

467
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Today, I will also tell you

468
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,400
that the bandages of the boat

469
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,400
can't be broken from your side.

470
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
Yes.

471
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Is there any problem at home?

472
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,400
No, there is no problem.

473
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,400
What are you doing at home?

474
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
I am working on a farm.

475
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,400
A farm is not a car repair shop.

476
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,400
You can't help yourself when you go back.

477
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
That's true.

478
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,400
I have observed him for the past few days.

479
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
He is not bad.

480
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,400
Maybe he is the next one.

481
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Old Squad Leader, let me talk to him.

482
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
Talk to him.

483
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Hai Shang.

484
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
Squad Leader.

485
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
Come down.

486
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
Hai Shang.

487
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,400
What were you looking at up there?

488
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
I was looking at the lake.

489
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
I saw the lake.

490
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,400
I saw the lake.

491
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,400
I saw the lake.

492
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
I saw the lake.

493
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,400
I was looking at the lake.

494
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,400
Looking at the lake now,

495
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
the level is as high as the mirror.

496
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
It's hard to imagine that it was so flooded that day.

497
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,400
What was the situation?

498
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,400
I heard from Squad Leader Zhang Lang that you were there in 1998.

499
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
Yes.

500
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,400
In 1998, the highest level in history.

501
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,400
My squad leader took me here.

502
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
I waited for five months.

503
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
To be in charge of the guard,

504
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,400
my squad leader was almost sucked in.

505
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Yes.

506
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
I read the information.

507
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
The description of the text

508
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,400
is very shocking.

509
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Shocking is a rare thing.

510
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,400
Our position

511
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
is facing the most

512
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,400
lonely.

513
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,400
After so many years,

514
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,400
you should be used to loneliness.

515
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
Silly boy.

516
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
No one likes loneliness.

517
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,400
But fortunately,

518
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,400
I have a secret weapon.

519
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,400
Do you want to see it?

520
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
I won't break the secret.

521
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,400
Absolutely not.

522
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,400
I'll show you.

523
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,400
A mouthpiece.

524
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Can you play it?

525
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
A little bit.

526
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Now, the children don't play the mouthpiece much.

527
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,400
I taught it to them when I was a kid.

528
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
Please.

529
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,400
For you.

530
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,400
It's not suitable, squad leader.

531
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Isn't it your secret weapon?

532
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Old soldiers

533
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
have a time

534
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,400
when they can't hold guns.

535
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
You're still young.

536
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Take it.

537
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Thank you, squad leader.

538
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,400
Thank you.

539
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,400
Attention!

540
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,400
Squad leader.

541
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Attention!

542
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Squad leader, what's going on?

543
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
Training.

544
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
Training?

545
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,400
Why are you in the repair class?

546
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,400
Yes, I want to train cars.

547
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
But I don't have one.

548
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
12-car motorbike.

549
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
Six-car is worth more than two books.

550
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Six-car is in your repair class.

551
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,400
I'm training.

552
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,400
I'll see if the team is lacking people.

553
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
If it's lacking people, I'll pull them over.

554
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
What's your name?

555
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,400
Report!

556
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,400
I was wrong.

557
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
You're not wrong. I was wrong.

558
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,400
I increased the pressure on squad leader Zhang Liang.

559
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
What's going on?

560
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
We were transferred by the ship team.

561
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,400
We just came back.

562
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,400
Don't worry about those cars.

563
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
I'll fix them as soon as possible.

564
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,400
You went out?

565
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
I misunderstood you.

566
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,400
Okay, then.

567
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,400
Fix two cars as soon as possible.

568
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,400
One for training and one for spare.

569
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,400
Six cars are worth more than two books.

570
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
I'm so worried.

571
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
Don't worry. I'll finish it as soon as possible.

572
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,400
Okay, thank you.

573
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Everyone.

574
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,400
Thank you, squad leader Zhang.

575
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
Thank you, squad leader Zhang.

576
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Everyone.

577
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
Yes.

578
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,400
Squad leader, we have seven spare cars.

579
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,400
We'll fix this one as well.

580
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
Got it.

581
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
Zhou Er.

582
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
I'll count what's going on over there.

583
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
We've removed the heat sink.

584
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,400
We need to dry the goods.

585
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
We need to get the chicken oil.

586
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Got it.

587
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,400
Thank you.

588
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,400
No, the brake is not working.

589
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,400
The camera is not working either.

590
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Squad leader.

591
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,400
How long do we need to fix this car?

592
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
We've driven thousands of kilometers.

593
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
How can we fix this car?

594
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,400
Who said it's not working?

595
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,400
Last year, we went to the highland training.

596
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,400
When we went there, we fixed a dozen of cars.

597
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
But they were all broken.

598
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,400
We fixed dozens of car-sucking systems.

599
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,400
The car can't maintain a good performance.

600
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,400
We need to consider our responsibilities.

601
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,400
We can't fix it, squad leader.

602
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,400
This car-sucking system has a high consumption rate.

603
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,400
How can we fix it without a system?

604
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,400
And how can we explain to captain Wang Zhong?

605
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,400
He came to our door today to get a promotion.

606
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,400
Tomorrow, he'll come to the swimming pool to swim.

607
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
He just jumped at our door.

608
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
He can't fix it without a system.

609
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,400
Squad leader.

610
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
I have an idea.

611
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,400
Say it.

612
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,400
We'll take one car as a spare.

613
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,400
And we'll fix the other five cars.

614
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,400
We'll install this car when the spare is here.

615
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,400
So we don't have to waste the spare time.

616
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
And captain Wang Zhong doesn't have to be so anxious.

617
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
We won't be so passive.

618
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,400
You mean we'll take the car apart?

619
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
No?

620
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
It's not about the problem.

621
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,400
It's about your idea.

622
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
How can I explain it to him?

623
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
I don't know.

624
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,400
The point is, we didn't have such a precedent before.

625
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,400
We have scientific and strict arrangement of weapons.

626
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,400
If we talk about small things, we'll destroy weapons.

627
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,400
If we talk about big things, we'll disrupt the arrangement of the army.

628
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,400
It's so serious.

629
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,400
What if we report it to the base?

630
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
Such a big thing.

631
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
I guess the base doesn't have the authority.

632
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
Hansheng, your idea is right.

633
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
But think about it.

634
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,400
You report to the base leader.

635
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,400
The leader reports to his leader.

636
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,400
When...

637
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,400
When it's done, the spare parts are here.

638
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
Don't think about it.

639
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
Hurry up.

640
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
Go and do the statistics.

641
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,400
Excuse me.

642
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,400
Come in.

643
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,400
Captain, I have something to talk to you.

644
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,400
You're not here.

645
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,400
Captain Wang Zhong asked me several times when he could fix the car.

646
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,400
Instructor, I came here because of this.

647
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
The army has been training hard recently.

648
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,400
Many cars need deep maintenance.

649
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,400
But the maintenance of the maintenance squad is not enough.

650
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Then hurry up and apply for a transfer.

651
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
The transfer is scheduled.

652
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,400
What should we do?

653
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,400
It's a big thing to delay training.

654
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
I have a bold idea.

655
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
Tell me.

656
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,400
I want to disassemble a car and fix the internal parts.

657
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,400
When the spare parts arrive, I will install the car.

658
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,400
I can't do it.

659
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400
I will ask the chief first.

660
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,400
Okay.

661
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,400
Remember, wait until the superior has a clear explanation.

662
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
I understand.

663
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
I'll be right there.

664
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Okay.

665
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
Sit down.

666
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Hurry up.

667
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
What are you doing?

668
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Don't ask.

669
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
Don't stand still.

670
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Why don't you fix the car?

671
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,400
How can I fix it without a spacer?

672
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
How can I fix it without a spacer?

673
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
It's a bit stupid to have no spacer.

674
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
I let the chief Wang see you as a servant.

675
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
What?

676
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
You don't even show off.

677
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
Don't be so dramatic.

678
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,400
Captain Wang, you don't have to do this.

679
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,400
I don't practice team training.

680
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
I asked, a team doesn't recruit people.

681
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,400
Where is the training?

682
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,400
Captain Wang, the actual situation is a bit complicated.

683
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,400
Our repair team is lacking spacer.

684
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Isn't this a coincidence?

685
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
Isn't this the physical strength training?

686
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,400
If the car can't be repaired,

687
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,400
the future days will be high.

688
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,400
Right?

689
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
Spacer!

690
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,400
Captain Wang, I just finished reporting from the superior.

691
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
Now everyone is trying to find a way.

692
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
Can you give me a message?

693
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
I can't give it now.

694
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
But I can guarantee that as long as the spacer is solved,

695
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,400
I can start repairing it immediately.

696
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
You can do this.

697
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,400
I call you every two hours.

698
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,400
Don't bother me.

699
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,400
Okay.

700
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,400
It's almost dinner time.

701
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
Do you want to have dinner at the repair team?

702
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
I don't need to.

703
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Wait for my call.

704
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,400
Okay.

705
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Shut up!

706
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Hurry up!

707
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,400
Stop!

708
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Come on, get in!

709
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,400
What did you say, squad leader?

710
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
Nothing.

711
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
Let's go.

712
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,400
Let's have dinner later.

713
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
Okay.

714
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,400
Hello?

715
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
Yes.

716
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,400
Yes.

717
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
It's my fault.

718
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,400
I apologize to you.

719
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,400
I promise.

720
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,400
I call you every two hours.

721
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,400
This kind of thing will never happen again.

722
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,400
I apologize to you again.

723
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,400
I'm sorry.

724
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
I'm really sorry.

725
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Don't worry.

726
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
I'm sorry.

727
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,400
The more capable you are, the more responsible you are.

728
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,400
You're in the best condition.

729
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400
So you have to be dedicated.

730
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
If you don't object,

731
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,400
it's useless.

732
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
I'm sorry.

733
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
I'm going to start.

734
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
I think you're going to end.

735
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,400
Why are you two here?

736
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,400
If we don't come,

737
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,400
you'll be the one who's going to be the next one.

738
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
No way.

739
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,400
Why not?

740
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
These are all big equipment.

741
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
They're made up.

742
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
I'm not kidding.

743
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,400
I know.

744
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,400
What do you know?

745
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
Do you know if you're found out,

746
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,400
you'll at least be punished?

747
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
Hansheng, think about it.

748
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
You want to get into the newspaper.

749
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,400
If you're really punished,

750
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
you can only think about it.

751
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
I didn't think that much.

752
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,400
I'm sorry.

753
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
Do you remember the last time

754
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,400
we went to support the shipwreck team?

755
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,400
Captain Wang Zhong

756
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,400
called the instructor several times

757
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,400
and told him that we were too slow.

758
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,400
Two days later,

759
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,400
at the gate,

760
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,400
who was he looking at?

761
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,400
Me?

762
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,400
Who are you?

763
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,400
He was looking at Squad Leader Zhang Lan.

764
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,400
Wait, wait.

765
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
Since you mentioned Squad Leader Zhang Lan,

766
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
did you report to him

767
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
about such a big thing?

768
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,400
Since you mentioned me,

769
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,400
did you discuss it with us?

770
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
I didn't want to.

771
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,400
I'll take responsibility for what I did.

772
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,400
You've been in the army for a day.

773
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
You can't take responsibility for what you did.

774
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,400
Oh, my God.

775
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
Hansheng, tell me.

776
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,400
Are you sure about this?

777
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,400
Yes.

778
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,400
Let's forget about the disassembly and repair.

779
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
You only repair the number 58.

780
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
I repair the number 63.

781
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
The parts I removed from the number 63

782
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,400
are just as useful as the number 58.

783
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,400
I'll give you 100.

784
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,400
You can take it and put it on.

785
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,400
Who can adjust the scale?

786
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,400
Think about it.

787
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,400
Don't say that.

788
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,400
Hansheng, don't say that.

789
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,400
This is interesting.

790
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,400
What's interesting?

791
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,400
You think the leader is a fool?

792
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,400
I don't think so.

793
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,400
I just hate this.

794
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,400
You two didn't see it.

795
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,400
Captain Mao Zhong and Squad Leader Zhang Lan said

796
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,400
they would call every two hours to report the situation.

797
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,400
Forget about the situation.

798
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,400
And they asked Squad Leader Zhang Lan to apologize.

799
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,400
Squad Leader Zhang Lan nodded.

800
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,400
The other side's attitude was still evil.

801
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,400
No.

802
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,400
They were really against the squad leader.

803
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,400
I heard it.

804
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,400
This is a bit too much.

805
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,400
So?

806
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,400
So let's fix the car quickly now.

807
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,400
So that we can help Squad Leader Zhang Lan regain his face.

808
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,400
Okay.

809
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,400
You convinced me.

810
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,400
Let's do it.

811
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,400
It's okay, Zhou Er.

812
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,400
I've called you.

813
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,400
You can sleep now.

814
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,400
Yes.

815
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,400
Go back.

816
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,400
Who do you think I am?

817
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,400
Isn't this a car repair?

818
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,400
Let's do it.

819
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,400
Wait, wait.

820
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Come back.

821
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,400
Let me interrupt you.

822
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,400
Let's do this together.

823
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,400
But if something happens,

824
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,400
let's do it together.

825
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,400
It's a must.

826
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,400
It's a must.

827
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,000
Let's do it without any

828
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,400
cheating.

829
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,400
Let's do it.

830
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,400
Zhang Yi.

831
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,400
Come.

832
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,400
This car needs gas.

833
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,400
This car needs gas.

834
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,400
This car needs gas.

835
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,400
This car needs gas.

836
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,400
This car needs gas.

837
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,400
This car needs gas.

838
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,400
This car needs gas.

839
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,400
This car needs gas.

840
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,400
This car needs gas.

841
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,400
This car needs gas.

842
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,400
This car needs gas.

843
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,400
This car needs gas.

844
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
This car needs gas.

845
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,400
This car needs gas.

846
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,400
This car needs gas.

847
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,400
This car needs gas.

848
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,400
This car needs gas.

849
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,400
This car needs gas.

850
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,400
This car needs gas.

851
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,400
This car needs gas.

852
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,400
This car needs gas.

853
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,400
This car needs gas.

854
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,400
This car needs gas.

855
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,400
This car needs gas.

856
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,400
This car needs gas.

857
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,400
This car needs gas.

858
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,400
This car needs gas.

859
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,400
This car needs gas.

860
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,400
This car needs gas.

861
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,400
This car needs gas.

862
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,400
You need gas.

863
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,400
You need gas.

864
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,400
This car needs gas.

865
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,400
This car needs gas.

866
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,400
This car needs gas.

867
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,400
This car needs gas.

This car needs gas.

869
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,400
This car needs gas.

870
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,400
Squad Leader Billy.

871
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,400
Squad Leader.

872
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,400
The more you try to escape, the more you'll be beaten

873
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,400
The more you try to escape, the more you'll be beaten

874
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,400
The more you try to escape, the more you'll be beaten

875
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,400

00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,400
The more you try to escape, the more you'll be beaten

880
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,400
The more you try to escape, the more you'll be beaten

889
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,400
The more you try to escape, the more you'll be beaten

890
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,400
The more you try to escape, the more you'll be beaten

891
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
The more you try to escape, the more you'll be beaten

892
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,400

The more you try to escape, the more you'll be beaten

897
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,400
I can see your incompetent arrogance

898
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,400
You don't need to put on a mask to deal with me

899
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,400
You can see me as your target

900
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,400
Why am I so proud of myself?

901
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,400
My heart beats without any reason

902
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,400
The fire of justice always burns

903
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,400
If you dare to provoke me, I'll burn you to death

904
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,400
If you dare to provoke me, I'll burn you to death

909
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,400
I'm the fire of justice

I'm the fire of justice

919
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,400
I'm the fire of justice

920
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,400

922
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,400
I'm the fire of justice

923
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,400
I'm the fire of justice

924
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,400
I'm the fire of justice

925
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,400
I'm the fire of justice
