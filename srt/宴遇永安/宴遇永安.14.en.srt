00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,620
But if you believe me,

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,700
and I inclusion to me,

42
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:14,260
I too am totally scared to do this.

43
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,340
You have always been a dreamer.

44
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,300
Now that you mention Gu Jinglan,

45
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,500
you have your own unique opinion.

46
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,420
How can you not like it?

47
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,540
Congratulations.

48
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,780
Let's call it a day.

49
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,860
Zhang Xingzhi

50
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,820
said he was a straight-A student.

51
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,780
But he's still in Hongwen School.

52
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,780
I have to be a good teacher

53
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,660
when I see him.

54
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,500
Xiao Shiqi,

55
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,700
you can ask your father to teach you

56
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,940
how to read and write.

57
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,780
He's young and talented.

58
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,060
He'll teach you more.

59
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,460
Aunt,

60
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,100
Young Master Lin

61
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,980
is a student of Zheng Zhao.

62
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,380
He has his own plans.

63
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,060
It's good for him to be a teacher.

64
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,140
But why do you keep mentioning Young Master Lin?

65
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,340
He can make me

66
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,900
the second one

67
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,980
who can make you his student.

68
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,020
I can take over his position.

69
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,580
You and Aunt all admire him so much.

70
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,300
He must have his own unique talent.

71
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,860
Yifeng.

72
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,100
TellMen of promoted sense of honor to come and see me.

73
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,360
Yes, Your Highness.

74
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,780
Your Highness, you've been waiting for me for so long.

75
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,780
What happened?

76
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,780
Please go inside.

77
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,780
Anran was worried about something.

78
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,780
She changed her horse.

79
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,780
You're still thinking about her?

80
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,780
Anran,

81
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,780
I'm not worried about her.

82
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,780
I'm just worried about her.

83
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,780
I'm worried about her.

84
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,780
I'm worried about her.

85
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,780
I'm worried about her.

86
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,780
I'm worried about her.

87
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,780
Anran,

88
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,780
I've been making this tea for hours.

89
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,780
I'm waiting for you to drink it.

90
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,780
Please have a sip.

91
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,780
Actually,

92
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,780
it's not something urgent.

93
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,780
I heard that

94
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,780
Princess Royal has a good eye for you.

95
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,780
Why don't you go to her and do a ceremony?

96
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,780
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

97
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,780
Look at you.

98
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,780
It's okay.

99
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,780
It's okay.

100
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,780
Why did you react so much?

101
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,780
Let me tell you.

102
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,780
You were sick when you were a child.

103
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,780
You vomited on me.

104
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,780
I made my own tea.

105
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,780
It's not a big deal.

106
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,780
Yes.

107
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,780
Your Highness is guilty of Anran.

108
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,780
Don't say that.

109
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,780
You're in the capital now.

110
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,780
I can't help you.

111
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,780
But the Princess Royal can.

112
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,780
Princess Yingqun has a bright future.

113
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,780
But you don't have to be the prince consort.

114
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,780
As long as you two are together,

115
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,780
she can be of help to your family.

116
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,780
I understand your painstaking effort.

117
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,780
But this is a humiliation to yourself

118
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,780
and to the Princess Royal.

119
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,780
It's not that serious.

120
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,780
The people who are proposing to you in the capital

121
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,780
are in a long line.

122
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,780
If you don't agree,

123
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,780
one day you'll get old.

124
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,780
They won't like you.

125
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,780
That's what I think.

126
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,780
You should talk to the Princess Royal.

127
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,780
If she really likes you...

128
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,780
I've asked her about it.

129
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,780
The Minister of War, Wei Xiangqin,

130
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,780
is the Minister of War.

131
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,780
The Grand Secretary of the Imperial Household, Song Fangxu,

132
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,780
is the Minister of War.

133
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,780
The Princess Royal told you?

134
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,780
I've told you before.

135
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,780
Anran is really beautiful.

136
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,780
But the Princess Royal...

137
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,780
Why did you suddenly

138
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,780
become interested in the Ministry of War?

139
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,780
The thing is,

140
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,780
I've been friends with the Minister of War, Guo Pingxu.

141
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,780
He's now the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

142
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,780
He's worried about his position after the return of the throne.

143
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,780
So he asked me for help.

144
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,780
Okay.

145
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,780
Actually,

146
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,780
he's just like that.

147
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,780
Look,

148
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,780
Shen Ren chose Guo Pingxu himself.

149
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,780
Now he's not satisfied.

150
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,780
He's just a lowly official.

151
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,780
That's why I hope you can find a backer in the capital.

152
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,780
The Minister of War of the former government

153
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,780
was chosen by Sixth Prince.

154
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,780
I don't like him either.

155
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,780
I'm sorry.

156
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,780
Thank you for your concern.

157
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,780
I'll leave you to your work tomorrow.

158
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,780
Take care of yourself.

159
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,780
The water quality in the capital is not good.

160
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,780
You can come back and have some tea.

161
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,780
It's not good to stay.

162
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,780
The End

163
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,780
An Ran.

164
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,780
Why are you here?

165
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,780
The food here is delicious.

166
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,780
I often send you food.

167
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,780
I just want to have a bite.

168
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,780
But I don't want to...

169
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,780
This is...

170
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,780
What does it mean?

171
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,780
Your Highness.

172
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,780
I just came back from the amusement park.

173
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,780
I passed by the mansion of Jinzhang.

174
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,780
I came to have a look.

175
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,780
Be careful.

176
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,780
Don't fall down.

177
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,780
I got some spring warm tea.

178
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,780
I want to invite Lin Shaoying and Pei Yu

179
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,780
to taste it tonight.

180
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,780
Come here.

181
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,780
Yang Yang.

182
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,780
We must stop the marriage of the Princess.

183
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,780
Why?

184
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,780
Don't ask.

185
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,780
I saw it on TV.

186
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,780
Did you see the social media?

187
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,780
They play chess.

188
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,780
They pretend to be stupid and sick.

189
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,780
They do.

190
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,780
Okay. Come on.

191
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,780
Oh my God.

192
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,780
Yang Yang.

193
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,780
I broke my leg.

194
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,780
It hurts.

195
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,780
Uncle, Yang Yang.

196
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,780
Yang Yang.

197
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,780
It hurts.

198
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,780
Uncle.

199
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,780
Oh my God.

200
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,780
I'm dead.

201
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,780
You're insulting me.

202
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,780
Uncle, are you okay?

203
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,780
Help.

204
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,780
Uncle, it's bad for you.

205
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,780
Come and help.

206
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,780
Uncle, are you okay?

207
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,780
What's wrong?

208
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,780
Uncle.

209
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,780
Come on.

210
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,780
Slowly.

211
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,780
Where did you hurt?

212
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,780
Where did you hurt?

213
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,780
Where did you hurt?

214
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,780
It's not a good injury.

215
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,780
We have to send her to the clinic.

216
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,780
Yes.

217
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,780
We have to send her to the clinic.

218
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,780
Hurry up.

219
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,780
Let's go.

220
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,780
Stop.

221
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,780
Lin Shaoying and Pei Yu

222
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,780
don't want to make an appointment.

223
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,780
So they play this together.

224
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,780
I don't dare.

225
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,780
Don't be angry.

226
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,780
It's a good thing to have an appointment with you.

227
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,780
How dare you?

228
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,780
How could they know

229
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,780
that tonight is the night of the banquet?

230
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,780
So they are trying to fool you.

231
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,780
Yes.

232
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,780
How about this?

233
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,780
Let Anren take them to the clinic to heal.

234
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,780
Tonight is the night of the banquet.

235
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,780
We'll go to a hospital

236
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,780
and have a drink with you.

237
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,780
I'm sorry.

238
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,780
I'm sorry.

239
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,780
I'm sorry.

240
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,780
Well,

241
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,780
I'll do it.

242
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,780
Oh my god.

243
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,780
I'm so scared.

244
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,780
You know how to be scared.

245
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,780
After all, it's the crown prince.

246
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,780
Besides, I can see that

247
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,780
you don't want to go.

248
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,780
Thank you.

249
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,780
Go back.

250
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,780
I'll send Shisi back after I finish eating.

251
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,780
Okay.

252
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,780
We'll go.

253
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,780
Hurry up.

254
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,780
Hurry up.

255
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,780
Your Highness.

256
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,780
How is it?

257
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,780
Lingshao Yin has been in contact with officials

258
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,780
in various departments of the court.

259
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,780
He only had a secret meeting with a imperial censor,

260
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,780
Pei Fei.

261
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,780
I've found out that

262
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,780
he is from a lowly family.

263
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,780
Anren has always been like this.

264
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,780
He's always the same person.

265
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,780
By the way,

266
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,780
how is he with the princess?

267
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,780
He's in a hurry.

268
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,780
Lingshao Yin gave a gift to various departments

269
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,780
in the mid-autumn festival.

270
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,780
He even gave a gift to the minister of the ministry of justice,

271
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,780
who has never been in contact with the court.

272
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,780
But he didn't tell the princess.

273
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,780
Minister of justice,

274
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,780
is Cao Rong?

275
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,780
Yes.

276
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,780
This is the best place to eat.

277
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,780
It's not as good as your restaurant in Guixiang.

278
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,780
Don't underestimate the Shen family.

279
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,780
They used to serve food at the entrance.

280
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,780
It was a good business.

281
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,780
Now they can serve the princess's wedding.

282
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,780
They have a young lady

283
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,780
who is very close to the film studio.

284
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,780
Even the princess is in the family.

285
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,780
Is the princess a person to be respected?

286
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,780
A woman is respected.

287
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,780
She's a woman.

288
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,780
You're right.

289
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,780
What would you like to eat?

290
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,780
What is this?

291
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,780
The menu.

292
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,780
The menu is divided into the menu.

293
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,780
The name of the menu.

294
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,780
You're so unique.

295
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,780
One more of the specials.

296
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,780
Okay.

297
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,780
What is this?

298
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,780
The menu.

299
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,780
It's better than a bad pen.

300
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,780
It's not easy to remember the color of the menu.

301
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,780
The young lady is kind.

302
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,780
The string can be pulled by the husband.

303
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,780
What else do you want?

304
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,780
The menu.

305
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,780
There are no grapes and pepper.

306
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,780
The previous meeting was in charge of the restaurant.

307
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,780
But this time the prince invited you.

308
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,780
I'm bored.

309
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,780
But I'm happy to eat at your house.

310
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,780
It's you.

311
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,780
Why are you so familiar?

312
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,780
The last time the princess ate snacks at the meeting,

313
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,780
you were still busy.

314
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,780
I'll give you two.

315
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,780
Young lady, what kind of snacks are these?

316
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,780
Come on, give us one too.

317
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,780
Okay, I'll have it later.

318
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,780
Okay.

319
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,780
The young lady is really a talent.

320
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,780
I'm Liu Feng, the third in the family.

321
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,780
Please call me Liu San.

322
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,780
Liu San, long time no see.

323
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,780
Please sit down.

324
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,780
Is the young lady the owner of the ten-fold?

325
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,780
I run this ten-fold with my family.

326
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,780
Since you have family, why do you have to sell wine?

327
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,780
Can you still get married in the future?

328
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,780
Ertong, stop talking.

329
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,780
Sorry, madam Shen.

330
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,780
It's okay.

331
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,780
I'm not hungry.

332
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,780
Young man, you're a man.

333
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,780
You can eat in your clothes.

334
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,780
You can taste my food.

335
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,780
You'll know I can eat in my clothes.

336
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,780
I'm not in a hurry.

337
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,780
You're a man.

338
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,780
Why are you in a hurry?

339
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,780
I'm afraid your family will be criticized.

340
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,780
Erlang.

341
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,780
I'm a decent person.

342
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,780
If someone thinks I'm a man, he's a bastard.

343
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,780
But you're rude.

344
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,780
You don't look like a man.

345
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,780
You don't look like a man who can get a job.

346
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,780
You're a man who has to cultivate his life.

347
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,780
Erlang, you're a man who is rude and has a good personality.

348
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,780
I won't live without a ten-fold like you.

349
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,780
You're the ugly one.

350
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,780
After a thousand years,

351
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,780
I don't know how many people will think I'm pretty.

352
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,780
You have no skills.

353
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,780
Madam Shen's words never spare people.

354
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,780
Madam Shen.

355
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,780
Eat.

356
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,780
Sorry.

357
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,780
Hua'er is a man of ancient origin.

358
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,780
But I don't think she can say such a stupid thing.

359
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,780
I will never talk to her in the future.

360
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,780
I made a friend of Mr. Liu's angry.

361
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,780
You can't talk to him.

362
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,780
You don't blame me.

363
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,780
Hua'er is rude.

364
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,780
You should be punished.

365
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,780
Besides, I'm a businessman.

366
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,780
I know the truth.

367
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,780
I'm afraid people will fight and fight.

368
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,780
I can't do business.

369
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,780
I heard that the Shen family's new fried dishes have a good taste.

370
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,780
Compared to the steamed one,

371
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,780
it has a more fragrant taste.

372
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,780
Stir-fry can take the high temperature of the oil

373
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,780
to take away the juice of the meat.

374
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,780
It makes the texture crispy.

375
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,780
Of course it will be fragrant.

376
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,780
To make fried dishes,

377
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,780
you need to use an iron pot.

378
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,780
Madam Shen's cooking is unparalleled.

379
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,780
I admire her.

380
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,780
To be honest,

381
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,780
I also went to Guixiang restaurant to learn.

382
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,780
Guixiang restaurant is elegant and elegant.

383
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,780
It's noisy and quiet.

384
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,780
The guests are sitting, but it doesn't seem messy.

385
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,780
I think Mr. Liu has a lot of experience in the city.

386
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,780
Let's go.

387
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,780
How many defeating rounds were I in?

388
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,780
But he refused to come!

389
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,780
I asked him why he was here today.

390
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,780
He did not listen!

391
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,780
I hope he can ask for your help

392
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,140
What kind of authority do you have?

393
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,580
But they told me

394
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,300
that courtiers are very moral

395
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,740
and strict.

396
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,700
I went out to ask around

397
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,460
and you didn't tell me anything.

398
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,300
Who doesn't know that

399
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,500
you're the only one in the whole capital?

400
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,860
The Shen family and Lin Shaoyin are relatives.

401
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,620
Uncle,

402
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,820
I'm busy with my studies.

403
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,740
How can I know that?

404
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,460
You're just a second-in-law from Xiangzhou.

405
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,140
If it weren't for your father's hard work,

406
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,940
I wouldn't have let you study in the capital.

407
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,540
How dare you offend the young master of the capital.

408
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,180
Tomorrow,

409
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,860
you'll apologize to Li.

410
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,180
I'm a son.

411
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,860
How can I apologize to a prostitute?

412
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,540
You're the one who persuaded me

413
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,380
to apologize to Li.

414
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,860
You look down on prostitutes.

415
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,860
They're better than you.

416
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,020
They can eat and sleep

417
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,420
and earn their own money.

418
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,300
What about you?

419
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,340
You're still eating with me.

420
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,340
How can you say that about me?

421
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,340
It's because of Lin Yan.

422
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,220
I'm afraid of him.

423
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,660
Mrs. Shen, I'm sorry.

424
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,900
I was drunk yesterday

425
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,380
and said those nonsense.

426
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,100
I hope you can accept these gifts.

427
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,620
Please forgive me.

428
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,380
If you're not angry,

429
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,620
please say something to Lin Shaoyin.

430
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,700
I want to thank him for his teachings.

431
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,860
I'll remember it.

432
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,620
Young Master Lin?

433
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,740
Yes.

434
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,340
I've said it.

435
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,820
I won't bother you if you're busy.

436
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,300
Didn't he come to apologize to me?

437
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,100
He took away such a big car

438
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,580
just by looking at it.

439
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,300
What a cunning man!

440
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,500
I'm sorry.

441
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,220
Why are you here today?

442
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,340
I wanted to thank you in person.

443
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,900
I'm the second son-in-law.

444
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,540
Did you help me?

445
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,100
The food box I sent yesterday

446
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,620
was at the gate of the 14th gate.

447
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,060
You came,

448
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,260
so why didn't you go in?

449
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,820
You talked to the owner of the Guixiang Restaurant

450
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,300
and had a good time.

451
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,940
I don't want to bother you.

452
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,460
The business of Guixiang Restaurant is booming.

453
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,100
I thought I'd take the opportunity to get more money.

454
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,740
By the way,

455
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,380
Liu Sanlang is really not what I thought.

456
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,380
I thought

457
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,620
a rich second-generation like him

458
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,780
would be hard to get along with.

459
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,180
But he's not only fit for the job,

460
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,380
but also very smart.

461
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,780
Rich second-generation?

462
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,860
He's rich in the previous generation.

463
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,740
He must have a second generation

464
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,660
to be able to have him.

465
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,900
By the way,

466
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,060
Liu Sanlang must be rich for several generations.

467
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,660
He has a good family background

468
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,620
and he's handsome.

469
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,780
I think the young lady who loves him

470
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,940
is not only stupid.

471
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,460
What's wrong?

472
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,180
The fish is broken.

473
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,980
Is it sour?

474
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,260
I just can't get used to it.

475
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,260
I forgot to tell you that this is a rough cabbage.

476
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,700
I'm not jealous.

477
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,580
Why are you afraid of garlic today?

478
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,500
What's wrong?

479
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,860
It's so spicy.

480
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,900
It's so spicy.

481
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,900
It's so spicy.

482
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,900
It's so spicy.

483
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,900
It's so spicy.

484
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,900
It's so spicy.

485
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,260
It's so spicy.

486
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,260
You're going to get married?

487
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,620
You're going to get married?

488
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,700
Mr. Shen,

489
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,180
I've already retired from my job.

490
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,180
Don't talk nonsense.

491
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,580
I'm pregnant.

492
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,580
Retired?

493
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,580
Yes.

494
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,580
Why?

495
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,540
Recently, many people in the Yushi Group

496
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,540
said that you're a big shot

497
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,740
and you're going to marry the 14th Shen Family.

498
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,260
You hit the second son of the Huan Family.

499
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,540
Someone asked me

500
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,540
if you were married to the Shen Family.

501
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,220
I can't say that you're engaged.

502
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,460
I'm asking you

503
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,980
how to answer.

504
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,540
You should tell me this first.

505
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,740
I think the Yushi Group is too idle.

506
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,940
Talking about this...

507
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,460
You can't say that.

508
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,940
The Yushi Group is supposed to be a big shot.

509
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,660
Besides, you're the supervisor.

510
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,940
Why am I the supervisor?

511
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,940
Of course.

512
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,940
Look,

513
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,340
you're a righteous man.

514
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,340
You're trying to be a good man.

515
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,340
You look like a good man.

516
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,340
You're just a little older than your marriage.

517
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,340
But the Yushi Group

518
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,860
wants to have their own children

519
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,860
marry you.

520
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,460
I see.

521
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,340
You don't want to retire from your job, do you?

522
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,340
What did I say?

523
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,740
You have her in your heart.

524
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,540
You should tell me.

525
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,260
You're so cold-hearted.

526
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,860
How does the Shen Family know that you like her?

527
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,740
She'll understand if you tell her.

528
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,740
Why do you want to retire?

529
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,540
What nonsense are you talking about?

530
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,540
That's how you are.

531
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,540
You think too much about everything.

532
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,540
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

533
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,740
You missed the Shen Family.

534
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,740
You have the right to regret it.

535
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,260
You two are a good couple.

536
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,260
You're a couple.

537
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,260
You're not like the one who's a good man.

538
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,260
Why does it sound like

539
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,260
you're being forced to marry her?

540
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,260
I'm not.

541
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,260
I'm not.

542
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,260
No one looks down on me.

543
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,260
Young Master Lin,

544
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,260
Mr. Pei.

545
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,260
I was ordered by the Senior Princess

546
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,260
to invite you to the mansion today

547
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,260
to enjoy the flowers and the poems.

548
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,260
I just went there yesterday.

549
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,260
Why did I come again?

550
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,260
Your Highness.

551
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,260
Thank you for your kindness.

552
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,260
But I have to write a memorial today.

553
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,260
I have no time to go.

554
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,260
I knew you were busy with work.

555
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,260
I've prepared dinner for you tomorrow.

556
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,260
I'm looking forward to it.

557
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,260
I...

558
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,260
I understand.

559
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,260
But I have to read the memorial tomorrow.

560
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,260
As the imperial envoy,

561
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,260
you should go to the palace first.

562
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,260
You can't go there.

563
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,260
I hope you can forgive me.

564
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,260
I hope you can forgive me too.

565
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,260
You insist on this.

566
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,260
I won't bother you.

567
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,260
Oh.

568
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,260
I think

569
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,260
you're afraid of seeing the Senior Princess.

570
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,260
But what happened

571
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,260
when we drank together yesterday?

572
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,260
Nothing.

573
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,260
I just saw you didn't want to see the Senior Princess.

574
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,260
I saw you didn't want to see her.

575
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,260
So I found an excuse.

576
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,260
Yes.

577
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,260
Your Highness.

578
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,260
Ling Shaoying and Pei Yushi

579
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,260
all said they had work to do.

580
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,260
They can't be away for two days.

581
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,260
It's okay.

582
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,260
The pastries in Guixiang Restaurant

583
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,260
are too sweet.

584
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,260
I miss the food of the Shen Family.

585
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,260
You can invite Madam Shen

586
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,260
to cook for me.

587
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,260
I'll go to the kitchen.

588
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,260
Cook for me.

589
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,260
Yes.

590
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,260
Some people don't like

591
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,260
the poetry and painting.

592
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,260
But the food is delicious.

593
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,260
The best food

594
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,260
will come.

595
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,260
12th Master.

596
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,260
Please.

597
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,260
We're friends.

598
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,260
No need to do this.

599
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,260
An Ran.

600
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,260
You go first.

601
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,260
We're friends.

602
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,260
But we have to treat guests.

603
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,260
12th Master, please.

604
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,260
No.

605
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,260
You go first.

606
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,260
12th Master, please.

607
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,260
You go first.

608
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,260
You go first.

609
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,260
Langjian, Pei Yushi.

610
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,260
I'm sorry.

611
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,260
Langjian, Pei Yushi.

612
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,260
The Chief Princess sent a message

613
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,260
to invite you to have dinner together.

614
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,260
Didn't the Chief Princess

615
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,260
refuse?

616
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,260
She said we were discussing business

617
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,260
and

618
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,260
we had dinner.

619
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,260
Yes.

620
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,260
We were eating.

621
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,260
But the Chief Princess

622
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,260
invited Madam Shen to cook dinner.

623
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,260
Prepare the horse.

624
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,260
Yes.

625
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,260
12th Master, go with me.

626
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,260
No.

627
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,260
I won't go.

628
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,260
I suddenly remembered

629
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,260
I have guests at home.

630
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,260
I have to go back.

631
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,260
You have to go.

632
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,260
I won't go.

633
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,260
You have to go.

634
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,260
I won't go.

635
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,260
You go by yourself.

636
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,260
You won't go.

637
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,260
You said you weren't afraid of the Chief Princess.

638
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,260
I don't want to see her.

639
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,260
I'm not afraid.

640
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,260
Go with me.

641
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,260
I won't go.

642
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,260
You have to go.

643
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,260
You hit me. I won't go.

644
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,260
She won't eat you.

645
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,260
I won't go.

646
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,260
Can you bear to let me face the Chief Princess alone?

647
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,260
I can.

648
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,260
You can go by yourself.

649
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,260
I won't go.

650
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,260
I won't go.

651
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,260
An Ran.

652
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,260
An Ran, let me down.

653
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,260
An Ran, let me down.

654
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,260
Let me down.

655
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,260
Are you a human?

656
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,260
Are you a human?

657
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,260
Lady Shen.

658
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,260
I'm bored eating alone.

659
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,260
How about you stay and eat with me?

660
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,260
Thank you, Your Highness.

661
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,260
I'm not allowed to eat alone.

662
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,260
But there's a sweet Aloe Vera that I haven't made yet.

663
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,260
How about I bring it here

664
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,260
so that I can talk to you?

665
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,260
Sure.

666
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,260
Young Master Lin and Prefectural Governor Pei are here.

667
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,260
Young Master Lin and Prefectural Governor Pei are here too?

668
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,260
Young Master Lin and Prefectural Governor Pei are here too?

669
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,260
Greetings, Your Highness.

670
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,260
Greetings, Your Highness.

671
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,260
I, Prefectural Governor Pei, am not convinced by your kindness.

672
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,260
I came to apologize for my hasty completion of my work.

673
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,260
I, Prefectural Governor Pei, am not...

674
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,260
I, Young Master Lin, am here to apologize.

675
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,260
Let's have dinner together.

676
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,260
Thank you, Your Highness.

677
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,260
Thank you, Your Highness.

678
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,260
Your Highness, I've already eaten.

679
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,260
Then eat again.

680
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,260
The First Princess asked me to cook.

681
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,260
She's also with the Ancestral Immortal?

682
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,260
Wait.

683
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,260
Does she know that I have an engagement with the Ancestral Immortal?

684
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,260
She's going to kill me.

685
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,260
Lady Shen,

686
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,260
I heard that you're Young Master Lin's cousin.

687
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,260
But I see that you two are quite compatible.

688
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,260
Your Highness, don't joke.

689
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,260
I'm just a close relative of Young Master Lin.

690
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,260
I'm just taking care of each other.

691
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,260
I don't dare to be arrogant.

692
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,260
What are you talking about?

693
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,260
I don't think Lin Anran would mind.

694
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,260
She does.

695
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,260
I mean,

696
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,260
Young Master Lin should be with a good background,

697
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,260
with a lot of studies, and with a good appearance.

698
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,260
If she finds someone who's not from the family, I'll mind for her.

699
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,260
Then,

700
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,260
what do you think is the family?

701
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,260
What is the family?

702
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,260
I'll tell you.

703
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,260
What do you think of me?

704
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,260
Your Highness is a first-class family.

705
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,260
Naturally, you should be with a good background,

706
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,260
with a lot of studies, and with a good appearance.

707
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,260
I don't think I'm compatible with you.

708
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:54,260
And I already have someone in mind.

709
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,260
No wonder Lin Anran always

710
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,260
refuses my invitation.

711
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,260
You think I...

712
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,260
You think I...

713
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,260
You all think that I...

714
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,260
I have a good impression of Young Master Lin?

715
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,260
Pei Yishi.

716
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,260
Pei Lang.

717
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,260
Don't you know who I want to meet?

718
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,260
Who?

719
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,260
Then I'll tell you again.

720
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:08,260
It was the first time I saw Pei Yishi at the Seven West Society.

721
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,260
That day,

722
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,260
he played the piano in his sleep.

723
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,260
He was like a famous musician.

724
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,260
He was elegant and elegant.

725
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,260
He was a man of his own.

726
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,260
Until now,

727
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:27,260
I can't stand anyone else.

728
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:39,260
People go to the mountains to play the piano.

729
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:43,260
It's to relieve the pain in their hearts.

730
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,260
But I thought

731
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:52,260
he was the one who really wanted to relieve the pain.

732
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,260
And the person in front of him

733
00:33:54,260 --> 00:34:00,260
really showed the love that a drunkard should have.

734
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,260
You know my feelings,

735
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,260
but you always avoid me.

736
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,260
Prince Consort is ill.

737
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,260
I want to take care of him.

738
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,260
But I don't want to treat myself badly.

739
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,260
But Pei Lang always refuses to respond.

740
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,260
He drank a lot last night.

741
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,260
I'm afraid he'll say too much.

742
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,260
But I can only

743
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,260
set a trap from Young Master Lin.

744
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,260
I even invited Lady Shen.

745
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,260
I didn't expect it to lead to a misunderstanding.

746
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,260
Anran.

747
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,260
In the future,

748
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,260
you should come to the Princess's Mansion often.

749
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,260
You can also bring your friends.

750
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,260
I thought it was a misunderstanding.

751
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,260
Yes, it is a misunderstanding.

752
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,260
Your Highness misunderstood me.

753
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,260
Pei Lang.

754
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,260
Pei Lang.

755
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:09,260
I don't misunderstand you.

756
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,260
One day,

757
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,260
I'll make you understand.

758
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,260
I thought you liked Lady Pei.

759
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,260
Then you can take care of yourself.

760
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,260
But just now,

761
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:29,260
the ancestors said there was someone who was kind-hearted.

762
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,260
Who could it be?

763
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,260
The ancestors haven't appeared yet.

764
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,260
Thanks to Young Master Lin for the sales.

765
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,260
It's already sunset.

766
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,260
The market is still so hot.

767
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,260
Young Master Lin is really good at managing.

768
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,260
Why are you praising me all of a sudden?

769
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,260
I'm really grateful.

770
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,260
Young Master Lin must have a family to treat us so well.

771
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,260
I have nothing to do.

772
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,260
I have to be emotional.

773
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,260
Emotional value?

774
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,260
Are you praising me?

775
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,260
I want you to be happy.

776
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:26,600
Besides, the

777
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,260
Princess's Mansion is full.

778
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,260
Do you want to buy more food?

779
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,260
I'm full.

780
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,260
I was so hungry just now.

781
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,260
I'm full of food.

782
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,260
Food?

783
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,260
You're laughing.

784
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,260
So you also have a crush on someone.

785
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,260
You thought the Princess liked you.

786
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,260
This crush doesn't sound like a good thing.

787
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,260
Look.

788
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,260
No, no.

789
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:26,200
This is all

790
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,260
Yes.

791
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,260
Excuse me.

792
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,260
Be careful.

793
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,260
Are you okay?

794
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,260
I'm fine.

795
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,260
Thank you, Young Master.

796
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,260
Young Master, you just said you have a crush on someone.

797
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,260
Can you ask who it is?

798
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,260
I don't know.

799
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,260
I don't know.

800
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,260
I don't know.

801
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,260
I don't know.

802
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,260
I don't know.

803
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,260
I don't know.

804
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,260
I don't know.

805
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,260
I don't know.

806
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,260
I don't know.

807
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,260
I haven't finished yet.

808
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:03,260
I mean, I made it up.

809
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,260
Can you not be so angry?

810
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,260
You're so scary.

811
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,260
But you're really a young man.

812
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,260
You're good at finding excuses.

813
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,260
If you say that,

814
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,260
the Princess can't force you.

815
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,260
But you can't blame yourself this time.

816
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,260
What the Princess did

817
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,260
really made me confused.

818
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,260
Next time, I'll definitely find a way to make up for it.

819
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,260
I'll definitely learn a lesson next time.

820
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,260
I won't be narcissistic anymore.

821
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,260
As long as the other person doesn't say clearly that he likes you,

822
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,260
it's not going to work.

823
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,260
Remember,

824
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,260
our Young Master is outside.

825
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,260
You have to protect yourself.

826
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,260
And play with it.

827
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,260
Young Master!

828
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,260
It seems that

829
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,260
I can't lose.

830
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:01,260
I'm afraid that I'll never see you again.

831
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,260
So I cut you off once,

832
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:08,260
but it's too late.

833
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,260
I know that

834
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:15,260
I'll never see you again.

835
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:21,260
But fate has changed.

836
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,260
The night

837
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,260
makes the wind

838
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,260
sound like a love song.

839
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,260
We know each other's true feelings.

840
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,260
We've never been

841
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:35,260
apart in this life.

842
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,260
I'm afraid that

843
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,260
the world will turn into a piece of paper.

844
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,260
I'm afraid that

845
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,260
we'll never be together.

846
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,260
I'm afraid that

847
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,260
the heart will be torn apart.

848
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,260
I'm afraid that

849
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,260
we'll never be together.

850
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,260
The night

851
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,260
makes the wind

852
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:56,260
sound like a love song.

853
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,260
We know each other's true feelings.

854
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:07,260
We've never been apart in this life.
