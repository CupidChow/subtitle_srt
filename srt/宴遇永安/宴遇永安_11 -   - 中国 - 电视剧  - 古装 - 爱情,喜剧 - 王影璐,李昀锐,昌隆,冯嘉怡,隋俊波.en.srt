2
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 11=

3
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,140
Taste again.

4
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,940
- No way.
- Yeah.

5
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,980
How could pork be cooked
to taste like this?

6
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,140
I've tried for days,

7
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,300
and I just can't do it.

8
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,500
You good-for-nothings.

9
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,340
You can't even copy it right.

10
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,180
What are you doing?

11
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,360
Are you asking for a beating?

12
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,180
Mr. Lu.

13
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,540
Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu is here.

14
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,620
Mr. Lu.

15
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,700
(Yunlai Ledger)

16
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:43,060
(Yunlai Ledger)

17
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,900
(Lu Yun, owner of Yunlai Tavern)

18
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,460
After a fierce battle,

19
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,260
we failed to crush the Shen family

20
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,580
and suffered a significant loss.

21
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,660
They've made a comeback,

22
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,260
and you have no new strategies at all.

23
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,380
I...

24
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,020
You have seven days

25
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,660
to shut Shen's Diner down,

26
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,300
or you'll be kicked out of Yunlai.

27
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,060
Yes, yes.

28
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,580
(Shen's Diner)

29
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,540
Fengxia.

30
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,460
Wait, wait.

31
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,820
There are some things

32
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,980
that haven't been made clear.

33
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,900
I think it's necessary

34
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,380
to clarify them.

35
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,740
As the Best Chef

36
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,180
in Juxian,

37
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,460
I was busy

38
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,900
with my career before

39
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,620
and neglected your feelings.

40
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,740
That was my fault.

41
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,260
But you have to remember:

42
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,780
I'll never forgive you
when I'm successful.

43
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,100
When we first came to Yong'an,

44
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,300
you pawned your gold ring

45
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,660
just to make ends meet.

46
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,620
It's okay.

47
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,940
I bought you a new one.

48
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,700
Why not try it on?

49
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,380
Hold out your hand.

50
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,340
Hurry.

51
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,940
Hold out your hand.

52
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,740
With such a big ring...

53
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,700
Look at you.

54
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,040
This is the middle finger.

55
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,420
Oh, the middle finger.

56
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,540
Right.

57
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,900
How odd. This is the size

58
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,820
we bought when we got married.

59
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,460
Enough, stop it.

60
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,420
It hurts.

61
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,180
You didn't expect that, did you?

62
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,380
Think about it.

63
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,920
How much work have I done these years?

64
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,540
My fingers must have gotten thicker.

65
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,580
No way.

66
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,740
It must be the jeweler

67
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,520
who made a mistake.

68
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,500
I'll go to him tomorrow

69
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,460
and get it changed.

70
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,380
But that's a minor issue.

71
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,700
Don't worry about it.

72
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,900
The key point is

73
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,180
that your husband is now a man

74
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,580
who can make a lot of money on his own.

75
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,620
From now on,

76
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,100
just follow me

77
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,060
and live a good life.

78
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,540
Mind your temper.

79
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,620
Enough, Best Chef in Juxian,

80
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,540
get back to work.

81
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,500
What's wrong now?

82
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,140
Your attitude is off again.

83
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,140
I used to be poor

84
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,220
and couldn't buy you gifts,

85
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,660
so I understood you were mad at me.

86
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,560
Now that I have money

87
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,420
and can buy you gifts,

88
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,600
you're still mad at me.

89
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,700
Listen.

90
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,620
The Culinary Master Competition
is coming soon.

91
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,660
If I win first place

92
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,740
in the competition,

93
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
I'll be the Best Chef in Yong'an.

94
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,140
I'll be a big shot.

95
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,100
Yes.

96
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,020
You've changed already.

97
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,300
Back then, you at least helped me

98
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:15,960
with some chores

99
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,140
and handled the ingredients.

100
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,940
Now, all you do is brag,

101
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,700
calling yourself the best chef.

102
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,740
Aren't you ashamed?

103
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,140
Aren't I helping you?

104
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,340
I'm just too busy.

105
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,340
I'm busy with my career.

106
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,300
Besides,

107
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,940
my social status

108
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,980
and influence

109
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,220
have improved a lot.

110
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,300
This diner

111
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,500
depends entirely on me.

112
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,780
Without me,

113
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,740
this diner...

114
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,700
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

115
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,140
Social influence?

116
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,420
The diner depends on you?

117
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,180
How can you even say that?

118
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,900
Shen Jianshe,

119
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,900
is this your true nature,

120
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,380
or is it just because you've never had

121
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,300
a stage to show off before?

122
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,060
It's because I've never had a stage.

123
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,940
If I had one,

124
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,180
I would've made it big long ago.

125
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,020
I'll make you famous right now.

126
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,900
Famous, huh?

127
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,140
Why kick me?

128
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,340
Hurry up and cook.

129
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,680
- How did this happen?
- Always like this.

130
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,700
No, no.

131
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,740
What happened to him?

132
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,740
- Is he okay?
- What's wrong with you?

133
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,740
Sir, sir.

134
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,020
- What's going on?
- Are you okay?

135
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,960
- Sir.
- What's wrong?

136
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,340
Let me help you up.

137
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,900
- Get up.
- Slowly.

138
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,380
Come on, slowly.

139
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,180
Brother.

140
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,420
- Is it a stomachache?
- Are you okay?

141
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,060
Don't scare me.

142
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,700
Are you okay?

143
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,940
- What's wrong?
- Brother.

144
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,300
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

145
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,700
What's wrong with you?

146
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,820
Gongcai.

147
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,020
Go call a carriage.

148
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,020
Deyuan, take him to the clinic.

149
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,820
Sure.

150
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,300
- Get up.
- Come on.

151
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,700
Jicai,

152
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,660
I think this

153
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,500
is food poisoning.

154
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,660
Your food is unclean.

155
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,860
I'm going to report you.

156
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,260
(Princess Fuhui's Mansion)

157
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,620
Vice Prefect, this way, please.

158
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,140
After the Qixi Poetry Gathering,

159
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,980
all the factions

160
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,900
have sent their visit letters
to the Princess,

161
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,020
and she refused them all

162
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,140
but ours.

163
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,860
But I'm increasingly feeling

164
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,460
that something is off.

165
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,780
We want to find out something
from the Princess,

166
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,300
and perhaps she also wants to know

167
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,060
something from us.

168
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,100
Let's just wait and see.

169
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,100
I thought you'd have

170
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,620
to engage in a long game with me

171
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,220
before getting to the point.

172
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,340
You're wise.

173
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,840
Why should I beat around the bush?

174
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,860
Over the past ten years,

175
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,940
the position of Prefect
has changed hands 16 times,

176
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,710
with the longest tenure being two years.

177
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,140
Naturally,
I want to seek advice from you.

178
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,300
It's not just a recent thing.

179
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,700
Who

180
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,900
doesn't want power?

181
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,900
What about the case of selling
official positions 17 years ago?

182
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,660
Prefect Cui Ning

183
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,580
didn't gain a single benefit

184
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,020
and lost his entire family's lives.

185
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,460
The case has become a solid verdict,

186
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,420
but the real beneficiary
walked away unscathed.

187
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,420
Now,

188
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,700
he might still be hiding in court.

189
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,150
Judging from your words,

190
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,020
you seem to think

191
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,140
that there's more to that case.

192
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,820
It's just a guess.

193
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,220
I'm not interested in meddling in that.

194
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,180
But you don't need to worry.

195
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,380
Even if there's any trouble,

196
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,540
I'll be on your side.

197
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,860
With someone protecting you,

198
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,100
you have nothing to fear.

199
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,450
Thank you for your favor.

200
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,120
(Pavilion of Jade
in the Fairy Mountains)

201
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,200
Favor?

202
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,500
The word you just used

203
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,300
is quite apt.

204
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,620
Newcomers who are favored in court

205
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,540
- Your Highness.
- are indeed

206
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,820
more endearing than those old-timers.

207
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,020
Anran,

208
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,100
I feel

209
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,900
that I really hit it off with you.

210
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,700
From now on,

211
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,460
you should visit me more often.

212
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,300
Your Highness...

213
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,300
You can even bring friends

214
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,300
along.

215
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,220
Your Highness.

216
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,940
Your Highness.

217
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,900
Your Highness,

218
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,260
someone from the Prefecture

219
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,580
needs the Vice Prefect urgently.

220
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,780
What's the matter?

221
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,900
Your Highness.

222
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,000
Vice Prefect,

223
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,520
someone got poisoned at Shen's Diner.

224
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,580
It's crowded there.

225
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,740
You've harmed my brother.

226
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,730
Today,

227
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,700
I'm going to shut down this place.

228
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,820
- Don't you dare come near.
- We'll investigate.

229
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,940
Listen to me.

230
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,260
Before we get to the bottom of this,

231
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,100
don't be impulsive.

232
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,060
Think twice.

233
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,040
My brother is still in bed.

234
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,340
His life is hanging by a thread.

235
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,260
And I can't be impulsive?

236
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,420
Guys,

237
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,420
smash this place.

238
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,900
Smash it.

239
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,020
Don't come near us.

240
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,340
Move.

241
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,380
Stop them.

242
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,900
Stop them, stop them.

243
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,460
Stop them.

244
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,460
Back off.

245
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,540
Listen.

246
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,020
Don't be impulsive.

247
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,860
The case is not yet concluded.

248
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,540
If anyone dares to move,

249
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,260
they will be treated as a mob.

250
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,220
Do you hear me?

251
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,900
Whoever causes trouble

252
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,340
will go to jail.

253
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,160
Officials,

254
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,340
you have to do justice for us.

255
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,300
The Prefecture officials have arrived.

256
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,260
Good.

257
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,980
Shen's Diner caused poisoning.

258
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,100
The owners should be imprisoned.

259
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,780
Yes, imprison them.

260
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,840
Do you have any evidence?

261
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,020
You don't have any evidence.

262
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,420
You're just talking nonsense.

263
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,540
I've heard it before.

264
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,100
Your family is related
to Vice Prefect Lin.

265
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,100
Right?

266
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,540
No wonder this evil shop

267
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,680
has been able to stay open,

268
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,920
and you've never been imprisoned.

269
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,220
As it turns out,

270
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,660
Prefect Lin has been protecting them.

271
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,500
Yes.

272
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,560
He's been protecting them.

273
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,140
The truth is not yet clear.
Why arrest us?

274
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,020
You don't want to find out the truth.

275
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,340
You keep shouting to shut us down.

276
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,740
There must be someone behind you.

277
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,540
Yes, someone is behind you.

278
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,540
My brother was poisoned at your place,

279
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,100
and you're slandering me?

280
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,100
He's lying.

281
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,580
I'll fight with you.

282
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,300
Grandpa!

283
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,740
Grandpa!

284
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,260
Are you okay?

285
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,540
You all saw it.

286
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,530
They're trying to kill me.

287
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,380
Are you alright?

288
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,220
Get out of the way.

289
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,940
They want to kill me.

290
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,140
I might as well die.

291
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,500
- Let me see.
- Every inch of my flesh

292
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,860
has been bitten to shreds by him.

293
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,540
They've harmed so many people,

294
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,060
and now they want to kill me

295
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,580
right in front of everyone.

296
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,540
Look at this; it's serious.

297
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,720
This is really bad.

298
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,180
Look at how badly you've bitten him.

299
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,220
Look at the bites.

300
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,580
Grandpa's flesh is gone.

301
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,540
Why just stand there?

302
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,620
Smash this diner. Smash it.

303
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,580
How dare you!

304
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,580
Stop them.

305
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,540
Stop them!

306
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,860
Keep shouting.

307
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,100
It hurts!

308
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,940
Stop.

309
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,820
They're going to kill me, too.

310
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,260
The Vice Prefect is coming.

311
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,440
Hurry, the ancestor is coming.

312
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,000
He'll definitely be on our side.

313
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,820
Finally here.

314
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,700
Get up.

315
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,700
It's okay now.

316
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,660
Though you have

317
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,060
a relative in court,

318
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,180
you still can't twist the truth.

319
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,780
Everyone saw it.

320
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,620
They're bullying us with power.

321
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,660
Stop talking nonsense.

322
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,380
Who can do justice to my brother?

323
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,220
- My brother.
- Stop shouting.

324
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,620
You have to trust the Prefecture.

325
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,540
Yes.

326
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,980
Mr. Lin has always been upright.

327
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,180
He won't cover for them.

328
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,060
Exactly.

329
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,060
Since they are relatives,

330
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,980
he should recuse himself from this.

331
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,610
- Recuse yourself.
- Vice Prefect.

332
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,600
You must recuse yourself.

333
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,140
Yes, you must recuse yourself.

334
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,340
You can't be involved.

335
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,100
My brother...

336
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,420
Seal the diner

337
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,100
for investigation.

338
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,300
Vice Prefect, how can you

339
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,900
seal our diner?

340
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,220
- Vice Prefect.
- No.

341
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,100
Vice Prefect.

342
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,820
- Why seal our diner?
- Vice Prefect.

343
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,260
Vice Prefect.

344
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,020
(Sealed by the Prefecture,
25th of the 7th month)

345
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,780
Bear with it.

346
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,300
Such an old villain.

347
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,420
Why did he

348
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,420
have to bite here?

349
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,460
This place is

350
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,980
where you usually pinch me.

351
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,100
It's a sacred ground.

352
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,180
It's a protected area.

353
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,300
Why did he bite it?

354
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,140
Why are you still so flippant?

355
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,860
At a time like this,

356
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,980
you're still making jokes.

357
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,100
- It's done.
- It's done?

358
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,820
- Put it down.
- Alright.

359
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,980
No wonder the ancestor

360
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,340
agreed to break off the engagement

361
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,740
so readily before.

362
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,500
He was just afraid we'd drag him down

363
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,580
and wanted to get rid of us asap.

364
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,260
Let me say something unpleasant.

365
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,380
At his age,

366
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,340
in this era,

367
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,300
he's definitely

368
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,620
a super old bachelor.

369
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,380
We did him a favor

370
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,420
by giving him a betrothal.

371
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,500
Doesn't he know it?

372
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,380
And yet...

373
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,580
Enough.

374
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,860
I've told you so many times

375
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,660
not to bring it up again.

376
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,660
Just let it go.

377
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,900
Why keep mentioning it?

378
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,860
Dear,

379
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,300
let me say something.

380
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,460
If I'm wrong,

381
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,700
you can criticize me.

382
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,980
I think what Gong Cai said is right.

383
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,940
Isn't it?

384
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,740
Things haven't been clarified yet,

385
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,540
and he sealed our diner right away.

386
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,060
As an ancestor,

387
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,380
for the sake of his career,

388
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,220
he just ignores his descendants

389
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,660
and stands by.

390
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,380
Is that appropriate?

391
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,900
Has the ancestor really abandoned us?

392
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,100
Without finding out the truth,

393
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,800
he pasted such a big seal on the door.

394
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,180
That's his way of standing by us.

395
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,420
He meddles in everything.

396
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,740
Enough. We can't just

397
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,620
count on his help.

398
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,220
He's helped us enough.

399
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,100
We're still living in his house.

400
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,060
Still, he can't seal the diner.

401
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,740
Didn't we want to stand
on our own in Yong'an?

402
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,060
We can't just rely on him.

403
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,900
I think Jicai is right.

404
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,980
Mountains can collapse,

405
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,540
and the ancestor can leave us.

406
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,820
We can't always rely on luck.

407
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,000
This time,

408
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,180
we have to rely on ourselves

409
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,040
to get through this.

410
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,300
Dear, you're right.

411
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,660
We have to rely on ourselves.

412
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,530
I've also discovered something.

413
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,660
Well.

414
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,620
You see,

415
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,660
the first man to report us

416
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,260
and the man who said

417
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,420
that we are related to the ancestor

418
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,740
is the same man.

419
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,340
The very villain who bit me.

420
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,740
I can't help but feel

421
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,500
that he caused trouble with a purpose.

422
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,420
He must've been sent by Yunlai.

423
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,420
They stand to gain the most.

424
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,640
Unable to copy our pork dishes

425
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,420
or beat us,

426
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,920
they resorted to underhanded tactics.

427
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,880
Folks,

428
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,140
in this battle to defend our diner,

429
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,980
we must take the initiative.

430
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,700
My brother has been vomiting all night.

431
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,020
Physician, you must save him.

432
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,460
What's going on?

433
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,220
How could a Shen also get poisoned?

434
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,620
The physician has gone in.

435
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,140
- It seems serious.
- Lady Deyuan,

436
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,020
what happened

437
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,180
to Mr. Shen?

438
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,220
Don't even mention it.

439
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,020
We are not like Yunlai Tavern.

440
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,060
We eat the same meals

441
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,220
that we serve to our guests.

442
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,020
That's why Mr. Shen was poisoned.

443
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,740
Poisoned?

444
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,060
Did Mr. Shen really get poisoned

445
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,380
by the food from your own diner?

446
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,260
He was truly poisoned.

447
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,220
It was terrifying.

448
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,980
After eating,
he vomited,

449
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,420
had diarrhea,

450
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,780
and then fainted.

451
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,780
- Let's do it here.
- Okay.

452
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,860
Hold on tight.

453
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,260
- Don't let me fall.
- Okay.

454
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,420
Someone's coming there.

455
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,220
Don't stop me.

456
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,260
Let me go.

457
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,380
- Don't do this.
- Let me die.

458
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,380
Don't be impulsive.

459
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,580
What's wrong?

460
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,020
If there was a problem with our food,

461
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,660
how could I let my son eat it?

462
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,260
My son is almost dead from poisoning.

463
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,540
The poisoner must be someone else.

464
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,220
Don't do this.

465
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,700
We must live to clear our name.

466
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,460
We're innocent.

467
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,500
We're innocent.

468
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,540
(Help me)
Please do justice for me.

469
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,780
(Wronged)
I am innocent.

470
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,020
Folks,

471
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,380
our food was somehow poisoned.

472
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,420
My son is now

473
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,380
(Wronged)
barely clinging to life.

474
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,260
He's on the brink of death.

475
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,300
Folks,

476
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,620
you must've seen wrong cases.

477
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,060
Have you seen one worse than this?

478
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,180
I am utterly wronged.

479
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,220
(Help me)
Folks.

480
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,180
Do justice for me.

481
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,820
(Wronged)
I'm innocent.

482
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,580
(Shen's Diner)

483
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,980
My brother is weak from poisoning
and can't catch a cold.

484
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,440
How can he see you now?

485
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,080
(Sealed by the Prefecture)
Lady Shen.

486
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,340
Everyone is saying

487
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,900
that Mr. Shen has also been poisoned.

488
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,540
Let us take a look.

489
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,020
We will surely find out the truth

490
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,580
and clear your name asap.

491
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,740
Please do us a favor.

492
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,980
My father has just died.

493
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,940
We barely managed to bring him back.

494
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,500
If you let him catch a cold,

495
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,180
he will die for sure.

496
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,740
Who died?

497
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,860
Shen Yangyang, I'm your father!

498
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,700
Lady Shen,

499
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,860
let us take a quick look inside.

500
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,580
I'll definitely find the poisoner.

501
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,820
Just one look.

502
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,420
We'll be quick.

503
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,420
We'll find out the truth ourselves.

504
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,980
We don't need you anyway.

505
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,740
You're making things hard for me.

506
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,980
Leave this to me.

507
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,660
- Vice Prefect.
- Leave us.

508
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,740
- Auntie.
- Okay.

509
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,860
Your brother

510
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,020
is not poisoned, right?

511
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,340
Without asking anything,

512
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,500
you sealed our shop,

513
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,180
and now you're trying to probe?

514
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,280
Isn't it too hasty to build
a righteous reputation

515
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,920
at the cost of our family?

516
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,020
You're too bad.

517
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,500
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

518
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,060
Vice Prefect, please leave.

519
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,100
It's not like that, Shaoguang.

520
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,300
Lady Shen,

521
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,540
the only way to make the poisoner
let their guard down

522
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,340
was to seal the diner first.

523
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,620
During this time,

524
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,420
I have found some clues.

525
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,380
What were the symptoms

526
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,460
of the poisoned diners?

527
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,500
Mostly vomiting and dizziness.

528
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,580
Some even said they saw

529
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,940
little people jumping.

530
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,660
It looks like mushroom poisoning.

531
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,140
I asked the merchants in West Market

532
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,460
who sold you mushrooms.

533
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,660
They confessed

534
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,300
that the steward of Yunlai Tavern

535
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,780
had approached them several times.

536
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,940
Everyone in West Market
does business by the rules.

537
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,140
There shouldn't be any problem.

538
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,020
It's probably that steward from Yunlai.

539
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,340
He found out which mushrooms

540
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,420
were supplied to us

541
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,420
and secretly replaced them
with poisonous ones.

542
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,300
That's also my guess.

543
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,140
But for now,

544
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,220
we don't have any evidence.

545
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,300
Vice Prefect,

546
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,460
we were wrong

547
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,640
about you before.

548
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,500
We thought you

549
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,900
only cared about your own reputation

550
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,500
and just left us alone.

551
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,860
We're really sorry.

552
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,260
Come on, hurry up.

553
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,420
On behalf of my whole family,

554
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,380
I'll apologize

555
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,020
to the Vice Prefect
who has been doing good deeds

556
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,420
for generations.

557
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,010
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

558
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,900
Vice Prefect.

559
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,180
- We were wrong about you.
- No.

560
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,120
We were wrong about you.

561
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,080
It's not necessary.

562
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,140
I should've explained
from the beginning.

563
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,340
It was my oversight.

564
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,380
No, no.

565
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,620
How could you have an oversight?

566
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,480
All these mistakes

567
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,130
are mine.

568
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,000
I was too impulsive.

569
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,400
I even cursed you behind your back.

570
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,000
I really deserve to be punished.

571
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,300
Shen,

572
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,100
you cursed me behind my back?

573
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,060
I...

574
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,000
Did I?

575
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,290
Everyone, please sit down.

576
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,190
So, what should we do next?

577
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,500
Right.

578
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,300
The ancients are superstitious.

579
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,420
Actually, we should...

580
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,460
No.

581
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,020
As the ancients said,

582
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,900
people in Yong'an are superstitious.

583
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,760
Right? Look.

584
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,020
I'm pretending to be ill anyway.

585
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,650
Why don't I just fake my death?

586
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,260
You can dress up as ghosts

587
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,660
to scare that steward

588
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,740
and get him to talk.

589
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,260
When did the ancients ever say

590
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,960
that people in Yong'an
are superstitious?

591
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,620
It might actually work.

592
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,620
Manager Feng is very fond

593
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,340
of believing in mysteries

594
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,460
and fortune-telling, right?

595
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,820
There are indeed many shrines
in Yunlai Tavern.

596
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,180
And I often see Manager Feng

597
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,900
casting moon blocks with the steward.

598
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,460
If they believe in ghosts and spirits,

599
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,060
it might be worth a try.

600
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,140
Auntie,

601
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,740
you look so ghostly.

602
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,860
You really do.

603
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,580
It's done.

604
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,940
Be extra careful.

605
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,980
Don't worry.

606
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,080
Deyuan and I have rehearsed

607
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,340
several times in Yunshui Manor.

608
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,500
I'm very familiar with it.

609
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,700
Be careful.

610
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,060
Go for it, Auntie.

611
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,140
Someone's coming.

612
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,940
Are you alright?

613
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,460
Thank you.

614
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,940
Wow, there really is such a thing

615
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,340
as lightness skills in this world.

616
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,260
Vice Prefect,

617
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,820
how did you just fly up?

618
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,740
Can you take me for a spin?

619
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,180
What spin?

620
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,860
We haven't finished our business yet.

621
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,340
Go for it, Auntie.

622
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,420
Be careful.

623
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,660
We still have things to do.

624
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,180
Don't hurt yourself.

625
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,900
Wait.

626
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,580
Be careful.

627
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,780
(Yunlai)

628
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,860
Who?

629
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,260
Who's there?

630
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,540
Why did you poison me?

631
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,860
Why did you poison me?

632
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,260
You killed

633
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,500
Handsome Shen!

634
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,500
Who did it?

635
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,980
Tell us the truth,

636
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,020
or

637
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,300
we'll die together.

638
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,740
It wasn't me.

639
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,880
It wasn't me.

640
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,820
Manager Feng ordered it.

641
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,020
I didn't want to kill anyone.

642
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,700
(Capital Prefecture)

643
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,100
Silence.

644
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,800
Steward Liu Mo,

645
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,060
poisoning people with mushrooms,

646
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,500
violated the law.

647
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,760
(Cao Rong, Ministry of Justice)
You turned yourself in,

648
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,150
so you get three years of labor.

649
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,020
The principal offender, Feng Li,

650
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,440
has fled out of fear of punishment.

651
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,740
A wanted notice should be issued.

652
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,700
It's now been proven

653
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,040
that Shen's Diner was framed

654
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,740
and did not intentionally

655
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,290
serve poisonous mushrooms.

656
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,380
It'll be unsealed immediately.

657
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,540
Thank you, Vice Minister Cao.

658
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,220
Court dismissed.

659
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,380
Vice Minister Cao
from the Ministry of Justice acted

660
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,580
as the Inspector to adjudicate

661
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,700
the case in the Prefecture.

662
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,560
He's known for his integrity
and impartiality.

663
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,040
He'd never cover for the Shens.

664
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,500
I knew the Shens were innocent.

665
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,140
Vice Prefect,

666
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,300
thank you for your help.

667
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,860
Why offer incense

668
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,140
to thank me?

669
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,700
It's a custom from our hometown.

670
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,420
You've done us such a great favor.

671
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,940
You deserve any thanks we can give.

672
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,460
Sorry about that, sorry.

673
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,860
Master,

674
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,340
please accept me as your disciple.

675
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,340
I want to learn lightness skills
from you.

676
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,260
What are you doing?

677
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,260
Get up, get up.

678
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,220
What are you doing?

679
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,260
This is all from the drama

680
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,460
I watched with Grandma.

681
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,120
I should do this to get myself a master.

682
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,740
Master,

683
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,140
please accept me as your disciple.

684
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,260
If you refuse,

685
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,200
I'll just keep kneeling.

686
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,360
I won't get up.

687
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,580
I'll even roll on the ground.

688
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,580
- Yangyang.
- What drama?

689
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,860
Yangyang.

690
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,380
Get up.

691
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,340
How can you

692
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,340
take the Vice Prefect as your master?

693
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,700
If you take him as your master,

694
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,260
what about your seniority?

695
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,420
Isn't that right?

696
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,460
Agate Meat.

697
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,020
That's right.

698
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,500
If Mr. Lin is Yangyang's master,

699
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,580
she'll be only below him.

700
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,620
I'm the father of Mr. Lin's disciple,

701
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,740
so you all

702
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,180
should offer me some incense, too.

703
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,060
Alright, stop joking around,

704
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,160
or the food will get cold.

705
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,580
Everyone, take your seats and eat.

706
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,620
Vice Prefect, take a seat.

707
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,540
- Right, let's eat.
- Come on.

708
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,880
Mr. Lin, would you like some rice?

709
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,300
- Here.
- Okay.

710
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,620
- Have some meat.
- Vice Prefect.

711
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,500
- Serve him a piece.
- Here's a lamb chop.

712
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,420
I stewed it.

713
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,290
Thank you.

714
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,140
Here, let me serve you a piece.

715
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,060
I want to learn lightness skills.

716
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,260
Yangyang,

717
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,220
eat first.

718
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,440
I'll teach you after the meal.

719
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,700
Okay.

720
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,660
Vice Prefect, have some of this.

721
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,820
It's very delicious.

722
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,440
Shen, that's enough.

723
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,980
- This.
- Have some greens, Yangyang.

724
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,320
- I made this.
- Thanks.

725
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,900
Come on.

726
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,060
Hurry up and eat.

727
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,860
Master, hurry up.

728
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,620
Master,
I want to learn lightness skills.

729
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,860
I want to fly up to that pavilion.

730
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,220
Come on.

731
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,770
Ancestor, let me down.

732
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:00,660
Ancestor.

733
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,900
Let me down.

734
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,700
Auntie, save me.

735
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,060
Ancestor.

736
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,540
Let me down.

737
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,500
Ancestor.

738
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,380
Auntie.

739
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,100
Yangyang, what did you just call me?

740
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,300
Ancestor?

741
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,260
It's an exclamation word
from our hometown.

742
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,320
When someone is very scared

743
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,220
or excited,

744
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,420
they shout "Ancestor".

745
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,940
You are getting used
to talking nonsense.

746
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,100
Didn't you want
to learn lightness skills?

747
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,340
Why are you scared now?

748
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,820
I forgot.

749
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,300
I got vertigo

750
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,220
from my father.

751
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:33,780
Yangyang,

752
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,780
you won't be afraid
if you try a few more times.

753
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,940
Do you want to try again?

754
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,900
No.

755
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,100
I'll go wash the dishes.

756
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,700
She just chickens out.

757
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,780
Washing the dishes?

758
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:44,840
The only thing she knows

759
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,080
how to wash is herself.

760
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,860
But Vice Prefect,

761
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,700
what did it feel like

762
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,580
when you used that lightness skill?

763
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,260
Lady Shen?

764
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,820
You were trying to scare me.

765
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,020
How could I?

766
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,220
I thought you were curious

767
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,820
about the lightness skill.

768
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,260
Clearly not.

769
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,260
Alright.

770
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,900
After all, I thought

771
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,240
you abandoned us for your career.

772
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,320
It's my fault.

773
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,700
How could it be because of that?

774
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,780
Then why?

775
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,580
(Letter of Engagement Dissolution)

776
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,420
Forget it.

777
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,980
I was being petty.

778
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,700
Please don't take it to heart.

779
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,420
How could you be petty?

780
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,020
As the dignified Vice Prefect,

781
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,660
how could you be petty?

782
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,180
The curfew-lifted Yong'an

783
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,380
is just as beautiful

784
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,740
as our hometown.

785
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,420
You always mention your hometown,

786
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,980
as if compared to Yong'an,

787
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,900
you still prefer that place.

788
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,260
Each place has its own merits.

789
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,020
But in our place, everyone is equal.

790
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,260
Life is convenient.

791
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,020
And there's no curfew.

792
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,260
There's more freedom.

793
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,620
Marriages and funerals

794
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,880
are all based on personal will.

795
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,420
These things are indeed better.

796
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,380
You once said

797
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,500
your hometown wasn't Qingyang,

798
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,860
and you met my parents

799
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,340
after you moved to Qingyang.

800
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,620
So, where exactly

801
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,300
is your hometown?

802
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,220
Why is it governed that way?

803
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,060
It's called Future Village,

804
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,940
a very remote place.

805
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,620
You might not have heard of it.

806
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,180
Future Village?

807
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,780
A place that has yet to arrive.

808
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,820
You're so good at making things up

809
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,300
that even Zhuangzi would consider you
a kindred spirit.

810
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,620
How sophisticated the way you insult me.

811
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,220
If I hadn't read a few books,

812
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,460
I wouldn't have understood.

813
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,180
But I'm not making it up.

814
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,660
It just needs
another thousand years or so

815
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,800
for you to see

816
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,520
the Future Village
where everyone is equal.

817
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,820
Indeed,

818
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,540
equality can only be achieved

819
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,160
when there is an abundance of resources.

820
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,940
It's impossible now.

821
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,860
But if we expand farmlands and markets

822
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,680
and make the people

823
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,240
materially and spiritually satisfied,

824
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,340
so that we can live at ease,
free from illicit acts.

825
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,740
Then we might get a little closer

826
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,260
to the Future Village you described.

827
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,700
I'm surprised you understand this.

828
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,700
The economic base
determines the superstructure.

829
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,900
I've never heard of this before.

830
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,900
The economic base
determines the superstructure?

831
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,740
That's really interesting.

832
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,980
You understand this sentence?

833
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,700
You are truly ahead of your time.

834
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,140
I never thought

835
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,380
that someone in this era
could understand this.

836
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,180
When my father became the Prefect,

837
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,380
my family moved to the Capital.

838
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,780
Soon, he was charged
with selling official positions,

839
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,820
implicating our clan.

840
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,380
Liu Chang and I barely escaped

841
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,460
with our lives.

842
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,900
But my parents and everyone else...

843
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,580
Though we were not officially engaged,

844
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,860
this must have affected you as well.

845
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,740
Life back in your hometown

846
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,460
must've been hard.

847
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,500
That must be why you didn't want

848
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,100
to tell me the real situation back then

849
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,400
and made up the Future Village.

850
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,060
I can understand that.

851
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,460
It's alright.

852
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,300
It's all in the past.

853
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,780
Now, it's us

854
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,260
who are troubling you.

855
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,900
You've gone through so much hardship.

856
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,340
I'll definitely
pay more respects to you.

857
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,940
In the past, during festivals,

858
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,500
I was indeed not very sensible.

859
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,340
Pay respects?

860
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,500
I'll attend to you.

861
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,580
Among friends,

862
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,100
that's not necessary.

863
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,540
Didn't you say before

864
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,220
that you don't make friends?

865
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,220
People can change.

866
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,460
So, we are friends now.

867
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,940
Let's do this.

868
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,340
In the Future Village,

869
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,660
friends shake hands.

870
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,860
Shake hands?

871
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,290
So beautiful.

872
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,180
Though I still miss my hometown,

873
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,180
after going through
these things recently,

874
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,660
I seem to like it here more and more.

875
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,560
During the Lantern Festival,
there is no curfew.

876
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,080
The city with lights
will be even more beautiful.

877
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,260
Then,

878
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,900
I will take you to see it again.

879
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,420
Really?

880
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,100
Thank you. You're so kind.

881
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,970
(Shaoguang's Food Notes)

882
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,230
(Why not eat pork?)

883
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,240
(The people of Yong'an are stubborn.)

884
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,750
(Lamb is the best in the world.)

885
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,010
(Pork can never be on the table.)

886
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,530
(Before,
pork could only be steamed,)

887
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,290
(boiled, and roasted.)

888
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:18,310
(Even the slightest mistake in breeding,
slaughtering, and deodorizing)

889
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,570
(can ruin the taste.)

890
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:21,830
(But I want the people of Yong'an)

891
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:24,600
(to easily enjoy delicious meat,)

892
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,620
