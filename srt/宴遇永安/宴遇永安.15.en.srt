hey

14
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,380
bad

15
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,460
Defeated

16
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,120
!

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,500
Go!

18
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,300
Is he asleep?

19
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,760
He is.

20
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,160
Yang Jun?

21
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,220
What's wrong?

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Father.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Why did you suddenly enter the capital?

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Did something happen?

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What can happen?

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm just worried that you're not used to being in the capital.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I brought you some food and supplies.

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm afraid I can't see it.

29
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What?

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Now that you're in the capital,

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
you're hiding a little girl in the car.

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You're joking.

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You're in the capital.

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Do you know the saint?

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No.

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm just a nobody.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Even if you know,

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
you'll be a nobody in the capital.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You don't have to bother me.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Although it's late,

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
there are many people.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You'd better not stay outside.

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll go down now.

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
From now on,

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
you'll be away from your family.

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
How can I go to the capital now?

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll take you to the house.

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Please.

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I miss you a lot.

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I wonder if you're doing well.

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm used to being in the capital.

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Don't worry.

53
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Do you have this boat?

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
This boat?

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Can I use this boat?

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Go to your father.

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Dad, I want to use this boat.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Don't use this boat.

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Look at mine.

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Look at mine.

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Why are you so noisy?

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
When did you come?

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Your Highness,

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
they're from the Shen family.

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
When my parents were alive,

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
they set up this marriage for me.

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
They came to the capital three months ago.

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But you didn't tell them the truth.

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Why didn't you tell me?

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Not long after that,

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
my father wrote to the whole family.

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
They came to the capital together.

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I thought they'd never make the marriage

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
after the Cui family's death.

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But now I've told them

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
that they've already retired.

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
They just stayed.

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I didn't tell you the truth.

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Anran used to be close to me.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But she didn't tell me

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
anything after she retired.

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Even though she wrote to the family,

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
she never mentioned the Shen family.

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Anran just thought

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
that they were not important.

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Really?

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But I thought

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
that she didn't want to go to the capital with you.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And she had a wife.

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yangyang, be careful.

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Be careful, Yangyang.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You didn't ask me about the capital.

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But you didn't want to care about the Princess.

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You're protecting the family.

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You didn't say a word

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and you're asking me?

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Anran,

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
the Princess is the only one

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
who cares about the Princess.

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
She's like the Princess of the previous dynasty.

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The Crown Prince is still young.

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He's not in a good mood.

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The Princess will always remember

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
that if there's someone

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
who can rely on her,

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
she'll be able to make a mistake.

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I understand.

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's getting late.

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You should go to bed.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Don't worry.

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Anran,

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
the engagement is canceled.

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But since the Shen family is here,

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I should see them.

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The Young Master is so polite to this man.

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I just heard him call him the Holy Man.

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Isn't he an ordinary man?

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He's not ordinary.

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Brother Li,

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
you should bake the lamb skewers.

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The main thing is the meat.

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And the seasoning.

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Brother Shen, please.

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Watch me.

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Master Mao,

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
you're so good at it.

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Master Mao,

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
try it.

129
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's good.

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's a good dish for cooking.

131
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm flattered.

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's so good.

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The smoke rises from the clouds.

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The fire is burning.

135
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It smells so good.

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's so good.

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
A Ji is here.

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This is

139
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Anran's fiancee, right?

140
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
She's too thin.

141
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
She should be more elegant.

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
She's always so quiet.

143
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Mr. Li,

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Shaoguang and I have broken the engagement.

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
No need to explain.

146
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Master,

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
how is Mrs. Shen?

148
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Greetings.

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm not of a high rank.

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
This is His Majesty's brother.

151
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But he looks like a relative of the ancestors.

152
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Anyway,

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm afraid he's too far away.

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll just read it.

155
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Uncle Li,

156
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I hope you'll be happy.

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Look at his mouth.

158
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He's so good at talking.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Anran,

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Shen's family is very interesting.

161
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm very happy.

162
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Brother, what are you talking about?

163
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Try this skewer.

164
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I used to eat roast lamb.

165
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But I've never eaten such a skewer.

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
How is it?

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's tender and tender.

168
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's wonderful.

169
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Wonderful.

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What do you want?

171
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
A hotel?

172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
A carriage?

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
A mansion?

174
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
A dog?

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What did he say?

176
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Are you drunk?

177
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Why are you so drunk?

178
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You're a relative of the ancestors.

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Drink!

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
How can I be a relative of the ancestors?

181
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm a relative of the ancestors.

182
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll drink.

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Drink more.

184
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Drink more.

185
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Brother Shen, come on.

186
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What's in the fish pond?

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
A pond, a hair salon, a study,

188
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and a security guard.

189
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What does security guard mean?

190
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Security guard!

191
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Security guard means

192
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
security guard

193
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
who protects us.

194
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Security guard.

195
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
We're called security guards.

196
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You're a fool.

197
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm drunk.

198
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You're right.

199
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Uncle, my dad is a

200
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
big fish.

201
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Eat some fish.

202
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Wait.

203
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You're wrong.

204
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I told you.

205
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You're right.

206
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Uncle, I've found the essence of life.

207
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Have a drink.

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Come on.

209
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
This game is so fun.

210
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Where did you learn it from?

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We created it.

212
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We've been playing since childhood.

213
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
We're innovative.

214
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You're talented.

215
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I know that the gift of the groom

216
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
is not the same as that of my parents.

217
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I didn't have time to inform them.

218
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Will he make it difficult for you?

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Fangcai is very brave.

220
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He's a real man.

221
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He's a real man.

222
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
This is the sixth brother of the sage,

223
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Prince Zhao.

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This wine is delicious.

225
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You don't know.

226
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Don't worry.

227
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The world will find you interesting.

228
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Li,

229
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I knew you were

230
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
very proud and

231
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
proud of yourself.

232
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You're a good official.

233
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I think you're

234
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
a better official than our sage.

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Right?

236
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Uncle, how do you know?

237
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I don't know.

238
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:12,680
I'm a

239
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,220
woman who

240
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,520
chooses

241
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,520
to believe

242
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,420
that nem petty

243
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,620
lady

244
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,620
likes

245
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,620
attractive

246
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,620
woman

247
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,620
As little as

248
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,620
Well said!

249
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,620
But, Shen Xue, I don't understand one thing.

250
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,620
What do you mean by the word society?

251
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,620
Society, let me tell you, is a university.

252
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,620
Actually, you have universities too.

253
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,620
In the Wu Ben Xiang, Guo Zi Jian is a university.

254
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,620
Of course.

255
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,620
But, let me tell you, the university is still complicated.

256
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,620
For example, your officialdom is a university.

257
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,620
You learn a theory of human beings.

258
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,620
But when you see it in the society, you think,

259
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,620
it's not like that.

260
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,620
What is the most powerful person?

261
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,620
The most powerful person is the one who can keep his nature in the society.

262
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,620
This person is powerful.

263
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,620
You and him.

264
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,620
You are the kind of people.

265
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,620
I'm touched.

266
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,620
I'm touched too.

267
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,620
I'm touched too.

268
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,620
I'm touched too.

269
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,620
You are the king of the nine directions.

270
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,620
You don't understand.

271
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,620
I don't want to talk about it.

272
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,620
You are a thief.

273
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,620
Yes, yes.

274
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,620
Shen Xue, Shen Xue.

275
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,620
Yes, yes.

276
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,620
To be honest,

277
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,620
I'm worried about you.

278
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,620
Don't worry.

279
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,620
This guy doesn't believe in the rules.

280
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,620
He is not in the right place today.

281
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,620
What's wrong with him?

282
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,620
He is just a little boy.

283
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,620
The sky is clear, the sea is clear,

284
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,620
the sea is clear, the land is clear.

285
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,620
The atmosphere is so good tonight.

286
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,620
I can't help but sing.

287
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,620
What are you singing?

288
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,620
Come on, come on.

289
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,620
Sing well.

290
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,620
Sing well.

291
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,620
Brother Li, I saw you playing this game well.

292
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,620
Play with me.

293
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,620
I'll sing first.

294
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,620
Okay.

295
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,620
Ready?

296
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,620
Ready.

297
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,620
What's in the city of Yongan?

298
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,620
Shen's small restaurant.

299
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,620
I'm shooting a video again.

300
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,620
I'm talking about you.

301
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,620
Come on, go on.

302
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,620
Why don't you wear Shen?

303
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,620
He's drunk.

304
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,620
No, no, no.

305
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,620
He's not drunk.

306
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,620
Don't talk nonsense.

307
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,620
Mother, mother.

308
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,620
I'm drunk.

309
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,620
I'm drunk.

310
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,620
I'm drunk.

311
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,620
From this point on,

312
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,620
Father, father.

313
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,620
Now who's drunk?

314
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,620
He needs to drink.

315
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,620
I'm not!

316
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,620
Bastard.

317
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,620
Your Highness.

318
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,620
Annaa.

319
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,620
Cui family is Shi's family.

320
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,620
How did they get married in Shanggu?

321
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,620
This family is so strange.

322
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,620
I was also confused.

323
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,620
But my parents never cared about the family.

324
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,620
And it's not strange to get married.

325
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,620
Your Highness also saw that the Shen family is not a trick.

326
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,620
They have been taking care of me.

327
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,620
They never moved.

328
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,620
Have you checked their details in person?

329
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,620
They will not have any problems.

330
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,620
You didn't go?

331
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,620
For this family, you lied to me.

332
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,620
I'm just worried that going back to Qingyang to investigate the old case

333
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,620
may cause unnecessary trouble.

334
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,620
You are going to investigate the case for the Cui family.

335
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,620
You are afraid that it may cause unnecessary trouble.

336
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,620
Do you know how big this is?

337
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,620
I risked my life to save you.

338
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,620
I didn't want you to risk your life.

339
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,620
How did you know?

340
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,620
I raised you.

341
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,620
I can't see your mind.

342
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,620
I understand.

343
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,620
You will know what I want to do sooner or later.

344
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,620
But you saved me.

345
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,620
I can't involve you in this family anymore.

346
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,620
Please don't ask me about it.

347
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,620
Please don't ask me about it.

348
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,620
You are so stupid.

349
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,620
You are like a relative to me.

350
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,620
How can I say no to you?

351
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,620
You are doing such a dangerous thing.

352
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,620
I'm not in the capital.

353
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,620
How can I protect you?

354
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,620
Anran, you are a new person.

355
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,620
You are a young man.

356
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,620
You have to live well in the high places.

357
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,620
This is what your parents want.

358
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,620
I understand.

359
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,620
Okay.

360
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,620
Why are you still like this?

361
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,620
Anran.

362
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,620
You have been in the capital for a while.

363
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,620
Did you find anything?

364
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,620
The evidence is in the file.

365
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,620
I didn't find anything.

366
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,620
The Shen family is the family of the Cui family.

367
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,620
Maybe you know a little about the family.

368
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,620
The case happened suddenly.

369
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,620
The Shen family is far away in Qingyang.

370
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,620
They have nothing to do with the government.

371
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,620
I asked them.

372
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,620
They don't know anything.

373
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,620
The Shen family is not allowed to enter your house.

374
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,620
If someone is watching them,

375
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,620
it will be a problem.

376
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,620
Do you understand?

377
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,620
I understand.

378
00:18:42,620 --> 00:19:08,500
succumbed to the

379
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,220
I know what you're going through.

380
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,620
It means that there must be some people around him.

381
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,620
Luckily, you're cautious.

382
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,820
You never thought of escaping from the country.

383
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,620
I didn't want to involve the benefactors

384
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,620
and that's why I hid it.

385
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,420
Now it seems...

386
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,620
In the past, you always encouraged me

387
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,820
not to participate in the annual regular events.

388
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,220
If it wasn't for the temporary examination in the fifth year,

389
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,620
you might not have had a chance to become an official.

390
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,420
Finally, you tried to turn me into a spy

391
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,020
and said you wanted to make me feel more at ease.

392
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,220
If it wasn't for the corruption case,

393
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,820
I'm afraid we wouldn't be able to get to Yongan.

394
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,820
Actually, you asked me to investigate the corruption case.

395
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,820
But I don't know if he really wanted me to catch him

396
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,820
or if he thought I was his own man.

397
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,220
He would have kept his eyes closed.

398
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,820
So, the man tried to break into the capital,

399
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,820
but the princess didn't even give him a single reward.

400
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,420
What on earth does the princess want?

401
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,420
And why does she have to stop you from entering the capital?

402
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,420
That... That... That's... That's King Zhao.

403
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,420
Didn't you just fight with him?

404
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,820
How many lives do you have?

405
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,620
You want to be the royal family's concubine?

406
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,220
I was just...

407
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,220
I was just fighting with him.

408
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,220
I... I... I can't afford to fight now.

409
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,220
Don't be too nervous.

410
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,420
I think the atmosphere tonight is quite harmonious.

411
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,620
Brother.

412
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,620
Brother.

413
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,020
I called him brother.

414
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,220
Maybe he's not angry.

415
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,820
Didn't you see it?

416
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,220
King Zhao was drunk and kept talking to him.

417
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,620
Dad, did he ask you about the ancestors?

418
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,220
I just said something was wrong.

419
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,820
If it wasn't for his daughter's wisdom,

420
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,020
I'd have killed you.

421
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,420
He asked me, but I didn't say anything.

422
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,420
I didn't say anything.

423
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,420
Can you hold back when your daughter is fighting with you?

424
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,420
I know nothing about your mouth.

425
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,020
I just wanted to tell him

426
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,420
that our ancestors violated the filial piety.

427
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,620
But I didn't say anything.

428
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,020
I really didn't say anything.

429
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,220
And King Zhao was very kind to me.

430
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,420
I was just...

431
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,820
Maybe I could make friends with him

432
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,420
and make some friends with the ancestors.

433
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,620
Do you think it's possible that

434
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,820
the young master was angry at King Zhao

435
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,020
because he was working?

436
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,420
In ancient times, King Fan couldn't enter the capital without permission.

437
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,420
He was afraid that someone would come to steal the gold.

438
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,620
There must be something wrong.

439
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,420
Jin, I think

440
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,220
you should go to the capital.

441
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,420
Jin, I think

442
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,420
their relationship is not simple.

443
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,820
Grandfather said that

444
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,020
the ancestors changed their names

445
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,820
to call upon the old.

446
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,620
Is it possible that the savior

447
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,020
is King Zhao?

448
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,820
Did your grandfather really say that?

449
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,620
I have no impression.

450
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,220
It's possible.

451
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,020
It's okay. Let's not think about it.

452
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,620
Since he is here,

453
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,220
we can just take him as an elder and take care of him.

454
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,420
We just don't want to trouble him.

455
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,620
What? Zhao...

456
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,620
Mr. Li promised to come to our 14th banquet tonight.

457
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,620
The second master of the Shen family personally sent a post to my husband.

458
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,020
He said he would have a banquet at the Shen family's restaurant.

459
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,020
He will not fail to fulfill such a sacred request.

460
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,020
Grandfather.

461
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,020
What's wrong?

462
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,020
What's wrong with you?

463
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,020
Get up.

464
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,220
Are you okay?

465
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,620
Dad, mom.

466
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,020
What are you thinking?

467
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,820
Inviting that person to the restaurant for dinner?

468
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,020
Look at you. You are so flustered.

469
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,820
Didn't you say that last night?

470
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,220
You said that King Zhao has arrived.

471
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,620
We have to take care of him.

472
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,820
I told you to take care of him.

473
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,020
I didn't ask you to invite him.

474
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,020
Mom, I'm sorry.

475
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,220
I'm sorry.

476
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,420
I'm sorry.

477
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,620
I'm sorry.

478
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,420
Mom, why don't you stop him?

479
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,020
What did I do wrong again?

480
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,620
Didn't your dad insist on inviting him?

481
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,420
I think it's okay.

482
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,020
Young Master has to work every day.

483
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,420
It's not convenient for King Zhao to show up in public.

484
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,820
He can only stay in Yunshui Hospital.

485
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,820
How boring it is!

486
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,420
If he can come out at this time to have a good time,

487
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,820
and eat something delicious,

488
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,020
he will be very happy.

489
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,020
That's right.

490
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,220
And the safest place is our restaurant.

491
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,220
Once this person is served,

492
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,420
it may be helpful for him.

493
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,620
I feel strange.

494
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,220
I think I'm going to be convinced.

495
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,420
What do you think?

496
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,220
Ji, listen to me.

497
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,420
This relationship is always

498
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,420
about eating and eating.

499
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,620
Your dad knows it.

500
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,420
Then you should tell him.

501
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,420
What's the point of making decisions on our own?

502
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,020
Yes, we should tell him.

503
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,220
But it's too early for them to go to court.

504
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,420
We haven't got up yet.

505
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,020
How about this?

506
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,420
You should tell him.

507
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,220
Okay, I'll go now.

508
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,620
Ji, what are you thinking?

509
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,020
Don't forget to save it.

510
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,020
The elders in my tribe

511
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,620
don't know where they heard

512
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,620
that you don't even have a concubine.

513
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,620
They came to me.

514
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,220
I heard from my family

515
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,020
that I have four sisters, three cousins,

516
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:48,820
and six nephews.

517
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,220
They all want to marry you.

518
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,420
Our Pei family is also Wang family.

519
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,020
But I'm not a part of it.

520
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,820
But because I'm friends with you,

521
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,420
I've become a good friend.

522
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,620
How should I answer them?

523
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,620
Mr. Pei,

524
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,420
when did I become friends with you?

525
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,820
Two ladies are protected by the court.

526
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,620
One of them is a beauty.

527
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,020
They are all maids.

528
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,820
Yes, I don't know which man is in charge.

529
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,220
It's a good fortune.

530
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,220
There's a beauty ahead.

531
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,220
Let's go and see.

532
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,420
The people who can enter the court

533
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,420
must have a good taste.

534
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,020
I think they're all looking at you.

535
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,220
Why don't you pick a good one?

536
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,420
I'll listen to you.

537
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,820
You're making fun of me again.

538
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,020
I'm sorry.

539
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,620
But before,

540
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,420
there was a famous woman.

541
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,220
I'm pretty and handsome.

542
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,420
All the men in the village came to ask for her.

543
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,220
I'm Pei Shiba.

544
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,220
I'm a young lady.

545
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,020
I'm a young lady.

546
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,620
I'm a young lady.

547
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,220
I'm a young lady.

548
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,820
I'm a young lady.

549
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,420
I don't want to miss the good chance.

550
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,820
I'll ask you for your name.

551
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,020
It seems that you've never been married.

552
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,820
I'm very grateful for your good chance.

553
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,020
Have you heard it clearly?

554
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,220
I'm Pei Shiba,

555
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,820
Pei of Hedong.

556
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,220
Big Niu.

557
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,420
Pei Shiba,

558
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,820
I'm a man of honor.

559
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,220
I'm not willing to tell you the truth.

560
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,020
Your wife is a woman of honor.

561
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,420
She doesn't want to marry you.

562
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,620
Shiba, can you forgive her?

563
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,620
Marry me?

564
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,220
Goodbye.

565
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,820
Goodbye, Pei.

566
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,620
Why are you here?

567
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,820
Are you kidding me?

568
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,820
Come here.

569
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,220
That's the young lady's cousin.

570
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:45,420
That's the young lady's cousin.

571
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,420
That's the young lady's cousin.

572
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,420
You didn't do it right.

573
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,020
Pei Shiba,

574
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,020
don't be so happy.

575
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,020
Lin Yan's cousin

576
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,620
is just a man of honor.

577
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,620
Look at her.

578
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,220
Is she married to that weak woman?

579
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,820
She wants to marry her.

580
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,420
It's a blessing that my niece doesn't marry her.

581
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,220
You call yourself the 12th.

582
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,620
But you're ranked 47th in the family.

583
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,820
Don't teach me.

584
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:23,020
When I say you're 47th in front of others,

585
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,420
you have to answer me.

586
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,420
My aunt and aunt are just...

587
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,020
I've caused you trouble again.

588
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,420
I'm sorry.

589
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,420
You've always been my sister.

590
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,020
Just now, too.

591
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:50,820
It's a disaster to invite Prince Zhao to dinner.

592
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,220
I can't keep my robe tomorrow.

593
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,820
Is it that serious?

594
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,420
It's not serious.

595
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,820
I appreciate you helping me.

596
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,020
If you can cause me trouble,

597
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,620
I'm not capable enough to do it.

598
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,020
It's none of your business.

599
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,020
But Prince Zhao reminded us

600
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,620
to find a place to stay as soon as possible.

601
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,620
To avoid causing trouble for him.

602
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,220
Can't we just stay here?

603
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,420
It's okay.

604
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,220
But you're wearing a official robe.

605
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,420
You can't just go there.

606
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,220
I can't.

607
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,820
But I'm afraid I can't go back.

608
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,820
I've got a robe on.

609
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,420
Go ahead.

610
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,620
I'm sorry.

611
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,820
I'm done.

612
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,020
I'm done.

613
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,420
I'm done.

614
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,620
Young Master, well...

615
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,620
The elder you said you had something to hide from me.

616
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,220
Is he Prince Zhao?

617
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,220
Is he important to you?

618
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,820
He's the one who saved my life.

619
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,820
It's Prince Zhao who adopted me.

620
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,020
No wonder.

621
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,820
It's not easy to exchange a maid.

622
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,820
I need to be a good friend.

623
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,020
You're smart.

624
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,820
But don't say that again.

625
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,620
Young Master,

626
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,620
is there anything you need to keep in mind

627
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,020
when you're with Prince Zhao?

628
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,020
Is there anything you can't let him know?

629
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,420
He cares about me.

630
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,420
But it's not convenient to talk to the elder.

631
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,420
I see.

632
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,420
Stop.

633
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,020
Young Master, we're here.

634
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,420
Come down.

635
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,420
What's wrong?

636
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,020
Young Master.

637
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,420
Young Master.

638
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,820
Mr. Li, I'll make you a bowl of soup.

639
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,820
Okay.

640
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,820
Drink more.

641
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,020
The wine is good.

642
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,220
Come on.

643
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,620
Try the fishball soup.

644
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,820
Okay.

645
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,620
It's really rare to be together like this.

646
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,820
We can't see this child in this situation.

647
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,820
Stop it.

648
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,820
It's not easy for a child to be a young master.

649
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,820
He only knows you.

650
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,620
If he doesn't help the Jin family,

651
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,620
who will support him?

652
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,020
Yes.

653
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,620
Don't worry.

654
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,020
As long as I'm here,

655
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,820
I won't let anyone down.

656
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,420
Thank you.

657
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,020
Mr. Li, let's eat.

658
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,420
Let's drink.

659
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,820
Okay.

660
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,820
Together.

661
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,220
Together.

662
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,820
Eat.

663
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,220
Okay.

664
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,420
Try it.

665
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,820
Brother Shen,

666
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,420
after eating the food you cooked,

667
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,820
I'm afraid you won't eat the food from home.

668
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,420
Mr. Li, you're so kind.

669
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,620
As long as you're here,

670
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,620
I'll cook for you anytime.

671
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,820
Yes.

672
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,420
If you don't want to come,

673
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,620
you can change your name.

674
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,820
I'm not Brother Li.

675
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,220
It's like Anran said,

676
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,020
my identity.

677
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,820
I don't know your identity.

678
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,020
Please forgive me.

679
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,020
Forgive you?

680
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,820
I'm sorry.

681
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,820
Don't be shy.

682
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,420
Sit down.

683
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,220
Come on.

684
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,620
Sit down.

685
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,820
To be honest,

686
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,020
I'm very close to you.

687
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,020
If you lose your identity,

688
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,220
I'll lose my life.

689
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,620
I'm glad you're here.

690
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,820
I don't have friends like you.

691
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,820
Your Highness,

692
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,820
we're ordinary people.

693
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,620
How can we afford it?

694
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,220
We can afford it.

695
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,220
Brother Shen.

696
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,420
Thank you.

697
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,420
Thank you for your care.

698
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,620
Here.

699
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,420
No, no.

700
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,820
No, no.

701
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,820
Don't say that.

702
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,420
After drinking,

703
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,620
I feel a little drunk.

704
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,420
Brother Shen, go out with me.

705
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,420
Uncle,

706
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,420
I'll go out with you.

707
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,220
Yes, yes, yes.

708
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,620
Let the young master accompany you.

709
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,420
You said,

710
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,820
you'll sit down and eat as soon as you enter.

711
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,020
I haven't been to the Fourteenth Palace yet.

712
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,420
Let your uncle Shen accompany you.

713
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,620
You can talk to him about food.

714
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,420
He won't bother you.

715
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,020
Brother Shen.

716
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,220
Your Highness asked me to come out.

717
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:25,020
Do you have something to tell me?

718
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,620
Brother Shen, you're so clear.

719
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,420
Sit down.

720
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,620
Don't be nervous.

721
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,020
Sit down and talk.

722
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:43,020
I want to talk to you about Anran's future.

723
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,620
Anran is the daughter of Jingzhao.

724
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,820
I know.

725
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,820
From the perspective of the world,

726
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,620
she is young and promising.

727
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,220
But in the wedding,

728
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,020
she is an old man.

729
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,820
We are both elders.

730
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,820
We should think about Anran.

731
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:03,020
Actually, I know that you want to talk about Shao Ying.

732
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,820
But I didn't expect this.

733
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,420
Yes, we have an engagement with Shao Ying.

734
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,220
But our marriage contract is already written.

735
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,020
I want to say that

736
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,420
it's not appropriate to live in Yunshui Garden.

737
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,820
Anran is highly appreciated by His Majesty.

738
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,820
She was invited by the Princess of Fu Hui.

739
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,820
She is very important.

740
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,620
The business of Shennong Palace is no different from mine.

741
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,420
But it's up to the world.

742
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,020
If Anran keeps the Shen family,

743
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,020
she will cause misunderstandings

744
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,220
and will ruin the marriage.

745
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,220
So that's what it means.

746
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,620
I know that.

747
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:46,620
But we always think that Shao Ying is a member of our family.

748
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,820
Besides,

749
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,220
the husband of the Princess is still here.

750
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,620
Our Shao Ying can't really do that.

751
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,620
I know that you value Anran.

752
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,620
That's why I dare to talk to you.

753
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,420
You and I want to be good for Anran.

754
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,420
But Anran is complicated.

755
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:04,020
This marriage contract will always be a new problem.

756
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,820
I mean,

757
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,820
I want to take you away from Yongan

758
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,020
and go to another place.

759
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,020
Go away?

760
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,220
Your Highness,

761
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,820
although we are just common people,

762
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,020
we have the right to choose.

763
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,620
My restaurant just opened.

764
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,220
Now it's time to make a big deal.

765
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,420
The whole village is in danger.

766
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,620
You can listen to my arrangement and make a choice.

767
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,220
I will decide what you need.

768
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,220
You don't know me very well.

769
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,020
It's not about money.

770
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,220
I'm willing to give you ten thousand gold.

771
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,620
How much?

772
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,820
Ten thousand gold?

773
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,020
I wish you a safe trip.

774
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,020
That's ten thousand gold.

775
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,620
And he promised me

776
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,020
that as soon as we get to the city,

777
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,420
he will build a big restaurant for me.

778
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,420
He will buy clothes for your mother.

779
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,020
He will introduce you to the King of the World.

780
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,220
He will build a private house for Yang Yang.

781
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,020
Really?

782
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,220
This is my good brother, King of Zhao.

783
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,420
He told me in person.

784
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,620
How can it be fake?

785
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,620
This is a good thing, father.

786
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,820
You are so good.

787
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,020
Sit down.

788
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,020
No, it's not that simple.

789
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,620
How much does a restaurant cost?

790
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,820
Why is King of Zhao so good to us?

791
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,020
Why don't you understand?

792
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,620
King of Zhao knows the background of our ancestors.

793
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,220
Maybe he is the one who saved our ancestors.

794
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,220
That's right.

795
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,620
Our ancestors told me before.

796
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,020
What did I say?

797
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,220
Wait, when did our ancestors tell you?

798
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,220
It's really a big thing.

799
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,220
Young Master,

800
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,020
the elder you told me that you had something to hide from me,

801
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,620
is he King of Zhao?

802
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,420
Is he important to you?

803
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:05,020
Did King of Zhao adopt me when I was young?

804
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,020
I told you.

805
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,820
Why did our ancestors tell you?

806
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,820
This is a bit biased.

807
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,220
Don't be biased.

808
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,620
Is this the point?

809
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,820
The point is that King of Zhao and our ancestors are actually one.

810
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,020
King of Zhao is looking for the future of our ancestors.

811
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,820
Then he has to get us out.

812
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,820
If you want to get us out,

813
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,620
he has to give us some benefits.

814
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:33,620
And King of Zhao thinks that I want to be his brother.

815
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,220
So he is being generous.

816
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,820
What's so strange about that?

817
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,820
Isn't it?

818
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,220
It makes sense.

819
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,620
Ji, I don't think you need to be so nervous.

820
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,220
We can discuss it.

821
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,820
But in the novel,

822
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,420
it's all written like this.

823
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,420
I'll give you 5 million and leave my son.

824
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,820
Do you agree?

825
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,620
Right?

826
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:59,620
Maybe these are the old ways.

827
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,820
It makes sense.

828
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,220
It makes sense.

829
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,020
It's also in the TV series.

830
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,220
If King of Zhao really introduces me to someone,

831
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,620
we really need to think about it.

832
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,220
Yangyang has been here for so long.

833
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,620
He can't just stay at school.

834
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,420
It's stressful to stay in the capital.

835
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,820
But we can consider to retire and raise our children.

836
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,420
Think about it.

837
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:21,420
But we really need to consider to leave the college.

838
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,420
The marriage has been canceled.

839
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:27,020
It's not appropriate to stay like this.

840
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,820
It makes sense.

841
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:06,180
Gosh.

842
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,420
Yeah, that's why you free.

843
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,620
Be money- Click Hit Like

844
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,220
That's all come out.

845
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,720
Okay.

846
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,820
susceptibility

847
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,820
I'm afraid that I can't get rid of the past

848
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,820
I'm afraid that I can't get rid of the past

849
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,820
I'm afraid that I can't get rid of the past

850
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,820
I'm afraid that I can't get rid of the past

851
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,820
I'm afraid that I can't get rid of the past

852
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,820
I'm afraid that I can't get rid of the past

853
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,820
I'm afraid that I can't get rid of the past

854
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,820
I'm afraid that I can't get rid of the past

855
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,820
I'm afraid that I can't get rid of the past

856
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,820
I'm afraid that I can't get rid of the past

857
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,820
I'm afraid that I can't get rid of the past

858
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,820
I'm afraid that I can't get rid of the past

859
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,820
I'm afraid that I can't get rid of the past

860
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,820
I'm afraid that I can't get rid of the past

861
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,820
I can't get rid of the past

862
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,820
I'm afraid I can't get rid of the past

863
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,820
I'm afraid that I can't get rid of the past

864
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,760
I'm afraid that I can't get rid of the past

865
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,760
I am afraid

866
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,760
..
