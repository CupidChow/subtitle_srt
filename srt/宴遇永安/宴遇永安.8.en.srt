1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

43
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

44
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

45
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,460
To be continued...

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Don't forget to eat well

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
If you can't be busy with work, you can buy it every day

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Help me

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Where do you think I learned

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No, I fell down by accident

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No way

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I said how can you swim back by yourself

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm so guilty

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I almost killed myself to save you

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What are you thinking, little lady?

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You can't jump down to save me

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What's wrong with that?

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Besides, there was no one here just now

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
If you want to find the shortcut, I will never save you

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You're not really done, right?

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Take care of yourself before you save someone next time

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Don't worry, my mother calculated for me

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm lucky, I won't be in trouble

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Look, even if I save someone, I also saved a woman like you

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Who will save who?

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If I save you, you can save me next time

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Where's Xiaoyu?

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Xiaoyu, let's go home

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let's go

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Well, my lady, we are just around the corner

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Why don't you go back with me and change your clothes?

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You are all wet and cold

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Okay

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Come on, let's go

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
My lady, we're almost there, right here

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You are from Yunlai?

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
My lady, be gentle

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't let the manager find out

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
My lady, I don't want to bring people in from the front door

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This is a big one, I can come over, you can too

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
My lady, you are too skinny

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This is my smallest dress

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Why are you still wearing such a big one?

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Come on, sit down

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't be shy, sit down

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll pour you a glass of water

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
If you are so skinny, those young men won't like you

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Forget it

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm not going to drink it

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm going to drink it

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm going to drink it

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The young man won't like it

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Forget it, it doesn't matter if they like it or not

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's important to like it

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes, I want you to look good

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What's the use of looking good?

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
My lady, you have to eat more

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
At least when others bully you, you can protect yourself

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
My lady, my mother calls me A Yuan, what's your name?

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Your name is A Yuan?

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
My name is Ji, Ji Cai's sister

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Ji Cai?

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's interesting, how can someone use the name of a vegetable?

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I have an older brother, he's called Gong Cai

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Gong?

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Gong Cai is a dish of dried vegetables

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm an outsider, we call dried vegetables Gong Cai

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Gong Cai is really delicious

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
My lady, your family must all love it

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Our family does food business

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Then you must do better than Yunlai

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
My lady, you are talking about this for the first time

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I am so confident about Yunlai's level

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Do you know? They don't know how to cook

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But they always find something to cook for dinner

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Then they can sell at a very high price

117
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But it's the first time I've heard that Yunlai does business like this

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Forget it, let's not talk about them, they make a lot of money

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
My lady, where are you from? I'm from the capital, we are fine there

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
There are no rules, unlike Yongan, it's too free

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Then why are you here?

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I owe money, so I pressed a fingerprint on the pulse

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Just that one action, I lost my status as Liang Min

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I became a slave and can't go home anymore

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Me too, I can't go home anymore

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
My lady, you too?

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Then you must miss home a lot

128
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yongan's June and July are always very hot, not as hot as ours

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's also very hot in our place, but there are ways to cool down

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
My lady, have you been to the capital?

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I have been there

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Really? We have so much delicious food there

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'll go and have a look

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'll go and have a look

135
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Brother Hu, it's already past 50

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We are really different, have you been to the capital to eat?

137
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You eat, I'm the youngest, I have a young master

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You don't have to worry about me

139
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Eat more, I'll eat my own

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Lan Jun, let's go eat

141
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let them eat first

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We have already started eating

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
In the court, in the palace, we have never been lazy

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Instead, the little ghosts in the capital are very hard to deal with

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
They dare to eat before the young master arrives

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
This is too much of a problem for you

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I am a young man, above them

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's natural not to be willing

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But the five people are all in front of him

150
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
He is not very careful

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Instead, it's those who are more respectful in the ordinary

152
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The more I don't know how many hidden secrets are hidden

153
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's too difficult

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But I see you have a new master

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There should be a right for him

156
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Then you will pinch them, right?

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What's the use of pinching them?

158
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What I want is a blessing

159
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I always feel like a blessing here

160
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
No sense of belonging

161
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Are you hungry?

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
A little bit

163
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
How about I cook for you?

164
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But I have nothing here

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
There are some oil I have been practicing

166
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Ah Yuan, you can eat pork oil?

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You court

168
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I don't like pork

169
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
How can you

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's good to eat when you have no money

171
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What sheep and pigs are my four-legged treasure

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
They always say that pork is cheap

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I don't eat it

174
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What? They are not

175
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
They are noble

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Can they raise their wages?

177
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Ah Yuan, do you have green pepper?

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Green pepper

179
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
This afternoon

180
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The Minister of Works and Department of Works will come to the economic road to repair the land

181
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I wonder who is willing to help the colleagues of the Ministry of Works

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What's going on?

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Who has cooked?

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You are the one who cooked

185
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Cheng Hu

186
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yes, this is Yan

187
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm sorry

188
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I fell a few days ago

189
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
My legs are not smooth

190
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
My waist is not good

191
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I can't do this job

192
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Don't you understand?

193
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You are the master of the family

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What's wrong? I just called

195
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What's wrong?

196
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I am a rough person

197
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Besides

198
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I think the age of the young master is half younger than me

199
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's comfortable to call

200
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't know how to pass

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I don't know how to pass

202
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't know how to pass

203
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't know how to pass

204
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't know how to pass

205
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't know how to pass

206
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yes

207
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yes

208
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Cheng Hu

209
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Do you know what the dream is about me?

210
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
How dare you let me take your life?

211
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You

212
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You are a dream

213
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
As far as I know

214
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The young master is not from the Shi family

215
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Of course not

216
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm just lucky to be an official in the same dynasty as the dream

217
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You are playing me

218
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes

219
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Just play you

220
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
If you think I'm rich with dreams

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But still don't look at me

222
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I will look at you instead

223
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Unfortunately you are not

224
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
This is your share

225
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I know

226
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You look at me young

227
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You suspect that I have no ability

228
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Not willing to follow me

229
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But have you ever thought

230
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Jingzhao mansion is now a hot mountain

231
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Which Shi family is willing to come

232
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Or hard hair

233
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Just leave you

234
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What you want

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Isn't it to make achievements in the capital?

236
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Ok

237
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Then you choose yourself

238
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Or leave now

239
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I will not stop you from giving money

240
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Or just be with me

241
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I will be a good brother to you

242
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I promise

243
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
As long as I have a future

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I will let you make a family business

245
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Everyone is here

246
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Just right

247
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I brought some food for everyone

248
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Grandma

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I tell you

250
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
All are hot

251
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I promise if you eat our food

252
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You will definitely fall in love with it

253
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Come

254
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Help me set it

255
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
This is lamb skewers

256
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
This is big chicken chop

257
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Come

258
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Eat while it's hot

259
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Come

260
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Come hold

261
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Come

262
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Why are you still standing?

263
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Hurry up

264
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Eat while it's hot

265
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Don't be polite

266
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Hurry up

267
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Come

268
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Shaoyin

269
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Look at this situation

270
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You are very angry

271
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
To the stage of being pregnant

272
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That's good

273
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Eat and chat

274
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The atmosphere is better

275
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Everyone

276
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I am Lin Shaoyin's family

277
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
If you are willing

278
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Just call me aunt

279
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You see, you are also very hard in your daily life

280
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Everyone hurry up and eat

281
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Eat while it's hot

282
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Don't be polite

283
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Move chopsticks

284
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Hurry up

285
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Come

286
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Hold it while it's hot

287
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I will pour you some milk tea

288
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Come

289
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Chenghu

290
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You are 30 years old

291
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Your family is poor and you haven't married

292
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I can't guarantee

293
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You will definitely get married

294
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But I can make you a comfortable dish

295
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I have already approved the letter

296
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The month of the Zhao family is increased

297
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The month of the Zhao family is increased

298
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Xu Erlong

299
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Many children don't take it seriously

300
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You are no exception

301
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But at the end of the year

302
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
There is a chance to make a living in the capital

303
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
If you go back

304
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Who dares to be rude to you

305
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Everyone wants

306
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I will do my best to do it for you

307
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What I said today

308
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Heaven and earth are the evidence

309
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You listen

310
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Listen

311
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I dare not say

312
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Lin Shaoyin is good

313
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But he is willing to change his position

314
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
If

315
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Change your position is

316
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
He is willing to stand in your shoes

317
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Think about you from time to time

318
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You have been doing it for many years

319
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I know how rare it is

320
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
As long as you follow Shaoyin

321
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
He will never let you suffer

322
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Okay, hurry up

323
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Everyone hurry up and eat

324
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The food is cold

325
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Hurry up and eat

326
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm not hungry

327
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Why are you looking at me

328
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Eat

329
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Come on, pour some milk tea for you

330
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I can smell it

331
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Shaoyin, haven't you finished eating?

332
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Sit down

333
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Eat together

334
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Sit

335
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Come on, you sit down too

336
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Sit down

337
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Shaoyin

338
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You eat

339
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Big brother

340
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Come and taste this

341
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'll mix it for you

342
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What is this?

343
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
This is called cold skin

344
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Made of rice milk

345
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Made of rice milk

346
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'll try it

347
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Come on, don't move

348
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'll mix it for you

349
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
This must be mixed evenly

350
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Okay, come and taste

351
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Then I'm not welcome

352
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Really delicious

353
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Really delicious

354
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Delicious

355
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You guys come

356
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Come, come, come, come

357
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Everyone taste

358
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I tell you

359
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
If you like to eat

360
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Our cross will open in a few days

361
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You guys go ahead and eat

362
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Okay, okay, okay

363
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Our food is really good

364
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
We are in the light of Shaoyin

365
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Right

366
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Shaoyin's family is really good

367
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
This, this

368
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's done

369
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You can eat it soon

370
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Okay

371
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What is this?

372
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's a rabbit

373
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Gone

374
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'll make it for you again

375
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So fragrant

376
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Okay

377
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Try it quickly

378
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Okay, I'll try it first

379
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Delicious

380
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So simple

381
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Such a common food

382
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
How can it be so delicious?

383
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What is the name of this food?

384
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What name?

385
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I only bought a few kinds of rice

386
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But

387
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Seasoned with green pepper

388
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
To make the taste more fragrant

389
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
This rice is no longer ordinary

390
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I think

391
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
This is the treasure of the poor

392
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
How about

393
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Poor happiness

394
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
How about

395
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You can say

396
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You eat quickly

397
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yuan, your injury is

398
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's okay

399
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's okay

400
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Chunyan

401
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Chunyan, are you inside?

402
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Chunyan

403
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You are so rude

404
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Why are you locking the door?

405
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Wife

406
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I have to go out to work

407
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You can leave after a while

408
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I just have to trouble you

409
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Need to go back on the way

410
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Your name is Chunyan in Yunnan

411
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I don't like this name

412
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Wife, you can call me Yuan

413
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
When my family is here

414
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I always call me that

415
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm sorry

416
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm sorry

417
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You always call me that when you are here

418
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Okay

419
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Wife, I'm almost leaving

420
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You can wear this dress

421
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
We may not meet again in the future

422
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
This dress is not worth it

423
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Don't mind

424
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm leaving

425
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Yuan

426
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Go

427
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Forget it

428
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Why do you care about the other's business?

429
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Come on, young master

430
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The family is going to open for the 14th time

431
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
They are busy cleaning the new shop

432
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Just have time to make such a bowl

433
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I secretly give it to you

434
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Don't give them

435
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Thank you, aunt

436
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Mr. Liu

437
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What's wrong with your throat?

438
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Not comfortable?

439
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
In a few days

440
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'll make some honey water for you

441
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Send it

442
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Honey water

443
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Honey water is the best

444
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Aunt

445
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I have something to discuss with you

446
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Is it important?

447
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
If not

448
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
We'll talk when you get home

449
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm in a hurry to go back to the store

450
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
There are only two people in the store

451
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You say this repair

452
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
They can't fix anything

453
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm busy every day

454
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Just take care of the family

455
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I tell you

456
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
One by one is useless

457
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yes

458
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Actually

459
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Not very tight

460
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
That's fine

461
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
That's fine

462
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Then young master, take your time

463
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'll go first

464
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Wait until you get off work

465
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
No no no

466
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
When you are on duty

467
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Remember to take this box back

468
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
OK

469
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Then I'll go back first

470
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'll send you

471
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
No need, no need, young master

472
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Young master, wait

473
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Hurry up and eat

474
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm leaving

475
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Go, Mr. Liu

476
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Aunt, go slowly

477
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You say this marriage

478
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
How can the husband not open his mouth to Aunt Li?

479
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm not sure

480
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Could it be

481
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
This meal

482
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Bought the husband

483
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Let you have a feeling

484
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I'm not sure if I still want it

485
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Or just do it

486
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Just be sincere

487
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Who let you eat

488
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I will say

489
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Why are you here

490
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I owe the senior

491
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I went to the vending machine

492
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Pressed a handprint

493
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I lost my identity as Liang Min

494
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Become a slave

495
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Can't go home anymore

496
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Aunt

497
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Grandpa and grandma are always fighting over the renovation

498
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What to do

499
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm sorry

500
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm sorry

501
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm sorry

502
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm sorry

503
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm sorry

504
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm sorry

505
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Aunt, why don't you care about me

506
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Aunt

507
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I blame Yang Yang

508
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Young master

509
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Your mother gave me food

510
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'll take it back after I leave

511
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I have

512
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Yang Yang is a shadow

513
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Goddess

514
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Goddess

515
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yang Yang

516
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Take the food box to the kitchen, okay?

517
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Okay

518
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Young master, I have something to say

519
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
What did you say? I didn't hear it clearly

520
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You say first

521
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Dare to ask young master

522
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
If someone signed the vending machine by himself

523
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Become a slave

524
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
How can you recover to Liang Min

525
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm afraid

526
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You have to wait for a special agency

527
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Or he found a official to get married

528
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Husband to change the machine for him

529
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
what happened

530
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You just said

531
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Someone signed the vending machine by himself

532
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Become a slave

533
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Then he is Liang Min's slave

534
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Must go to Liangjing first

535
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
After the growth, the name is clear

536
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Ask your parents about the situation

537
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Make a contribution to the establishment of the vending machine

538
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Only then entered the vending machine

539
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
If only the vending machine is printed

540
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Not counted

541
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Thank you young master

542
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'll go out first

543
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Come back when you have something to say

544
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Young master

545
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Where is my aunt?

546
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Aunt just went out

547
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
But my grandmother said

548
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Aunt is unhappy

549
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Let me watch her

550
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Don't let her run around

551
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Why is your aunt unhappy?

552
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Because of you

553
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I

554
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Aunt said

555
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Young master is her last hope

556
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Not now

557
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I saw her crying several times

558
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Last hope

559
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
But before

560
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Your aunt doesn't seem to want to marry me

561
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Yang Yang

562
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Your aunt

563
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Did you guess that I was going to get married?

564
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Young master is going to get married

565
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
But

566
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It should be okay

567
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
My aunt is not the first time to be married

568
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Don't you always say

569
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
One time to give birth, two times to be familiar?

570
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Do you know what is a marriage?

571
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Of course I know

572
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Why ask a child

573
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You bitch

574
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Bitch

575
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Hide

576
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Hide, I see you dare to hide

577
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You bitch

578
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You dare to hide

579
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I'll kick your face

580
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Bitch

581
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'll beat you to death

582
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I'll beat you to death

583
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
You bitch

584
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I'll beat you to death

585
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You bitch

586
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I tell you

587
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I tell you

588
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm your fan

589
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You dare to resist

590
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I tell you

591
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Your family is dead

592
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
No one can support you, do you know?

593
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Besides

594
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Your selling spirit is with me

595
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'll beat you to death

596
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I should beat you to death

597
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I should beat you to death

598
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You bitch

599
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
You bitch

600
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'll give you two

601
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Remember my strength

602
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Manager Teng

603
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Give you

604
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Why are you so angry?

605
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Don't hurt your body

606
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Mrs. Shen

607
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
What's the matter?

608
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
The lady in your family lent me a suit

609
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I came to return it

610
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I saw it by chance

611
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
She made you unhappy

612
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
That child is not sensible

613
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Can't you just use the stick to teach

614
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
If you don't like it, just sell it

615
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Change some money

616
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Or I'll take it

617
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Teach her rules for Manager Feng

618
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I said this bitch

619
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Why is the ladder hard recently?

620
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It turns out that I met Mrs. Shen

621
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I thought I had a backer

622
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Manager Feng, what are you talking about?

623
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
In front of you

624
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm not a backer

625
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Then she is hard

626
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
That is to know Manager Feng

627
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Men are beggars

628
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
The sky is clear

629
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Not like her

630
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
A little girl

631
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
She made Manager Feng so unhappy

632
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
What else do you do?

633
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I heard the neighbors say

634
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
You usually have everything

635
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I usually like to calculate everything

636
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You believe in the magic of the temple

637
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
How can you pick her?

638
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
To be honest with Manager Feng

639
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I know a little face

640
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Her sharp nose

641
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Fugong line

642
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
In the chest

643
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
That is proper

644
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Clothes

645
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Mrs. Shen

646
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Let me tell you this

647
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
This bitch

648
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Her pulse is in our original

649
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
So people can't leave

650
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I have to give her rules

651
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It's not convenient for you to see a woman

652
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Or just think about it

653
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
That's not what I said, Manager Feng

654
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
People have to believe in evil

655
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Enough, don't say it anymore

656
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Spring banquet is a piece of goods I bought

657
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I decide the life and death trade

658
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Who can she be treated by me?

659
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
As long as I am her master for a day

660
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
She can't treat me at all

661
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Your family is going to have a temple in Ju Xianxiang

662
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I advise you

663
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Better take care of your own business

664
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Don't stick to others

665
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Please go back

666
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Please go back, Mrs. Shen

667
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You bitch

668
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You dare to pull others

669
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Mrs. Shen

670
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
You don't have any relationship with this bitch, do you?

671
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
So today you came to me to say this

672
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You are so annoying

673
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
See you later

674
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
This is Yongan

675
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
People can be treated as goods and sales

676
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Who can I protect?

677
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You bitch

678
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You dare to pull Mrs. Shen

679
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Mrs. Shen

680
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You want to get back at me, don't you?

681
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
But you don't want to live

682
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Come here

683
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I will beat you to death

684
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Bitch

685
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Stop

686
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Get up

687
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Manager Feng, I tell you

688
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I have more than just a relationship with this bitch

689
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
We are friends

690
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
She told me that she only signed a prostitution and became a slave

691
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
She is a good person

692
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
She wants to sell herself as a slave

693
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
She needs to go to the capital first

694
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
After that, she will ask her parents about the situation

695
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
She has to make a contribution

696
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
She is a whore

697
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
She is a whore

698
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
She is a whore

699
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
What are you talking about?

700
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
What? You dare not admit it

701
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Then get the prostitution and sell yourself

702
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You

703
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You dare not

704
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Because you know

705
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You are forced to pay the price if you don't go through the complete procedure

706
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Manager Feng

707
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You are too bold to do this

708
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I thought you were going to break the rules and expand the store

709
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I didn't expect you to do illegal business and sell the goods

710
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
You are talking nonsense

711
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I will tear your mouth

712
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Then you hurt a good person again

713
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You are the best

714
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Bring out Yuan's prostitution

715
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Come

716
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Close the door

717
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I will see if you two can leave today

718
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
The person in charge of Jinzhao is here

719
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Keep an eye on them

720
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Yes

721
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Young master

722
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Brother

723
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Didn't you say that if I have any difficulties, I can ask you for help?

724
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I want to go to the Yulai Jiu Temple

725
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
If I haven't come back, you can take more people there

726
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
You catch them and expand the store

727
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You will definitely catch a criminal if you do a surprise check

728
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It's also a new official to add a more attack

729
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Don't be afraid

730
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Manager Feng

731
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
The appearance of your Yulai Jiu Temple expansion does not meet the rules of the two departments

732
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It turns out that the Lord Cheng is here

733
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Lord Cheng, why are you so stubborn?

734
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Look, it's been so many years

735
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Nothing happened

736
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
What are you doing?

737
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
What are you doing?

738
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Besides

739
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Who said nothing happened?

740
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
The school was on fire in April

741
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
If it wasn't for your family's mess, it would have been so late

742
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
How could it be so burning?

743
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Nonsense

744
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
The people in the study are here

745
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Come here

746
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Come here

747
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You

748
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Tell the Lord

749
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Is there such a thing?

750
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Tell me the truth

751
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Say it

752
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
No

753
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
If the Lord doesn't believe it, you can ask others

754
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You

755
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
You

756
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You all say it

757
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Tell the Lord

758
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Is there such a thing?

759
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
No

760
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I don't know

761
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I don't know

762
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Really?

763
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Young Master

764
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Young Master

765
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Young Master

766
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You came just in time

767
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Your people

768
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Pan Yao said that because of our Yulai's source

769
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
The study next door was on fire

770
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Lord Yuan, Young Master

771
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You must help me

772
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Jin Wuwei's report

773
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
The fire in April caused the Yulai Jiu Temple to block the back alley

774
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
The three people were burned by the fire

775
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
The three people knew it all

776
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
They heard you deny it

777
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Will they come back from hell to kill them?

778
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
No

779
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
This

780
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Manager Feng believed in ghosts

781
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Aren't you afraid?

782
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
This

783
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Impossible

784
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
It seems that the thing is blocked

785
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
There is no dead person

786
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Only him

787
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
He didn't come to the Jintang

788
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Then he just burned his arm

789
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Isn't that admitting?

790
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Must be a war

791
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
You

792
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So boring

793
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You

794
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Young Master

795
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Do you know who is behind our master?

796
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I advise you to be good

797
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Who is behind your master?

798
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Is Manager Feng

799
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Want to raise the relationship behind your master

800
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Is it a way of teaching the dead?

801
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I

802
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I understand

803
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
The study in April was on fire

804
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Could it be that your Yulai Jiu Temple

805
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Also by this method

806
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Cover the matter

807
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Right?

808
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
There is someone behind

809
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
No wonder everyone dare not point to you

810
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Young Master, open

811
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Start

812
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Yes

813
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
No

814
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
That

815
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
You

816
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You

817
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Let go

818
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Young Master

819
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Don't move

820
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Stop

821
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Stop

822
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Stop

823
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
You

824
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
You

825
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Get out

826
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And you

827
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
You get out

828
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
How dare you

829
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Don't you know the master?

830
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Dare to do it

831
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Get out

832
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Get out

833
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Young Master

834
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
No

835
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Really no

836
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Today is

837
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It's this

838
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,120
The lady who is in the

839
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,000
She wants to take away my servant

840
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
So I will leave it for now

841
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
You bullied her

842
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I

843
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I dare not bully the lady

844
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
She bullied you

845
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Young Master

846
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Young Master

847
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I didn't take her away

848
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
It's Feng who cheated the people

849
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
What are you talking about

850
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Say it

851
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
A Yuan's wife was a good person

852
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
She was cheated by Feng

853
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Only put a handprint on the vending machine

854
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
She didn't go to the city

855
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Right, A Yuan

856
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Go to the city

857
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I didn't go

858
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Young Master, look

859
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
A Yuan didn't go to the city

860
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Then she is a good person

861
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Feng can't kill her

862
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Feng

863
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Is what they say true?

864
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
This

865
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
This

866
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Vending machine

867
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I count three times

868
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Three

869
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Two

870
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Good good

871
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Buying food is a sword

872
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It's not easy to get a point

873
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
The process is complicated

874
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You are afraid of trouble

875
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And you are sure that the lady is simple

876
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
She just wants to be a servant forever

877
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Manager Feng

878
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Do you know what you have done?

879
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I'm afraid now

880
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It's not to destroy this fake vending machine

881
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Can talk to her

882
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You mean

883
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
This vending machine is fake

884
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
This is not counted

885
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
The lady was for no reason

886
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Can sue her surname Feng

887
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Feng Li

888
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I just arrived at Yuan'an and didn't have money to eat

889
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
You said you were kind enough to buy me a cake

890
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
The cake cost one or two jin

891
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I don't have money to pay you

892
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
You lied to me to hold this vending machine

893
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I didn't expect this vending machine to be fake

894
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Feng Li

895
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I tell you Feng Li

896
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Feng Li

897
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Feng Li

898
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
How can you be so high

899
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
You spit it out, you pay me

900
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Spit it out, you pay me

901
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Enough enough

902
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Enough

903
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Is it really delicious?

904
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Then I will burn more paper money for you

905
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Let you eat enough

906
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yuan, you are free

907
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Let's go

908
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You

909
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
You dare to stop the person I let go

910
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Let's go

911
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Go

912
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Go

913
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Go

914
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Go

915
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Go

916
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Go

917
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Go
