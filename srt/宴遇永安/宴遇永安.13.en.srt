1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:38,000
violet

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Do you have any advice?

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Your Majesty,

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I have discussed with the Imperial Guards

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
to let people travel at night.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Your Majesty,

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Lin Shaoyin is not only a tourist.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
After he enters the night,

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
there are still merchants in the city.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What is the purpose of the Jingzhao Mansion?

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
After the tomb, it is forbidden to travel.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
After the morning, it is allowed to travel.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But in the mid-autumn,

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
people from the city of Shishu are going to enjoy the moon.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No one is knocking on the tomb.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
People do not know that they have arrived at night.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Do you want to blame them?

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Lin Anran,

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
in the mid-autumn,

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
it was you who

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
released the two Jin people from the city of Shishu to return home.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This made the tomb not open.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
In the mid-autumn,

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
people return home to reunite.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Shouldn't it be?

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You are leading the way to violate the night ban.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You are a traitor.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What is your intention?

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's all because of a certain person.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No one caught the thief.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But the common people who break the ban

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
are increasing day by day.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What do you mean?

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Isn't this the duty of the Jingzhao Mansion?

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Why do people break the ban on the night ban?

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The saint is under the rule of the sea,

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
the river is clear,

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
the bandits are few.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But the king said that

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
the 14 Jin people were not noticed.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The merchants and guests will return home at night.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Eventually, the ghost will come to life.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
If it is forbidden,

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
people are reluctant to come back.

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But if you let go,

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
you will be more famous.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is the first time I've heard that

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
the ghost is only in the night ban.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Have you checked the Ministry of Revenue?

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Your Majesty, I...

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Your Majesty,

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
these are the new things

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
that Minister Zhang discussed in the Jingzhao Mansion.

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's better to read the book

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and let go of the ban.

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It will be more efficient.

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let go of the ban in secret.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I...

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I know that the Ministry of Revenue will be guarded.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But if the time is not right,

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
the country will not be in a good shape.

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Let go of the ban.

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's not a big deal.

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The Ministry of Revenue

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I've given up.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The punishment from Heaven is finally over.

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I should forget about all these.

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You are usually quiet

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
when you talk about things that others don't understand.

98
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But when it comes to some wrong words,

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
you should be more cautious.

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Drink the medicine.

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If you feel unwell,

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
call someone.

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
My ancestors said they don't remember.

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But why is he so gentle lately?

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Where are you going?

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You scared me.

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Don't blame me for not following you.

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I was just a beggar at the jade market.

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
No one told me to impeach you.

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I was worried about you.

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I was worried that you would be punished.

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But I didn't expect you to be so cold-hearted

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and play with them.

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Wait.

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Did you expect this?

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So you are just following the trend.

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You are so smart.

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I wish I could be as smart as you.

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay.

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll leave now.

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Please wait, Mr. Lin.

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Mr. Cao.

123
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The band you added is in a bad shape.

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Could you please add some more?

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Please.

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I wish you a long life.

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I wish you a long life.

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I wish you a long life.

129
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I wish you a long life.

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Young Master.

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
My father, Yongan Ren Zhi,

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
used to live in a rich family.

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This is a gift from Liang You Fu.

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
There are a few of them.

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Mei Cheng Xia.

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I saw it again

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
in the manual you gave me.

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The manual

139
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
also contains my last name.

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The manual is connected.

141
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's just a common thing.

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The wine and the silk are poisoned.

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The Qing Zhao family is trying to avoid the Shen family.

144
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We can find the Da Li Temple.

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Why did you send the Ministry of Justice?

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,500
Cao Rong is just a

147
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,000
man of the family.

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He must have connections with the court.

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I want to see if he's a man of the family.

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
He used to be friends with Lang.

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He wants to have a fight with him.

152
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Something happened to the Cui family.

153
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He didn't even look at the camera.

154
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Is it dangerous?

155
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I didn't find out

156
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
that someone was speaking for the Cui family.

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But I tried to read the manual.

158
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The Cui family's name is Cao Rong.

159
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's been five years since it was written.

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I guess he was punished

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
because he spoke for A Yan.

162
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Please forgive me.

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The appearance of Lin Shao Ying

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
is similar to my old friend's wife.

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
My old friend is Cui Rang Zhi from Qingyang.

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Her wife is Lu Shishanniang from Xiuzhou.

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Did you know about it?

168
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The Cui family from Qingyang?

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
They were the criminals of the Yu Guan case 17 years ago.

170
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Cao Rong, you have a connection with them?

171
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
17 years ago,

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Shao Ying was just a child.

173
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
How could he know about the Yu Guan case?

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Cui family was the King of Jingzhao.

175
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But they were the criminals.

176
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I am the King of Jingzhao.

177
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I know about the case of the case of Tiezheng Rushan.

178
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What's the secret?

179
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What the hell is Rushan?

180
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Rang Zhi would never do such a thing.

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The case didn't get back together in the Court of Justice.

182
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Rang Zhi was killed in prison.

183
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
There must be a reason for it.

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
If that's the case,

185
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
why didn't you tell Cui family about it?

186
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You mentioned Mao's pain.

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Mao was just a teacher in the province.

188
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
No one wanted to listen to him.

189
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I kept on reading.

190
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But I was rejected.

191
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I lost 7 li of my assets.

192
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't care about the Gu family.

193
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I spent 7 years in the capital.

194
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I tried to get into the Ministry of Justice.

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Now I am here.

196
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I want to wait for the right time.

197
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
One day,

198
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I will get rid of the wrongdoings of the Rang Zhi family.

199
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I am sorry.

200
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It seems that you really have a good relationship with Cui Ning.

201
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
If you have a new policy,

202
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
you can make Cui Ning happy.

203
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But you have to put your life at stake.

204
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What will you do?

205
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I will risk my life to...

206
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
If you ask me like this,

207
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
you must be related to the Cui family.

208
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Do you have any new evidence?

209
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What will you do?

210
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Come with me to see His Majesty.

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Minister Cao, calm down.

212
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You just need to clarify with me in front of His Majesty

213
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I am not Lu Shi Lang.

214
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He is the new minister.

215
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
His Majesty will not ignore me.

216
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Minister Cao.

217
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Calm down.

218
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I have nothing to calm down.

219
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I have been working for the Cui family for 17 years.

220
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Minister Cao, no.

221
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Minister Cao.

222
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Nothing is impossible.

223
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Hold me.

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Lu Shi Lang.

225
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
A Lang, I found a pen.

226
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Cui Che, I am here to see you.

227
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Ah Che.

228
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You are really Ah Che.

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I didn't expect

230
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I could see my old friend's son

231
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
in my lifetime.

232
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Sit.

233
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Sit.

234
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I have tried many things.

235
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Please forgive me.

236
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's okay.

237
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's good to be careful.

238
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Kid,

239
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I am sorry.

240
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I am sorry.

241
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Kid, you have suffered a lot these years.

242
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
How did you survive?

243
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I was saved by King Zhao when I was a child.

244
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
King Zhao?

245
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Why did he do that?

246
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
King Zhao had a relationship with Ah Ye.

247
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He knew Ah Ye.

248
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
When the official was sent to the case,

249
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
he sent someone to find me.

250
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
At that time, King Zhao's eldest son Li Sheng

251
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
was appointed as the heir, but died of illness.

252
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I had a few filial piety to Li Sheng.

253
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I could not meet King Zhao.

254
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
When I met King Zhao, he adopted me.

255
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's all thanks to King Zhao.

256
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
If I had saved you,

257
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I would not have given you a casual life.

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Uncle, don't say that.

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
After the case,

260
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
the Cui family in the capital was closed down.

261
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It was removed.

262
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I went to Qingyang.

263
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But the old house of the Cui family was also taken as a flat.

264
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I really thought you...

265
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Okay.

266
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You have grown up.

267
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Originally, I didn't want to disturb you.

268
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But now, I have no evidence.

269
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I really need your guidance on the future.

270
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Kid.

271
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I only knew the origin and the end

272
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
after I met King Zhao.

273
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But the case of Yu Guan,

274
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
involved 16 soldiers and soldiers.

275
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It seems that the foundation was affected.

276
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That's why it was closed down.

277
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The evidence in the case is only against your father.

278
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It can't be refuted.

279
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I have seen these in the files.

280
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
This person claims that he was not able to buy a coffin for my father.

281
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
He was also killed.

282
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I can only protect myself.

283
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The evidence in his hand is very familiar.

284
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
My father was immediately taken to the prison.

285
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Then he committed suicide.

286
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Everyone says he died of guilt.

287
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That little Li also died in the water.

288
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Even Xiao Wu Lang, who was in charge of this case,

289
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
was also in a coma because of horse riding.

290
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Xiao Wu Lang?

291
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
The prince consort of the Princess of Fu Hui?

292
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yes.

293
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The files of that year

294
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
were all erased.

295
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I also asked around

296
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and finally decided it was him.

297
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Lang Jun.

298
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
A secret letter from King Zhao.

299
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
The Prince of Fu Hui

300
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The Prince of Fu Hui asked me to visit

301
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
the soldiers in the capital.

302
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Lang Jun wanted to enter the capital.

303
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The Prince of Fu Hui was so anxious

304
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
that he couldn't find a man to help him.

305
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
How come he knew someone in the capital

306
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
in just a few days?

307
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
He even found out that the army was in a coma.

308
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The Prince of Fu Hui

309
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Minister Cao said

310
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
the one who was in charge of the case

311
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
was the Prince Consort of the Princess.

312
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The one who was in a coma for many years?

313
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yes.

314
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Since I was able to find out,

315
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
it's not a secret.

316
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
At the age of the Prince,

317
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
it's more likely that he was involved in the case.

318
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Although he didn't know I was going to investigate the case,

319
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
why didn't he mention Xiao Wu Lang?

320
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I think...

321
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I think...

322
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I can't think of anything.

323
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I didn't ask you.

324
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
By the way,

325
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
the Princess of the Princess is very fond of the Shen family.

326
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Please give them another meal.

327
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'll send it to the Princess

328
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and ask the Prince of Fu Hui.

329
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Have you recovered?

330
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm fine.

331
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm feeling like a cow.

332
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What is it that you want to see me about?

333
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's a bit awkward.

334
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The Jinzhao family didn't send the Princess a band.

335
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Now that it's the Mid-Autumn Festival,

336
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
we have to go out again.

337
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's a bit...

338
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You set up so many bands in my restaurant.

339
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Why didn't you send one to the Princess?

340
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You must have forgotten.

341
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm sorry.

342
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I was wondering

343
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
why the Princess sent so many bandages to the Cloud Water House.

344
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's either a poem or a painting.

345
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's all about dating.

346
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The Princess has a lot of friends.

347
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
If you send a band to her,

348
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
maybe she wants to eat...

349
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The pot is on fire.

350
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Well,

351
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'll make a salty ham band for you.

352
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You said that the ham sauce takes time,

353
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
so you sent it late.

354
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
The Princess is so unruly.

355
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
She must like the salty ham band more.

356
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Although it's Mid-Autumn Festival,

357
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
you should show enough respect.

358
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Thank you.

359
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You're so talented.

360
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Maybe you can be a good judge.

361
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I thought you were praising me.

362
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
This is a special ham band for the 7th and 8th Jin Dynasty.

363
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's made up after the marriage.

364
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
After the marriage,

365
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
it's baked for a month.

366
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Then it's cleaned,

367
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
baked,

368
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
fermented,

369
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and stacked.

370
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
This is a simple version.

371
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's more important to make it in the first year of the year.

372
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's only good in the summer.

373
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's better to eat it for two or three years.

374
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Give me one.

375
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Why is this ham so delicious?

376
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's better than fresh meat.

377
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's so delicious.

378
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
How delicious are those two or three years old ham?

379
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Of course.

380
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
After marinating the ham,

381
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
it has a sense of the after-mortar.

382
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's not as fresh as fresh meat.

383
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
After-mortar?

384
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What does it mean?

385
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Fresh meat is like a young man.

386
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's tender, but it's too straight.

387
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It lacks some flexibility.

388
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's easy to be covered by seasoning

389
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
and other flavors when cooking with fresh meat.

390
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But the old ham

391
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
is like a mature man.

392
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's been marinated in the market.

393
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
When cooking with it,

394
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
it only covers its flavor with other flavors.

395
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It won't affect the taste at all.

396
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
But I think

397
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
the ham is getting older and more flavorful.

398
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
But the old man

399
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
doesn't necessarily have a better quality

400
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
when he's older.

401
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Of course.

402
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Look at my brother.

403
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
He's old enough.

404
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
He's not mature at all.

405
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Let's go to Su Shui City.

406
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But I think

407
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Young Master Lin is different.

408
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
He's young,

409
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
but he's experienced.

410
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Young Master Lin, what's wrong?

411
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
He's right.

412
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Our young master has experienced

413
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
and experienced.

414
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But he's not good at drinking.

415
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But he's still good at drinking.

416
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Is it a good thing that he's not good at drinking?

417
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Hurry up and eat.

418
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm eating.

419
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's delicious.

420
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
But they...

421
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The Lady of the Deceased is talking nonsense.

422
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The old man is not good at drinking.

423
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Besides, how does she know?

424
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Does she know or not?

425
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But what she said is right.

426
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Our old man has experienced and experienced.

427
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But he just agreed to marry us.

428
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Now he's praising you so much.

429
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Is he regretting and wanting to marry again?

430
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
He doesn't like me at all.

431
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
That's good.

432
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You can't be a fool.

433
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But why do I feel that

434
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
you're talking like a ghost?

435
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Stop talking nonsense.

436
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Send the letter.

437
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Old man,

438
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
did you mention the letter

439
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
to Su Shui City?

440
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
No.

441
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
His Highness is a benefactor,

442
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
but he's a prince.

443
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I used to think that

444
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
His Highness had a heart of gold.

445
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But now,

446
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm a little confused.

447
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Just use these wooden boards and leather materials

448
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
to make a box bag.

449
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It can be used daily.

450
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
What good things do you have in your house?

451
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You have to be very smart.

452
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You're so smart.

453
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'll listen to you.

454
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What about you?

455
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You admire me so much.

456
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Why don't you make more gold bricks for me?

457
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm going to make a deal.

458
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Here's the money.

459
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm just kidding.

460
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I owe you so much.

461
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I don't have the nerve to ask you for money.

462
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That's good.

463
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Actually, I have a question

464
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
for you.

465
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Okay, go ahead.

466
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I've seen the most harmonious

467
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
in the Shen family.

468
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Even if there's a real wind,

469
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
they care about each other the most.

470
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I wonder if you

471
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
have ever

472
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
lied to your family?

473
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
That's too much.

474
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yangyang would steal candy.

475
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
When the grandparents were around,

476
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
the grandparents would steal private money.

477
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
He gave me half of it.

478
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I helped him to trick my grandmother.

479
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And my brother.

480
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
He's been lying to his family more.

481
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
He even divorced

482
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
his ex-wife.

483
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
He kept the secret from his family

484
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
about the divorce.

485
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
But later,

486
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
you all knew about it.

487
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
We wanted to pretend not to know.

488
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
We lied to Yangyang

489
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
that his mother had gone away.

490
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But one day,

491
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yangyang came back and said

492
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
he knew that his aunt and mother had left.

493
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I also knew one thing

494
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
that no one in the family knew.

495
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
My sister-in-law has a new lover.

496
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
She has a lot of assets.

497
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
So my brother is not as good as before.

498
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
He didn't even have the courage to move out.

499
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
He moved out with her.

500
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
He drank too much and told me.

501
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I didn't dare to tell my parents.

502
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Otherwise, he would get beaten up again.

503
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You must have something on your mind.

504
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
That's why you asked me

505
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
if I had lied to my family.

506
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
If you want to say it,

507
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm just being impulsive.

508
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
If you don't want to say it,

509
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm still being impulsive.

510
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I have a very trusted elder.

511
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
But I suddenly realized

512
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
that he seemed to have something to hide from me.

513
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And I also have a lot of things to hide from him.

514
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I don't know why the elder did this.

515
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
But I know that the young master is very good.

516
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You won't hurt others.

517
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You must have your reasons for lying.

518
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Or a good lie.

519
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
A lie has a good intention?

520
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
If it's you,

521
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
sometimes lying is also a good intention.

522
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You told me that

523
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
you don't judge yourself before you hurt others.

524
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm sorry.

525
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
It's almost done.

526
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
How is it?

527
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It's done.

528
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You are so considerate.

529
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You made such a bag.

530
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Young Master,

531
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
look at this for me.

532
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Is this for carrying?

533
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Does it look good?

534
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It's really good.

535
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It's really a good intention.

536
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
This orchestra is also made by the hand of Lady Shen, right?

537
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Yes.

538
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I've heard that the 14th Shen family is doing this.

539
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
The filling is pork?

540
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Why don't you eat it?

541
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's also salty, fresh and fragrant.

542
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
This is specially marinated by Lady Shen.

543
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm very happy about this young lady.

544
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I don't know what kind of man will be able to match her in the future.

545
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But don't be like me.

546
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
In the end,

547
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I feel lonely.

548
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You said you were lonely.

549
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I have something to ask you.

550
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm afraid that I'll touch your sad feelings.

551
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Do you want to ask about the Prince Consort?

552
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Are you curious about me?

553
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I don't have any chance.

554
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I don't have any feelings for that Xiao family.

555
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
If my father wants me to marry,

556
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
then I'll marry.

557
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
After the marriage,

558
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
he plays his own game.

559
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I live my own life.

560
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I don't know how that person is.

561
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
A person who is not good at riding a horse,

562
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
must ride a horse.

563
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
The horse just put it down the cliff.

564
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It never woke up.

565
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I'll just live my own life.

566
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
The Prince Consort is not good at riding a horse,

567
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
but he insisted on riding a horse.

568
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
The horse just put it down the cliff.

569
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Yes.

570
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Everyone outside is the horse I trained.

571
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I made the Prince Consort not to ride a horse.

572
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
If you want to kill someone,

573
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
you will have to ride a horse.

574
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
If you want to train a horse,

575
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
it's only because you want to be the owner of that horse.

576
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's not because of some conspiracy.

577
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Even my mother's brother,

578
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
and the current courtier,

579
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
have doubted me

580
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and doubted me.

581
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I didn't expect that you know me

582
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
so well in this capital.

583
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Today,

584
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
the gifts I received

585
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
are all for the next year's military service.

586
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm not sure if I can hold it in.

587
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But I like you.

588
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So I'll tell you.

589
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Thank you for your advice.

590
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
The former military secretary was chosen by the Sixth Prince.

591
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I don't like both of them.

592
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Now,

593
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I don't have to see them for a long time.

594
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Although I haven't given them the imperial edict,

595
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
if you want to get the gift,

596
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
the wife of the He Dong Jie Du Shi and the Wang family

597
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
are all in Yong An for the next year's military service.

598
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
The Sixth Prince?

599
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Prince Zhao?

600
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
He has been in contact with the court.

601
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
He even recommended Bu Yuan.

602
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
These are all gifts from the Senior Princess.

603
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
She also said that

604
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
when she sees these jade,

605
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
everyone will be relieved.

606
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Then she can freely enter the Senior Princess's mansion.

607
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Thank you for your kindness.

608
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I'll go back to my mansion.

609
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Mister, please forgive us.

610
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
These are all orders from the Crown Prince.

611
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Please get in the carriage.

612
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
You are a young man.

613
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
You are so young.

614
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You are really a young man.

615
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
You are a man of justice,

616
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
you are handsome,

617
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
and you are very elegant.

618
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
These are the most popular things of the Senior Princess.

619
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You have been asking me for a favor.

620
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You are very interested in me.

621
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
If you want to be my wife,

622
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
you can be my wife.

623
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Young Master.

624
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Young Master.

625
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Please think about it.

626
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
After all, that is what the Senior Princess means.

627
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
With the support of the Crown Prince,

628
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
the character of the young master

629
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
is not ugly.

630
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You are exaggerating.

631
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Young Master, please take care.

632
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Grandfather,

633
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
why do I hear

634
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
what they say?

635
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I don't understand.

636
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Why can't I understand what they say?

637
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Go back to the restaurant.

638
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
We have to talk about something important.

639
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
What is it?

640
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Hurry up.

641
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Senior Princess, please don't go.

642
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Please don't go.

643
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Please don't go.

644
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
We are running out of time.

645
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Senior Princess, please don't go.

646
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Please don't go.

647
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Are women in ancient times

648
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
so crazy?

649
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Yuan'er, come out.

650
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
What should we do?

651
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
This is too crazy.

652
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
After the meeting,

653
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
the Senior Princess said

654
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
that someone really collected what I said

655
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
and made it into a trailer.

656
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And recently, many bookshelves

657
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
have used this technique of hand-painting.

658
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Unlike this manual hand-painting,

659
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
it is very fast.

660
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And,

661
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
my personal image

662
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
is not bad,

663
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
right?

664
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
These women

665
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
are really picky.

666
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
But you have to persuade them.

667
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Don't just stand by the door.

668
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
It will affect our business.

669
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
What do you mean by picky?

670
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
What we lack now is the knowledge of aesthetic.

671
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
They all have their own taste.

672
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Don't worry.

673
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I will manage my Communist Party.

674
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Communist Party?

675
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I have to warn you, Miss Shen.

676
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
These women like your image after you pack it.

677
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Not your real image.

678
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You can't just say anything to them

679
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
just because of this.

680
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Do you hear me?

681
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
We will never allow you to cheat on your feelings.

682
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Am I that kind of person?

683
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Am I that kind of person?

684
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
No, Mom.

685
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I can be like those celebrities.

686
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Besides,

687
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I said those words out of my heart.

688
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Don't worry, Mom.

689
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I will keep my distance from my fans.

690
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I belong to everyone.

691
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I can't be alone in a war.

692
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
You should quit.

693
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
You don't look like an idol.

694
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
But you are carrying your idol's bag.

695
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I thought you were a little more popular.

696
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I didn't expect you to be so vulgar.

697
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
What do you mean?

698
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
You are all here.

699
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Something big happened.

700
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
You dare not to...

701
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Why are there so many people in front of us?

702
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Why is the door still closed?

703
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
They are not doing business anymore.

704
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
They are just trying to read Shen Gong Cai's fans.

705
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
They are all his fans.

706
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Are they not mine?

707
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Dad, you are right.

708
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Yes, yes.

709
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Yang Yang and I saw it with our own eyes.

710
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
The people in Princess Royal's mansion

711
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
have sent Young Master Lin to the mansion.

712
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
They said that

713
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Princess Royal has taken care of Young Master Lin.

714
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
What?

715
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Grandpa, what do you mean by that?

716
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Let's go to the meeting.

717
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Let's go.

718
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Okay, let's go.

719
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Let's talk.

720
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Family, I want to say something.

721
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Actually, I think

722
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
this is not necessarily a bad thing.

723
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Think about it.

724
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
If the ancestors really followed Princess Royal,

725
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
then her status and status

726
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
would have gone up.

727
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Then we would be the descendants of Princess Royal.

728
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
That would be considered as her hiding her descendants.

729
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Gong Cai, are you crazy?

730
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I am not crazy.

731
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I am just a little bit crazy.

732
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Gong Cai,

733
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
are you crazy?

734
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
What's wrong?

735
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
We are the descendants of the ancestors.

736
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
If Princess Royal is with the ancestors,

737
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
then she will be with the ancestors.

738
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
If she is not with the ancestors,

739
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
then the past will change.

740
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
The future will change too.

741
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Then we will be with the ancestors.

742
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Right, right, right.

743
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
You forgot about this?

744
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
That's not good.

745
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Then they can't be together.

746
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
If they are together, then we are all gone.

747
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
The point is, if I am gone,

748
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
what about my family?

749
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Poor me.

750
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
You are brainwashed by your Gong Cai.

751
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
No, he is indeed like that.

752
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
But according to the theory in the science fiction,

753
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
history can't be changed.

754
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Since we already exist in the future,

755
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
then it means that the ancestors will meet

756
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
another ancestors, Shen Niangzi, and marry her.

757
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Ji,

758
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
she is the eldest princess after all.

759
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Her status is here.

760
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Moreover, she doesn't ask her to be her father.

761
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
She doesn't limit her development.

762
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
So many benefits.

763
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I tell you,

764
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
it's hard to say.

765
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
The ancestors are not like that.

766
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
But what if the eldest princess marries Hao Duo?

767
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Use the strong one.

768
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Family,

769
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I think it's time to die.

770
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Everything that happens now

771
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
may affect the future.

772
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
First, we must put aside the internal conflict.

773
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Second, we must stop the ancestors from marrying the eldest princess.

774
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Third, we must stop the ancestors from going to more happy places.

775
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
It makes sense.

776
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
The rain is falling, the rain is falling

777
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
The wind is swaying, the clouds are swaying

778
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Listen, once you want to understand, you have to wake up

779
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
True love or only memories

780
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
You are the dream, you are the clear sky

781
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
The moon is falling, the moon is falling

782
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
The words are changing, the heart is not self-evident

783
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Can we meet each other in the road?

784
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I thought the cold was gone

785
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
But the eyes are red and cold

786
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Even the ice is frozen

787
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It's my heart that is not hot

788
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
You are the sound, you are the logic

789
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I need to put you in my life

790
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I can't stop my heart from beating

791
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
It's a long journey, how can I give up?

792
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
When I run towards you, my mind is confused

793
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I'm addicted to you, I'm still her family

794
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
My heart is moving, the wind blows away the latest meaning

795
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
It's a hidden secret that I've been hiding

796
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I've been thinking about you all my life

797
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Love is a holiday, the wandering heart will come back to isolate

798
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It's unreachable, it's getting closer

799
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Let life change, only we

800
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Don't say no, maybe it's just love

801
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Willing to love forever

802
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Will not give us the same feeling

803
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I've been thinking about you all my life

804
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Love is a holiday, the wandering heart will come back to isolate

805
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
It's unreachable, it's getting closer

806
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Let life change, only we

807
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Don't say no, maybe it's just love

808
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Thanks for watching!
