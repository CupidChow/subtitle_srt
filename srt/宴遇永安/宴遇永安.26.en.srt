00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
THE GENERATION

00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,780
END OF EPISODE ONE

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,620
Russian dub 60

4
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:53,400
Even we found some

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm looking for Fengning Town.

6
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Why did you come to Yongan?

7
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
There are many opportunities to see it.

8
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Fengning Town is not easy to find.

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I see.

10
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You can't go there.

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let's go.

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Where are we going?

13
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Ju Xianxiang.

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why do you have to go to Ju Xianxiang?

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You are not easy to find in other places.

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Recently, the Ju Xianxiang family is taking over the job.

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
They are very few.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You can go to Mao Cui's shop.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I want to ask you.

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Is Shen's surname Shen?

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Is it Shen's family?

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm not going there.

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm not going.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Don't worry.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Shen's family doesn't want people.

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
There are many people who want to go there.

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I want to ask you again.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Which other family has copied the method of Shen's family?

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yunlai Jiu Si.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yunlai Jiu Si?

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What?

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What?

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What?

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What?

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What's your surname?

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
My surname is E.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What?

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You have a scar on your face?

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You look like a person.

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I look like a person.

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I look like a person.

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Today

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I will help you to find a way out.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You need to follow me.

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You need to follow me.

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I will.

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You need to follow me.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You need to follow me.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I will.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Brother, brother.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I will help you.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Come on.

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Come on.

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Give me the money.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What?

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Give me one more chance.

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm too nervous.

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm too smart.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Give me one more chance.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let's talk.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm a person.

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I can't give you.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Give me the money.

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Give me the money.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Give me the money.

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Give me the money.

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Wait.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You need to sign the contract.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And then you need to get your hair done.

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Thank you.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But my parents can't do anything to me.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I can do anything.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But don't worry.

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I will do everything.

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay?

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Come on.

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This way.

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Master.

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
He is stupid.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But he can give us food.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He is not so cheap.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
we need to prepare a birthday party.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We need to prepare a birthday party.

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Come on.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I need you to make a wish.

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Come on.

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I will do it.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Come on.

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You need to prepare a birthday party.

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You need to prepare a birthday party.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Come on.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I will do it.

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You need to prepare a birthday party.

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Come on.

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Come on.

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Master.

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,400
You're in the restaurant of the Shen family.

103
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,480
You're a friend,

104
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,680
but you're also a family member.

105
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,800
Stop talking nonsense. Sit down.

106
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Taste my cooking.

107
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,600
Be honest and honest.

108
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
You can judge.

109
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,000
Why does the owner treat me so well?

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,200
That's good.

111
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,400
That's how people should be.

112
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
It's normal.

113
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,200
Do I have to re-establish

114
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,000
your understanding of human-human relations?

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,400
And look at you.

116
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,000
You've suffered a lot before.

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,400
No one treats a slave like that.

118
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,800
What did you say?

119
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,200
Aren't you Liang Ming?

120
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,000
Why are you a slave?

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
No, it's okay.

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,600
If you're really a slave, it's okay.

123
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,400
We'll figure something out for you.

124
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,800
Do you know Ah Yuan?

125
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,400
He was in the restaurant of the Shen family.

126
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,200
He was in the restaurant of the Shen family.

127
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,600
He signed a contract with the Shen family.

128
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,200
And he became a swordsman.

129
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
So what?

130
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,000
We'll figure it out for you.

131
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,200
No, I'm joking.

132
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,600
You're joking.

133
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,400
You're really...

134
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Try it.

135
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,600
Okay.

136
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,600
How is it?

137
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Not bad.

138
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,200
But it's not a good thing.

139
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh my god.

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,800
This is fried food.

141
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,600
In this dynasty,

142
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,200
it's a rare thing.

143
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,600
Before the Shen family restaurant,

144
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,200
no one has ever seen it.

145
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,600
It's a great dish.

146
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,000
Boss,

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I always think that

148
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,600
the dishes you cook

149
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,200
taste the same.

150
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,400
The guests like it.

151
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,200
They think it's fresh and they haven't eaten it.

152
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,400
But after eating,

153
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,800
they'll know it's fresh.

154
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,200
It's simple.

155
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,400
If there's nothing else,

156
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
I'll go back to work.

157
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,000
It's not bad.

158
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,000
Simple?

159
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,200
Do you really want me to teach you how to cook?

160
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Of course.

161
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,000
A man can't keep his word.

162
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,200
I don't care if you're from the Eastern or the Western.

163
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,400
I'll follow the rules.

164
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,000
Just come here.

165
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,600
No problem.

166
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,600
Great!

167
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,680
Aquatica

168
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,680
Mom, look at the water.

169
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,800
Look.

170
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,200
Look, how much Alan has worked hard for this birthday party.

171
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,520
He's so hardworking.

172
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,760
San'er, here, take this.

173
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,520
You've done two jobs.

174
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,880
You deserve this.

175
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,240
Why don't you try this?

176
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
Why don't you try this?

177
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,480
Why don't you try this?

178
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
Why don't you try this?

179
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,240
Grandpa, come on!

180
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,360
Grandpa, you're so good!

181
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,420
Shut up!

182
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,420
Speak up!

183
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,140
Everyone, stop!

184
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,260
Stop telling me stories!

185
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,400
difficulty level 40

186
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,880
I can see God in front of us

187
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,200
You are もー

188
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,640
I will rest

189
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,540
God

190
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,640
I am the messenger for the king

191
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:13,840
Quickly

192
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,360
Take them ready

193
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,540
I'm sorry

194
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,040
I can't

195
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,600
It's wrong

196
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Let's go

197
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:56,400
So do you want to be mine learn

198
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,400
The festival of the Chushen will be very lively.

199
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
All the food in the world is in Yongan.

200
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,600
Today, the famous chef of Yongan will be in the same class.

201
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,600
The food of Yongan is very delicious.

202
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,800
Many families will come to eat it.

203
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,600
The first food judge of Yongan is in the Ministry of Rites.

204
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,400
If any family gets a good word from him,

205
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,400
it will be the first of the Yongan's kings.

206
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,400
Last year, the winner was Yunlai Jiusi.

207
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,400
She will eat the most common food in Beijing.

208
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,400
rien

209
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,520
But I have a problem with Ms. Shen.

210
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,660
She's not interested in competing in the contest.

211
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,780
Defeat me, I won't do it again.

212
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,280
And you?

213
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
Stop religions of mine.

214
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,600
I promise that I won't go to the contest, no way.

215
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,400
Today, I've already had a meal with my friends.

216
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
I've selected the best cook.

217
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,400
How lucky I am to have a dream come true.

218
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,400
It's my pleasure to have you here.

219
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
I'm just a guest.

220
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,400
I've also prepared a question for you.

221
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,400
Just a question.

222
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,400
I've also brought Master Lin along.

223
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,400
It's really a great pleasure.

224
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,400
How do you feel, young man?

225
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,400
Enough. Don't make me nervous.

226
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
You've been a banana for 40 years,

227
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
and you're still so pitiful.

228
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,400
We're both very kind.

229
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,400
You're the best cook.

230
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
You're the best.

231
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
You're the best.

232
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
You're the best.

233
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
You're the best.

234
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
The king is the king of the people.

235
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
The people are the king of the food.

236
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
You can do anything you want.

237
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
I'm not a cook.

238
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
I'm just a cook.

239
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
Look, look.

240
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
The cook is Master Lin.

241
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,400
The competition hasn't started yet.

242
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
Why don't you come with me?

243
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Of course.

244
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
Excuse me, Xixi.

245
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Excuse me.

246
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Mom, here.

247
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Come on.

248
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Don't pull me.

249
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
Sit down.

250
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Excuse me.

251
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Thank you.

252
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Grandpa.

253
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Fengxia, you're here.

254
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
I knew you'd be back.

255
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
I'm not here to see you.

256
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
Let's go over there.

257
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Mom.

258
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Come on.

259
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Grandpa, good luck.

260
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Grandma, they made good food.

261
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
Really?

262
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
I've never seen it before.

263
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Excuse me.

264
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Thank you.

265
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Anyway, Anran has to be with another god.

266
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
I'm not sure.

267
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
I'm not sure.

268
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Anyway, Anran is going to be married to another godmother.

269
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
And she's going to be a saint.

270
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
When I left the court,

271
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,400
Meng Xiang personally admitted that

272
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Anran was going to be his grandson-son-in-law.

273
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,400
This ceremony of God of Chu

274
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,360
is

275
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,360
celebrated by Meng Puye

276
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,260

and yuxian in advance.

280
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,260
Everyone is invited

281
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,260
to be the God of Chu in this year.

282
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,260
After completion of the ceremony,

283
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:43,340
allProvance- откуда

00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,140

00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,140
and enter the new department.

287
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,500
The new year is nine months long.

288
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,980
I didn't know such a thing existed.

289
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,060
Just happens that that center嘴

290
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,620
may have so manyares let me down...

291
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,780
Come on.

292
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,940
What's wrong?

293
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,500
I'm havingifiques.

294
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,940
Tesla.

295
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,660
How you come?

296
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,860
Hello?

297
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,580
I want to talk something important.

298
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,940
I have something important to do.

299
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,940
It's like an open-ended essay.

300
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,940
Please choose your own ingredients and cook your own food.

301
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,940
How to cook this dish?

302
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,940
It's also a question.

303
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,940
Yes, yes, yes, just do this.

304
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,940
I can't even think of your dad's brain.

305
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,940
Oil?

306
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,940
Look, the security guard is going to take something.

307
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,940
Yes, yes, yes, this is the one.

308
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,940
This one is wonderful.

309
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,940
Look, everyone has thought of it.

310
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,940
Why is your dad still standing there?

311
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,940
What are you picking?

312
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,940
This...

313
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,940
Your dad...

314
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,940
No, I'm going.

315
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,940
Grandma!

316
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,940
Excuse me, excuse me.

317
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,940
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

318
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,940
Shen Jingsheng.

319
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,940
Why do you take what others take?

320
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,940
At this time, you still learn from others.

321
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,940
I don't know what to take either.

322
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,940
I just take what others take.

323
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,940
Can't you just move your own brain?

324
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,940
Grandma, don't interfere with the cook's cooking.

325
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,940
Please leave.

326
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,940
Excuse me.

327
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,940
When the young master was in school,

328
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,940
he was a grown-up.

329
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,940
He was 50 years old.

330
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,940
He was already old.

331
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,940
What is this chess?

332
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,940
Shouldn't the young master know?

333
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,940
Why didn't he tell us?

334
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,940
Then he would have been killed.

335
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,940
I'm so tired.

336
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,940
Right.

337
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,940
Are you done?

338
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,940
What is Fuyao?

339
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,940
A Ji Kui, help your dad think.

340
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,940
The reason why Mr. Meng asked you to solve this question

341
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,940
is to let the cook blend the taste of life into the family's food.

342
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,940
Did I say something wrong?

343
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,940
You are the one who made a fuss.

344
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,940
Everyone guessed it right.

345
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,940
It's still you.

346
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,940
The person I like...

347
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,940
Is it possible?

348
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,940
What?

349
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,940
You have a plan?

350
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,940
You must be joking.

351
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,940
Every family has a plan for the cook's cooking.

352
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,940
Of course, we should win first place.

353
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,940
Young master Lin has been staring at me.

354
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,940
Is there something on your face?

355
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,940
Young master Lin.

356
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,940
Young master Lin.

357
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,940
Young master Lin.

358
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,940
Young master Lin.

359
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,940
Stop it.

360
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,940
Stop it.

361
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,940
It's hard to win.

362
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,940
I'm so tired.

363
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,940
And there is also Fuyao.

364
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,940
I still don't know what Fuyao is.

365
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,940
Hurry up.

366
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,940
We don't have enough time.

367
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,940
I know.

368
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,940
Fuyao.

369
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,940
Fuyao.

370
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,940
I remembered something.

371
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,940
Did I say it right?

372
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,940
You study, grow up, know the fate, and then grow up.

373
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,940
Is this the life of a person?

374
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,940
You are so smart.

375
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,940
Is this a life-size dish?

376
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,940
Hurry up.

377
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,940
Come on.

378
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,940
Yes, I know.

379
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,940
I know.

380
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,940
You are so smart.

381
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,940
I'll tell you this.

382
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,940
What's wrong?

383
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,940
How to cook a life-size dish?

384
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,940
Hurry up.

385
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,940
You are so slow.

386
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,940
I'm so worried.

387
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,940
Come on.

388
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,940
Come on.

389
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,940
Come on.

390
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,940
Come on.

391
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,940
Come on.

392
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,940
Come on.

393
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,940
Come on.

394
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,940
Come on.

395
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,940
Come on.

396
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,940
I know.

397
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,940
Come on.

398
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,940
You are all stupid.

399
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,940
I can't wash it alone.

400
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,940
I can't even eat.

401
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,940
Come on.

402
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,940
Come on.

403
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,940
Brother, don't you have a new one?

404
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,940
I can't wash all these.

405
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,940
No need to wash.

406
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,940
Come here.

407
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,940
Come on.

408
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,940
The owner has an important task for you.

409
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,940
Great.

410
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,940
The owner finally values me.

411
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,940
I can rest assured and use me boldly.

412
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,940
I will not let the owner down.

413
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,940
Enough.

414
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,940
Stop talking nonsense.

415
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,940
You are going to the cook's party.

416
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,940
See who is good at cooking.

417
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,940
You can find a way to beat them.

418
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,940
Beat them directly?

419
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,940
You are...

420
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,940
You are too low-key.

421
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,940
Low-key?

422
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,940
I am just a low-key person.

423
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,940
How can I be low-key?

424
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,940
But you can use your own method.

425
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,940
I...

426
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,940
Anyway, you can't let anyone pass by.

427
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,940
No, you...

428
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,940
You...

429
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,940
You bad guys.

430
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,940
Right.

431
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,940
You...

432
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,940
Are you crazy?

433
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,940
No.

434
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,940
I can't do anything wrong.

435
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,940
I am just a low-key person.

436
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,940
It's okay.

437
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,940
Stop.

438
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,940
I forgot to tell you.

439
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,940
Especially the Shen family.

440
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,940
We must make them lose their heads.

441
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,940
Otherwise, it will be difficult to get rid of the hatred of the owner.

442
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,940
And...

443
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,940
If you don't do it well,

444
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,940
the owner will want you to look good.

445
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,940
You are so blind.

446
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,940
Let's go.

447
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,940
What's wrong with him?

448
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,940
He is so slow.

449
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,940
He hasn't figured out what to do yet.

450
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,940
He is so good.

451
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,940
He will finish it soon.

452
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,940
Look at this.

453
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,940
He is almost done.

454
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,940
Just do it.

455
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,940
Go.

456
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,940
Go.

457
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,940
Go.

458
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,940
Go.

459
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,940
It smells so good.

460
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,940
Come on, dad.

461
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,940
It smells so good.

462
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,940
It smells so good.

463
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,940
It smells so good, it smells so good.

464
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,940
Dad.

465
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,940
Dad.

466
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,940
Dad.

467
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,220
Dad!

468
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,620
Yingying!

469
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,700
You bitch!

470
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,780
Yingying, let me go!

471
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,860
Let her go!

472
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,620
Let her go!

473
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,380
Yingying, let me go!

474
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,460
Let her go!

475
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,300
Let me go!

476
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,460
No, no, no!

477
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,100
Yingying, let me go!

478
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,260
Why are you here?

479
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,260
Oh, my God!

480
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,180
What...

481
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,020
What happened?

482
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,940
Why are you here?

483
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,980
Don't touch me!

484
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,540
Don't touch me!

485
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,300
Who are you?

486
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,780
Who are you?

487
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,500
I'm leaving.

488
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,700
I'll explain it to you later.

489
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,700
What?

490
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,260
You want to practice this?

491
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,260
Let me add some more.

492
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,660
I'll explain it to you later.

493
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,820
I'll explain it to you later.

494
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,820
Get out!

495
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,660
Hey, Shen!

496
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,220
Dad!

497
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,220
Are you a communist?

498
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:37,780
Dad!

499
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,300
What happened to your hand?

500
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,900
Is that a communist?

501
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,340
Shen Jiansheng hurt his hand.

502
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,340
It's okay.

503
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,820
Your hand...

504
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,700
Your hand is swollen.

505
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,700
What are you holding on to?

506
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,020
Hurry up and go to the clinic.

507
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,380
Fengxia, Fengxia.

508
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,220
Listen to me.

509
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,220
You're really okay.

510
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,660
Come on, hurry!

511
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,660
Take out your shoes.

512
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,860
Hazel, I'm really fine.

513
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,100
You can't hold on.

514
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,700
You have to go to the clinic!

515
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,980
Look at how swollen his hand is!

516
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,100
Be careful.

517
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,540
Uncle, I'm fine.

518
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,660
How's your hand?

519
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,940
Thank you for your concern.

520
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,540
I accidentally hurt myself again.

521
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,180
It's okay, young master.

522
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,540
I can hold on.

523
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,420
Shen,

524
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,060
you've been talking for so long.

525
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,580
You haven't come up with any idea.

526
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,900
You don't know what to do.

527
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,140
Your wrist is swollen.

528
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,300
Why are you still competing?

529
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,540
Why are you still holding on?

530
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,900
Go to the clinic now!

531
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,820
Go to the clinic, okay?

532
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,980
Even if we start now,

533
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,220
it's too late.

534
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,620
Dad, let's stop competing.

535
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,580
Yeah, let's go and see the doctor first.

536
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,180
Yeah, let's stop competing.

537
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,300
Let's go to the clinic.

538
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,940
Uncle,

539
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,860
don't force yourself.

540
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,860
Fengxia,

541
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,460
I seem to know what to cook.

542
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,740
Half a lifetime,

543
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,780
I can't do anything.

544
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,860
It brings a lot of trouble to the family.

545
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,020
I've done a lot of wrong things.

546
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,660
For this competition,

547
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,540
I've prepared for a long time.

548
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,540
Really.

549
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,300
In fact, winning or losing doesn't matter to me.

550
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,780
I just want to have a chance

551
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,860
to prove myself to my family.

552
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,380
I can do it.

553
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,540
Okay.

554
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,660
Be careful.

555
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,620
Good luck.

556
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,980
Okay.

557
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,500
Good luck.

558
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,900
Good luck, grandpa.

559
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,060
Good luck.

560
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,620

561
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,980

00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,640
Shh

563
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,000
Jeez

564
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Gosh

565
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,500

570
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,780
For those who have no spirit

571
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,780
Constitutionally

572
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,380
are different.

573
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,380
I'm afraid there's something wrong.

574
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,380
If we want to give you an advice,

575
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,380
we shouldn't rush.

576
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:21,380
The noodles in the first bite are as tender as new leaves.

577
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,380
And they are made of gold and silver flowers

578
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,380
and the same as the flowers in the flowers.

579
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,980
It's like bathing the baby

580
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,380
who was born on the third day.

581
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,980
The new leaves are called the soup.

582
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,980
That's wonderful.

583
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,980
In the second bite,

584
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:48,980
we put the cherry fruit in the soup.

585
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,980
Don't say it yet.

586
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,980
In the cherry season,

587
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,980
cherry...

588
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:59,580
Isn't it time to put the cherry in the soup?

589
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,580
I can't wait to see it.

590
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,580
This soup is called the cherry blossom soup.

591
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,580
It means the cherry in the soup.

592
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,580
Interesting.

593
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,580
You're going to put all the most important moments of your life

594
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,580
into this soup.

595
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,580
In the third bite,

596
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,580
there are lotus seeds, mandarin, and silver.

597
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,580
This should be called the lotus soup.

598
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,580
That's right.

599
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,580
It means the baby is born early.

600
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,980
Good.

601
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,380
Is this the tofu?

602
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,780
In the fourth bite,

603
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,180
it tastes different.

604
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,580
It's not easy to eat.

605
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,580
This is to remember the separation.

606
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,980
It's a sign of the past.

607
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,580
The taste of life is in this soup.

608
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,580
I see.

609
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,580
Wonderful.

610
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,180
Every dish in Guixiang Restaurant

611
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,180
is made of poetry.

612
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,180
The wind is green, the silver is green.

613
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:19,180
The red building in the purple building is beautiful.

614
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,780
Only the green river is red.

615
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,980
The whole tree is open and the sky is clear.

616
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,980
Only the winter is cold.

617
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,980
The golden tree is new and the small one is lighter.

618
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,980
When the flowers bloom,

619
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:39,980
the green bamboo is made and the spring is clear.

620
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,980
Good.

621
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:50,380
These four dishes represent the four seasons of spring and autumn and winter.

622
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,380
Yes.

623
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,380
Zhenhan,

624
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,780
this is a new and beautiful dish.

625
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:13,780
This fish and this fish is the most expensive dish in this city.

626
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,780
It's so hard to eat.

627
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,780
I can't help but eat.

628
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,780
Please.

629
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,780
Are these six dishes?

630
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,780
Actually, this is a dish.

631
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,780
It's called Six Dishes.

632
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,780
The chef usually puts his dishes

633
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,780
that are hard to forget on a plate.

634
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,780
Only this dish is called Six Dishes.

635
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,780
Only this dish is called Six Dishes.

636
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:50,780
It's a famous dish in the restaurant of the Shen family.

637
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,780
Other dishes are very special.

638
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,780
It tastes very home-cooked.

639
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,780
The more home-cooked, the more difficult it is to eat.

640
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,780
The Li family has been busy for a day.

641
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,780
When we get home, we sit on a table

642
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,780
and share the six dishes.

643
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,780
When we eat these dishes,

644
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,780
we don't feel lonely.

645
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,780
Six Dishes don't need to be special.

646
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,780
As long as the family likes it.

647
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,780
Before the birth contest,

648
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,780
I also wanted to win the first place

649
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,780
to prove myself.

650
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,780
But when I took a few cuts

651
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,780
and started to cook,

652
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,780
I thought about the taste of my family.

653
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,780
My son likes meat.

654
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:50,780
My daughter and A Yuan like my fried dishes.

655
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:59,780
My favorite wife likes to eat small seafood.

656
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:04,780
And my granddaughter Yangyang likes to eat desserts.

657
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,780
I have a special relative at home.

658
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,780
She likes to eat rice tofu.

659
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,780
At this moment,

660
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,780
winning or losing is not important.

661
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,780
Not at all.

662
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,780
If I have to choose a dish

663
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,780
to represent my life,

664
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,780
I want to say that

665
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,780
this dish must be eaten by my family.

666
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,780
Must be eaten.

667
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,780
A family is always together.

668
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,780
Eat every meal.

669
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,780
This is the most important thing in life.

670
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,780
You succeeded.

671
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,780
The End

672
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,780
The End

673
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,780
The End

674
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,780
The End

675
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,780
The End

676
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,780
The End
