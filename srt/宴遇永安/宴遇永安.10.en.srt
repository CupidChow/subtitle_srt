1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,560
involved

2
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,600
well

3
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,920
Let's make Tiantian to die

4
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,160
Don't worry

5
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,320
A screen

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,120
Careful with your knife, okay?

7
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,240
Careful with your knife because sometimes it's okay.

8
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,380
It's normal!

9
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,880
It's normal!

10
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,420
Be careful with your knife!

11
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,980
Careful with your knife because it's so sharp.

12
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,500
So sharp.

13
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,100
I thought your pocket is a bit sharp?

14
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,060
revisit

15
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,640
The price

16
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,760
They said we've venir bonbon.

17
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,720
No contest If ì•ˆ finden

18
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,720
Okay, okay.

19
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,720
It's really that good?

20
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
I thought you would try it.

21
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,720
Try it, everyone.

22
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,720
Dad, mom, it's time to serve the dishes.

23
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,720
Hurry up.

24
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
I'll be right there.

25
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
Hurry up.

26
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,720
Take it slow.

27
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,720
Okay.

28
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,720
Here comes the speedy journey.

29
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
14.

30
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
14.

31
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,720
Who can make cold noodles in ancient times?

32
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,720
Who can make instant noodles in ancient times?

33
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,720
And who can make chicken chops in ancient times?

34
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,720
Only I, Shen Jian She, am talented.

35
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
Enough.

36
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,720
What are you giving to the movie, The Passing Moon?

37
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,720
Which of the leading actor is not better than you?

38
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,720
You are just taking advantage of the old people who have never eaten.

39
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,720
You have no real skills.

40
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,720
Stop bragging.

41
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,720
You can't say that.

42
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
You can't always remember me.

43
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
You have to be nice to me.

44
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,720
I am a genius chef now.

45
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,720
If it weren't for me,

46
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,720
this small restaurant would be so famous.

47
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,720
Shen Jian She,

48
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,720
I found out that when you open a restaurant,

49
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,720
how can you put all your money on your face?

50
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,720
You said it like you were doing a great job.

51
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
This decoration is not made by your daughter.

52
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,720
The design of the palace is not drawn by your daughter.

53
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,720
Making instant noodles with the technology of making instant noodles is not taught by your daughter.

54
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
You are still talented.

55
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,720
Why are you so shameless?

56
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
Yes, yes, yes.

57
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
No matter how good your daughter is,

58
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,720
she is also my daughter.

59
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,720
There is a problem with the sound.

60
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,720
Dad, mom.

61
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
My god.

62
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
It's full.

63
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Hurry up and serve the dishes.

64
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
Really?

65
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
It's full.

66
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,720
It's full.

67
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
Hurry up.

68
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
It's delicious.

69
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
It's delicious.

70
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,720
Try this.

71
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
This is a crispy fish.

72
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
It's crispy.

73
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
The sauce is sweet.

74
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,720
The fish is delicious.

75
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
It's delicious.

76
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
You ate so much.

77
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
You still can't get fat.

78
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
What?

79
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
You are a cloth maker.

80
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,720
You are reluctant to have more cloth on you.

81
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
What are you talking about?

82
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,720
I didn't keep it for you last time.

83
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,720
Do you have to be so angry?

84
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,720
You are a wind and rain.

85
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,720
It's a pity that it's too full.

86
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,720
I remember that you even broke your own bed.

87
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
What are you talking about?

88
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
What?

89
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
You have guts.

90
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Go outside and talk.

91
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
Don't hit, don't hit.

92
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
Go out.

93
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
How are you?

94
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,720
Go out.

95
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
Go.

96
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
Don't fight.

97
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
Don't fight.

98
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
Come out.

99
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
Come out.

100
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Come out.

101
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
Everyone.

102
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
Everyone.

103
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
Look.

104
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
Look.

105
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
Manager Zhao and Manager Liu

106
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
have made a lot of money.

107
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
It's a good match for this dynasty.

108
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
How beautiful.

109
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
I'm like a wife of Manager Zhang.

110
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,720
We don't gain weight.

111
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
We are so ugly.

112
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,720
Stop arguing.

113
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,720
I happen to have something to talk to you.

114
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,720
What you just did is called a chair.

115
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,720
It's more comfortable than before.

116
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
You owe me a lot of money.

117
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
You know it's good.

118
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
I have a drawing paper.

119
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
If you want to do this business,

120
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
I can teach you.

121
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
If you sell it to others,

122
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
you only need to share my two-fold.

123
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,720
Then...

124
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
This...

125
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
But the chair needs to be laid on top.

126
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
You have to manage Manager Zhang and Madam Xu

127
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,720
to make the cloth.

128
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
We are friends.

129
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
We make money together.

130
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
It's a serious matter.

131
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
What's the point of fighting?

132
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,720
You are right.

133
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
Brother,

134
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
it's all my fault.

135
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
You should take the responsibility.

136
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,720
Madam Shen,

137
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,720
I'll pay for their meal.

138
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
How about it?

139
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Okay.

140
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Okay, okay.

141
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
Then...

142
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
This...

143
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,720
Brother, you are so great.

144
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,720
You scared me.

145
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,720
Brother, I'll come to see you tomorrow.

146
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
Take care.

147
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
Brother.

148
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,720
Brother.

149
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,720
Brother, brother, brother.

150
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,720
Brother, brother, brother.

151
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,720
Brother, brother, brother.

152
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Brother, brother, brother.

153
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,720
I guess this is the widow of Liu Yuxiang.

154
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
You came here today

155
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
to consult about the Qin's problem.

156
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Yes, yes, yes.

157
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
But brother,

158
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
what are these two circles?

159
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
It's so interesting.

160
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
This is called Mo's

161
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
in my hometown.

162
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
It looks more beautiful

163
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,720
after you wear it.

164
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Mo's?

165
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
This...

166
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
Look carefully.

167
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
You are really a good man.

168
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,720
You always show your talent.

169
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,720
Here's the thing.

170
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
Recently,

171
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
I've been thinking about

172
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
how to make a good husband.

173
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
I've been thinking about

174
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
how to make a good husband.

175
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Here's the thing.

176
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
Recently, I want to make another husband.

177
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
But I have some concerns.

178
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
What concerns?

179
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
I think you

180
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,720
can make another husband.

181
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
I've made three husbands.

182
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
I've made my husband

183
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
lose his husband.

184
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
So what?

185
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
This is your nature.

186
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,720
People in the street

187
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
say I'm an ominous person.

188
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Now Zhou Tuhu wants to marry me.

189
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
I'm afraid of hurting him.

190
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
Why do you care

191
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
about the people in the street?

192
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
Do you care

193
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
whether they raised Zhou Tuhu

194
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
or you?

195
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
No.

196
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
So why do you care about them?

197
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,720
They only live once.

198
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
Remember,

199
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,720
you must open yourself.

200
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
Besides,

201
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
you are not the one who lost him.

202
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,720
Why are you afraid?

203
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
Go and call him.

204
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,720
I'll listen to you.

205
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
Thank you.

206
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Hurry up.

207
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
Hurry up.

208
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
Let's do it one by one.

209
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
There are so many guests.

210
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
He's still chatting.

211
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
Aunt,

212
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
do you want me to

213
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
ask dad to come and help?

214
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,720
Forget it.

215
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
This is the first time

216
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,720
I've seen your dad

217
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
so happy.

218
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
I don't know how long

219
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
he can be happy.

220
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Let him go.

221
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
Luckily,

222
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Sister Yan is here.

223
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Otherwise,

224
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
I have to help

225
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
grandma and grandpa

226
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
cook and cook.

227
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
And I have to deal with

228
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,720
the guests' quarrels.

229
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
I have to be very busy.

230
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,820
The

231
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
The sun is too big.

232
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
I have to ask mom to change it.

233
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
My dear,

234
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,720
this hairpin is so beautiful.

235
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,720
It costs ten thousand.

236
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,720
You are so kind to me.

237
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
We've been working for more than ten days.

238
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
It's too hard to get back to work.

239
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
It's just a hairpin.

240
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,720
It's important that you like it.

241
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,720
Since my grandma left,

242
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,720
I've been in Yongan.

243
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
For so many years,

244
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
this is the first time

245
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
I've been to Xishi.

246
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
My dear,

247
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
you are the first person

248
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
who is so kind to me

249
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,720
besides my mom.

250
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,720
I will definitely

251
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
repay you.

252
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
You are the greatest

253
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,720
repayment to me.

254
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Let me take it.

255
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
Let me take it.

256
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,720
I'll take it if you like your hairpin.

257
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
Help me take the hat.

258
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
I'll take it.

259
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
My dear,

260
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
there is a restaurant in front of us.

261
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
I'm a little scared.

262
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
You called the name of the restaurant

263
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,720
and told them

264
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,720
that you would tell them.

265
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Why are you scared now?

266
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,720
They were forced to leave.

267
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,720
I don't know how

268
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,720
I dare to call them.

269
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,720
Then you should do it in the future.

270
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,720
What can they do to you?

271
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
Let's go.

272
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Look,

273
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,720
so many new dishes are served.

274
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Look,

275
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,720
the name is so interesting.

276
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
This dish is exactly

277
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,720
the same as the one in the Shen family.

278
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,720
It's a bit like it.

279
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,720
Jin Xiang Su Yu?

280
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,720
Su Xiang Yun Lv?

281
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,720
Why is there a picture of Wu You Ying?

282
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
Everyone,

283
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
welcome.

284
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,720
Welcome to our Yunlai Jiu Si.

285
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,720
The dishes of Yunlai Jiu Si

286
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,720
are not comparable

287
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
to those of the small families.

288
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
For example,

289
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,720
this dish,

290
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,720
Su Xiang Yun Lv.

291
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
Other people cook this dish

292
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
with only lamb bones in the soup.

293
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
But in our family,

294
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,720
besides the lamb bones,

295
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
we also add chicken bones and fish bones

296
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,720
and cook it for a whole day.

297
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,720
We are happy to add fresh meat and vegetables.

298
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
And the price

299
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,720
is half of the price of other families.

300
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
Half?

301
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,720
That must be delicious.

302
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,720
Welcome, welcome.

303
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
Please, please.

304
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
Please, please.

305
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
Please come in.

306
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
Welcome.

307
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
Please come in.

308
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,720
Please, please.

309
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
Welcome, welcome.

310
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Please come in.

311
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
Mrs. Shen.

312
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
What?

313
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
You still have time

314
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,720
to take care of this little maid?

315
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
I think

316
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,720
you should go back to your own shop.

317
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
But where are the guests?

318
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
There are still a few tables left.

319
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
Come on, come on.

320
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Please come in.

321
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,720
Welcome, welcome.

322
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
Welcome, welcome.

323
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
Please come in.

324
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
Please come in.

325
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
Please, please.

326
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
Welcome, welcome.

327
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
Let's go.

328
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,720
Let's go to my house for a drink.

329
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,720
Okay, okay, okay.

330
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Let's go.

331
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
I know, I know.

332
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
I know, I've investigated it.

333
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
What did you know?

334
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
Why don't we have guests here?

335
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
The restaurant

336
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,720
stole all our food.

337
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
And they only sell half of the price.

338
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
Aren't they shameless?

339
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Family, let's have a meeting.

340
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
I want to say something.

341
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,720
Do you know what time it is?

342
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,720
It's the time to survive.

343
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
It's the time to solve the case.

344
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
It's...

345
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,720
Where's A Ji?

346
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,720
Where's A Ji?

347
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
Aunt and A Yuan went out to buy food.

348
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
They haven't come back yet.

349
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
This kid is so serious.

350
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,720
He doesn't want to come to the family meeting.

351
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
It's okay.

352
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
I'll say it again.

353
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,720
Since we've decided to stay and open a restaurant,

354
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
we have to get some air

355
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
even if we don't steam buns.

356
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,720
It's not the first time that there are dead people.

357
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,720
It's the first time.

358
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,720
They've copied my pancake before.

359
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,720
This time, they've put the black hand on me again.

360
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,720
Facing this kind of vicious competition,

361
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,720
this kind of unprecedented, cruel business war,

362
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
we have to win this battle.

363
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,720
We have to win.

364
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
My enthusiasm is already boiling.

365
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
I've been developing so many dishes for so many years.

366
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
They've just given me a little bit of a chance.

367
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
It's tolerable.

368
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
It's unbearable.

369
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
What have you developed?

370
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Aren't they just some ordinary modern dishes?

371
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
It's normal for them to be able to return the guests.

372
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
If you don't raise your hand during the meeting,

373
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
don't speak.

374
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Mom, don't be angry.

375
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
Don't introduce yourself like my dad.

376
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
Dad, actually, I just thought of something.

377
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
Then you say it quickly.

378
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
Sit down.

379
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Since the original restaurant can copy our dishes,

380
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
can we copy it back?

381
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
One hug, one hug.

382
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
That makes sense.

383
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,720
The four famous dishes of Yunlai Jiu Si

384
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,720
have been copied by my Shen Jian She.

385
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
Braised fish with milk,

386
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
pig's head spring,

387
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
Changshanzhou,

388
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,720
and the big picture of Jin Zhuang.

389
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,720
I hope you guys can give me more valuable suggestions.

390
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
This is our traditional dish.

391
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
Let's have a taste first.

392
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,720
Yangyang.

393
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,720
The old one is in the front, the old one is in the back.

394
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
So grandma first.

395
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
Grandma ate too much this morning.

396
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
She's not hungry now.

397
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,720
But how can I remember

398
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
that the original four dishes of Yunlai Jiu Si

399
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
don't look like this?

400
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
Son,

401
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
you came up with this idea first.

402
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
You try it.

403
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
I...

404
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
Wait a minute.

405
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
What do you mean?

406
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Hurry up and give your dad a face.

407
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
No, try it.

408
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
Gongsun,

409
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,720
you can pick one.

410
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
Just try it.

411
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
I'll give you this.

412
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Give me this.

413
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
You have to bite it.

414
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
Dad,

415
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
you can't even chew it, right?

416
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
Enough.

417
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
Don't force yourself.

418
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
No, no, no.

419
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
This is the softest.

420
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,720
Like this.

421
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,720
I'll try this porridge.

422
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Look.

423
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
It's really...

424
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
It's really soft.

425
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
It's really soft.

426
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
It's really soft.

427
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
It's really soft.

428
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
It's really soft.

429
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
It's really soft.

430
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
I'm sorry, dad.

431
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,720
I really couldn't help myself.

432
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,720
Your cooking is really stable.

433
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
Unless you've practiced it many times,

434
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
or every time you cook new dishes,

435
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
it tastes so bad.

436
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
You guys are so disrespectful to me.

437
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,720
Don't forget.

438
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
How did you grow up so big?

439
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
If you didn't cook for me since you were little,

440
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
I would have cooked for you.

441
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
You said you bought these ingredients

442
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
and spent a can of money.

443
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
How expensive is that?

444
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,720
Look, it's all ruined.

445
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
You didn't even taste it.

446
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,720
How do you know these dishes are ruined?

447
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
Do you...

448
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Do you have a terrible impression of me?

449
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Enough, enough.

450
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Let's think about it.

451
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,720
Is there any other way to deal with the old Jiusi?

452
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,720
Come out and help us.

453
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
We're back.

454
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
Koke.

455
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
Koke is back.

456
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,720
Koke is finally back.

457
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
Dad, the food is here.

458
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,720
Just come here.

459
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Dad, I'm back.

460
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,720
Ji, where have you been for so long?

461
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,720
Ji,

462
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
what's in the bag?

463
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
It's a big bag.

464
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,720
How did you get a big pot back?

465
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
This...

466
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,720
It's a big kill to defeat Jiusi.

467
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
Aunt,

468
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,720
we've been away for so long.

469
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,720
We just went to buy pork and pot.

470
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,720
I went to the door of Yunlai with Yuan after buying the food.

471
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,720
I found out that they had copied our food.

472
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,720
I took Yuan to order half a pig.

473
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
I don't like pig.

474
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
It's hard to buy good pork.

475
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
I found it when I went out of town.

476
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,720
My wife said she wanted an iron pot.

477
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,720
The iron sauce said the stove was not warm enough.

478
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
It couldn't even heat up.

479
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,720
Fortunately, the western-style iron sauce

480
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,720
couldn't stand my words and words.

481
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,720
So I made it.

482
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,720
So that's what happened.

483
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,720
I was wondering why you two bought so long.

484
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
Wait, wait, wait.

485
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,720
I still don't understand what you said.

486
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
You don't understand?

487
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,720
How did pork and iron pot become

488
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
a big kill to defeat Jiusi?

489
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,720
Yes.

490
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,720
So they copied our food,

491
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
used better ingredients,

492
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
but ordered a lower price.

493
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,720
They wanted to use a low price to take away our survival space.

494
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,720
Although they must have lost money,

495
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,720
they lost a lot.

496
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
Yangyang,

497
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,720
why can't I understand what you're talking about?

498
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
You need to learn your skills first.

499
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
You'll get there eventually.

500
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,720
It's okay.

501
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
You can learn from me later.

502
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
You'll understand it eventually.

503
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
Okay, don't bother.

504
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
Don't bother.

505
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
Go on.

506
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
I don't understand.

507
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
If we compete in the same way,

508
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
we can't win.

509
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
But I said before

510
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,720
that we wanted to go the route of evaluation.

511
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
We stick to the principle of

512
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,720
pushing the dust with the price of beauty.

513
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
Pork is cheap in this day and age.

514
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,720
We can lower the cost by using pork

515
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,720
to make new dishes.

516
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,720
But many people don't eat pork.

517
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
They think pork has a taste.

518
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
Yes.

519
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
They don't eat pork here.

520
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,720
Yuan,

521
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,720
didn't you say you like pork with rice?

522
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,720
I don't have much money.

523
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,720
I'm not picky or considerate.

524
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
But others...

525
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,720
But we're doing

526
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,720
the business of the people.

527
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,720
As long as we make pork delicious

528
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
and at a low price,

529
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,720
we can satisfy the need of the rich.

530
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Who will refuse?

531
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
Wait a minute.

532
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,720
I think I understand.

533
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
You mean

534
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
if you want to make pork delicious,

535
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,720
you need to get rid of the bad smell of pork.

536
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,720
You're a iron pot.

537
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,720
You're doing this, right?

538
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,720
Boil the pork first.

539
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Then fry it with iron pot and spices.

540
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
It should be fine.

541
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
You're right.

542
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,720
The signature dishes of our family

543
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
are easily copied.

544
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
Now we use iron pot to make special dishes.

545
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,720
And there are many ways to make pork.

546
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,720
I'm afraid they can't copy it now.

547
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,720
You're right.

548
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
Great.

549
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
Very good.

550
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,720
Fried pork with iron pot.

551
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Who will cook in this dynasty?

552
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
Who?

553
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,720
Who else?

554
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
No one.

555
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Right?

556
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,720
If we really

557
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,720
promote pork dishes,

558
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,720
our restaurant will be great.

559
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,720
It's a famous history.

560
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,720
It's unique in this dynasty.

561
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
Come and have a look.

562
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,720
The new dishes are served in the restaurant.

563
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
Don't miss it.

564
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,720
What's this?

565
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,720
Today, we introduce the new dishes.

566
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
Braised pork with horse brain.

567
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
Guests are still here.

568
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Free free free.

569
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
Free free.

570
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,720
It smells good.

571
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
It smells good.

572
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,720
It smells good.

573
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,720
It smells good.

574
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,720
It smells good.

575
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,720
It looks like pork.

576
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,720
Pork.

577
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
How can we eat pork?

578
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
How can we eat pork?

579
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720
Pork is good for your health.

580
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,720
How can we eat it?

581
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
Guys,

582
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
Braised pork with horse brain is marinated with heart.

583
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,720
Braised with heart,

584
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
then stewed with broth.

585
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
Finally, it's cooked and cooked.

586
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
It will remove the fishy smell of pork.

587
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
It's delicious and easy to eat.

588
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,720
Cooked?

589
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,720
What is cooked?

590
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,720
It's a special cooking technique.

591
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,720
It's the unique recipe of our restaurant.

592
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,720
Right.

593
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,720
It smells good.

594
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,720
It's really good.

595
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
Try it.

596
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,720
It doesn't taste like the bone.

597
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,720
It's really good.

598
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
It doesn't taste like the bone.

599
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Guys,

600
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,720
try it.

601
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
Try it.

602
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
Try it.

603
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
Don't move.

604
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,720
It's really good.

605
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
How can we know it's good?

606
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,720
Try it.

607
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
Try it.

608
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,720
This guy.

609
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,720
Come on.

610
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,720
You will like it.

611
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,720
Try it.

612
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720
It's really good.

613
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,720
I'll eat it myself.

614
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
I'm so full.

615
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,720
It's so delicious.

616
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Why don't you eat it?

617
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,720
It seems that Shen

618
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,720
is in a hurry to get married.

619
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,720
He even came up with this trick.

620
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,720
The pork is too fishy

621
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,720
and hard to eat.

622
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,720
But the Shen family

623
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,720
put the treasure on the pork.

624
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,720
Isn't it more stupid than the pig?

625
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
Yes.

626
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,720
It seems that

627
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,720
the Shen family will close the door and

628
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,720
the boss will be punished.

629
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,720
It smells so good.

630
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,720
We just started our business.

631
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,720
It's been a day without water.

632
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,720
You don't know.

633
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
It's hard to hear

634
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
what the neighbors say.

635
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
They say that

636
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
Yunlai took our business.

637
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,720
Our whole family has a good reputation.

638
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,720
Even the pig is not angry.

639
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
The trend of comparing pork

640
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,720
is going up and down.

641
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,720
The nobles think that

642
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
pork is for the rest of the meal.

643
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
They think it's a common thing.

644
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,720
So they don't eat it.

645
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,720
Ordinary people follow the trend.

646
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
But in fact,

647
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
they don't know how to

648
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,720
remove the fishy smell of pork.

649
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
So they can't get it.

650
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,720
To break this concept,

651
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,720
it should go up and down.

652
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,720
I really think

653
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,720
I need a suggestion.

654
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,720
What does it mean to go up and down?

655
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
A'Yuan, Jueyan.

656
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
They will manage it themselves.

657
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
We just need to wait.

658
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,720
Let's go in and eat.

659
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
I think you said go up and down.

660
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
It's harder.

661
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
Ordinary people don't know how to eat.

662
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,720
Do you have a way to let the people above eat?

663
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,720
I don't have a way.

664
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,720
But you do.

665
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Me?

666
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
Brother,

667
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,720
aren't you the big V?

668
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
Shen Lang.

669
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,720
Shen Lang.

670
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,720
Shen Lang.

671
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,720
Shen Lang.

672
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
I didn't expect

673
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,720
Shen Lang to be so handsome and cool.

674
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
Yes.

675
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,720
Shen Lang is tall and handsome.

676
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,720
He is good at dancing and driving.

677
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,720
I didn't expect he would be so good at food.

678
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,720
Yes.

679
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
Shen Lang,

680
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,720
do you have any ideas?

681
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
Tell us.

682
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
Yes.

683
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Tell us.

684
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,720
I'm flattered.

685
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
These are all

686
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
your best compliments.

687
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
You are all very kind.

688
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,720
Thank you.

689
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
You are welcome.

690
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Ladies and gentlemen,

691
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,720
I invited you all here

692
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,720
to taste my new dish.

693
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,720
It's horse brain meat.

694
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Horse brain?

695
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Shen Lang,

696
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,720
is this horse brain made of pig?

697
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,720
How can we eat this?

698
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,720
This pig is made of cold food.

699
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
This is not pig meat.

700
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,720
This is sand.

701
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
I don't eat pig meat.

702
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
I don't eat it either.

703
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
I don't eat it either.

704
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
Ladies and gentlemen,

705
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,720
I once said

706
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,720
in the poem meeting of the First Princess,

707
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,720
people have different talents.

708
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,720
But their soul is equal.

709
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,720
People are like that.

710
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,720
What's the difference between animals and animals?

711
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,720
How can we eat mutton?

712
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,720
He can't eat this pig meat.

713
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
But mutton is grass-fed.

714
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,720
It's meat is clean.

715
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,720
But pig meat is hard to eat.

716
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
Yes.

717
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,720
It's not food.

718
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,720
Actually,

719
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
don't just listen to others.

720
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
You must try it yourself.

721
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,720
Then you will know

722
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,720
what the taste of the pig meat

723
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,720
in the restaurant is.

724
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,720
It smells good.

725
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,720
It smells good.

726
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,720
It smells good.

727
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,720
How is it?

728
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720
Is it delicious?

729
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
Yes.

730
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,720
It smells good.

731
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,720
Everyone says that

732
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,720
the pig meat has a taste.

733
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,720
This is prejudice.

734
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,720
We are human beings.

735
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,720
We can't listen to others.

736
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
Ladies and gentlemen,

737
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,720
you can understand the theory of equality.

738
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
It means that

739
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,720
not only do we have good looks,

740
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,720
but we also have a heart

741
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,720
that treats people equally.

742
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
Why can't we give it to pigs?

743
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,720
You have the most unparalleled opportunity.

744
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,720
You can't give it to pigs.

745
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,720
For example,

746
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,720
you judge someone by his appearance

747
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
and his appearance.

748
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,720
It's too hasty.

749
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
Shen Lang is right.

750
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
Just like Shen Lang's appearance,

751
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
it's hard to imagine that

752
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,720
he is so talented and loving.

753
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
I'm willing to believe him.

754
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,720
They are so stupid.

755
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,720
They are eating it.

756
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
How is it?

757
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,720
The pig meat is so tender and juicy.

758
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,720
I'm a real man.

759
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,720
How can I make the pig meat

760
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,720
taste like this?

761
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,720
Really?

762
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,720
Try it.

763
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,720
I'll try it too.

764
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
Try it.

765
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,720
It's really delicious.

766
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,720
I want to eat the pig meat.

767
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,720
It's delicious.

768
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
The pig meat of the Shen family

769
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,720
is so delicious that even the nobles praise it.

770
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,720
Is there really something unusual?

771
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,720
I want to try the pig meat too.

772
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,720
The pig's brain is red and bright.

773
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,720
The stomach is thick and thick.

774
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Shen Lang is so good at it.

775
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,720
He can make the pig meat taste so delicious.

776
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,720
Shen Lang cooked the pig meat

777
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,720
in a very cold way.

778
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,720
It's even better than the lamb.

779
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,720
It's not hot.

780
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
Shen Lang's fan is also very luxurious.

781
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,720
I've only seen the fan of the group.

782
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
I've never seen such a folding fan.

783
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
Yes.

784
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,720
Ladies and gentlemen,

785
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
in fact,

786
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,720
anything can be achieved

787
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,720
if you put your heart into it.

788
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,720
Wow!

789
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,720
It's so amazing!

790
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
Pig meat is fresh and delicious.

791
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,720
It's very delicious.

792
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,720
It's cooked and fried in a real way.

793
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,720
It's very delicious.

794
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,720
Yes, it's very delicious.

795
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,720
Everyone, come and try it.

796
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,720
Come and try it.

797
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,720
Come on in.

798
00:28:47,720 --> 00:29:12,340
The

799
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720
pig's brain is red and bright.

800
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,720
The stomach is thick and thick.

801
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
The stomach is thick and bright.

802
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,720
It's sweet and spicy.

803
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
The pig's brain is red and bright.

804
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
It's very delicious.

805
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
Ladies and gentlemen,

806
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,720
here it is.

807
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,720
This is the new dish you ordered.

808
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,720
This is the yunjin kidney.

809
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,720
It's very delicious.

810
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,720
This is the pig's brain.

811
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,720
Enjoy it.

812
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,720
It looks good.

813
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,720
It's just out of the oven.

814
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
Let's eat.

815
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,720
I used to think that pig meat was very thick and delicious.

816
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Now I think I don't appreciate it.

817
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,720
This is also good.

818
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
Finally, I got it.

819
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,720
Hurry up.

820
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,720
The pig's brain is red and bright.

821
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,720
It's very delicious.

822
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,720
The stomach is thick and bright.

823
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
It's very delicious.

824
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,720
The pig's brain is red and bright.

825
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,720
It's very delicious.

826
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
Ladies and gentlemen,

827
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
here it is.

828
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,720
This is the yunjin kidney.

829
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,720
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

830
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,720
Enjoy it.

831
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,720
Enjoy it.

832
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,720
Fengxia,

833
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,720
someone is cooking in the kitchen.

834
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
I'm too busy to come.

835
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
I'll help you when I'm done.

836
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
Thank you.

837
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,720
How is it?

838
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
Be careful.

839
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,720
Don't break it.

840
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,720
This is specially made for me by the guest.

841
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,720
It's almost done.

842
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Let's do it like this first.

843
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Gongcai,

844
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,720
I'll tell you the truth.

845
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,720
Actually, I don't really care about

846
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,720
the reputation of the first chef.

847
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,720
I don't want to be the guest's hot spot.

848
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
I just want to be the guest's hot spot.

849
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
I just want to be the guest's hot spot.

850
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
I'll be the guest's hot spot.

851
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
Okay, okay, okay.

852
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,720
Next year, the Spring Festival,

853
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,720
the first chef competition,

854
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,720
if I win,

855
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,720
your dad will be the first chef in Yongan.

856
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
Dad,

857
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,720
let's not talk about this.

858
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,720
It's useless.

859
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,720
You have to talk about the key.

860
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,720
I mean, what else do you have in your eyes except money?

861
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,720
No, this...

862
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,720
Just know money.

863
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,720
Is money that important?

864
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,720
You go back to your work.

865
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
What?

866
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,720
Go back to your work.

867
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
What?

868
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,720
Is it done?

869
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,720
Yes.

870
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,720
Where did you get this?

871
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
Is it enough?

872
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,720
What you owe, what you owe,

873
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,720
plus interest,

874
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,720
that's enough.

875
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Dad,

876
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,720
and,

877
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,720
don't let me do this kind of thing.

878
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,720
I'm the first chef in the Shen family,

879
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,720
I have so many fans.

880
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
If they see this,

881
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,720
it will have a bad effect.

882
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,720
How many fans are you talking about?

883
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,720
First chef?

884
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,720
I'm the first chef in the show.

885
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,720
You're wronged for doing me a favor.

886
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
No.

887
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,720
No.

888
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,720
Sir,

889
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,720
you used to look down on me.

890
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,720
The last time I cooked the dishes of Yunlai Restaurant,

891
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,720
you bit that Anchun.

892
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,720
That expression.

893
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
Your teeth are going to fall off.

894
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,720
The porridge is also spitting out.

895
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,720
Right?

896
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
How about now?

897
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,720
It's good.

898
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,720
Good.

899
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,720
Good.

900
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
Dad,

901
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
but seriously,

902
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,720
it's all because you practiced more than 500 times before.

903
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
This is the only way to not make mistakes, right?

904
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
Sir,

905
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,720
I have to say something to you.

906
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,720
Don't blame me for not teaching you well.

907
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,720
There is no genius in this world.

908
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,720
Only Qin Fen.

909
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,720
For this pork dish,

910
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,720
I practiced 500 times.

911
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,720
After years of meditation,

912
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
I have a great experience.

913
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
Only then can it become a classic.

914
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
Only then can it be a good thing for you.

915
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,720
Right?

916
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,720
Of course.

917
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,720
Shun Dao also achieved the reputation of being the first chef in my show.

918
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,720
Dad,

919
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,720
Dad,

920
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
based on what you said,

921
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,720
now you don't even take my mom's words seriously.

922
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,720
Your mom's words?

923
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,720
Is it useful?

924
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,720
When did I ever hear that?

925
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,720
Just your mom.

926
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,720
Let me tell you,

927
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,720
let alone your mom,

928
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
the whole Yongan,

929
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,720
who can control me?

930
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,720
Who else?

931
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Who else?

932
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,720
She's still the first chef.

933
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,720
Don't know how she got so excited, right?

934
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,720
I feel that Dad is different from before.

935
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
He's a little...

936
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,720
Pretentious.

937
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,720
Very pretentious.

938
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
What do you mean?

939
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,720
I...

940
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Shen Jian She,

941
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,720
I found that since our restaurant opened,

942
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,720
you've changed so much that I don't even recognize you.

943
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,720
Really?

944
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
I also think

945
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,720
I need to get to know you again.

946
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,720
I'm Shen Jian She,

947
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,720
the first chef in my show.

948
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,720
You're tired of being the first chef in my show, right?

949
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,720
You really think you're a celebrity?

950
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,720
I'm telling you, you're just a celebrity.

951
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,720
Do you know that?

952
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,720
Miss Mei,

953
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,720
you can take Shen Jian She's waist.

954
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,720
The waist of the first chef

955
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,720
can't be taken.

956
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,720
I'll make you the first chef in my show.

957
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,720
Pick it up.

958
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,720
I don't want to.

959
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,720
Shen Jian She,

960
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,720
wipe the table for me.

961
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,720
I... I like wiping the table.

962
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,720
You're annoying.

963
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,720
I can wipe that table.

964
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,720
I'm sorry.

965
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,720
Why is Miss Shen coming to the restaurant at this hour?

966
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,720
I know that Young Master doesn't have the habit of eating at night.

967
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,720
But I haven't seen him in a few days.

968
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,720
I have a dish that I want him to try.

969
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,720
Liu Chang,

970
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,720
let Miss Shen come in.

971
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,720
Young Master,

972
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,720
please have a seat.

973
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
This is a new dish we developed.

974
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
It's a bit special.

975
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,720
I don't dare to send it directly to the Jinzhao Mansion.

976
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,720
But I still want to invite you to a feast.

977
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Okay.

978
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,720
You want me to eat this?

979
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,720
The pig's trotter is common.

980
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,720
It's not common to let the Vice Mayor of Yongan have a delicious pig's trotter.

981
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,720
The key is...

982
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,720
Ha ha ha ha.

983
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,720
Ha ha ha ha.

984
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Ha ha ha ha.

985
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,720
Ha ha ha ha.

986
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,720
What?

987
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,720
Are you disappointed that you didn't see me eating like a wolf?

988
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,720
Ha ha ha.

989
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,720
No, no.

990
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,720
How could I?

991
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,720
I have no prejudice against pork.

992
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,720
I can eat it as I want.

993
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,720
I can even make such a difficult dish so delicious.

994
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,720
You are really a good person.

995
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,720
If anyone can marry you in the future,

996
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,720
I will be very blessed.

997
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,720
I will definitely erase all related memories.

998
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,720
If there is a repeat, it is a repeat.

999
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,720
Since the wheel of morality is lost,

1000
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,720
it must be judged by the children.

1001
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,720
Only the first.

1002
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,720
It's okay, it's okay, I was just blind.

1003
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,720
I didn't see anything.

1004
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,720
Ha ha ha ha.

1005
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,720
What a blessing, but forced me to be like a red water beast.

1006
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,720
What?

1007
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,720
Nothing.

1008
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,720
How did you think of making pork?

1009
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,720
Pork is cheap.

1010
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,720
We can't afford to roll expensive ingredients with Yunlai roll.

1011
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,720
I guess this roll is the meaning of the pen.

1012
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,720
Shao Ying is a master.

1013
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,720
You sell pork, people don't spend much,

1014
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,720
you can eat good meat.

1015
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,720
It's a merit.

1016
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,720
Yes, that's what I mean.

1017
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,720
I also have such a thing.

1018
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,720
The dispute between the Shen family and the original Jiu Si

1019
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,720
is not just between you.

1020
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,720
Someone has already found out.

1021
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,720
And it's very exaggerated.

1022
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,720
I think the sale of pork will shake the foundation.

1023
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,720
Today, it can be seen as a low-key item.

1024
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,720
In the future, it will be a crime.

1025
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,720
What kind of pig talk is this?

1026
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,720
Eating pork rises to this level.

1027
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,720
Pig talk?

1028
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,720
Yes, I also think it's pig talk.

1029
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,720
In fact, in the court and the palace,

1030
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
there are many businessmen who are in the East and West

1031
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,720
with the name of the roll.

1032
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,720
I think the profit of the original Jiu Si

1033
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,720
is not just in the hands of their owners.

1034
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,720
Then do you want us to win or do they win?

1035
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,720
I bet you win.

1036
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,720
I bet you win.

1037
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,720
I bet you win.

1038
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,720
I bet you win.

1039
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,720
I bet you win.

1040
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,720
I bet you win.

1041
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,720
I bet you win.

1042
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,720
I bet you win.

1043
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,720
I bet you win.

1044
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,720
I bet you win.

1045
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,720
I bet you win.

1046
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,720
I bet you win.

1047
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,720
I bet you win.

1048
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,720
I bet you win.

1049
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,720
I bet you win.

1050
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,720
I bet you win.

1051
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,720
I bet you win.

1052
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,720
I bet you win.

1053
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,720
I bet you win.

1054
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,720
I bet you win.

1055
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,720
I bet you win.

1056
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,720
I bet you win.

1057
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,720
I bet you win.

1058
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
I bet you win.

1059
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,720
I bet you win.

1060
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,720
I bet you win.

1061
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,720
I bet you win.

1062
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,720
I bet you win.

1063
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,720
I bet you win.

1064
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,720
I bet you win.

1065
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,720
I bet you win.

1066
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,720
I bet you win.

1067
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,720
I bet you win.

1068
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,720
I bet you win.

1069
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,720
I bet you win.

1070
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,720
I bet you win.

1071
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,720
I bet you win.

1072
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,720
I bet you win.

1073
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,720
I bet you win.

1074
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,720
I bet you win.

1075
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,720
I bet you win.

1076
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
I bet you win.

1077
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,720
I bet you win.

1078
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,720
I bet you win.

1079
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,720
I bet you win.

1080
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,720
