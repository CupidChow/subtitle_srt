1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,960
It's fantastic!

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 9

3
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,440
We're finally going back.

4
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,440
I'm a little reluctant.

5
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,440
Yeah, we're used to living in Yongan.

6
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,880
I'm sure you'll miss your ancestors when you go back.

7
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,880
Here we go!

8
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,880
Smells so good!

9
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,880
The moon is full.

10
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,880
As long as our ancestors are moved by the spring water and lamb,

11
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,880
we can go back.

12
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,880
Here they come.

13
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,880
Hurry up!

14
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,880
Welcome, young master!

15
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,880
I thought it was just a regular meal.

16
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,880
But it's so big.

17
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,880
And they even made some good food.

18
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,880
It's special to have you.

19
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,880
Let's go.

20
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,880
Please sit down, young master.

21
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,880
Sit down.

22
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,880
Sit down.

23
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,880
All of you.

24
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,880
Chief Liu, sit down.

25
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,880
I...

26
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,320
I'll...

27
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,320
Sit down, please.

28
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,320
Okay.

29
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,320
Young master, please try it.

30
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,320
We made it for you.

31
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Please.

32
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,320
Then...

33
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,320
I'll try it.

34
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Thank you.

35
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,320
It's delicious.

36
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,320
Yeah!

37
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,320
Come on!

38
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
Come on!

39
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,320
Come on!

40
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,320
Yeah!

41
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Come on!

42
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,320
Come on!

43
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,600
Go, go, go.

44
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,440
Now Shen Nianzi has no worries.

45
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,760
You can also propose to the Shen family.

46
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,240
Since you are all here,

47
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,000
I have something to discuss with you.

48
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,440
What a coincidence!

49
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,400
We have something to tell you, too.

50
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,120
You go first.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,480
I won't interrupt.

52
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,040
Please go ahead, Uncle.

53
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,600
No, no.

54
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,080
You go first.

55
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,480
Uncle first.

56
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,120
You go first.

57
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,320
What about you, Aunt?

58
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,560
I'll go first.

59
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,160
Shao Yin, we have prepared a farewell gift for you.

60
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,920
A...

61
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,960
We made this dress especially for you.

62
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,040
We made it ourselves.

63
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,280
I hope you will always be healthy.

64
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes, Shao Yin.

65
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,760
And we made these lamps especially for you.

66
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,560
We hope to light up your future.

67
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,320
Yes.

68
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,560
Shao Yin, I have a gift for you, too.

69
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,680
I made this dress myself.

70
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,280
I even made a fan for you.

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,440
Fan?

72
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,240
I guess it means that you want to put me in this position.

73
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,400
That's right.

74
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,120
You are always the most important person in our family.

75
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,760
Thank you.

76
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,040
But you said it was a farewell gift.

77
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,320
Is it...

78
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,520
Well, Shao Yin.

79
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,800
We have been here for a long time.

80
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,160
We should go back to our hometown.

81
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,120
So we prepared some gifts for you.

82
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,360
We made them ourselves.

83
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,880
I hope you will live a comfortable life.

84
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,800
We even cleaned up your yard and your house.

85
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,080
I hope you won't mind.

86
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,600
Shao Yin.

87
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,440
We have troubled you a lot.

88
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,600
We are very grateful.

89
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,800
Let's toast to you.

90
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,080
Come on.

91
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,360
To Shao Yin.

92
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,840
Stop standing there.

93
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,240
Let's eat.

94
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,360
Sit down.

95
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
Sit down.

96
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,800
Enjoy your meal.

97
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
Thank you.

98
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
Yang Yang.

99
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Here.

100
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
Thank you.

101
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,240
You said you had something to tell us.

102
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,640
What is it?

103
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,960
It's nothing.

104
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,040
I don't want to talk about it.

105
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,360
Then let's eat.

106
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Here.

107
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,880
Mr. Liu, try this.

108
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
Thank you.

109
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,680
This is the recipe for rice tofu.

110
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,680
I'll leave it to you.

111
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,560
Keep it.

112
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,400
Don't forget to eat after we leave.

113
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,560
You can't be busy with work.

114
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
Aunt.

115
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,400
These lights look like fireflies.

116
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,280
What are fireflies?

117
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,320
They are fireflies.

118
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
Fireflies.

119
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
Yang Yang.

120
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,400
I know a place that can see fireflies.

121
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
Do you want to go?

122
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,440
I do.

123
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,520
Where is it?

124
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,360
I'll take you there after we finish eating.

125
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
Okay.

126
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,800
Please take care of Yang Yang for me.

127
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
Let's go.

128
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,760
But we are going out now.

129
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,240
We are breaking the curfew.

130
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
We can go out from the back door.

131
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,600
We can avoid the night view.

132
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,120
The night view of the River Cang is the most famous in Yongan.

133
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,840
You are leaving soon.

134
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,560
If you don't go,

135
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,360
you won't have a chance.

136
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,840
Let's eat first.

137
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,400
We'll talk when we are full.

138
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,080
It's so beautiful.

139
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,600
So many.

140
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,800
Uncle Sha Yin.

141
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,680
When I go back,

142
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,920
I'll see fireflies and believe you.

143
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,280
What do you mean, Uncle Sha Yin?

144
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,560
Don't call me that.

145
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
I love you.

146
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Go, go.

147
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,240
Brother, I found fireflies.

148
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,040
Yang Yang, don't catch them.

149
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,040
Fireflies will die if you keep them for a day.

150
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,520
How nice it is for you to let them free.

151
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Yes.

152
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,160
I wish you

153
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
freedom and freedom.

154
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,760
Freedom and freedom?

155
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
That's the biggest wish I've ever made.

156
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,200
To be honest,

157
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,400
when I first met you,

158
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
I thought you were a...

159
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
You were a senior officer.

160
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,000
I thought I should offer you a drink.

161
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,320
But after getting along with you,

162
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,200
I realized you were cold and warm.

163
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,360
Now I feel

164
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,960
you're like a friend.

165
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,920
But I'm just a passerby in Yongan City.

166
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,240
I don't belong here.

167
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,800
So I've decided

168
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,000
not to make friends here.

169
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,280
What a coincidence.

170
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Me too.

171
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
Then...

172
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,040
we're not friends.

173
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Brother!

174
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,800
Brother, look at the bear!

175
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
It's so beautiful!

176
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Mr. Liu,

177
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,400
I have a big favor to ask you.

178
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
It could be a lifelong favor.

179
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

180
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Sure.

181
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Well,

182
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
after the meeting,

183
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
I've received

184
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,400
a lot of internship from Yongan's female interns.

185
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,400
I mainly work with the professional and the fake.

186
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
I'm very interested in you.

187
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
I'm very interested in you.

188
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
I'm very interested in you.

189
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
I'm very interested in you.

190
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,400
I'm very interested in you.

191
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
I'm very interested in you.

192
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
I don't know much about you.

193
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
So I'd like to ask you

194
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
to help me understand.

195
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Let me see.

196
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
This is a compliment to Shen Lang.

197
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
He's very talented.

198
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
He was very popular that day.

199
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
This is a compliment to you.

200
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
You're very handsome and elegant.

201
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Really?

202
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
What?

203
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
What is elegant?

204
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
This is even more impressive.

205
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
This is even more impressive.

206
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,400
This lady has given you a lot of love.

207
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
Let me see.

208
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Give me one.

209
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Did you send these letters to the wrong place?

210
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
This is unbelievable.

211
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
If I knew it was like this,

212
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
I should have said something

213
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,400
with a little bit of insight.

214
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
I should have got some fans.

215
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
What are you doing?

216
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
I'm sorry.

217
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
I'm sorry.

218
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,400
Here's another one.

219
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
What is the best?

220
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
What is the best?

221
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
You...

222
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
I didn't expect that

223
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
people here are so talented.

224
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
I'm a little bit embarrassed.

225
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
I want to do this with love.

226
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
I don't care about my life.

227
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,400
I want to live on these.

228
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
I said...

229
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
Where are you?

230
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,400
You don't understand me at all.

231
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
According to my script,

232
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
we were on a full moon night,

233
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,400
and touched the ancestors with a bowl of perfect lamb.

234
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Then the moon was getting smoother,

235
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
and we fell asleep.

236
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
We woke up and returned to the modern era.

237
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,400
We've been making money here

238
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
for several years.

239
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
To be honest,

240
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
I think the money in the ancient times

241
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
is much better than the modern ones.

242
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,400
I can't bear to leave Yongan.

243
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
Yes.

244
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Although there are no electronic games,

245
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
and no modern luxury,

246
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
the money is better.

247
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
Mom, I'm like this.

248
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
When I come back to the modern era,

249
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
I can't find a job.

250
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
And our restaurant is not working.

251
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,400
I can't do it.

252
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
Look at me.

253
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,400
We can't do it.

254
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,400
We can make some food here.

255
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
And we can make money.

256
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
And I can have so many fans.

257
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,400
That's great.

258
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,400
What you said is not important.

259
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,400
I heard that the first birthday competition

260
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
will be held in Yongan next year.

261
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
If we can stay there,

262
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,400
I can get a place in our family.

263
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
If I can get a place,

264
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
I can have a lot of fans.

265
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,400
If I can get a place,

266
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,400
I can have more fans than you.

267
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,400
Enough.

268
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
You're talking nonsense.

269
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
I know you're a genius.

270
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
You're not finished.

271
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
You're still a genius.

272
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Actually, I think my dad is right.

273
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,400
Look at my dad.

274
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
He's a little bit of a genius.

275
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
He's definitely an idol.

276
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Right?

277
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
Actually, I like Yongan too.

278
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
Because there are ancestors who take me.

279
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,400
How about we just don't go back?

280
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
I just said it randomly.

281
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
It doesn't mean anything else.

282
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Actually, it's not impossible.

283
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,400
Actually, it's not reasonable.

284
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
But my aunt's ancestors

285
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,400
said a lot of things.

286
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,400
What if she finds out?

287
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,400
It's almost time.

288
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Don't think too much.

289
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
Let's go back.

290
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
There are so many golds in the country.

291
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
The days will get better.

292
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Okay.

293
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,400
I'm going back with the love of my fans.

294
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
Take it.

295
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Take it.

296
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Take it.

297
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Take it.

298
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Take it.

299
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Shao Ying is in our family's heart.

300
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
Always in the most important position.

301
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Ice.

302
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Night.

303
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,400
She's the celestial wife in our family.

304
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,400
She's thinking about her daughter.

305
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,400
The god of love.

306
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,400
God of love.

307
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
I feel like my family will be alive.

308
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,120
I finally found likeness e-mails and a cheap 바로 arrange for gold.

309
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,760
Miss.

310
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,600
What are you doing here?

311
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,600
I'm sorry, but you were all sleeping in the yard yesterday.

312
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,600
I was worried that you were all drunk and cold.

313
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,600
So I quickly sent you back to your rooms.

314
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Let's think from another angle.

315
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Actually, from the beginning,

316
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,200
all the tricks we used to go back were all made up by us.

317
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
We've tried it all.

318
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Since we really can't go back now,

319
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,200
does it mean that we can only face reality?

320
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Staying...

321
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
is actually quite good.

322
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,200
I'm not stupid in modern times.

323
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,200
But in ancient times, I was quite popular.

324
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,200
And now it seems that the ancestors are quite good.

325
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
How about...

326
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,200
Let's just stay and have a little party.

327
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
Enjoy the sound of modern music.

328
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Maybe we'll get rich.

329
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,200
Shen Gong Cai, what time is it? Why are you still thinking about this?

330
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
I'm not.

331
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Right, your sister is right.

332
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Your thinking about lying down is definitely wrong.

333
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,200
You have to think positively when you're doing things, right?

334
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
But...

335
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,200
if there's really something that's not good enough,

336
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
and it really makes us unable to go back,

337
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,200
then if I take part in the competition,

338
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,200
and get the first place in Yongan,

339
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
that would be great.

340
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
The first place in Yongan!

341
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,200
So you don't want to go back?

342
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
Ji,

343
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,200
all these years, your father didn't get much money from his family.

344
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Our family is having a hard time.

345
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
If we can really stay in Yongan,

346
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,200
at least our family has some material security.

347
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,200
I'm not sure if I can go back.

348
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,200
I'm not sure if I can go back.

349
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,200
I'm not sure if I can go back.

350
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,200
But we have material security now.

351
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
That makes sense.

352
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,200
Let's eat!

353
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Master.

354
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,200
Eat up!

355
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Eat!

356
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
Eat!

357
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Eat up!

358
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
Eat up!

359
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
Eat up!

360
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
Eat up!

361
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
Eat up!

362
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Uncle, you must be tired.

363
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200
Master, after you finish eating,

364
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
I have a request.

365
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,200
You can tell me what you want.

366
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Okay.

367
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
I...

368
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,200
Actually...

369
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,200
I'll tell you later.

370
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Wait.

371
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,200
Please.

372
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Brother Shui,

373
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
you tell me.

374
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Actually, we want...

375
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Actually...

376
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Forget it.

377
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
You can be my sleepwalker.

378
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Master, we have something to tell you.

379
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
We have something to tell you.

380
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
But it's okay.

381
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Master, are you hungry?

382
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
I'll cook something for you.

383
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,200
It looks like enough for me.

384
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Yes.

385
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Then, please enjoy.

386
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
What's so difficult?

387
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
You just said you wanted to leave,

388
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,200
now you want to come back and live in Yunshuiyuan.

389
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
I...

390
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
I guessed it right.

391
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,200
Actually, we did encounter some problems.

392
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,200
We can't leave for now.

393
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
I'm sorry, Master.

394
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,200
We can't find a place to go.

395
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,200
So we can only stay here for now.

396
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
We've decided.

397
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
We've made a lot of money.

398
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
We're going to rent a shop and open a market.

399
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
We'll earn a lot.

400
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,200
We can rent a shop and open a market.

401
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Then we can earn more.

402
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
So we can live in your house for free.

403
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,200
So we can pay your rent.

404
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
What do you think, Master?

405
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Rent a house in your house.

406
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
If it's known,

407
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,200
it's like the salary I gave you.

408
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,200
This...

409
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Take it back.

410
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Leave it.

411
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,200
When you have time, make me a bowl of rice tofu.

412
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Don't worry.

413
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,200
We'll take care of your meals.

414
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Shen!

415
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Thank you, Master!

416
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
You know that the Shen family won't leave.

417
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
Are you at ease?

418
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
No.

419
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
No?

420
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,200
You're so happy that you're holding hands.

421
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,200
I...

422
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,200
I'm holding hands and feet?

423
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
Why are you hiding so far away?

424
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
I'm not hiding so far away.

425
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
I'm waiting for you to clean up.

426
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
How could you?

427
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,200
We came out of the Cui family together.

428
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
You're the best brother in my life.

429
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,200
How could I steal your money

430
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,200
and laugh at you?

431
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
No way.

432
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,200
You're so funny.

433
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
You said I was your best brother.

434
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
You're a liar.

435
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
I'm not lying.

436
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,200
You're the best brother in my life.

437
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Hailan, Hailan.

438
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,200
You've been using this trick since childhood.

439
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
I've been watching you.

440
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,200
You've grown up.

441
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,200
But I haven't seen you like this for many years.

442
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
After the Shen family came,

443
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
you've been so relaxed.

444
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,200
But you should get married.

445
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
You're not a good teacher.

446
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
You won't tell others even if you know.

447
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
But if others

448
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
follow the Shen family,

449
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
your identity will be in danger.

450
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
What's wrong?

451
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
I'm not sleepy.

452
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
I just can't sleep these days.

453
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,200
You should go back now.

454
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
I'm going to bed.

455
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
I'll see you later.

456
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
Bye.

457
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
I'll be back in a while.

458
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
If there's any difficulty,

459
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,200
I'm still a young master of Jingzhao.

460
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
Maybe I can help you.

461
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Duanxi, I'm really fine.

462
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,200
I'm going back now.

463
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
I'll see you later.

464
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Bye.

465
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Bye.

466
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
Come on, come on.

467
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,200
Look, it's so lively.

468
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,200
Yes, yes, yes.

469
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,200
Look, there are many delicious things.

470
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Yes.

471
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
They say that the world's best food is in Yongan.

472
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
The family of Yongan is in Ju Xian.

473
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
If you want to eat,

474
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
you should come here.

475
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
Look, in front of us

476
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
are two famous restaurants in Ju Xian.

477
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
The first one is called Yinglai Jiu Si.

478
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,200
The most luxurious restaurant in Yongan.

479
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
All the guests are nobodies.

480
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
You can eat anything you want.

481
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,200
You can taste everything here.

482
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,200
Look, the second one is Guixiang Jiu Lou.

483
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
The third generation of the Liu family is Jin Yun.

484
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Now it's the responsibility of Liu Feng and Liu San Lang.

485
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
What's important is the character.

486
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
The most popular dish among the scholars.

487
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
What a wonderful dish.

488
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
On the wall of the west side of the Jiu Lou,

489
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,200
there are the most famous words of the poet Yongan.

490
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
The oil smells good.

491
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,200
The dish is very delicious.

492
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,200
The family of Hang?

493
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,200
You have the characteristics of the two families.

494
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Good girl.

495
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,200
Dad.

496
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
Aunt, you are so good.

497
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,200
This is called good?

498
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,200
Oh my god.

499
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,200
The cooks of the Jiu Si in Yunlai

500
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
love to cook fried food.

501
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,200
Guixiang Jiu Lou is made of steamed rice.

502
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,200
It's steamed rice.

503
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,200
It's very delicious.

504
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
I don't believe it.

505
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
You don't believe it?

506
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
When I open this restaurant,

507
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,200
the two restaurants will be no match.

508
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,200
If you bring me again...

509
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
Come on, come on.

510
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,200
We have to see the front.

511
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,200
Mom, my dad won't care about me.

512
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,200
This is the one.

513
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,200
This is the closest to the center of the city

514
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
in the shopping mall.

515
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,200
It's 400 yuan a month.

516
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
400 yuan?

517
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Remember, money is not the problem.

518
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,200
The problem is

519
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,200
the shop is too ordinary.

520
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,200
Is there anything better?

521
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,200
Yes, yes, yes.

522
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,200
This is good.

523
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
This is the money.

524
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,200
I have to support the store.

525
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Right?

526
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,200
I knew it.

527
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,200
You are so kind.

528
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,200
500 yuan.

529
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,200
So big.

530
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,200
Is there anything better?

531
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,200
Is there anything better?

532
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,200
Yes, yes, yes.

533
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,200
Let me see.

534
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,200
This way.

535
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,200
This is the best one

536
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,200
in the giant shopping mall.

537
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,200
800 yuan a month.

538
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,200
It's small.

539
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
It's still small.

540
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
It's still small.

541
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
Mr. Shen.

542
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
Miss Shen.

543
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Come with me.

544
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,200
What?

545
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
What's wrong with you?

546
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
I'm busy.

547
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Time is money.

548
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Mr. Shen.

549
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Did you float?

550
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
I didn't float.

551
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Did you think about the size?

552
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
You are still small.

553
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,200
I didn't.

554
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
I was planning.

555
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Do you have that brain?

556
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
Don't argue.

557
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Mr. Shen.

558
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
What are you doing?

559
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,200
I'm sorry.

560
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,200
I'm sorry.

561
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,200
Shut up.

562
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,200
I heard.

563
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,200
Madam.

564
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
Excuse me.

565
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
Can you find us another room?

566
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,200
The room is not too big.

567
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
You should have told me.

568
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Yes.

569
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
Money.

570
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
Come on.

571
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Look at this one.

572
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,200
This is the shop of Mr. Kang Yuan.

573
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,200
It's a big business.

574
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,200
It's small.

575
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,200
It's 300 yuan a month.

576
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,200
But there is one thing.

577
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,200
Mr. Kang Yuan likes food.

578
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
So he wants to make this shop

579
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,200
a restaurant.

580
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,200
Who is Mr. Kang Yuan?

581
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
You don't know who Mr. Kang Yuan is?

582
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,200
No.

583
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,200
He is the most famous food master in Yongan.

584
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
Do you know the annual chef's meeting?

585
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
That's his brush.

586
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,200
The chef's competition?

587
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Madam.

588
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,200
How about this?

589
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
We'll pay you a year's rent.

590
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
How about 250 yuan a month?

591
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
Honey.

592
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Have you thought about it?

593
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
What is this?

594
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
It's a good deal.

595
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
280 yuan.

596
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,200
It's not a big deal.

597
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
Madam, you are a good person.

598
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
You have a lot of money.

599
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
250 yuan.

600
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
265 yuan.

601
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,200
There is a attic in the backyard.

602
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,200
It's not repaired.

603
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
It's 250 yuan.

604
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Okay.

605
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,200
You are really good at business.

606
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
No.

607
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
Let's make a good deal.

608
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
Madam.

609
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,200
The backyard is connected to the alley.

610
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
When you expand it,

611
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,200
you will have half of the shop.

612
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
Expand?

613
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
You can do this?

614
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,200
No one cares.

615
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Who cares?

616
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
The back alley is still good.

617
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,200
Don't worry.

618
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
It's not going to happen.

619
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,200
Okay.

620
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
Let's sign the contract.

621
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Okay.

622
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,200
Let's go.

623
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,200
I can't.

624
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,200
It's not like that.

625
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,200
It's like the two most famous shops.

626
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Guixiang restaurant and the former bar.

627
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
They are all big.

628
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
If we really want to investigate,

629
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
we can't know who is behind it.

630
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,200
How about...

631
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,200
you just do it?

632
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
I can't do it

633
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
without the order of the young master.

634
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,200
Come on, A Ji.

635
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,200
How is the shop we chose?

636
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
Is it good?

637
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,200
And it's big.

638
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,200
A Ji,

639
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,200
you should find someone to make a pot for me.

640
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,200
I don't use the pot here.

641
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,200
There are many places to do this.

642
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
A Ji,

643
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,200
you have many ideas.

644
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,200
You can see how to renovate this place.

645
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,200
A Ji,

646
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,200
the maid said we can expand it.

647
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,200
Of course.

648
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,200
I'm afraid it will be checked.

649
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,200
You should take care of it.

650
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,200
Aunt,

651
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,200
you seem to be unhappy.

652
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
Are you still laughing at the present?

653
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,200
Here is the candy for you.

654
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,200
Thank you, Yangyang.

655
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,200
A Ji,

656
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,200
you should accept the reality.

657
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,200
Think about it.

658
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,200
Our restaurant will close down sooner or later.

659
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,200
What else can we do?

660
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,200
What else is worth your attention?

661
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,200
Is it your account with only 200 fans

662
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,200
or your ex-boyfriend?

663
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,200
A Ji,

664
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,200
I didn't see this place at first.

665
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
But I thought about it later.

666
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,200
It's not bad.

667
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
Think about it.

668
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,200
Our restaurant is not even a third of the size.

669
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,200
This place can make money.

670
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,200
And our ancestors bless us.

671
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,200
It's good.

672
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,200
A Ji,

673
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,200
tell me why you want to go back.

674
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,200
It's nothing.

675
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
Just tell me.

676
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,200
Don't be sad.

677
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,200
Tell me.

678
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,200
I just don't understand

679
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,200
why I came to this place.

680
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,200
I worked day and night.

681
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
I saved some money

682
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,200
and bought a washing machine.

683
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,200
It cost me more than 3000 yuan.

684
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,200
I never used it.

685
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,200
I was told that I should be

686
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,200
a good businesswoman.

687
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,200
I should learn how to give people

688
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,200
a good treatment.

689
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,200
I can't go out at night.

690
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,200
Yes, I can.

691
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,200
But I can't go out.

692
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,200
I can't go out.

693
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,200
You're used to it.

694
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,200
You don't want to go back.

695
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Don't worry.

696
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,200
We just started.

697
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,200
Maybe we'll go back

698
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,200
one day.

699
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
A Ji, don't worry.

700
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,200
You should

701
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,200
take it easy.

702
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Yes, we're getting started.

703
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,200
We're getting started.

704
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,200
If we can't go back,

705
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,200
we'll...

706
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,200
Aunt, maybe

707
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,200
I'll get used to it.

708
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,200
It'll be fine in a few days.

709
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,200
Yes, in a few days.

710
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Don't worry.

711
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
I really want to

712
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,200
survive in this world.

713
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,200
But what can I do

714
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,200
if I stay here?

715
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,200
Help!

716
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,200
Help!

717
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
Someone, help!

718
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,200
Identification

719
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,200
I tried to save myself

720
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
from this cook's hand

721
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
But the size of То,

722
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,960
the way forward

723
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,140
and appearance

724
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,960
i was scared

725
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,400
hidden behind

726
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,940
censhr 관

727
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,000
concurrently

728
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,140
if not for the sad heart

729
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:18,060
What has passed away
