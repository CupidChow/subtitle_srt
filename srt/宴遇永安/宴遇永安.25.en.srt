1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,260
The pop star

47
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,260
Just like a pop star

48
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,260
Now, we have another grand finale!

49
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,340
A grand finale...

50
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,340
To become the pop star

51
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,420
so I can impress you too!

52
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,400
Just like a pop star

53
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,400
To become the pop star

54
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,400
The problem is when I entered the bar,

55
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,000
I should have gone in first to see if it was a proper place.

56
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,200
If it's not proper, don't come in.

57
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,400
You still don't believe my character after so many years?

58
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,000
Come, sit here.

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,200
Then we can't do it.

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,400
Sit.

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,200
Sit.

62
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,200
Shen Jiansheng.

63
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,400
Do you still remember how many years we've been married?

64
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
It should be...

65
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,800
20...

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,000
33 years.

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,200
We've been together since modern times.

69
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,200
We've been together for so many years.

70
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,200
I thought our days would be better.

71
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,800
Our feelings would also get stronger.

72
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,400
But now,

73
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,400
I don't recognize you anymore.

74
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,000
Fengxia, this is what I wanted to tell you.

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm also concerned about this.

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,600
Yangyang told me that

77
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,000
after we came to Yongan,

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,600
you became a great chef.

79
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,000
Gongcai has a lot of fans.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,800
Aji is also doing well.

81
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,800
But Grandma seems unhappy and doesn't make any progress.

82
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,000
I felt really bad when I heard it.

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,600
The reason I said you should get to know us again

84
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
is because you want to see our progress.

85
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,600
You have to see our good side.

86
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,600
You told me personally

87
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,600
that I have a bad temper.

88
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
I only hit you,

89
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
scolded you,

90
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
slapped you, and kicked you.

91
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Do you know why?

92
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Sister,

93
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
I don't have money.

94
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Life is hard.

95
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
How can you be in a good mood?

96
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,600
I don't understand.

97
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
I have money now.

98
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
What do you mean?

99
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
I don't understand.

100
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Since we came to Yongan,

101
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
you have all gotten better.

102
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Only me is still busy every day.

103
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
I don't have my own life.

104
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
I can't help but shout

105
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,600
and get angry when I'm in a hurry.

106
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
I haven't changed at all.

107
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
I am very pitiful.

108
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,600
I lost my family.

109
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
I am very pitiful, right?

110
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
You...

111
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Shen Jiansheng,

112
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,600
do you remember how I looked when I was young?

113
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
I remember.

114
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
I was very good.

115
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
I was pretty.

116
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,600
But my personality was always like this.

117
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
I was always scolding and hitting me.

118
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,600
I really forgot everything.

119
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
When we were together,

120
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
you said you liked me and I was gentle.

121
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
It's because you can't make money.

122
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
I've been arguing.

123
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,600
That's why I became like this today.

124
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,600
After coming to Yongan,

125
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,600
everything you did was right.

126
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Nothing happened next time.

127
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Everything you did was perfect.

128
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Including the dishes you cooked,

129
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,600
they were all top-notch.

130
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Do you believe it?

131
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Forget it.

133
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
I was wrong about you.

134
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
This...

135
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Xiu Shu!

136
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Old Master!

137
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
According to the news provided by the wife,

138
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Mr. Cao caught a pair of people from the Dou family.

139
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Dou family?

140
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Let's go.

141
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
The people from the Ministry of Justice said

142
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,600
that my brother and I had a friendship.

143
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
If we are caught,

144
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
it's up to you.

145
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
You're also an official.

146
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
You're afraid that

147
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
your appearance will be ruined

148
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
if you take the punishment?

149
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Who is the one who has a scar on your body?

150
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,600
Who can prove that I'm the one who used the death penalty?

151
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,600
You!

152
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Dou Shi Ba,

153
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
from the Fengling Town of Yuanji.

154
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Six years ago,

155
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
Jin Wuwei joined the army.

156
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,600
He died of illness.

157
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
On the other hand,

158
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
you're a dead man.

159
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Who would come to investigate a dead man?

160
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
Could it be

161
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,600
someone behind you?

162
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
I really can't ask for it.

163
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
I understand.

164
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Your purpose is to find someone behind me.

165
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Okay. I'll tell you.

166
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
The person behind me

167
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,600
is me!

168
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
You little bastard!

169
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
I won't let you get away with it!

170
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
You used the death penalty.

171
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
You're also fighting for the person.

172
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Take him! I can take it!

173
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
You don't even dare to take the blood.

174
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
What can you do to me?

175
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
All the people under your command

176
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
have already been executed.

177
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,600
They were all with you in your death.

178
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
What a great way to get away with it.

179
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,600
It's a pity that they can't be with you.

180
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
You... What are you going to do?

181
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
What are you going to do?

182
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
How dare you?

183
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,600
How dare you?

184
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,600
The person behind me won't let you get away with it!

185
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
You little bastards!

186
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
You bastards!

187
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
You bastards!

188
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
You bastards!

189
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
No!

190
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
No!

191
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
The person behind me

192
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
won't let you get away with it!

193
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
No!

194
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
No!

195
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
It's all over.

196
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
You've seen the whole thing.

197
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
It's really him.

198
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
A few wood balls

199
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
and some smoke.

200
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
The person behind me

201
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
scared the person behind him.

202
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
But he

203
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
and that person

204
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
have already been executed.

205
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
The knife house keeps sending money

206
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
to him.

207
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
They want so much money

208
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
just to keep these people

209
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
and seal their own jade.

210
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
The salt and iron

211
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
are all controlled.

212
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
The King of Zhao needs these

213
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
and food.

214
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Dou Shi Ba is responsible

215
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
for sending money.

216
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
According to him,

217
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
things everywhere

218
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
will be leaked by a street person.

219
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
They are very careful.

220
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Dou Shi Ba won't see the street person.

221
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
The two sides meet at the same place

222
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
and choose the ghost city.

223
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
The street person only sent his followers

224
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
to come.

225
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
The ghost city is afraid that the gold house is not captured

226
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
and there is no certain location.

227
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
It's hard for us to fight.

228
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
But Dou Shi Ba has a good eye.

229
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,600
He followed the follower

230
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
and knew that person was in the ghost town.

231
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Ghost town?

232
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Ghost town?

233
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
The Ministry of Justice caught a group of troublemakers.

234
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
They are gathering in a street.

235
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
I came

236
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
to remind you

237
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
to be careful.

238
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
I'm done.

239
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
You can go back.

240
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Okay.

241
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
Thank you, Young Master.

242
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
You knew about

243
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
the Ministry of Justice so soon.

244
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
You even came to remind us to be careful.

245
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,600
I came here to do my duty

246
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
and to ensure the safety of the ghost town.

247
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,600
Is the way they are going to the ghost town

248
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,600
related to Shao Yin's case?

249
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,600
We know more about this side.

250
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,600
We can help investigate.

251
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
It's none of your business.

252
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
I see.

253
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
I'll go first.

254
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,600
Shao Yin, wait a minute.

255
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
Shao Yin, wait a minute.

256
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Shao Yin, you're busy.

257
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Did you forget to eat again?

258
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
This is called He Fan.

259
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
It's very convenient to eat.

260
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
You made it?

261
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Yes.

262
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
This is the package I made.

263
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
The package means

264
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
that you can take away

265
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,600
the food that you can't finish.

266
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,600
You can take it with you.

267
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
Shao Yin, you came to

268
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
tell us the news in person.

269
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
We are very grateful.

270
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
If you're willing,

271
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
we will send you food again.

272
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Thank you.

273
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
But you don't have to send food.

274
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Just take care of yourself.

275
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,600
Mrs. Shen.

276
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,600
Come in.

277
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
Lao Jun, I didn't eavesdrop.

278
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
I didn't hear it.

279
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Why did you refuse to

280
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,600
send food to Mrs. Shen's family?

281
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
You're not angry anymore.

282
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,600
Welcome.

283
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,600
You're really good at making up.

284
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
You should save money and spend.

285
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
The discounted buff is on sale.

286
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,600
You can buy it at the price of 11.

287
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Thank you.

288
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
You're welcome.

289
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Thank you.

290
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,600
Thank you.

291
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,600
We're back.

292
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
You're back.

293
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
You've worked hard, Yuan.

294
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
You still have to pick up Yang Yang to school.

295
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Let's find another person as soon as possible.

296
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
It's not hard.

297
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Get out.

298
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Yang Yang seems to be a little unhappy.

299
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
He didn't talk all the way.

300
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Your mouth is oiled.

301
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Tell your aunt who's going to

302
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
make trouble for our baby.

303
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Today, everyone knows

304
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
their father.

305
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
My father is very good.

306
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
He's the only one

307
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
who makes money outside.

308
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,600
It's been a long time since he came back.

309
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,600
But they all say

310
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
I'm still a kid.

311
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
How can a kid talk nonsense?

312
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
It's okay.

313
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
They don't understand anything.

314
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Don't cry.

315
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
You told me

316
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
that although my father is very stupid

317
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
and doesn't hurt,

318
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
he loves me very much.

319
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
He won't stop loving me.

320
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
But

321
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,600
he didn't play a role in Guiyang.

322
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
How can I not tell him

323
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
that something really happened to him?

324
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
No, no.

325
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Your father is a fool.

326
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,600
He's a fool.

327
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
He'll be fine.

328
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
You have a letter, ma'am.

329
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Give it to me.

330
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,600
Why are you crying?

331
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,600
Your father must have a new one.

332
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600
Here you are.

333
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
It's my father.

334
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Dear family,

335
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
this letter came a little late.

336
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Because I spent a lot of time

337
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
in the industry.

338
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,600
My acting career is out of scale.

339
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
I have the capital to run

340
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
a small restaurant in the city.

341
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Everyone,

342
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
everyone, come and see me.

343
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Don't miss it.

344
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Please come and see.

345
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Everyone,

346
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
I'm the founder

347
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,600
of the famous Shenzha restaurant.

348
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,600
Have you heard about it?

349
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Yes.

350
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Meixia,

351
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
our Shenzha restaurant

352
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
is the second restaurant in Jingzhao.

353
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
We also gave the mayor

354
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
of the district a meal.

355
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
So what I brought today

356
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
is the famous

357
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
fried rice cake.

358
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Our fried rice cake

359
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
is very delicious.

360
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
It's only ten yuan per piece.

361
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Ten yuan?

362
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
I heard that

363
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
it's only ten yuan per piece.

364
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
But it's too expensive.

365
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
It's too expensive.

366
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
It's a lot.

367
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Today, in front of everyone,

368
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
I'll show you.

369
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
This is the fried rice cake.

370
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
This is the fried rice cake.

371
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Is this a paste?

372
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
No, our fried rice cake

373
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
is particular about paste and paste.

374
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
This way, it's crispy and crispy.

375
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
What is this?

376
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
This is

377
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,600
our legendary product.

378
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Have a taste.

379
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Try it.

380
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Try it.

381
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
My family,

382
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
I didn't expect that

383
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
the dishes in the restaurant

384
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
are all black.

385
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Everyone's enthusiasm can't be stopped.

386
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
It's delicious.

387
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
So I decided to promote the family alliance model.

388
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Let everyone participate in the meeting.

389
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,600
Let the Shenzha restaurant

390
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,600
be everywhere.

391
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
I believe that everyone

392
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,600
is a business elite.

393
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
They are all looking for

394
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
a good and promising project.

395
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
As the founder of the Shenzha restaurant,

396
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
I can tell you responsibly

397
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
that as long as you join our Shenzha restaurant,

398
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
you will be rich.

399
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Join? What do you mean?

400
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Lao Jun, what are you talking about?

401
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,600
We don't understand.

402
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
The so-called joining is

403
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,600
if you want to open the restaurant

404
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
you can have the sign of our restaurant.

405
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Then,

406
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
we will give you 500,000 yuan

407
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,600
for the month you open.

408
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,600
500,000 yuan?

409
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Don't believe him. He's a liar.

410
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
How can I be a liar?

411
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,600
You are so stupid.

412
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
I've found you several times.

413
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
You are the one who makes pancakes.

414
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
I'm not.

415
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
I can't do anything

416
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
if I make pancakes.

417
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
I can't develop more if I'm a talent like me.

418
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,600
You sell clothes and cakes.

419
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
Do you have a word of truth?

420
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Oh, right. I'm angry too.

421
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,600
I'm a liar.

422
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,600
I told you I didn't remember wrong.

423
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
What are you waiting for? Hurry up and arrest him.

424
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Stop running.

425
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Stop running.

426
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
Stop running.

427
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Stop running.

428
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Stop running.

429
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,600
The business of the restaurant is booming.

430
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,600
So,

431
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,600
I made many friends.

432
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
I can enter the restaurant smoothly.

433
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,600
I can enter the restaurant smoothly.

434
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,600
The book, the hair, the sword

435
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,600
are all the new stages

436
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,600
of the life.

437
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,600
Who doesn't have a child?

438
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,600
I'm so ashamed.

439
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,600
I'm so ashamed.

440
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
I'll go back and face Yang Yang.

441
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,600
I miss Yang Yang very much.

442
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
I hope he can go to school happily.

443
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
What's this?

444
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,600
What's this?

445
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,600
What's this?

446
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
I didn't hear anything.

447
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,600
Take a look.

448
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
What are you doing?

449
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
Thank you for your attention.

450
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
The business of our restaurant

451
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,600
is getting more and more popular.

452
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,600
But now, we are really too busy.

453
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
So, we posted an recruitment notice

454
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,600
to find a helper.

455
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,600
A chef who is currently recruiting

456
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,600
and asking to be a good cook

457
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,600
and a good disciple.

458
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,600
A good disciple?

459
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Then, we can just find a helper.

460
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
That's right.

461
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,600
We don't hire a helper.

462
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,600
And we don't need to sign a contract.

463
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,600
We just need to sign a labor contract.

464
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
A labor contract?

465
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,600
You can get paid by the month.

466
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
If you are unhappy, you can say it a month earlier.

467
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Then, you can resign.

468
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
Resign?

469
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
What's a labor contract?

470
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,600
Is this a lie?

471
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
This is not a lie.

472
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,600
I can sign a labor contract.

473
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
I can work for eight days a month.

474
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,600
And I can eat in the restaurant.

475
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
I can also raise a kitten.

476
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Sometimes, I get up later than the owner.

477
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Really?

478
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Isn't this a cross?

479
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,600
Why is it like a fan?

480
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
That's right.

481
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,600
What are you doing?

482
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
Why are you tearing it?

483
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,600
Others want to see it.

484
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
This kind of cross

485
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,600
is enough for me to walk.

486
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,600
This person is really a cross.

487
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Is this a cross?

488
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,600
This person is really a cross.

489
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,600
Young man, do you know cooking?

490
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,600
I don't understand.

491
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,600
You don't understand? Why are you tearing our Zhao Pingqi?

492
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
Then you should ask me this kind of nonsense.

493
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,600
I don't know cooking. Why am I here?

494
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,600
Young man,

495
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
don't just play with your mouth.

496
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Are you really capable?

497
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,600
Let's go eat.

498
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,360
The Master went on aete员

499
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:43,380
Hey, my folder has disappeared.

500
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,640
He's taking me back to the Sound and Color kindergarten Meiling Wah.

501
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,920
I also ate manifesto must practice.

502
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Okay, you are in that place?

503
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,240
I saw the letter!

504
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,060
Then…

505
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,500
I finished them.

506
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,900
Almost there!

507
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,220
So close!

508
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,800
が pasa

509
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:24,840
You win!

510
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,240
It's really good.

511
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
This fish is really good.

512
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,240
Mr. Pei.

513
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
This peacock is a new dish of our restaurant.

514
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,240
It's cooked by Mr. Yu.

515
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,240
Are you not satisfied with the taste?

516
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,240
No, no.

517
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,240
It's delicious.

518
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
It's very delicious.

519
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,240
Mrs. Shen,

520
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,240
you recommended your own cook like this.

521
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,240
Aren't you afraid that she will run away after she is famous?

522
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,240
That's her good ability.

523
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,240
It's my fortune to find her.

524
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,240
It's my ability to keep her.

525
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,240
In the New Year,

526
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Mr. Pei and the Princess Royal made a fuss.

527
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,240
It's not good yet.

528
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,240
The court is discussing

529
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,240
that she has disbanded all the men around her.

530
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,240
How can I let her go?

531
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,240
You are so confident.

532
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,240
Maybe the Princess is tired.

533
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,240
Or maybe those people made a mistake.

534
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,240
It's not necessarily related to you.

535
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
Yes.

536
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,240
Maybe it's like that.

537
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,240
So...

538
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,240
So it's still not related to me, right?

539
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
Mr. Pei,

540
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,240
you have the Princess in your heart.

541
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
Otherwise, you wouldn't laugh like this.

542
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,240
But what's the use?

543
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
It's like...

544
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240
It's like you and Anran

545
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,240
can see each other.

546
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,240
You are friends.

547
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,240
But now,

548
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
you don't look for each other.

549
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,240
Forget it.

550
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,240
Anyway,

551
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,240
she is going to get engaged to another Mrs. Shen.

552
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,240
Why do you mention this?

553
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,240
When she left the court,

554
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,240
Meng Xiang said that

555
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,240
Anran was going to be her grandson-in-law.

556
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,240
Actually,

557
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,240
we are the same.

558
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,240
We are all poor people

559
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,240
who have different opinions.

560
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
What are you talking about?

561
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
You heard everything.

562
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,240
Why do you want me to repeat it?

563
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,240
Good morning, dear Zhao!

564
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,240
Good morning.

565
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,240
What is...

566
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,240
It's time to wash my face and do the washing.

567
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,240
I will take a shower.

568
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,240
I have to go now.

569
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,240
réglage

570
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,240
It'sThere is so much time in bed.

571
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,160
Isn't this the Li Madam of the Shen Family?

572
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,360
Mr. He, Mr. He.

573
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,440
Li Li, I always see you busy in the temple.

574
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,800
Why are you free today?

575
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,600
Our family has a new palace.

576
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,760
I can do it.

577
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,800
I can get my hands out of the back door.

578
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,800
Great.

579
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,640
Look at the jewelry I got.

580
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,400
I also gave my wife some.

581
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,000
Really?

582
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,600
Look.

583
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,800
It's so beautiful.

584
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
The color is really good.

585
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,960
It's really good.

586
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,760
Let me tell you.

587
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,960
When I first came to Yongan,

588
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,760
I sold my gold bracelet.

589
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,760
I also wanted to buy a new one.

590
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
Let me try it.

591
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,960
It seems to be too small to wear.

592
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,080
But my hands

593
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,560
have been working for so many years.

594
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,360
My hands are getting thicker.

595
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,560
Let me tell you.

596
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,760
I was pretty when I was young.

597
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,560
Everything is wearing jewelry.

598
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,960
Not jewelry for people.

599
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,280
I can't do it now.

600
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,160
I'm old.

601
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,960
It's okay.

602
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,960
There are more beautiful things.

603
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,960
Try this.

604
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,960
This color is better.

605
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,960
You and my wife are familiar with each other.

606
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,960
She also said she was not beautiful.

607
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,960
Then I said,

608
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,960
is it because I'm too thin and not beautiful?

609
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
It's all my fault.

610
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,960
She likes jewelry.

611
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,960
I did this business.

612
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,960
She is happy when she wears it.

613
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,960
Women are beautiful when they are happy.

614
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,960
Look.

615
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
Mr. He, you are so good at talking.

616
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,960
Just for this,

617
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,960
I want all the jewelry in your stall.

618
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,960
All of them?

619
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,960
Yes.

620
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,960
I can make money now.

621
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,960
Why should I feel wronged?

622
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,960
I can buy everything I like.

623
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,960
I will be happy when I buy it.

624
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,960
I will be happy.

625
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Everyone is beautiful.

626
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Right?

627
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,960
You are right.

628
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,960
I will pack it for you.

629
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,960
Okay.

630
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
Come on.

631
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,960
Take it.

632
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,960
Pack this for me.

633
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,960
Okay.

634
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
Tell me.

635
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,960
Why am I so bad-tempered?

636
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,960
I don't know why you are so bad-tempered.

637
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,960
You are like this when you are in love.

638
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
You are like this when you are married.

639
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,960
You are still like this after you got married.

640
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,960
You beat me, pinched me, scolded me, and hit me.

641
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,960
What else do you know?

642
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,960
I am a man.

643
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
I have dignity.

644
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,960
You can't feel sorry for me.

645
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,960
Why can't you let me be?

646
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,960
Why can't you be nice to me?

647
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,960
You have changed since you came to Yongan.

648
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,960
Only me is still thinking about it.

649
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,960
I don't have my own life.

650
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,960
I can't help but shout and get angry when I am in a hurry.

651
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,960
I haven't changed at all.

652
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,960
How is it?

653
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,960
Is it beautiful?

654
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
It's really beautiful.

655
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,960
I think every one is suitable for you.

656
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
Okay.

657
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,960
Wrap this for me.

658
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
Okay.

659
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
I want this too.

660
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
These two.

661
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,960
Wrap both of them.

662
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,960
Okay.

663
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,960
I want them both.

664
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,960
Wrap them all for me.

665
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,960
Okay.

666
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,960
Here, take it.

667
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,960
Lady Li, I have wrapped them all.

668
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
Tell me if you get new goods next time.

669
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960
Okay.

670
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
Take care.

671
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,960
I am leaving.

672
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,960
Hold on.

673
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,960
So cool.

674
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,960
It's so cool to be 13 today.

675
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,960
So cool.

676
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
It's so cool to be 13 today.

677
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,960
Dad, where are you going?

678
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,960
You are not in the shop recently.

679
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,960
Mom is not in the shop either.

680
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
What are you busy with these days?

681
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,960
Your mom goes out alone recently.

682
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,960
I am afraid that something bad will happen to her.

683
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,960
I have to ensure her safety.

684
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,960
So I...

685
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
I will follow her.

686
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
No.

687
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,960
She goes out alone.

688
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960
She is rich now.

689
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,960
When a person is rich, he may change.

690
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,960
When he is rich, he may...

691
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
What?

692
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,960
No.

693
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
I mean...

694
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
What?

695
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,960
What if...

696
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,960
What if I have?

697
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,960
What did you find out?

698
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,960
I...

699
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,960
I...

700
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,960
I followed her for a day.

701
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
I saw her buying goods.

702
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,960
I didn't do anything.

703
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,960
I am speechless.

704
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,960
My mom didn't suspect you when she caught you going to the bar.

705
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,960
You are suspecting her.

706
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,960
She told you about this?

707
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,960
Say it.

708
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,960
I don't have any dignity anyway.

709
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,960
What else did she say?

710
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,960
My mom said that she knew you were not a man with a good heart.

711
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,960
I also think that...

712
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,960
You are not rich now.

713
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,960
You can't tell which is a good or bad.

714
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,960
You are just trying to get her wrong.

715
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,960
Yes.

716
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,960
That is a misunderstanding.

717
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,960
You are trying to get her wrong.

718
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
Sit down.

719
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
No.

720
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,960
Am I your dad or are you my mom?

721
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,960
Listen to me.

722
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
Say it.

723
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,960
Say it.

724
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
You didn't make any mistakes.

725
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,960
But you did make my mom sad.

726
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,960
I know it's not easy for you to raise me and Gongcai.

727
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,960
Especially my mom.

728
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,960
She is so old.

729
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,960
I have seen her old photos.

730
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,960
She is so beautiful.

731
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,960
When I was a kid, she liked to dress up.

732
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,960
But the family situation was not good.

733
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,960
She sold all the jewelry.

734
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,960
She left a gold ring and a gold bracelet.

735
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,960
After we came to the ancient times,

736
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,960
she sold these two for us.

737
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,960
Actually, after the restaurant opened,

738
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,960
I bought gold for my mom.

739
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,960
But you have to buy the ring and the bracelet.

740
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,960
What did you buy?

741
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,960
A big gem.

742
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,960
You can't even show it on the spot.

743
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,960
How sad mom must be.

744
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,960
My daughter.

745
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,960
Don't you know?

746
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,960
Your mom is cruel this time.

747
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
She doesn't want me.

748
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,960
She wrote a divorce letter to me.

749
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,960
I don't know.

750
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,960
When I was poor,

751
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,960
she didn't say she would leave me.

752
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,960
Now,

753
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,960
she finally has some money.

754
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,960
She said no.

755
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,960
I have a big brain.

756
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,960
I shouldn't have said that.

757
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,960
What did you say?

758
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,960
I said she has a bad temper.

759
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,960
She thinks I have no money.

760
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,960
I said she only beats me and scolds me.

761
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,960
She is always like that.

762
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,960
Is that what your mom is like when she is young?

763
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,960
Your mom is gentle when she is young.

764
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
I am really not good at it.

765
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,960
Your family and your nephew

766
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,960
have to rely on her.

767
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,960
Why did I forget it?

768
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,960
My daughter.

769
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,960
Don't say that.

770
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,960
Tell me.

771
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,960
Does your mom really want to divorce me?

772
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,960
If she really wants to divorce you,

773
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,960
I will support her.

774
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
How can you support her?

775
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
If you support her, you will have no father.

776
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,960
But think about it.

777
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
Mom has money now.

778
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,960
Why does she still live here?

779
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,960
Why didn't she buy a big house to live in?

780
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
You mean

781
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,960
there is still a fire?

782
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,960
It depends on you.

783
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,960
If you want to borrow money, you can change it.

784
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,960
I can definitely borrow money.

785
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
By the way,

786
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,960
there will be a competition soon.

787
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,960
Can you teach her?

788
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,960
Let her see that I am not as lazy as before.

789
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,960
I have been reflecting on my progress.

790
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,960
Okay?

791
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,960
You did well.

792
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,960
My daughter.

793
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
You did a lot of work.

794
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,960
You are tired.

795
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,960
I will take care of this.

796
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,960
You rest.

797
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,960
What are you doing?

798
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
I...

799
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,960
I got lost.

800
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,960
I walked into the study.

801
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,960
I came to this room.

802
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,960
I opened the lock.

803
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,960
I am saved.

804
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,960
I am saved.

805
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
I am saved.

806
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,960
I am saved.

807
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,960
I am saved.

808
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,960
I am saved.

809
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,960
Young master,

810
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,960
my father said that he would never do it again,

811
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,960
but he said that he would never do it again.

812
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,960
Old man.

813
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,960
Old man.

814
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
I talked to Du Daning

815
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,960
who was the previous husband of the Shen family.

816
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,960
I told her that

817
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,960
she had a lot of things on her back.

818
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,960
Her love is subtle.

819
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,960
She has nothing to worry about.

820
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
She is a good woman.

821
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,960
He just said it.

822
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,800
He was so stubborn.

823
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,800
He agreed to help us immediately.

824
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,800
He dared not to show his power.

825
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,800
He has a house.

826
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,000
He has a name and a way.

827
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,680
He has a lot of information.

828
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,960
He should be able to find out

829
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,240
if there is anyone in the Grand Magistrate's House

830
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,520
or other places.

831
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,560
He really explained to someone.

832
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,200
He is in the business of food.

833
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,680
But he has a warehouse

834
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,400
that can store a lot of military weapons.

835
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
Who?

836
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Yunlai Jiu Si, Lu Yun.

837
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,400
Yunlai Jiu Si?

838
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,400
Lu Yun is very cautious.

839
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
He has found a lot of people.

840
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,400
These warehouses are not under his control.

841
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
It doesn't matter.

842
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,400
There are traces of what happened a long time ago.

843
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
Madam Du also asked me about

844
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
Zhao Xun Zhi from Hongwen House.

845
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
She said she ordered their house

846
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
and owed it to them.

847
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
She also said that Zhao Xun Zhi

848
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
always liked to go to Yunlai Jiu Si

849
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
to drink a few times.

850
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
There is one more thing.

851
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,400
This is sent by Meng Xiang before dinner.

852
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
But...

853
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
What's the matter?

854
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,400
Meng Lang invited me to go with him

855
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
at the last mountaineering party.

856
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,400
His granddaughter will also participate.

857
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,400
Then...

858
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
I have to refuse.

859
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,400
So Yunlai Jiu Si will also participate in the mountaineering party.

860
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,400
I can take the opportunity to see

861
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
if I can find any clues.

862
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
And...

863
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,400
It's mainly my father.

864
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
He has been very anxious to help me lately.

865
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
It's really hard for people to pretend.

866
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,400
If Shao Ying can take a break from this battle

867
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,400
and then reject him,

868
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,400
then I can take advantage of these days

869
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
to manage this matter properly.

870
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,400
I am a

871
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,400
grass-fired firefly

872
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,400
I am running away from the path in the fog

873
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,400
and heading towards you

874
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,400
Time is like a needle

875
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,400
You and I

876
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,400
are like a thread

877
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,400
This is enough for us

878
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,400
to tie the knots of each other

879
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,400
I am afraid that the time and space

880
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,400
will be too short

881
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,400
I am afraid that the time and space

882
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,400
will be too short

883
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,400
I am afraid that the time and space

884
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,400
will be too short

885
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,400
I am afraid that the time and space

886
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,400
will be too short

887
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
I am afraid that the time and space

888
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,400
will be too short

889
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,400
I am afraid that the time and space

890
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,400
will be too short

891
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,400
I am afraid that the time and space

892
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
will be too short

893
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,400
I am afraid that the time and space

894
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,400
will be too short

895
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,400
I am afraid that the time and space

896
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,400
will be too short

897
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,400
I am afraid that the time and space

898
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,400
will be too short

899
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,400
I am afraid that the time and space

900
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,400
will be too short

901
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,400
I am afraid that the time and space

902
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,400
will be too short

903
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,400
from night to dawn

904
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,400
I am afraid that something is going wrong

905
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,400
When you receives the orders

906
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,400
I hope you enjoyed this video.

907
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,400
If you have any questions, please leave a comment.

908
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,400
Thank you for watching.
