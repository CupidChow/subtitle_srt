2
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,900
=Episode 5=

3
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,240
(Yunshui Manor)

4
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,180
Today, after court,

5
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,680
people from
the Ministry of Rites mentioned

6
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,900
Princess Fuhui will still hold

7
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,080
the Qixi Poetry Gathering this year.

8
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,550
She will invite scholars and notables.

9
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,460
If we could use it

10
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,700
to socialize with the Princess,

11
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,620
it would not seem deliberate.

12
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,940
Yes,

13
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,220
I heard that the Princess's invitations

14
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,060
are always arbitrary.

15
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,680
In previous years, she even invited
the Liu family from Guixiang Tavern.

16
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,820
She has no prejudice
against merchant families.

17
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,620
But why does she specifically avoid

18
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,540
sending invitations
to our Capital Prefecture?

19
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,140
After Father left,

20
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,390
several Capital Prefects in a row
didn't last long

21
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,220
and had no interest in socializing.

22
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,500
I suppose

23
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,300
they drifted apart from the Princess.

24
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,580
How about

25
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,620
I directly request one

26
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,860
on your behalf?

27
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,900
Requesting an invitation ourselves

28
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,880
would seem like trying
to climb the social ladder,

29
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,350
and it would be too conspicuous.

30
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,700
Befriending nobles

31
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,140
should be as natural as possible.

32
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,540
I will think of another way.

33
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,020
Where is the tea brewing stove?

34
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,700
Late last night,

35
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,020
the Shen family borrowed
many things from our residence.

36
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,860
They said it's better than
what they used for their stall before.

37
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,140
Didn't you instruct yesterday

38
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,020
that the kitchen
would be open for their use?

39
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,560
I thought about it and gave it to them.

40
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,820
I'm working to overturn the Cui case,

41
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,860
and my future is uncertain.

42
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,380
Even if we publicly say
the Shen family is a distant relative,

43
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,660
if something happens one day,

44
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,500
they might still be implicated.

45
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,100
Young Master, your intention is

46
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,860
to terminate the engagement early

47
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,220
and send them out of Yong'an, right?

48
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,460
Lady Shen isn't fixated
on the engagement.

49
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,220
They came to Yunshui Manor
seeking refuge

50
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,620
just to give their family

51
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,940
a temporary place to stay.

52
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,300
They also said

53
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,830
they really want to return
to their hometown.

54
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,540
Well, isn't that perfect?

55
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,180
When the Cui family incident happened,

56
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,060
the Shen family

57
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,380
must have been implicated, too.

58
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,580
Even if Lady Shen doesn't mention it,

59
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,900
I can't pretend not to know.

60
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,300
Even if we send them away,

61
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,060
I should fulfill my responsibility

62
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,700
to ensure their future livelihood.

63
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,860
How about

64
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,580
giving them a sum of money?

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,780
That would seem like
we are trying to drive them away.

66
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,750
It's better to teach someone to fish
than to give them fish.

67
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,420
They have a hard time in business.

68
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,540
We should support them more.

69
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,100
Liu Chang,

70
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,420
please watch over them diligently.

71
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,660
If they need anything,

72
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,660
provide it.

73
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,700
Understood.

74
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,220
They have already...

75
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,980
taken everything.

76
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,900
The flat pan for frying tea,

77
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,020
the stove with charcoal,

78
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,140
and even...

79
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,060
the salt,

80
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,420
all borrowed.

81
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,860
They certainly...

82
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,380
were polite.

83
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,540
(Jianbing)

84
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:46,860
Daughter,

85
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,460
listen, our ancestor's things

86
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,500
are truly good.

87
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,620
Look at this charcoal fire,

88
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,900
it doesn't smoke

89
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,940
and doesn't choke people.

90
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,620
Come take a look.

91
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,940
Yong'an's one-of-a-kind

92
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,940
Jianbing Guozi!

93
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,700
One qian per piece.

94
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,380
The only Jianbing Guozi in the dynasty,

95
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,180
back on the market!

96
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,860
Guaranteed not to disappoint!

97
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,700
Come here...

98
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,920
Don't miss out as you pass by!

99
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,770
- Here, take a look.
- Hurry up, or it will be sold out.

100
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,580
Take a look.

101
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,420
No need, no need.

102
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,700
I am baffled.

103
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,140
In such a short time,

104
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,380
have they already

105
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,260
gotten tired of it?

106
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,180
Jianbing Guozi...

107
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,660
It smells so good.

108
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,620
Inside, there are eggs and sesame.

109
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,860
- Truly a delicacy in the world.
- Dad!

110
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,460
I know. I see it.

111
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,730
Where did their Jianbing Guozi
come from?

112
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,660
(Yunlai Tavern)

113
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,340
- Jianbing Guozi!
- Here you go.

114
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,660
Special offer in Juxian Alley,
three pieces for one qian!

115
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,900
- Rare to taste!
- Got it.

116
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,740
- Sweet or savory?
- Here they are.

117
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,180
That place also sells
Jianbing Guozi? Let's go.

118
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,660
Take care.

119
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Three pieces for one qian,
take your pick!

120
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,680
- Here is one for you.
- Take this.

121
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,700
Here you are.

122
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,020
Everyone,

123
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,860
three pieces for one qian.

124
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,940
Three pieces for one qian!

125
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,340
Good quality and cheap.
Three pieces for one coin!

126
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,750
Good quality and cheap.

127
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,620
Three pieces for one coin!

128
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,540
Look,

129
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,700
isn't this our Jianbing Guozi?

130
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,340
It's yours.

131
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,380
- Good, thank you.
- Give it to me.

132
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,250
Give it to me quickly.

133
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,980
How shameless

134
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,820
for such a big tavern

135
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,020
to copy us!

136
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,100
How dare they?

137
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,140
Everyone, don't crowd!

138
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,460
To make money, there is nothing
to be embarrassed about.

139
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,460
What should we do?

140
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,500
They copied ours,

141
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,700
and their price is lower.

142
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,900
Then, should we lower our price, too?

143
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,140
They must have
cheaper supplies than we do.

144
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,900
We have no advantage in a price war.

145
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,100
If we have no advantage,

146
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,620
then...

147
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:42,700
(Virtue and Fragrance)

148
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,180
These are the Jianbing Guozi

149
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,860
Yunlai Tavern copied from us.

150
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,940
I bought back all the flavors.

151
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,400
Let us taste them
to see what they are like.

152
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,150
Here, Yangyang.

153
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,260
It's a chicken cutlet!

154
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,980
Delicious!

155
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,140
The taste is indeed good.

156
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,460
Inside, it has...

157
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,300
Actually, if you taste it carefully,

158
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,060
the flavor is just average.

159
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,540
Still slightly inferior

160
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,780
to ours.

161
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,780
But this Jianbing Guozi itself

162
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,780
has no technical difficulty.

163
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,140
With a little effort,

164
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,380
it can be imitated quickly.

165
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,420
Who says it has no technical difficulty?

166
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,540
Vice Prefect!

167
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,380
Vice Prefect.

168
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,820
Is this

169
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,220
a full pancake feast?

170
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,140
Vice Prefect,

171
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,060
quickly, sit down.

172
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:47,980
Sit down!

173
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,340
Vice Prefect, try this.

174
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,380
Okay.

175
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,260
Mr. Liu,

176
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,340
here, have a taste, too.

177
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,340
Auntie, thank you.

178
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,180
You are welcome.

179
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,580
For this pancake,

180
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,100
the outer egg skin is soft and tender,

181
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,220
but the inside, like fried dough twists,

182
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,100
is very crispy.

183
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,700
Tastes wonderful!

184
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,060
What do you think?

185
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,540
Delicious.

186
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,860
Didn't

187
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,740
today's stall sale

188
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,220
go well?

189
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,860
No,

190
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,580
these are all made

191
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,980
by Yunlai Tavern.

192
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,580
They copied us,

193
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,900
and no one stops them.

194
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,020
Vice Prefect,

195
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,100
you must uphold justice for us.

196
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,420
Yes,

197
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,780
you're in charge of justice.

198
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,140
Is there no law

199
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,820
to restrain them?

200
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,820
Don't worry, Vice Prefect.

201
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,380
We can handle it.

202
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,300
Besides, to make money in business,

203
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,700
you always face all kinds of troubles.

204
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,180
We are fine.

205
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,900
Actually, this pancake

206
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,420
is nothing special.

207
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,220
Liu Chang, isn't that right?

208
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,380
Upon careful tasting,

209
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,700
this pancake still has...

210
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,380
Lady Shen, your family pancake

211
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,260
has more chewiness

212
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,380
and aftertaste.

213
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,500
Uncle Liu Chang,

214
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,860
you are lying, aren't you?

215
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,300
Uncle Liu Chang?

216
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,820
- It's just...
- Don't comfort us.

217
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,940
Once Yunlai Tavern
starts following trends,

218
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,740
soon all of Juxian Alley will imitate.

219
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,820
The market will saturate quickly.

220
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,860
We must switch tracks
as soon as possible.

224
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,140
Just some terms we invented.

225
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,020
Simply put,

226
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,270
it means selling something different.

they have started selling Lamb Skewers.

270
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,620
They came up with some new tricks

271
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,140
and drew people away.

272
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,740

such a big bunch of Lamb Skewers

274
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,780
would cost about 30 or 40 qian.

Vice Prefect or Censor,

337
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,580
addressing each other like that

338
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,860
seems distant.

Calling you Yan

340
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,740

We shouldn't stand on ceremony.

353
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,380
I heard that the Shen family,
which offered free tastings,

354
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,260
is now selling

355
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,340
those grilled Lamb Skewers.

356
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,980

357

Let us go try it.

359
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,180
But one thing puzzles me.

360
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,300
Lamb is so expensive.

361
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,660
Look, my salary isn't high,

362
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,740
and my rank is insufficient.

363
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,200
Every year,
when salaries are distributed,

364
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,740
I don't get a single lamb.

365
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,860
How can the Shen family's lamb

366
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,580
be sold so cheaply?

367
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,580
I really can't figure it out.

368
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,460
Want to copy?

369
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,300

as long as they can keep up.

371
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,840
Vice Prefect, please lend us
one more thing.

372
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,960
What?

373
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,420
If I guess correctly,

374
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,410
when you took office,

375
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,620
the court's supplies
should have included lamb, right?

376
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,700
Anran, how many lambs
do you get a year?

377
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,100
Enough to eat.

378
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,300
That means

379
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,340
at least

380
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,580
four or five lambs, right?

381
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,180
- Don't crowd!
- Take it.

382
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,820
Fresh Lamb Skewers.

383
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,540
Fresh Lamb Skewers!

384
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,390
Queue up!

385
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,300
Finally, my turn.

386
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,420
Listen, our ancestor's

387
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,540
welfare benefits are so good.

388
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,780
He has got so many lambs.

389
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,740
I'm telling you, it's all thanks to him.

390
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,660
When we leave,
remember to cook a delicious meal

391
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,500
to reward him.

392
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,740
Right...

393
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,540
Don't crowd, everyone gets some.

394
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,470
- Don't crowd!
- Thank you.

395
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,060
Queue up.

396
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,220
Fresh Lamb Skewers!

397
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,060
A small stall, but bold enough

398
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,540
to challenge our Yunlai Tavern.

399
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,980
- Don't rush, everyone gets some.
- Be careful, it's hot.

400
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,260
Line up.

401
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,740
Don't crowd.

402
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,940
Dad!

403
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,100
Disperse.

404
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,500
Disperse!

405
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,740
Disperse now!

406
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,140
Disperse, go away!

407
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,900
Go away.

408
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,660
Make way!

409
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,500
Seems like something happened.

410
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:39,980
Let us watch first.

411
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,820
Our Yunlai guests

412
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,500
are all of noble status.

413
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,220
Dining at our place

414
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,820
emphasizes tranquility.

415
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,380
Look at your stalls,

416
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,780
so noisy that our guests

417
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,850
can't eat.

418
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,980
What a disgrace!

419
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,860
Move away!

420
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,780
No!

421
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,820
Don't touch!

422
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,140
No, what is this?

423
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,990
No!

424
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Who told you to move?

425
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,260
- Don't touch!
- Yangyang!

426
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,660
- Yangyang!
- Move away!

427
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,600
Don't touch my daughter!

428
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,340
- Yangyang!
- Painful.

429
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,300
Put it down!

430
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,430
You... what are you doing?

431
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,580
See who dares to touch our family?

432
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,780
See who dares!

433
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,940
- Are you okay?
- Who dares?

434
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,340
- It's fine.
- What?

435
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,180
Be careful, you!

436
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,660
Drew a knife!

437
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,220
Yangyang, are you okay?

438
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,180
I don't even dare to touch my wife.

439
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,220
Who of you dares?

440
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,380
Want to die?

441
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,620
Sir,

442
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,620
which article in the market regulations

443
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,320
says you can't set up stalls
outside Yunlai Tavern?

444
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,380
What?

445
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,820
You refuse to move?

446
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,420
Anyone can see

447
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,260
we have not obstructed any shop.

448
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,660
If you forcibly dismantle our stall,

449
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,260
we will have to inform the guards.

450
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,540
Lady,

451
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,140
daring to call the guards

452
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,740
on our turf?

453
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,060
Have you considered

454
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,580
how the guards

455
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,340
will judge you?

456
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,420
Hope that at that time,

457
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,740
in the prison cell, you can still be

458
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,260
as sharp-tongued

459
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,980
as today.

460
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,260
Prison?

461
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,420
How did it come to prison?

462
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,980
Among merchants in Juxian Alley,

463
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,420
there are such heroes

464
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,820
who can sentence people to prison
with one word?

465
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,740
Where did this wild dog
come from, barking?

466
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,900
Our Yunlai Tavern has been too long

467
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,830
without showing authority
in Juxian Alley, right?

468
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,460
Anyone dares to meddle in our affairs?

469
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,980
Who?

470
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,180
Let me see.

471
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,020
Who...?

472
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,150
Lin...

473
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,540
- Who?
- The newly appointed Vice Prefect.

474
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,660
Vice Prefect... Lin.

475
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,100
Look clearly now.

476
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,900
Who dares to meddle in your affairs?

477
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,820
Vice Prefect... Lin,

478
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,780
I failed to recognize you.

479
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,420
Kneel!

480
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,020
How dare you?

481
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:35,900
Not me.

482
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,780
How dare you?

483
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,420
Daring to address the Vice Prefect

484
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,580
as... wild dog.

485
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,180
You're seeking death!

486
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,700
Vice Prefect,

487
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,620
earlier,

488
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,940
it was my subordinate.

489
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,560
He spoke recklessly
with ignorance of propriety.

490
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,100
I have already disciplined him.

491
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,500
Not me.

492
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,440
It's a misunderstanding.

493
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,380
Today,

494
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,660
this Shen family stall

495
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,420
blocked the market square

496
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,220
and severely obstructed

497
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,740
our Juxian Alley's

498
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,020
restaurant operations.

499
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,340
I kindly approached them
to dissuade them.

500
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,660
Who knew the Shen family

501
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,780
would be so obstinate?

502
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,980
They even insulted us.

503
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,820
You're spewing venom!

504
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,980
- Vice Prefect.
- Nonsense!

505
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,820
It's...

506
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,660
Truly.

507
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,380
You misjudge one point.

508
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,500
I didn't just arrive.

509
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,020
I have been watching

510
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,380
since you first brought your men.

511
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,940
Thanks, Manager Feng.

512
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,660
Censor Pei,

513
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,990
I have only recently arrived
at the Capital Prefecture.

514
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,660
My duty is to inspect areas
and purge misconduct.

515
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,500
Today,

516
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,220
thanks to Manager Feng's

517
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,820
consideration for my official burdens,

518
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,500
he specially came to bully the weak

519
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,460
to gift me

520
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,980
another merit to record.

521
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,100
Vice Prefect Lin,

522
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,500
I shall certainly
note this down for you.

523
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,780
You punish the strong, aid the weak,

524
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,180
and eliminate evil root and branch.

525
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,710
Thank you, Censor Pei.

526
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,540
Misunderstanding!

527
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,140
A colossal misunderstanding!

528
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,060
What I said earlier

529
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,420
was all in jest.

530
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,020
In truth, I saw the Shen family

531
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,060
toil at their stall.

532
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,780
So I brought some helpers,

533
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,740
thinking they needed aid

534
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,980
and lacked manpower.

535
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,720
Why are you still kneeling?

536
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,600
Help them!

537
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,060
- Quick! Get up and help!
- Yes.

538
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,930
- Hurry!
- Thank you.

539
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,820
Thank you, Vice Prefect.

540
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,620
- Thanks.
- What are you doing?

541
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,140
Remove your hand!

542
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,060
Who... who said you could touch?

543
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,940
I'll help, too.

544
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,380
Crush the strong, rescue the weak,

545
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,500
and uphold justice through speech.

546
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,700
Anran,

547
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,820
you're truly a model for our generation.

548
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,300
Boss, another skewer for me!

549
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,020
This Shen stall is too crowded.

550
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,780
Shall we switch to another?

551
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,140
- I'll follow...
- Boss! Another skewer!

552
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,660
you, Twelfth Master.

553
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,700
After you.

554
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,660
Wait!

555
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,980
Wait for me!

556
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,820
Wait! Future son-in-law!

557
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,780
Auntie,

558
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,820
future...?

559
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,820
Future son-in-law.

560
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,820
Apologies, Vice Prefect.

561
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,340
I ran too hastily.

562
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,020
My mind went blank for a moment.

563
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,100
I misspoke.

564
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,050
I'm sorry, Vice Prefect.

565
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:20,900
Apologies.

566
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,740
Don't rush.

567
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,540
Thank you for helping us earlier.

568
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,820
These are made by Jicai...

569
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,800
No...

570
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,750
These are fresh Lamb Skewers

571
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,660
made by Shaoguang.

572
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,100
Take them while hot.

573
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,090
Auntie, this is inappropriate.

574
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,100
Quick. Vice Prefect, take them.

575
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,360
- Take them, Vice Prefect.
- No need.

576
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,620
Oh, you have a friend present.

577
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,140
Then... I shall not disturb.

578
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,940
But Vice Prefect,

579
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,320
without you,

580
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,620
our family business would fail.

581
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,660
We must give you

582
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,860
your share of the profits.

583
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,940
I asked the mutton sellers

584
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,820
about the market price

585
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,660
and added an extra ten percent.
It's not much.

586
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,670
Vice Prefect, don't disdain it.

587
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,560
- Take it.
- Auntie...

588
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,400
No, Vice Prefect.

589
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,990
- Auntie, this is inappropriate.
- Just take it.

590
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,070
We agreed. Quick. Accept it.

591
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:55,890
Eat while hot.

592
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:56,700
Eat while hot!

593
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,820
Liu Chang, return it!

594
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,780
Son-in-law?

595
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,700
What son-in-law?

596
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,500
Twelfth Master, you misheard.

597
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,700
Since childhood,

598
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,660
my ears

599
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,940
could hear any sound within three zhang.

600
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,260
Back in the countryside,

601
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,740
all rumors from the villages around

602
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,820
reached my ears.

603
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,700
I could not possibly mishear.

604
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,620
She called you "son-in-law".

605
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,060
I'm acquainted with the Shen family.

606
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,950
Our parents arranged a betrothal
between me and Lady Shen.

607
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,020
Please

608
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,820
keep this secret.

609
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,740
An arranged marriage?

610
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,220
But the Shen family is merchants.

611
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,540
If you marry into

612
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,140
such a family,

613
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,980
and if word spreads,

614
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,020
it will harm your career.

615
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,860
Rest assured. I will not spread it.

616
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,700
This is nothing.

617
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,740
Nothing?

618
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,620
How can this be nothing?

619
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,180
Marrying them

620
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,460
will burden your descendants.

621
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,340
A womb betrothal means no formal
betrothal gifts were exchanged, right?

622
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,340
It can't hold.

623
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,860
Stay vigilant.

624
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,140
Don't let this family

625
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,740
ensnare you.

626
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,060
Twelfth Master,

627
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,340
they are not such people.

628
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,140
And please don't jump to conclusions.

629
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,140
You...

630
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,380
They use

631
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,300
such food to coax you.

632
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,060
This smells rather fragrant.

633
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,300
Let me taste it.

634
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,340
I have considerable expertise

635
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,820
in appraising fine cuisine.

636
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,420
Rustic fare of country bumpkins

637
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,840
won't satisfy me.

638
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,420
(Juxian Alley)

639
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,500
Delicious.

640
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,580
Truly delicious.

641
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,820
Simply a peerless delicacy
of the mortal realm.

642
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,340
Compared to this,

643
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,580
all the exquisite dishes
I've savored before

644
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,700
are utterly worthless.

645
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,540
Never imagined

646
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,140
this Lady Shen

647
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,660
could create

648
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,820
such exquisite flavor.

649
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,700
This woman is truly rare in this world.

650
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,580
So rare.

651
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,180
Actually, merchant families

652
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,420
aren't so bad, are they?

653
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,020
Anran,

654
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,220
I suddenly feel

655
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,660
that if you marry Lady Shen...

656
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,060
I should send her away early.

657
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,220
What?

658
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,780
Nothing.

659
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,580
Here, all for you.

660
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,520
All these are for you to eat.

661
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,780
Here.

662
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:05,980
Anran!

663
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,820
I'm treating you to a meal.

664
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,460
This... this will not do.

665
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,020
(Start Near to Go Far)

666
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,420
I have never seen

667
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,300
so much money.

668
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,980
Let me touch it, too.

669
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,100
See how great Yong'an is.

670
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,180
Just casually selling these Lamb Skewers

671
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,900
earned so much.

672
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,460
Ancient folks have taste.

673
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,580
They know how to appreciate my cooking.

674
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,620
It makes me not want to go back.

675
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,700
Shen Jianshe,

676
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,900
you're exploiting the information gap
of a modern person

677
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,600
and making things that
these people haven't eaten.

678
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,400
If you were truly capable,

679
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,620
our little restaurant back home

680
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,300
wouldn't have gone bankrupt under you.

681
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,740
I'm the one

682
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,600
who... skewer by skewer...

683
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,420
What did you say?

684
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,820
Louder.

685
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,260
I said...

686
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,020
I said... you... you were right.

687
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,260
Ancient money is easy to earn,

688
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,820
but nowhere to spend it.

689
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,400
No wireless internet.

690
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,290
Can't surf the web.

691
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,270
Can't binge on TV dramas.

692
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,980
No chili peppers. No air conditioning.

693
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,580
Fetch water yourself.

694
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,340
Empty the toilet yourself.

695
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,860
Yes! Tell me, this dump...

696
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,140
Games? Can't play games.

697
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,380
TV dramas? Can't watch dramas.

698
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,820
I say... we should

699
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,620
take the gold back to modern times

700
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,740
and live in comfort.
That's the real deal!

701
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,580
Right?

702
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,700
Brother, when are you not
living in comfort?

703
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,740
- How could you...?
- Your sister is right.

704
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,540
You really should learn from me.

705
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,020
I truly excel in the hall

706
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,980
and master the kitchen.

707
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,940
Handsome looks, perfect physique.

708
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,620
The very image
of the head of a household.

709
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,180
How much have you earned?

710
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,180
And you've already forgotten
your own surname and nature?

711
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,340
It's Shen.

712
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,020
Actually, I like ancient times, too.

713
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,100
We earn

714
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,180
this huge bucket of money so easily.

715
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,260
Plus,

716
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,200
I don't have to go to school,

717
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,220
study,

718
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,060
or do homework.

719
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,940
Listen,

720
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,980
if we go back,

721
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,380
you'll have to make up
all that homework.

722
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,220
Understand?

723
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,060
Don't learn from your dad.

724
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,100
I... When I was little,

725
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,280
I always submitted homework on time.

726
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,380
Let's keep striving.

727
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,820
While we can still earn,

728
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,340
we must earn more.

729
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,340
Then, after returning,

730
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,660
life will be better, too.

731
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,500
Wait. Mom,

732
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,860
I skewer Lamb Skewers every night.

733
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,820
My hands are sparking.

734
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,620
Look at my hands. Reeking of mutton.

735
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,620
I skewered, too.

736
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,660
I also grilled.

737
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,380
Lamb Skewers take time.
Cut meat, marinate,

738
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,780
then skewer one by one.

739
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,340
It's truly time-consuming and laborious.

740
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,740
If we want to earn more,

741
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,660
we need to sell things
that can be mass-produced

742
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,860
with high unit prices.

743
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:42,660
This...

744
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,500
What?

745
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,380
These days, some guests

746
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,940
said eating too many meat skewers
chokes them.

747
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,860
Could we

748
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,420
make drinks to sell alongside?

749
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,300
Makes sense!

750
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,860
(So Big a Bucket!
Finish Homework, Top Exams Crimson!)

751
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,120
(Find an Ideal Husband.
Ultracute Maiden Purple!)

752
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,340
(Beat Unfaithful Men. Green Drink!)

753
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,260
What spice is this? So fragrant.

754
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,820
So fragrant.

755
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,660
- Your Lamb Skewers.
- Thank you.

756
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,420
Brother,

757
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,700
no slacking today.

758
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:29,940
Parents went shopping.

759
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,900
We can only rely on you.

760
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,700
Got it. Am I that unreliable?

761
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,180
What a profound misunderstanding.

762
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,580
Okay.

763
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,700
Everyone!

764
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,460
Everyone,

765
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,220
ever been betrayed?

766
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,660
Ever tasted the bitterness

767
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,500
of a sincere heart trampled to mud?

768
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,940
So chilling

769
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,140
even in blazing summer!

770
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,380
Today,

771
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,780
our Shen's Diner

772
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,140
developed Happy Water.

773
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,620
One of the signature drinks

774
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,640
is named

775
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,580
"Beat Unfaithful Men. Green Drink!"

776
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,380
Beat Unfaithful Men. Green Drink!

777
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,090
Quenches thirst. Relieves stress.

778
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,380
And portable.

779
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,620
More importantly,

780
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,540
you can experience

781
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,220
the feeling of beating
an unfaithful man.

782
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,780
Look this way, please.

783
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,900
Everyone,

784
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,420
this is our process

785
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,620
of making Green Drink.

786
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:24,730
At this moment,

787
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,380
(Summer Refreshment)
Don't suppress your emotions.

788
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,540
Let them out.

789
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,180
Release years of inner pain

790
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,700
and let it all out.

791
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,620
Think of him in your heart.

792
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,780
Don't control yourself.

793
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,020
Explode.

794
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,140
Beat all unfaithful men under heaven.

795
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,500
Beat unfaithful men.

796
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,900
Beat all unfaithful men under heaven!

797
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,380
Beat unfaithful men!

798
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,300
Beat all unfaithful men under heaven!

799
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,900
Beat unfaithful men!

800
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,900
Beat all unfaithful men under heaven!

801
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,780
Beat all unfaithful men under heaven...

802
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,860
Brother!

803
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,700
Doing business here!

804
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,630
Don't really think about

805
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,060
your ex-wife who ran off.

806
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,220
Apologies, everyone.

807
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,220
Behold.

808
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,380
Such a refreshing aroma.

809
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,300
First shake: past troubles
scatter like smoke.

810
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,660
Second shake: bright future
comes into view.

811
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,820
Third shake: wealth and peace
forevermore!

812
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,740
Good!

813
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,940
Here. Open good fortune.

814
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,820
Open good fortune!

815
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,620
So fresh!

816
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,660
What taste must this be?

817
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,900
And ice cubes.

818
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,660
Real ice cubes!

819
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,780
How wonderful for summer heat!

820
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,820
Everyone,

821
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,860
I shall taste it

822
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,180
for you all.

823
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,740
How is it?

824
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,900
I have never

825
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,020
drunk such a delicious drink in my life.

826
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,180
Truly exquisite!

827
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,850
Exquisite!

828
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,740
- Good!
- Good!

829
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,820
I want some Lamb Skewers.

830
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,700
I also want this!

831
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,460
- Okay. One Green Drink.
- No problem.

832
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,060
Other drinks look good, too.

833
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,140
Give me this one.

834
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,540
- I want this one.
- This one!

835
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,660
Alright. You'll all have it.

836
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,020
One by one!

837
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,980
Line up! Here they are!

838
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,180
The last two times, I said

839
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,380
I'd treat you to a meal.

840
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,700
We didn't get to finish properly.

841
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,100
Now... this time,

842
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,500
it's you treating us again.

843
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,020
I'm truly embarrassed.

844
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,180
What is this?

845
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,980
This is a special tea drink
made by the Shen family.

846
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,020
It's called Dark Plum...

847
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,300
Dark Plum...

848
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,180
Liu Chang.

849
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,980
This tea is called Dark Plum Bobo,

850
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,540
All Things As You Wish.

851
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,380
Exactly.

852
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,460
Dark Plum Bobo, All Things As You Wish.

853
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,700
All Things As You Wish.

854
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,540
Good name.

855
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,260
Why can't I say it out loud?

856
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:06,980
It's delicious.

857
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,860
Lady Shen came up with this name, right?

858
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,660
She really has a clever mind.

859
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,120
Anran, you are truly blessed.

860
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,340
I heard

861
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,580
that you recently wanted
an advance on your salary.

862
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,920
Has something happened?

863
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,180
That Vice Minister Zhang

864
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,740
just pushed my request back. But he...

865
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,460
But he talked about this matter.

866
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,900
This person, honestly...

867
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,380
If you're facing difficulties,

868
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,860
you should tell me.

869
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,140
It's nothing.

870
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,700
I consider you a friend.

871
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,100
Between friends,
when there's difficulty,

872
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,420
why hide it?

873
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,820
Actually, it's...

874
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,570
it's Princess Fuhui,

875
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,820
who's hosting a Qixi Poetry Gathering.

876
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,740
She sent the invitation
to the Censorate.

877
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,220
A poetry gathering?

878
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,940
What's so difficult about that?

879
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,860
A normal banquet

880
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,980
wouldn't really be a problem.

881
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,620
But her Qixi Poetry Gathering

882
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,620
is considered
Yong'an's premier social event.

883
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,980
I genuinely want to go
and see the spectacle.

884
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:03,980
But...

885
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,300
I... I don't have
a decent set of clothes.

886
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,940
So I wanted to get some silk on credit.

887
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,820
Unfortunately,
Vice Minister Zhang didn't agree.

888
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,500
Then I just don't go.

889
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,710
Is that all?

890
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,220
I can make

891
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,540
a suit of clothes for you.

892
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,740
Really?

893
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,580
Really.

894
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,140
Forget it.

895
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,220
No need.

896
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,580
The Capital Prefecture's affairs
are complicated and burdensome.

897
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,780
Your salaries

898
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,740
are hard-earned.

899
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,020
Forget it.

900
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,780
Then...

901
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,540
then wouldn't it be better

902
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,460
if you lent me a set?

903
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,900
Sure. Take your pick.

904
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,460
Thank you, Anran.

905
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,780
Look,

906
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,180
I haven't managed
to treat you to a meal.

907
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,320
And now I'm borrowing
a suit of clothes from you.

908
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,700
Anran,
are you attending it, too?

909
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,220
You also know

910
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,100
that the Capital Prefecture is a mess.

911
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,900
Over the years, relations with her

912
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,740
have been neglected.

913
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,290
And I've only just taken up my post.

914
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,940
How could I ask for an invitation?

915
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,500
How can that be!

916
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,900
Anran, rest assured.

917
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,140
Getting an invitation is easy for us.

918
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,180
I'll take care of this.

919
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,960
The Grand Princess
finds her previous chef

920
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,840
lacking in novelty.

921
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,090
She's currently searching everywhere

922
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:16,750
for an innovative, excellent chef
to cater for the poetry gathering.

923
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,740
An innovative, excellent chef...

924
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,180
Well, you have

925
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,900
a suitable candidate right here.

926
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,300
- Apologies for the wait.
- Sir!

927
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,790
- They're free for you.
- How about two more?

928
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,860
Apologies, everyone, truly,
we have nothing left.

929
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,620
How about this,
everyone, please come early tomorrow?

930
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,560
The evening drum has sounded.

931
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,700
It's time for us to pack up.

932
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,760
Please come back tomorrow.

933
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,300
Sorry.

934
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,740
Could we have one more cup?

935
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,020
Let's go.

936
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,660
Business was incredibly good today.

937
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,940
I really didn't expect that.

938
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,490
- The first day! Business is so good.
- Auntie,

939
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:55,450
the money box is almost full.

940
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,300
So amazing.

941
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,140
Good girl, Yangyang.

942
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,380
So Big a Bucket!
Finish Homework,

943
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,220
Top Exams Crimson!

944
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,260
Find an Ideal Husband.

945
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,900
Ultracute Maiden Purple!

946
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,540
Beat Unfaithful Men. Green Drink!

947
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,380
Dark Plum Bobo, All Things As You Wish.

948
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,380
Yangyang, let me tell you.

949
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,480
The flaw in her character

950
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,980
is right here.

951
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,760
She just wants to hear ancient people

952
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,860
say these phrases out loud.

953
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,490
This is simply the collapse of ritual.

954
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,700
Dad,

955
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,940
you know an idiom.

956
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,420
What does that mean?

957
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,940
How come I don't know how to use it?

958
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,460
It's just a collapse.

959
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,300
Collapse?

960
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,700
This tea drink looks novel.

961
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,900
Could you prepare a few barrels

962
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,290
and deliver them
to the military tomorrow?

963
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,900
General!

964
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,660
No problem. Later, we...

965
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,080
If it's for delivery
to the military camp,

966
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,100
forgive me, I dare not comply.

967
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,380
You...

968
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,700
Why?

969
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,480
General, when you say "military camp",

970
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,860
you mean the Imperial Guard, right?

971
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:52,390
The Imperial Guard protects His Majesty
with great responsibility.

972
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,100
Food procurement has strict regulations.

973
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,180
How dare we, ordinary people,

974
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,900
send tea drinks to the military camp?

975
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,900
It's only tea.

976
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,100
You still dare not send it.

977
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,540
After all, a young woman is in charge,

978
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,900
and you lack courage.

979
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,340
General,

980
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,460
whether this tea is brewed in our pot

981
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,660
or in the camp's pot,

982
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,540
isn't it the same?

983
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,220
Then why not have
the official camp cooks brew it?

984
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,660
You wish

985
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,220
to sell me the recipe?

986
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,820
We won't be staying in Yong'an long.

987
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,740
There's no need
to keep the recipe secret.

988
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,080
We don't sell the tea drink

989
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,940
because we worry
we couldn't bear the responsibility.

990
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,230
But I'm willing to sell the recipe.

991
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,740
The Imperial Guard defends peace.

992
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,780
You deserve to taste

993
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,260
Yong'an's newest and best tea.

994
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,100
Just now, I said the young lady
lacked courage.

995
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,340
It seems I misjudged.

996
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,940
You flatter me, General.

997
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,220
Please wait a moment.

998
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,900
General, wait just a moment.

999
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,740
Auntie!

1000
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,420
Bold in thought and action.

1001
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,100
If she stayed in Yong'an,

1002
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,580
she could become a great merchant

1003
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,780
in no time.

1004
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,700
Young Master, actually...

1005
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,980
you admire Lady Shen quite a bit.

1006
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,780
Nonsense.

1007
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,100
General, here's the recipe.

1008
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,660
Thank you.

1009
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,780
Let's go.

1010
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,020
Look. Look.

1011
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,260
We've struck it rich!

1012
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,740
Don't flaunt wealth.

1013
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,100
It's fine, there's so much.

1014
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,180
What are you afraid of?

1015
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,340
Auntie, the Vice Prefect has arrived.

1016
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,380
- Vice Prefect.
- Vice Prefect. Mr. Liu.

1017
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,980
Any drinks left? Get them something.

1018
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,020
No need.

1019
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,180
I came to discuss a matter
with Lady Shen.

1020
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,020
Alright.

1021
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,940
There are still two cups here.
Find an Ideal Husband.

1022
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,100
Ultracute Maiden Purple!

1023
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,740
Please try it.

1024
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,020
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1025
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:35,940
Good. Alright.

1026
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,860
You chat.

1027
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,700
Yangyang, come here.

1028
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,300
Is this cup of "Ultracute Maiden Purple!

1029
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,420
Find an Ideal Husband"

1030
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,020
tasty?

1031
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,660
Tasty.

1032
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,900
Isn't it called "Find an Ideal Husband.

1033
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,260
Ultracute Maiden Purple"?

1034
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,460
Did you change the name?

1035
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,020
Didn't change it.

1036
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,320
Vice Prefect, you said it right.

1037
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,380
You did it on purpose.

1038
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,180
My elder brother said this name

1039
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,260
is too "collapse of ritual".

1040
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,260
I didn't think so before.

1041
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,340
When you said it, I realized.

1042
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,340
Stop laughing, Jicai.

1043
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,060
So teasing others is quite fun.

1044
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,180
Vice Prefect, what matter
did you come to discuss?

1045
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,540
Princess Fuhui is seeking someone

1046
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,250
to cater this year's
Qixi Poetry Gathering.

1047
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,220
I asked a friend at the Censorate
to put in a good word for you.

1048
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,060
Would you be willing

1049
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,540
to give it a try?

1050
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,380
What?

1051
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,820
Have us cater her Qixi Poetry Gathering?
