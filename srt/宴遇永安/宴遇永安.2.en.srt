00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Thanks for watching.

44
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,600
Whatść this dad

45
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,040
Be careful

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,480
Hey, Young Master Lin, please forgive me.

47
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,320
This gentleman, please forgive me.

48
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,200
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

49
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,800
Come on.

50
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,240
Who is your wife?

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,920
Greetings, Young Master Lin.

52
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,440
I'm Shen Shaoguang.

53
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,120
I'm in the restaurant.

54
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,360
I heard that you were on duty.

55
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,760
I was worried that you didn't eat well.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,960
So I came to make pancakes for you.

57
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,120
And send you cakes.

58
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,120
You're so rude.

59
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,120
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

60
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,640
You're Shen Shaoguang.

61
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,120
I'll give you another chance.

62
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,600
We'll go out together.

63
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,800
We'll restore the normal price.

64
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,160
Tell me your plan.

65
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,320
Plan?

66
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,320
I know.

67
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
My sister is Shen Shaoguang.

68
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,200
Chen Er gave her idea.

69
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,160
She said to make a show.

70
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,360
And we'll go around.

71
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,360
Young Master, you know me?

72
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,120
I'm famous so fast.

73
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,880
Making pancakes is a rare thing.

74
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,560
All right.

75
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,960
Go back.

76
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,920
Don't make a show next time.

77
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,760
Or you'll be punished.

78
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,480
What show?

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,160
What did you do?

80
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,280
Don't you know?

81
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,640
Young Master Lin, I...

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,600
Stop.

83
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,000
Uncle.

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,240
So you sold your sister

85
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,960
in front of your ancestors?

86
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,560
Who sold you?

87
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,880
She's your sister.

88
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,640
I said we don't like pancakes.

89
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,160
She didn't like me at first.

90
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,760
Shen Hongcai, you're so insincere.

91
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,080
Sister, you're so good at this.

92
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,960
I mean it.

93
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,000
You'd better think of a way to get close to your ancestors.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,360
How can you get into Yunshui Garden?

95
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,280
I didn't think of that.

96
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,360
Well...

97
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,400
Do you have money?

98
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,600
I'll buy you something else.

99
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,240
What?

100
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,960
What can't you do?

101
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,080
What can't you eat?

102
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,880
My parents are working in the kitchen.

103
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,760
You go help them.

104
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,600
Okay.

105
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll go later.

106
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:20,960
Now?

107
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,600
I'll go later.

108
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,200
Go.

109
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,640
Get up.

110
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,880
Get up.

111
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,760
Get up.

112
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,480
You're blaming me for being a help.

113
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,560
Shen Hongcai.

114
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,520
I said I wouldn't go.

115
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,560
You...

116
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,360
It's not a good start.

117
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,320
But all three generations of our family

118
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,680
are fans of pancakes.

119
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,960
I don't believe it.

120
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,160
I go to the ancestors every day.

121
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,480
I still don't believe it.

122
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:47,960
Here.

123
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,720
The latest flavor of Yan's Kitchen.

124
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,960
Pancakes and nuts.

125
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,520
There are all kinds of them.

126
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,560
One thousand pieces of pancakes.

127
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,880
That's right.

128
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,960
The ancestors will come to Yan's Kitchen.

129
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,080
Hold it.

130
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,080
The latest flavor of Wucai Pancakes.

131
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,040
Don't miss it.

132
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,440
You should start it.

133
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,840
You'll have a chance to eat it.

134
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,360
It's so delicious.

135
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,880
Wucai Pancakes.

136
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,200
So delicious.

137
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,680
Brother, you're so good.

138
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,880
I want this pancake.

139
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,640
Okay.

140
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,680
I want it.

141
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,280
Give it to me.

142
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,040
It's almost night.

143
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,880
Go home.

144
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,320
It's so delicious.

145
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,240
I'll take it right away.

146
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,160
Here it is.

147
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,360
Pancakes and nuts.

148
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,880
The latest flavor of Luo's Pancakes and Nuts.

149
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,640
It's delicious and expensive.

150
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,560
It's not expensive.

151
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,280
I'm angry.

152
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,680
Why don't you call me?

153
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,720
I'll give you the discount.

154
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,160
It's delicious and not expensive.

155
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,520
Defeat.

156
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,600
Our ancestors

157
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,920
are not the most hated people in the world

158
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,480
who eat pancakes and nuts.

159
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,400
Mr. Zhang.

160
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,120
Mr. Zhang, please wait.

161
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,920
I'm Pei Fei, the new prefect of the Imperial Court.

162
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,960
I'm here to help you.

163
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,080
But I've never seen your documents in the Ministry of Personnel.

164
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,160
I wonder if you can help me.

165
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,840
Why didn't you give it to me?

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,400
I guess you're too busy.

167
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,720
Mr. Pei, please wait.

168
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,280
Mr. Zhang.

169
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm worried about His Majesty.

170
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,160
I can't help but worry about a document.

171
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,120
I'm so worried about the imperial exam.

172
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,800
You...

173
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,720
Mr. Zhang.

174
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,360
It's Young Master Lin.

175
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,320
Do you need me?

176
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,880
I'm a new official.

177
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,720
If there's no plan in the Imperial Court,

178
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,040
I'm afraid it will affect the exam.

179
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,840
If you're busy with work,

180
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,840
I can go to the Imperial Court myself.

181
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,880
If you're not busy,

182
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,080
I can go to the Ministry of Personnel to get the documents

183
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,520
and give them to Mr. Pei.

184
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,400
The people there are busy.

185
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,200
I can't bother you with this.

186
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Tomorrow morning,

187
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,040
I'll send the documents to the Imperial Court.

188
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,880
Thank you.

189
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,560
Okay.

190
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,080
Thank you, Young Master Lin.

191
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,680
I heard you live far away.

192
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,080
Did you have breakfast when you went to the court early?

193
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,240
I went to the Ministry of Personnel for three times.

194
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,320
You can go to the Ministry of Personnel for four times.

195
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,840
Young Master Lin invited me to his carriage

196
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,600
and invited me to have lunch.

197
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,080
If others saw us,

198
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,440
they would think we're acquaintances.

199
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,320
If you want to embarrass me,

200
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,560
you have to think about it first.

201
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,320
I don't know how to repay

202
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,360
Young Master Lin's hard work and effort.

203
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,520
I also left home alone

204
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,280
and was exposed to the same body.

205
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,480
You don't have to worry about me.

206
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,840
I'm a new official.

207
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,520
You don't have to worry about me.

208
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,840
Mr. Pei.

209
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,560
Thank you.

210
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,240
Mr. Pei, please.

211
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,800
Do you like light food?

212
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,120
I don't like it.

213
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,640
I just don't have to worry about food.

214
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,200
Running is enough.

215
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,480
If you're not used to it,

216
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,480
I'll invite someone to buy it.

217
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,080
No, no, no.

218
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,560
I'm used to it.

219
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,120
I grew up in the countryside.

220
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,320
I'm used to eating these.

221
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,320
Young Master Lin helped me a lot today

222
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,040
and invited me to have lunch.

223
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,680
I should pay him back.

224
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,760
You're welcome.

225
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,520
No, no, no.

226
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,720
I must pay him back.

227
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,520
You can't

228
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,640
refuse to pay him back even for a meal.

229
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,760
grown

230
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,680
Fortunately,

231
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,160
Prince Yun Shui 감사합니다

232
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,360
I bought it in the name of the enemy.

233
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,920
The Designer's Light Things

234
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,720
seventeen years ago

235
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,320
King Jing Zhao

236
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,240
Dong之後

237
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,760
comments

238
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,480
have not Manning

239
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,400
Why are you so suspicious of the bandit?

240
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,160
At that time,

241
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,360
Mr. Pei was still in the family.

242
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
He didn't admit it.

243
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,680
This is

244
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,600
related to him.

245
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,000
If you're talking about me,

246
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,800
you should say the word.

247
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,240
Why don't you say it?

248
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,880
You want to keep the bandit

249
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,680
when you clean up the imperial censorate,

250
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,880
right?

251
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,120
Yes.

252
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,560
We need to be careful.

253
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,440
Father used to put the books and handwritings

254
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,360
in the study.

255
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,440
Maybe we can find clues from it.

256
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,280
Have you told everyone outside?

257
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,400
Don't worry, General.

258
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,200
Even a mouse

259
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,480
can't be put in here.

260
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,120
This secret door was made by Father secretly.

261
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,200
It's been abandoned for years.

262
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
But no one has found it.

263
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,240
What's the trick of the lock?

264
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,080
Did you make it?

265
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,880
Father used to tell me

266
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,600
that it's from the Western Regions.

267
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,000
Only he and Mother know how to open it.

268
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,960
They never allow me to enter the Western Regions.

269
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
They always lock it here.

270
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,480
In that case,

271
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,880
I don't know how to open the lock.

272
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,240
I don't think so.

273
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,800
What's the problem?

274
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,560
It's unfinished.

275
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,680
It's stunning.

276
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,800
Is it thatual that you locked the allowances inside?

277
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,920
I've never Alma过,

278
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,560
neither healing the 나� Ich CNC solution.

279
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,560
What a pity!

280
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't go.

281
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,400
Be careful around Y cherishedl .

282
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,680
Yes!

283
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,640
Hua affectionate Unga Y.

284
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,260
This is the way in which you can figure it out.

285
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,200
leaving what length I do not believe

286
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,400
How can we avoid the temptation of the king's meal?

287
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,320
Mister,

288
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,200
we are really

289
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,400
fooled by a little trap.

290
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,480
Don't worry.

291
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,880
We can open it.

292
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
What is this?

293
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,680
The King's Meal

294
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,640
Didn't you say

295
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,480
you wouldn't let a mouse in?

296
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,760
I'm going to look for them.

297
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,520
Come back.

298
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Shen Jiang?

299
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,840
Isn't the family who sold pancakes

300
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,840
called Shen before?

301
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,920
It is.

302
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,480
It was made by them.

303
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,120
The handwriting and other things

304
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,560
and the way they manage the business

305
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,560
are all strange.

306
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,640
It's like

307
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,760
they want to distract me.

308
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,680
Has someone

309
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,600
already found out your secret?

310
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,600
The King's Meal

311
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,440
You've been working for four hours.

312
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,760
How can someone dare not

313
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,960
wake up even the King's Meal?

314
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,040
Aunt,

315
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,080
should we give up?

316
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,080
Let's think of another way.

317
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,400
God,

318
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,000
please give me a miracle.

319
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,080
Tell me how to

320
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,080
deal with the ancestors.

321
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,560
How can I treat the young master?

322
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,840
It's too expensive.

323
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,000
Not enough to bring down some money.

324
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,340
You can keep this

325
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,280
and you

326
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,820
can houses

327
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,260
which people owkins will take from this.

328
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,120
Free food?

329
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,580
Where is the place you want to take me to?

330
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,060
You just arrived here, you don't know much about Yongan

331
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,400
It's called

332
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,760
The world's food is in Yongan

333
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,320
Yongan's food is in Ju Xian

334
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,920
The place we are going to eat

335
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,680
is a small restaurant that is about to open in Ju Xian

336
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,360
Before the opening night

337
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,560
Provide

338
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,240
Free food

339
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,560
Free food?

340
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,480
Yes

341
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,880
Did you receive the award?

342
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,560
Shao Yin also knows

343
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,300
I was worried that I was shy

344
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,960
It's a free meal for Shao Yin

345
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,320
I'm afraid it's not good

346
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,440
Look at the Shao Yin color

347
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,880
Is it the list you also left?

348
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,880
I also want to go there for free one day

349
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,640
So good

350
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,560
We will go there for free

351
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,280
It's almost over

352
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,240
The ancestors can't come

353
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Yangyang

354
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,200
Go to bed and tell your grandfather not to get hot

355
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,800
How many times have you been hot

356
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,320
Let's eat quickly

357
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,880
Aunt, cheer up

358
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,000
Grandma said that the carbon gas will let the luck slip away

359
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,200
Okay, the luck is back

360
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,880
Is this the place for free food?

361
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,280
Master Lin

362
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,080
Hurry up

363
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,680
C meter

364
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,680
The ghost has continued to have fun

365
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,840
Dowry time

366
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,680
Black and white

367
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,240
Round off

368
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,240
Is it a bear?

369
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,280
It's our super love hairs

370
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,280
Camel

371
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
Elated

372
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,640
Sweet not greasy

373
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,980
A new soap

374
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,960
Good food and fun

375
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,920
Prawns

376
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,660
The oyster ghost continues to show

377
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,720
For Mr. Pei

378
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,800
For Shao Yin

379
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,560
To eat first

380
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,320
Come, let's eat together

381
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,200
Come, let's eat together

382
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,000
Drink a little

383
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,640
Hey, why didn't you drink it?

384
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,640
Young Master, you're a little bit...

385
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,640
Young Master Lin, we were wrong to have drunk the wine before.

386
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,640
If we drink this, we won't drink with you anymore.

387
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,640
Sorry, I don't drink.

388
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,640
Young Master, I have something to say to you.

389
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
What is it?

390
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,640
I mean, I'm a little drunk.

391
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,640
What is it?

392
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
You said you didn't drink.

393
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,640
This is called lobster.

394
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,640
It's the most expensive fish in our restaurant.

395
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,640
Try it.

396
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,640
But we can't buy this kind of ingredients here.

397
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,640
So we can only use steamed buns instead.

398
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,640
How is it, Young Master?

399
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,640
Try it.

400
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,640
Yes, yes, yes. Try it.

401
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
Try it.

402
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
Lobster.

403
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,640
Yes.

404
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,640
Try it.

405
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,640
It's delicious.

406
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,640
You don't eat or drink.

407
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,640
You have to drink it.

408
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,640
Yes.

409
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,640
I don't drink.

410
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,640
No, no, you can't drink it anymore.

411
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
Xiao Jin is coming.

412
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
Xiao Jin can't go out.

413
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,640
If it's too late, I can't go back.

414
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,640
Then it's even better.

415
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,640
You just stay here and drink.

416
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,640
If you drink too much, you'll live here.

417
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,640
Yes.

418
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
Be positive, everyone.

419
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,640
Right?

420
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,640
If he drinks, it's over.

421
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,640
Sha Yin,

422
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,640
you have to give me a face for this cup.

423
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,640
There's no one who doesn't drink, right?

424
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
Yes.

425
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,640
If I don't drink this, it means

426
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,640
you haven't forgiven me.

427
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,640
Yes, you haven't forgiven me.

428
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,640
I didn't mean it.

429
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
Then drink it.

430
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,640
Just one cup.

431
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,640
Just one cup.

432
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
Just one cup.

433
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,640
It seems that you all

434
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,640
have to persuade me to drink this cup.

435
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,640
Why is it necessary?

436
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,640
Then I'll drink it first.

437
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
I...

438
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,640
Look at the Young Master.

439
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,640
He drank it already.

440
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,640
Good.

441
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,640
Good.

442
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,640
This wine.

443
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,640
Let's drink it together.

444
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,640
Come on.

445
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,640
Mr. Pei,

446
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
one cup.

447
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
Sha Yin,

448
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,640
I tell you,

449
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,640
there's one cup for two.

450
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,640
Let's drink one more.

451
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,640
I don't have much alcohol.

452
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,640
You have much alcohol?

453
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,640
I'm willing to drink it.

454
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,640
Great.

455
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,640
Come on.

456
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,640
Come on.

457
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,640
Young Master Lin.

458
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,640
Young Master.

459
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,640
Young Master.

460
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,640
Finally, I get the real person.

461
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,640
What are you doing?

462
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,640
What are you doing?

463
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,640
You're a ancestors.

464
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,640
I've already asked A Ji.

465
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,640
When the back yard of Yun Shui Yuan

466
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,640
was in the night,

467
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,640
there was a gap

468
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
without a back yard.

469
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
As long as we can find the key

470
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,640
and avoid Xiao Jin's patrol,

471
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
we have a chance

472
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,640
to sneak in before he wakes up.

473
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,640
I'm not going to let you go.

474
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,640
I'm not going to let you go.

475
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,640
I'm not going to let you go.

476
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,640
I'm not going to let you go.

477
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,640
I'm not going to let you go.

478
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,640
Hurry up.

479
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,640
You'll wake up in a minute.

480
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,640
Hurry up.

481
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,640
I'm tired.

482
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,640
Be gentle.

483
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,640
Slow down.

484
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
It's okay.

485
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,640
Go on.

486
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,640
There's nothing.

487
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,640
Nothing.

488
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,640
Are you two okay?

489
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,640
Let me help you.

490
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,640
In this age,

491
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,640
does the owner of the house

492
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,640
have the key?

493
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,640
Is he going to hang his bottom?

494
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,640
Is he going to hang his neck

495
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,640
and hide it in his clothes?

496
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,640
Hurry up.

497
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,640
My wife wants to do something to me.

498
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,640
Stop.

499
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,640
Is this for real?

500
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,640
Grandma.

501
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
Those things that the ancestors picked up,

502
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,640
will he use them to deal with us?

503
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
Yes.

504
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
He can't really deal with us.

505
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,640
Grandpa said

506
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
before Lin Yan was caught

507
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
by our ancestors,

508
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,640
he would be cold and ruthless.

509
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,640
Gongcai.

510
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,640
Wake up.

511
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
What's wrong with you?

512
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
Gongcai.

513
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
You're so rude.

514
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,640
Let's start with him.

515
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,640
Yes.

516
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,640
Gongcai.

517
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,640
No.

518
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,640
You're drunk.

519
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,640
Wake up.

520
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,640
Don't touch me.

521
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,640
Dad.

522
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
You're drunk.

523
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,640
You just want to get me drunk.

524
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,640
How about this?

525
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,640
I'll kill one person first

526
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,640
to wake you up.

527
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Then,

528
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,640
you should be willing to

529
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,640
tell me your identity and purpose.

530
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,640
No.

531
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,640
No.

532
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,640
Sato.

533
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,640
You're good.

534
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,640
Let us go.

535
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Don't kill us.

536
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,640
Sato.

537
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,640
Who's the one you're talking about?

538
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,640
Dad.

539
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,640
I'm wrong.

540
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,640
I'm wrong.

541
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,640
Please.

542
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,640
Please.

543
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,640
Sato.

544
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,640
What's your purpose?

545
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,640
We're wrong.

546
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,640
Sato.

547
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,640
Sato.

548
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,640
Please let my daughter go.

549
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,640
Don't do this.

550
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,640
We have no purpose.

551
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,640
Sato.

552
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,640
I'll count to three.

553
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,640
No.

554
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,640
Three.

555
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,640
No.

556
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,640
We have nothing.

557
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,640
Two.

558
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,640
Sato.

559
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,640
One.

560
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,640
Why did you take my wife away?

561
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,640
Sato, are you crazy?

562
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
This is a curse.

563
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,640
When you were telling the story of the curse,

564
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
you said she had a engagement

565
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,640
before she married into our family.

566
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,640
She didn't say that.

567
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,640
But my mom likes to read

568
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,640
those romance novels.

569
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,640
Isn't it all written like that?

570
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,640
There must be a mysterious

571
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
divorce in that kind of nonsense.

572
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,640
This is a standard match.

573
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,640
I've been through a lot.

574
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,640
Oh, no.

575
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,640
This is all over.

576
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,640
Don't be angry.

577
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,640
Look at the curse.

578
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,640
Sato, don't be so confused.

579
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,640
You said

580
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,640
you were my fiancee.

581
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,640
Do you have any evidence?

582
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
I know your real identity.

583
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,640
Qingyang Cui Che.

584
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,640
This Lin Shaoyin

585
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,640
was named Cui Che.

586
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,640
He was a former man of Qingyang.

587
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,640
When he was eight years old,

588
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,640
his father committed a death sentence.

589
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,640
The Cui family was all destroyed.

590
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,640
Only he was saved by someone.

591
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
He was changed his name and became a monk.

592
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,640
He survived.

593
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
Go on.

594
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,640
The Cui family was all destroyed.

595
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,640
Lin Shaoyin changed his name

596
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
and became a monk.

597
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,640
But the family I was engaged to

598
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,640
is not my family name.

599
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,640
We were married.

600
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,640
When Cui Che died,

601
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,640
Shaoyin was only eight years old.

602
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,640
It's not strange that

603
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
my family name is wrong.

604
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,640
It's not strange.

605
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,640
I feel sorry for you.

606
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,640
You must have forgotten your real identity.

607
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
But please don't worry.

608
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,640
We businessmen are good people.

609
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
Besides,

610
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,640
we are still relatives.

611
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,640
How can we be relatives?

612
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,640
Don't worry about it.

613
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,640
Anyway,

614
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,640
we won't tell anyone about you.

615
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,640
Think about it.

616
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,640
We are relatives.

617
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,640
If we hurt you,

618
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,640
we will have to cooperate.

619
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,640
Yes.

620
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,640
Come on.

621
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Come on.

622
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,640
Shaoyin asked us what our purpose was.

623
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,640
We did have an unexpected request.

624
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,640
Please make the decision

625
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,640
and let us live in Yunshui Garden.

626
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,640
You want to take me to Yunshui Garden?

627
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,640
Just say it.

628
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
Why do you have to bother?

629
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,640
Shaoyin means...

630
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,640
Impossible.

631
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,640
I've thought about it.

632
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,640
You are the son of the King of the Eighth,

633
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,640
but you don't allow others to eat his food.

634
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,640
In that case,

635
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,640
I can only use the Flying Sausage to make a place for myself.

636
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,640
Mr. Pei.

637
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,640
Get up and ask me.

638
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
Shaoyin is mad at you.

639
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Mr. Pei, tell me.

640
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,640
Shaoyin is making a mess.

641
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,640
He is going to marry you.

642
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,640
Mr. Pei.

643
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,640
You want to die?

644
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,640
Touch my mouth.

645
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,640
We are not only married,

646
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,640
but also have a family.

647
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
You must be responsible for me.

648
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,640
If you don't let us live in Yunshui Garden,

649
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,640
I'll cry on the street and count to three.

650
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,640
Count to three again.

651
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,640
One,

652
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,640
two,

653
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,640
three.

654
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,640
Everyone, please give him a good reason.

655
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,640
Mr. Lin...

656
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,640
I agree.

657
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,640
Mr. Lin, you are so kind.

658
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
You don't have to be so strict with me.

659
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,640
I'm really grateful.

660
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,640
You are the most important man.

661
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,640
I believe you won't regret it.

662
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,640
I promise you

663
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
I won't tell anyone about what I know.

664
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,640
There won't be a third person in our relationship.

665
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,640
There won't be a eighth person in our relationship.

666
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,640
At this moment,

667
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,640
the family is in a dilemma.

668
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,640
Please take them back

669
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,640
and clear their name.

670
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,640
Yunshui Garden

671
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,640
is not the same as the modern city of Shen.

672
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,640
Yes, it is.

673
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,640
Can we really live here for free?

674
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,640
I'm afraid that young master

675
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,640
will die if he doesn't ask for money.

676
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,640
Don't talk nonsense.

677
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,640
You are scaring me.

678
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,640
Come on.

679
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,640
Here they are.

680
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
Here they are.

681
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,640
Young master.

682
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,640
Young master.

683
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,640
You are staying in Yunshui Garden for the time being.

684
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,640
Others will criticize you.

685
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,640
Although you are engaged to the Shen family,

686
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,640
you are still single.

687
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,640
I don't know what kind of status you have.

688
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,640
Young master,

689
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,640
you won't regret it again, will you?

690
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,640
Our family

691
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,640
has moved our luggage.

692
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,640
No way.

693
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,640
I have to carry it back.

694
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,640
I'm just worried

695
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,640
that if I don't have a suitable name,

696
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,640
my colleagues will find out

697
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,640
that I have a bad reputation.

698
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,640
How can I deal with the Shen family?

699
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,640
Young master,

700
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,640
I'm in Honglong...

701
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,640
I read in a book that

702
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,640
relatives can live together

703
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,640
even if they are not married.

704
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,640
Moreover,

705
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
we have so many elders.

706
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
Young master said that

707
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,640
the Shen family and Lin family are relatives.

708
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,640
The Shen family is in trouble.

709
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,640
The elders are against it.

710
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,640
Yes.

711
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
They are relatives.

712
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,640
They are all relatives.

713
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,640
Yes.

714
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,640
Fine.

715
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Let's fight.

716
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,640
Thank you, young master.

717
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,640
This guy

718
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,640
deliberately made us

719
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,640
to get along with each other

720
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,640
in the name of cousin.

721
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,640
He made us feel

722
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,640
that he was the one who caused trouble.

723
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,640
He is indeed an elder.

724
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,640
He has a good reputation.

725
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,640
Young master,

726
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
you are so kind to accept us.

727
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,640
We know the reason.

728
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,640
The youngest young master of Jinzhao

729
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,640
can't have a fiancee

730
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
from a country like me.

731
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,640
It's good to have a good reputation.

732
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,640
I know the rules.

733
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,640
The first thing to do is to kill the first person.

734
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,640
The first thing to do is to kill the first person?

735
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,640
I know you don't want to marry me.

736
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,640
You are really not like the ordinary young lady.

737
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,640
You don't look sad

738
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,640
after you get married.

739
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,640
No.

740
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,640
I'm just joking.

741
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
It's so sad.

742
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,640
It's so sad.

743
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,640
Yes.

744
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,640
It's quite sad.

745
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,640
The wedding hall is ready.

746
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,640
You can take a rest for now.

747
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,640
Thank you, young master.

748
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,640
Thank you, young master.

749
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,640
Thank you, young master.

750
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,640
Dongcheng.

751
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,640
Everyone,

752
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,640
please come in.

753
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
Okay.

754
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,640
Go to the room.

755
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,640
Nobody cares about me.

756
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,640
I'm leaving.

757
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,640
Aunt, please go.

758
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,640
What are you doing?

759
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,640
Help me take the bag.

760
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
Madam Shen.

761
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,640
Young master Lin.

762
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,640
I'm sorry for the offence

763
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,640
of the two ancestors.

764
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,640
Madam Shen.

765
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,640
I had no other choice

766
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,640
but to make this decision.

767
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,640
Who knew that I would be fooled?

768
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,640
Yes.

769
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,640
If we don't say that,

770
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,640
Madam Lin will kill us.

771
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,640
We have no other choice.

772
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,640
But it's mainly A Ji who said that.

773
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,640
She is not a bad person.

774
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,640
You are really a good boy.

775
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,640
We really don't know

776
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,640
that before Madam Lin joined the army,

777
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,640
she had a marriage contract.

778
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,640
Yes.

779
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,640
You two should

780
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,640
discuss this matter

781
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
in the end.

782
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,640
What's wrong?

783
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,640
Is this the point?

784
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,640
You can't even understand it.

785
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,640
You two,

786
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,640
we will find a way to go back

787
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,640
and end this absurdity as soon as possible.

788
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,640
Please forgive us.

789
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,640
Please forgive us.

790
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,640
Forgive us.

791
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,640
I'm sorry.

792
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,640
I'm sorry.

793
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,640
I'm sorry.

794
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,640
I'm sorry.

795
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,640
I'm sorry, Mr. Su.

796
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,640
I'm sorry, Mr. Su.

797
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,640
I'm sorry.

798
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,640
A Ji,

799
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,640
you lied so much.

800
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,640
Will you be affected by it?

801
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,640
Just because you changed the past,

802
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,640
it will affect the future.

803
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,640
That's troublesome.

804
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,640
Then it's not going to be us.

805
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,640
Yes.

806
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,640
There's no other way.

807
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
If we don't say that,

808
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,640
there's no future.

809
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,640
We are going to be cut off now.

810
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,640
Madam Lin,

811
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
what's going on?

812
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,640
There seems to be someone outside.

813
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
As expected.

814
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,640
As expected what?

815
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,640
His diarhea to us is expected.

816
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,640
What does it mean?

817
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,640
I just heard the meaning of the word.

818
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,640
He.

819
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,640
I'm sorry.

820
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,640
Wang Jun,

821
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,640
this family

822
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,640
never slept.

823
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,640
They were all quiet.

824
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,640
I don't know what they were talking about.

825
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,640
What do you plan to do next?

826
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,640
They want to try to enter the Yunshui Garden.

827
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,640
Naturally, they will not stay quiet.

828
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,640
Wait for them to understand.

829
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,640
Lu Chang,

830
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,640
my parents did set up a marriage for me.

831
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,640
But I still remember

832
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,640
that family's surname is Zheng.

833
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,640
It's not a family name.

834
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,640
Do you remember?

835
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,640
Although I've been in the Cui family since I was a child,

836
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,640
I've always been working in the yard.

837
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,640
I've never heard of this.

838
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,640
Look.

839
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,640
I just taught him how to ride a bicycle.

840
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,640
He always does this in the yard.

841
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,640
Uncle, mother.

842
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,640
Uncle, I can do this.

843
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,640
Let me see.

844
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,640
It's so delicate.

845
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,640
Good. Good. Good.

846
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,640
This bicycle

847
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,640
can be used for cargo during the war.

848
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,640
But it may not be a good thing if it can be made.

849
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,640
We Cui family

850
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,640
will be a good general during the war.

851
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,640
Protect the country.

852
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,640
But I still hope

853
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,640
that the world will be peaceful

854
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,640
as it is today.

855
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,640
We just need to be loyal

856
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,640
and protect the people.

857
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,640
Okay, I won't talk anymore.

858
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,640
Your mother will talk to you.

859
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,640
Ah Che.

860
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,640
Actually, today,

861
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
father and mother have set up a marriage for you.

862
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,640
When you grow up,

863
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,640
you should treat your wife well.

864
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,640
Why do I have to set up a marriage?

865
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,640
What's the use of marrying my wife?

866
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,640
She can't make me a bicycle.

867
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,640
Ah Che.

868
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,640
Because

869
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,640
father and mother

870
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,640
can't be with you forever.

871
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,640
So I hope you can have your own family.

872
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,640
Don't you always want to be a big husband?

873
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,640
A big husband should be like your father.

874
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,640
He can treat his wife and children well.

875
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,640
He is not ashamed of the people of the world.

876
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,640
Be careful.

877
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,640
No one can touch it.

878
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,640
Mother.

879
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,640
Calm down.

880
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,640
My legs seem to be broken.

881
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,640
I can't walk anymore.

882
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,640
Search carefully.

883
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,640
No one can stay alive.

884
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,640
Little husband.

885
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,640
You'd better not

886
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,640
leave me alone.

887
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,640
I'm just a family member who is always taken care of by others.

888
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,640
The Cui family has always treated me very well.

889
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,640
I can't let the Cui family

890
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,640
let the last person

891
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,640
die here.

892
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,640
Shut up, Liu Chang.

893
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,640
Search inside.

894
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,640
Do you want to lure everyone here?

895
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,640
You haven't reached the end.

896
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,640
Come on, I'll carry you.

897
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,640
Ah Che.

898
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,640
Your father will never do that.

899
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,640
You must live.

900
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,640
Find out everything.

901
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,640
Revenge for the Cui family.

902
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,640
But in the past years,

903
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,640
your appearance is very different from that of the young master.

904
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,640
How did this family recognize you?

905
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,640
You should keep an eye on them these days.

906
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,640
I'll find a chance to see their faces.

907
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,640
I'll find a chance to see their faces.

908
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,640
I'll find a chance to see their faces.

909
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,640
I'll find a chance to see their faces.

910
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,640
I'll find a chance to see their faces.

911
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,640
I'll find a chance to see their faces.

912
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,640
I'll find a chance to see their faces.

913
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,640
I'll find a chance to see their faces.

914
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,640
I'll find a chance to see their faces.

915
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,640
I'll find a chance to see their faces.

916
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,640
I'll find a chance to see their faces.

917
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,640
I'll find a chance to see their faces.

918
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,640
I'll find a chance to see their faces.

919
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,640
I'll find a chance to see their faces.

920
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,640
I'll find a chance to see their faces.

921
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,640
The rain is falling, the rain is falling.

922
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,640
The wind is swaying, the clouds are swaying.

923
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,640
Listen, the old heart that once moved.

924
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,640
True love or only memories.

925
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,640
You are the dragon in the dream, you are the star.

926
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,640
I can't sigh, I see you under the moon.

927
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,640
I can't help but feel sad when I see your eyes.

928
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,640
Can we meet in the future?

929
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,640
I thought the cold was going to end.

930
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,640
But it turned red.

931
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,640
Even the ice is clear.

932
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,640
It's my heart that's broken.

933
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,640
You are the laughter, you are the logic.

934
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,640
I need to put you in my life.

935
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,640
I can't help but feel sad when I see your eyes.

936
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:16,640
Can we meet in the future?

937
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,640
I thought the cold was going to end.

938
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,640
But it turned red.

939
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,640
Even the ice is clear.

940
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,640
It's my heart that's broken.

941
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,640
You are the laughter, you are the logic.

942
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,640
I need to put you in my life.

943
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,640
