00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,680
I'm going to make a

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,920
I'm going to make a

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,980
I'm going to make a

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,820
I'm going to make a

00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,860
I'm going to make a

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,700
I'm going to make a

I'm going to make a

I'm going to make a

00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,720
You see

20
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,720
Are you going to love him

21
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,720
Are you going to love him

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,760
Are you going to love him

23
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,760
Are you going to love me

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,740
Chao Chao Chao Chao Chao Chao Chao Chao

25
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,740

00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,740

Chao Chao Chao Chao Chao Chao Chao Chao Chao Chao

28
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,740
Sweet gourd

29
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,740
Everything can be made with sweet gourd

30
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,740
What is that? I want it

31
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,740
This is spicy sweet gourd

32
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,740
Inside is a spicy flour

33
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,740
Our Yoyong likes it the most

34
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,740
Taste it

35
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,740
Taste it

36
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,740
Is it delicious?

37
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,740
Sweet outside, spicy inside

38
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,740
Delicious

39
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,740
Ok, master

40
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,740
I want this

41
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,740
Thank you

42
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,740
No more

43
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,740
Sweet gourd

44
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,740
Now, the sweet gourd is 60 yuan per jin

45
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,740
This ice sweet gourd is only 5 yuan

46
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,740
This is not made by Ruxing

47
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,740
This is the sweet gourd from Yangzhou

48
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,740
Not cheap

49
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,740
But the sweet gourd

50
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,740
Only need to cover the bag outside

51
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,740
Not much

52
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,740
Children love sweet

53
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,740
Making sweet gourd

54
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,740
Can be used at the cheapest price

55
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,740
Let children all over Yongan eat it

56
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,740
Except Yangyang

57
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,740
He has enough sugar

58
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,740
Children

59
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,740
This time

60
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,740
It's interesting

61
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,740
Listen to the future customers

62
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,740
All as friends

63
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,740
Children are children

64
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,740
Other customers are friends

65
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,740
You and your family

66
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,740
Always use such words

67
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,740
Sometimes I think

68
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,740
You are not the same person as me

69
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,740
But

70
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,740
Always more interesting

71
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,740
Will make me think

72
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,740
I want to continue like this

73
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,740
With you

74
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,740
With you

75
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,740
Never change

76
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,740
Let me

77
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,740
Why are you the only one in the thirteenth?

78
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,740
I haven't found a suitable master

79
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,740
Brother took Yangyang to see

80
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,740
Aunt and mother are worried about brother

81
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,740
So they went with him

82
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,740
Yuan caught a cold

83
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,740
I told him not to manage the store

84
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,740
Go to the doctor

85
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,740
I'm going to cook

86
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,740
The rain

87
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,740
The wind is swaying

88
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,740
The clouds are spinning

89
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,740
Listen

90
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,740
If you want to understand, you have to believe

91
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,740
True love or only memories

92
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,740
You are the dragon

93
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,740
You are the clear heart

94
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,740
No need to sigh

95
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,740
See you under the moon

96
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,740
With eyes to exchange

97
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,740
Heart is not self-evident

98
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,740
Can I go to the road

99
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,740
And look at the sound

100
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,740
Shaoguang

101
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,740
Are you in your heart

102
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,740
How much do you care about me

103
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,740
Will make me think

104
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,740
Just keep going like this

105
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,740
With you

106
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,740
With you

107
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,740
Never change

108
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,740
I think you are confused

109
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,740
I am addicted

110
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,740
I am still her family

111
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,740
Heart is moving

112
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,740
The wind blows the lightest

113
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,740
Is the hidden feeling of the humble

114
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,740
I have been hiding for a lifetime

115
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,740
Hundred miles away

116
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,740
Want to wander

117
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,740
After the heart is quiet

118
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,740
Come back to isolate

119
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,740
Unrequitedly

120
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,740
Approaching

121
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,740
To change the world

122
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,740
Only we

123
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,740
Unrequitedly

124
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,740
The smoke is coming out

125
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,740
The smoke is coming out

126
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,740
The smoke is coming out

127
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,740
The smoke is coming out

128
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,740
And the red ears are cold

129
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,740
And the clear night is not clear

130
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,740
The heart is not hot

131
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,740
The laughter is you

132
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,740
The logic is you

133
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,740
Still need to put you

134
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,740
Into the life

135
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,740
Friendship is not low

136
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,740
If you want to go down a little bit

137
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,740
You can take a few steps

138
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,740
A Ji

139
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,740
Aunt

140
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,740
How is it?

141
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,740
Is there a suitable teacher?

142
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,740
I want to be a teacher

143
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,740
No

144
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,740
Their teachers

145
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,740
No, my dad is great

146
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,740
They can't even read the homework

147
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,740
I still want to go to the red door

148
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,740
I don't think you want to go to school

149
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,740
You are just a high-skilled person

150
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,740
And the red door

151
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,740
I see you like the red door

152
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,740
If you don't let me go to the red door

153
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,740
I don't want to go to school

154
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,740
You've said it in your heart, right?

155
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,740
You just don't want to read

156
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,740
You really have to control it

157
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,740
Yangyang

158
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,740
Listen to me

159
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,740
This place is a little bad

160
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,740
It's a girl

161
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,740
Can't go to school

162
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,740
Red door

163
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,740
This place is where the Crown Prince studies

164
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,740
Our family doesn't have enough officials

165
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,740
No qualification to study

166
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,740
We do have officials

167
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,740
Isn't there a shadow?

168
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,740
And I don't want to go because of the Crown Prince

169
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,740
Didn't Aunt hear about it?

170
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,740
There are all the foot steps

171
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,740
And it's good to ride a horse and shoot arrows

172
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,740
Ride horse and shoot arrows

173
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,740
You still want to play

174
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,740
How dangerous

175
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,740
I just want to go to the red door

176
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,740
You

177
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,740
Go to the red door

178
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,740
I want to go to the red door

179
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,740
Okay

180
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,740
Let's think about going to the red door

181
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,740
Look, today we are the first time

182
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,740
Watching snow in Yongan

183
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,740
Let dad take you to pile snowmen, okay?

184
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,740
OK

185
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,740
I'll pile you a snowman later

186
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,740
I think

187
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,740
Whether Yangyang is an excuse

188
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,740
Or really want to go to the red door

189
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,740
We really have to think about it

190
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,740
Indeed, there is a limit in time

191
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,740
But I thought enough

192
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,740
We can't really put Yangyang

193
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,740
Study at home

194
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,740
Otherwise he doesn't know

195
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,740
How to get along with his peers

196
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,740
The vision will also become narrow

197
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,740
That red door is not half the place

198
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,740
All the people who enter are nobles

199
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,740
You can't go in at all

200
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,740
Moreover

201
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,740
How do you solve the matter that girls can't go to school?

202
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,740
You can't be a girl and a man, right?

203
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,740
A girl and a man

204
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,740
It's not impossible

205
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,740
No

206
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,740
A girl and a man

207
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,740
A girl and a man

208
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,740
I

209
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,740
Well

210
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,740
A girl and a man

211
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,740
You're a girl

212
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,740
A girl and a man

213
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,740
A girl and a man

214
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,740
A girl and a man

215
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,740
I'll go.

216
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,740
It's getting cold.

217
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,740
Do you want to warm yourself up?

218
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,740
Try it.

219
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,740
No, I can't smell it.

220
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,740
Can you help me smell it?

221
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,740
I insisted on taking my family to the city.

222
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,740
I almost put my family in danger.

223
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,740
It's my fault.

224
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:08,740
Since I came to Yongan, I've found that I'm a little arrogant.

225
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,740
Actually, it's not just your problem.

226
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,740
You are a little bit of a problem.

227
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,740
But at the critical time, you didn't lose your temper.

228
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,740
Whether it's the time in Su Shui City or other times.

229
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,740
As long as you are in danger, you stand up and stand in front of your family.

230
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,740
I know I'm not a good temper.

231
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,740
I can't keep you holding it in.

232
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,740
I should change it.

233
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,740
I have a problem.

234
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,740
How can you change it?

235
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,740
I want to change it.

236
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,740
No, I have a problem.

237
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,740
I'm too angry.

238
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,740
I change it.

239
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,740
No, no.

240
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,740
My problem is definitely bigger than yours.

241
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,740
I'll change it first.

242
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,740
I'm angry.

243
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,740
I'm a little bit of a bad temper.

244
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,740
I'm always giving you a temper.

245
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,740
Give it to me.

246
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,740
You are my wife.

247
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,740
Even if you have a problem, it's my problem.

248
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,740
It's always my problem.

249
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,740
I change it first.

250
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,740
OK, OK, OK.

251
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,740
You still have a big problem.

252
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,740
You change it first.

253
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,740
I change it.

254
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,740
What?

255
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,740
Then, if I change it well,

256
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,740
I can't...

257
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,740
Just...

258
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,740
It's cold in the city.

259
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,740
It's easy to catch a cold when you sleep in the hall.

260
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,740
Move back and live.

261
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,740
OK.

262
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,740
What's wrong?

263
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,740
Oh my god.

264
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,740
What's wrong?

265
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,740
The ancestors' hands are so clever.

266
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,740
This washing machine

267
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,740
was the first to be made in the country of Zi Cai more than a thousand years ago.

268
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,740
Oh my god, he's an ancient man.

269
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,740
He can make it.

270
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,740
I said I was seriously suspicious.

271
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,740
The ancestors also came here.

272
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,740
No.

273
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,740
I complained about the washing machine before.

274
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,740
I just said that

275
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,740
my hometown has a machine called a washing machine.

276
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,740
Then I drew a simple drawing.

277
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,740
Who would have thought that he would make it.

278
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,740
The ancestors are so nice to you.

279
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,740
It's unfair.

280
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,740
I'm working hard to clean the machine.

281
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,740
I've never seen him make a washing machine before.

282
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,740
It's so special.

283
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,740
Yes.

284
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,740
It's the first time I've seen such a beautiful machine.

285
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,740
Mrs. Shen.

286
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,740
The snowman at the gate of your house is so special.

287
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,740
Today, I came here to eat with two ladies.

288
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,740
I heard that you were in the backyard.

289
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,740
So I came to see you.

290
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,740
What is this big box?

291
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,740
This is...

292
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,740
You may not know.

293
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,740
This is called a washing machine.

294
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,740
A washing machine?

295
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,740
It can wash dishes.

296
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,740
In winter, you don't have to touch cold water.

297
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,740
So amazing.

298
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,740
Your family eats and uses it well.

299
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,740
How can you make something interesting?

300
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,740
Yes.

301
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,740
I think this is made by the Shen family.

302
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,740
No need to say.

303
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,740
Shen Lang,

304
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,740
you are good and knowledgeable.

305
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,740
Why didn't you think of getting another one?

306
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,740
I...

307
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,740
I still want to focus on my career.

308
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,740
I'm not in a hurry.

309
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,740
You are still young.

310
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,740
Shen Lang is worried about you.

311
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,740
But Mrs. Shen,

312
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,740
you are in a hurry to get married.

313
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,740
Yes.

314
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,740
Mrs. Shen should also think about herself.

315
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,740
I heard that a few days ago,

316
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,740
you went to the nine-story building of Guixiang and the Liu family's proposal.

317
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,740
The Liu family is a big and wealthy family.

318
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,740
You didn't even like this.

319
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,740
Mrs. Shen,

320
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,740
what kind of girl do you like?

321
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,740
What kind of girl do you like?

322
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,740
Tell me.

323
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,740
I'll introduce you.

324
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,740
Tell me.

325
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,740
I don't even know what kind of girl you like.

326
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,740
Yes, she is shy.

327
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,740
I like...

328
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,740
who believes in me.

329
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,740
Do you want us to win

330
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,740
or them to win?

331
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,740
I bet you win.

332
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,740
You can remember what I said.

333
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,740
You didn't say too much about the simple list you drew.

334
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,740
I thought about it.

335
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,740
I still don't know how to make it work.

336
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,740
I had to quit the ball and make a handball.

337
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,740
No matter how difficult it is,

338
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,740
you won't leave me to protect yourself.

339
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,740
Hurry up and catch me.

340
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,740
Young Master, help me.

341
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,740
I promise you with my life,

342
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,740
you will be fine.

343
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,740
Yes.

344
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,740
No more?

345
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,740
Is there more?

346
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,740
Young Master is off work.

347
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,740
No, he's off duty.

348
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,740
Young Master, let's go.

349
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,740
Let's go.

350
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,740
I saw a lot of people buying sugar-coated haws

351
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,740
but no one was there.

352
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,740
I came to the backyard to see.

353
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,740
No one?

354
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,740
No, I'll go see.

355
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,740
Thank you, Young Master.

356
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,740
Welcome.

357
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,740
You're really good at making up for it.

358
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,740
Save and spend.

359
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,740
The discounted buff is on sale.

360
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,740
Eat, drink, play, and buy.

361
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,740
It's only 11 yuan per cat.

362
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,740
I really like Lin Yan.

363
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,740
I'm sorry.

364
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,740
A Ji, what did you say?

365
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,740
Nothing.

366
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,740
A Ji, help me.

367
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,740
Help me.

368
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,740
Look at this cold weather.

369
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,740
How can you jump into a pool?

370
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,740
Do you know that in ancient times,

371
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,740
it's easy to die from a cold?

372
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,740
What are you doing?

373
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,740
Here, here.

374
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,740
Hurry up.

375
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,740
Ginger juice and milk.

376
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,740
A Ji, drink it.

377
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,740
You said it's free.

378
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,740
Be careful.

379
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,740
Young Master,

380
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,740
Zhao Erlang is still in Yongan.

381
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,740
He's the Zhao Xunzhi from the Imperial House.

382
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,740
It's really him.

383
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,740
He should have been a good man

384
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,740
and have been a traitor.

385
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,740
But he still has the nerve to be a traitor.

386
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,740
In the future,

387
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,740
try to get close to Zhao Xunzhi.

388
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,740
Okay.

389
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,740
By the way,

390
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,740
you fell into the pond in the garden.

391
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,740
Why didn't you say it earlier?

392
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,740
I just said it was about Zhao Xunzhi.

393
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,740
You...

394
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,740
Put on your clothes.

395
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,740
Lady Shen.

396
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,740
Is Lady Shen in the house?

397
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,740
Hurry up.

398
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,740
Stop her.

399
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,740
Don't let her in.

400
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,740
Hurry up.

401
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,740
Uncle.

402
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,740
Young Master,

403
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,740
why are you here?

404
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,740
It's late at night.

405
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,740
Shouldn't you have a rest?

406
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,740
I heard that Lady Shen fell into the water.

407
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,740
I came to see her.

408
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,740
How is she?

409
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,740
She's fine.

410
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,740
She just fell into the water.

411
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,740
Besides,

412
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,740
your kitchen is not as high as her knees.

413
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,740
She can't have anything she wants.

414
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,740
Why would she fall into the water?

415
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,740
If it's convenient,

416
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,740
can I go in and have a look?

417
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,740
It's not convenient.

418
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,740
It's really not convenient.

419
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,740
Young Master.

420
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,740
Young Master.

421
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,740
Just take a look.

422
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,740
Young Master.

423
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,740
Young Master.

424
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,740
Young Master.

425
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,740
Young Master.

426
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,740
Young Master.

427
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,740
Young Master.

428
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,740
Young Master.

429
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,740
Young Master.

430
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,740
How did you get in here?

431
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,740
I'm sorry.

432
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,740
I heard the cough.

433
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,740
I was worried about the whip.

434
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,740
I was worried about you.

435
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,740
How is Lady Shen?

436
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,740
Thank you for your concern.

437
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,740
I just feel a little cold and feel unwell.

438
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,740
Please go back first.

439
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,740
I'll take a look at you

440
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,740
and make sure you're fine.

441
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,740
I'll go back.

442
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,740
I'm really fine.

443
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,740
Young Master, don't come over.

444
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,740
Please go back first.

445
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,740
Why did you suddenly fall into the water?

446
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,740
Young Master.

447
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,740
Young Master.

448
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,740
Young Master.

449
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,740
Young Master, take your time.

450
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,740
Lady Shen.

451
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,740
Sir.

452
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,740
Sir.

453
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,740
Your clothes are...

454
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,740
Oh, no.

455
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,740
Lady Shen.

456
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,740
Your ancestor is doomed.

457
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,740
He ran back because he was worried about Ji.

458
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,740
Isn't he the most attentive to medical rules?

459
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,740
So his reaction is...

460
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,740
He's going to be a big trouble for Ji.

461
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,740
Why is it a big trouble?

462
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,740
I'm sorry.

463
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,740
I'm sorry.

464
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,740
I'm sorry.

465
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,740
I'm sorry.

466
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,740
I'm sorry.

467
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,740
I'm sorry.

468
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,740
I'm sorry.

469
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,740
I'm sorry.

470
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,740
I'm sorry.

471
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,740
I'm sorry.

472
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,740
Guan Xiaoyang.

473
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,740
It has nothing to do with you.

474
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,740
It's not easy to be a young man.

475
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,740
Put on your clothes first.

476
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,740
Liu Chang.

477
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,740
Go and bring all the charcoal and quilts in the house.

478
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,740
Yes.

479
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,740
Young Master.

480
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,740
Look at you and Ji.

481
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,740
You're all dressed up.

482
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,740
And our Ji is still Wei Chu Ge's wife.

483
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,740
Young Master, you're in such a hurry.

484
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,740
It's not appropriate, is it?

485
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,740
Yes.

486
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,740
I'm sorry.

487
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,740
You're worried about Ji.

488
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,740
We can understand.

489
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,740
Now you've seen Ji.

490
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,740
He's really fine.

491
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,740
He just caught a cold.

492
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,740
Young Master, please go back first.

493
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,740
Yes.

494
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,740
Young Master, you also saw that Ji is fine.

495
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,740
We will take good care of him.

496
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,740
Right?

497
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,740
If you have nothing to do,

498
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,740
you can...

499
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,740
You can...

500
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,740
I'm really sorry.

501
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,740
I offended you.

502
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,740
Please be patient.

503
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,740
If there is anything you need help with,

504
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,740
please tell us.

505
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,740
OK.

506
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,740
We'll tell you.

507
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,740
Open your mouth.

508
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,740
Or you can...

509
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,740
It's too embarrassing.

510
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,740
Dad.

511
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,740
I just found out

512
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,740
why you went back to the Cloud Water Garden at night.

513
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,740
It's not your fault.

514
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,740
When did you start to meddle in my business?

515
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,740
I can come back to the Cloud Water Garden

516
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,740
and leave whenever I want.

517
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,740
Who dares to stop me?

518
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,740
I've told you many times.

519
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,740
Only your mom can stop me.

520
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,740
Who dares to stop me?

521
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,740
Besides,

522
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,740
the person who should ask about this

523
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,740
is my business.

524
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,740
It's getting late.

525
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,740
Let Ji rest early.

526
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,740
Let's go out and talk.

527
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,740
Let's go.

528
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,740
Don't force me.

529
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,740
I know it in my heart.

530
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,740
OK.

531
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,740
You can talk here.

532
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,740
I'll take Yan Yan back to sleep.

533
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,740
I won't go back.

534
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,740
I'm not a child anymore.

535
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,740
I want to have a meeting with you.

536
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,740
Stop it, Jiayang.

537
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,740
The next topic is not about...

538
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,740
I know.

539
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,740
It's about Aunt Lin liking Aunt Lin.

540
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,740
Aunt Lin likes Aunt Lin.

541
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,740
Don't talk nonsense.

542
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,740
What are you doing?

543
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,740
It's OK to let the child talk.

544
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,740
I just saw our Su.

545
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,740
He is a little bit...

546
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,740
Otherwise, he can't talk like this.

547
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,740
According to history,

548
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,740
our aunt Lin's mind

549
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,740
should be on that god.

550
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,740
How can it be on Ji now?

551
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,740
It's a mess.

552
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,740
Girl,

553
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,740
did you say something

554
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,740
or do something

555
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,740
to make people misunderstand?

556
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,740
Shen Qianshe,

557
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,740
what are you talking about?

558
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,740
I...

559
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,740
Can you blame it on your daughter?

560
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,740
It must be your ancestors

561
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,740
who think too much.

562
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,740
You're talking nonsense.

563
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,740
I mean...

564
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,740
We can't blame it on Ji.

565
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,740
You saw it just now.

566
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,740
Ji kept telling Shao Yin

567
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,740
to go back.

568
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,740
I'm fine.

569
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,740
But Shao Yin insisted on seeing her.

570
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,740
It means Shao Yin

571
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,740
is not a good person.

572
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,740
Girl,

573
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,740
it has nothing to do with that.

574
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,740
What am I afraid of?

575
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,740
I'm afraid of changing history.

576
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,740
Once history changes,

577
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,740
our family will disappear.

578
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,740
Do you know that?

579
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,740
To solve the problem,

580
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,740
we need to find a reason.

581
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,740
We need to know why Shao Yin

582
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,740
likes you.

583
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,740
It's easy to find a reason.

584
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,740
Think about it.

585
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,740
Did you say something

586
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,740
or do something

587
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,740
to make people misunderstand?

588
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,740
It doesn't matter.

589
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,740
We can just explain it to her.

590
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,740
Everything will be back to normal.

591
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,740
Is it back to normal?

592
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,740
Is that what you mean?

593
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,740
It's about your daughter.

594
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,740
Our daughter is so good.

595
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,740
Does she need a reason?

596
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,740
I mean to solve the problem.

597
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,740
You're just raising the bar.

598
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,740
I'm telling you, Shen Jian She,

599
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,740
you blame your daughter

600
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,740
for all the problems.

601
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,740
You're wrong.

602
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,740
It's all your fault.

603
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,740
Don't worry.

604
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,740
My daughter?

605
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,740
Mom,

606
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,740
I grew up

607
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,740
in a modern science school.

608
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,740
Actually, last time I went to Xing Jiang An,

609
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,740
I realized that I was not a good person.

610
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,740
But,

611
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,740
I've purified my mind in the Buddhist hall.

612
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,740
I was just a little emotional.

613
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,740
Now I'm fine.

614
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,740
Ji,

615
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,740
you...

616
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,740
I'm fine.

617
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,740
As for my ancestors,

618
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,740
they were just normal men.

619
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,740
They didn't have many girls.

620
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,740
They might be curious about me.

621
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,740
But,

622
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,740
I heard that my wife appeared.

623
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,740
She's so good.

624
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,740
My ancestors can't be

625
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,740
surprised by my talent.

626
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,740
You're right.

627
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,740
You're right.

628
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,740
My wife is more suitable

629
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,740
for the girl of this dynasty.

630
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,740
She looks good.

631
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,740
Right?

632
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,740
I think so, too.

633
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,740
Then everything will be back to normal.

634
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,740
No.

635
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,740
Tomorrow morning,

636
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,740
we'll go to the new house

637
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,740
and move out of this Yunshui Garden as soon as possible.

638
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,740
We'll be isolated from this ancestor physically.

639
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,740
This matter is urgent.

640
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,740
We have to do it right away.

641
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,740
You do it.

642
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,740
You do it.

643
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,740
Me?

644
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,740
Your mom and I have to open a small restaurant.

645
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,740
We don't have time.

646
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,740
I'll give you the chance.

647
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,740
Are you sure?

648
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,740
I...

649
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,740
Gongcai,

650
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,740
be careful.

651
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,740
Mom.

652
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,740
Mom.

653
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,740
I've grown up.

654
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,740
This is the first time

655
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,740
you've given your family power to me.

656
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,740
You finally found out

657
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,740
that I have the ability.

658
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,740
Don't worry.

659
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,740
I'll find a house

660
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,740
that will satisfy everyone.

661
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,740
Why don't I do it?

662
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,740
Why don't you just lift it up?

663
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,740
Grandma is just like you.

664
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,740
I don't believe it.

665
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,740
Don't worry.

666
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,740
I'll do it now.

667
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,740
Wait for good news.

668
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,740
The fifth house in Chang'an.

669
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,740
The servant, Mrs. Du.

670
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,740
The fifth house?

671
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,740
Is this Mrs. Du?

672
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,740
Is this Mrs. Du?

673
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,740
Xiao Mei.

674
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,740
Go.

675
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,740
Hurry up.

676
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,740
Go.

677
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,740
Fresh vegetables.

678
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,740
Go.

679
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,740
Go.

680
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,740
Okay.

681
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,740
I've told you many times.

682
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,740
I want to drink soy milk with eggs.

683
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,740
I want to drink it with eggs.

684
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,740
Why do you always give me sugar?

685
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,740
I'm sorry, my dear.

686
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,740
I'll be careful next time.

687
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,740
I'll be careful next time.

688
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,740
Left.

689
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,740
And this bun.

690
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,740
We've been married for three years.

691
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,740
You'll never remember

692
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,740
that I don't eat meat buns.

693
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,740
I'm sorry, my dear.

694
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,740
I'm sorry.

695
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,740
I'll change it next time.

696
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,740
Miss Shan.

697
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,740
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

698
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,740
I have to tell you today.

699
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,740
Let's get a divorce.

700
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,740
Xiaoyang can be your daughter.

701
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,740
I'm sorry, my dear.

702
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,740
I was wrong.

703
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,740
I'll change it next time.

704
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,740
You're not kidding me, are you?

705
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,740
You're too cruel, my dear.

706
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,740
Who did you learn this from?

707
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,740
I'm scared.

708
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,740
I don't even look at the tower when I enter the game.

709
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,740
Are you serious?

710
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,740
Are you angry?

711
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,740
I didn't buy you breakfast, did I?

712
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,740
I remember.

713
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,740
You wanted to drink sweet.

714
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,740
No, you wanted to drink salty.

715
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,740
You wanted to drink egg.

716
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,740
You wanted to eat that bun.

717
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,740
I'll buy you another one.

718
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,740
I'll buy you another one.

719
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,740
No need.

720
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,740
Miss.

721
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,740
I'll tell you the truth.

722
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,740
I fell in love with someone else.

723
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,740
Let's stop here.

724
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,740
Xiaomei.

725
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,740
I support you.

726
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,740
When did you...

727
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,740
I'm sorry.

728
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,740
When did you come?

729
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,740
How long have you been here?

730
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,740
How are you doing?

731
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,740
Why didn't you tell me?

732
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,740
Why didn't you come to me?

733
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,740
Get up.

734
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,740
This man.

735
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,740
You're here with me.

736
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,740
I'm going to report it.

737
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,740
Me?

738
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,740
It's me.

739
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,740
Look.

740
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,740
You don't recognize me.

741
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,740
You...

742
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,740
You're not Xiaomei?

743
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,740
You've got the wrong person.

744
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,740
I'm not Xiaomei.

745
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,740
And I don't know what Xiaomei is.

746
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,740
How is that possible?

747
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,740
No.

748
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,740
This man.

749
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,740
What are you doing?

750
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,740
You...

751
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,740
You...

752
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,740
Let's talk about it.

753
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,740
Let's talk about it.

754
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,740
Impossible.

755
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,740
They look exactly the same.

756
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,740
Did you pretend not to know me?

757
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,740
Xiaomei.

758
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,740
I've let you go.

759
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,740
And now I'm totally different from before.

760
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,740
Believe me.

761
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,740
No.

762
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,740
I just think we're all in this strange environment.

763
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,740
We can take care of each other.

764
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,740
I think sometimes I let go of him.

765
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,740
Jinghao.

766
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,740
You're a bastard.

767
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,740
Where did you come from?

768
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,740
It's really not him.

769
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,740
Lady.

770
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,740
Lady.

771
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,740
Wait a minute.

772
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,740
That...

773
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,740
Lady.

774
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,740
I'm really sorry.

775
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,740
I just got the wrong person.

776
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,740
I'm the son-in-law of the Shen family.

777
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,740
The wife of the Lu family, Mrs. Pang.

778
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,740
She introduced me to rent a house.

779
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,740
The son-in-law of the Shen family?

780
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,740
Impossible.

781
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,740
Mrs. Pang told me that.

782
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,740
The son-in-law of the Shen family.

783
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,740
He's a good looking guy.

784
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,740
He's a good match.

785
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,740
Well...

786
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,740
I...

787
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,740
I am indeed the son-in-law of the Shen family.

788
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,740
How could I know that the wife's surname is Du?

789
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,740
She's a mute.

790
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,740
She's helping the fifth house in Chang'an.

791
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,740
Renting a house.

792
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,740
Right?

793
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,740
I just saw her.

794
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,740
She really looks like an old lady.

795
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,740
I'm sorry.

796
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,740
I shouldn't have blamed you.

797
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,740
No, no, no.

798
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,740
I shouldn't have.

799
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,740
I was just being rude.

800
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,740
How could I blame you?

801
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,740
Oh, right.

802
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,740
Mr. Tian just said that your old friend's name is Xiao Mei.

803
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,740
I think it's important to you.

804
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,740
That's why you're so excited.

805
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,740
Yes.

806
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,740
Xiao Mei...

807
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,740
is my ex-wife.

808
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,740
I'm sorry.

809
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,740
I shouldn't have.

810
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,740
I'm sorry.

811
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,740
She's my ex-wife.

812
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,740
The wife and she...

813
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,740
are indeed very similar.

814
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,740
You can't forget your old friend for a long time.

815
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,740
You're so loyal.

816
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,740
No.

817
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,740
I've let go of my feelings.

818
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,740
It's just that...

819
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,740
I didn't let her have a good life.

820
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,740
Every time I think about it,

821
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,740
I feel a little guilty.

822
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,740
You're moving out?

823
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,740
It's a bit sudden.

824
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,740
But we've found a house.

825
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,740
We've been bothering you for a while.

826
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,740
Is it because you're worried about King Zhao?

827
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,740
I'll be honest.

828
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,740
Since we've decided to help you with the case,

829
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,740
we're not afraid that the relationship between you and King Zhao...

830
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,740
will bring us trouble.

831
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,740
We won't regret it.

832
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,740
But we really have to move out.

833
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,740
If we stay like this,

834
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,740
the neighbors will definitely gossip.

835
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,740
And if you and Shaoguang...

836
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,740
really spread any rumors,

837
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,740
it's bad for everyone.

838
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,740
Rumors?

839
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,740
Rumors are...

840
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,740
rumors that you're just...

841
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,740
gossiping about each other.

842
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,740
But I don't care.

843
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,740
But we can't not care.

844
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,740
Young Master, to be honest,

845
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,740
you and Shaoguang...

846
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,740
are really not suitable for each other.

847
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,740
We've made up our minds.

848
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,740
We hope you can respect our decision.

849
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,740
I'm sorry.

850
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,740
My dear, why are you alone today?

851
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,740
Shen Liang and the others didn't come?

852
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,740
They moved out.

853
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,740
Moved out?

854
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,740
Yang Zi! Yang Zi!

855
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,740
Young Master Lin is here.

856
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,740
Help me send him away.

857
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,740
Oh.

858
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,740
Young Master.

859
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,740
Young Master.

860
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,740
You're avoiding me.

861
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,740
It's useless to escape.

862
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,740
I'm useless and shameless.

863
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,740
The more I drag things, the more dirty it gets.

864
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,740
I have to correct my ancestors' misjudgment.

865
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,740
It's best to make him feel that I have a big disease.

866
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,740
Oh, my respected Young Master Lin.

867
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,740
Good luck.

868
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,740
Oh, my God.

869
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,740
How can I avoid you?

870
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,740
You should be busy.

871
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,740
Why are you here?

872
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,740
What's the matter?

873
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,740
You...

874
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,740
have a cold.

875
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,740
Oh.

876
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,740
Don't worry.

877
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,740
I'm completely fine now.

878
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,740
I'm healthy now.

879
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,740
I'm like an old bull.

880
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,740
Oh, Young Master.

881
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,740
You don't have to care about me.

882
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,740
You're avoiding me.

883
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,740
Oh, my respected Young Master Lin.

884
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,740
Of course not.

885
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,740
It's just that there's an old saying.

886
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,740
The king and the minister are different.

887
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,740
We're not the king and the minister.

888
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,740
Oh, my respected old man.

889
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,740
I'm wrong.

890
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,740
We're...

891
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,740
young and handsome.

892
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,740
But we're the same age.

893
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,740
Oh, my God.

894
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,740
You really forgot about

895
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,740
the man and the woman.

896
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,740
I never paid attention to

897
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,740
the man and the woman.

898
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,740
You're a stubborn man.

899
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,740
Anyway,

900
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,740
I'd better keep a distance

901
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,740
from Young Master Lin.

902
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,740
Uncle and aunt

903
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,740
came to me.

904
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,740
They wanted to move.

905
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,740
They're afraid someone will talk about us.

906
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,740
When you first moved in,

907
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,740
you didn't think about it.

908
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,740
I didn't care.

909
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,740
Why did you change so suddenly?

910
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,740
You really want to avoid me?

911
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,740
Shen Shuiguang,

912
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,740
I want the answer.

913
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,740
Yes.

914
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,740
I really want to avoid you.

915
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,740
What's wrong?

916
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,740
What's the reason?

917
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,740
I'm just annoying you.

918
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,740
I'm sorry.

919
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,740
The past is past.

920
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,740
It's the fault of Yan.

921
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,740
I'm sorry.

922
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,740
I'll do it

923
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:06,740
I will keep my distance from you as you wish.

924
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:37,740
I will keep my distance from you as you wish.

925
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:06,740
I will keep my distance from you as you wish.

926
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:36,740
I will keep my distance from you as you wish.

927
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:06,740
I will keep my distance from you as you wish.

928
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:36,740
I will keep my distance from you as you wish.

929
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:06,740
I will keep my distance from you as you wish.

930
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:36,740
I will keep my distance from you as you wish.
