2
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,940
=Episode 9=

3
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,640
Mr. Shen, we're leaving.

4
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,890
Sure. Thanks for the hard work.

5
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,950
Dad.

6
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,890
If you ask me,

7
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,220
to make a tablecloth,

8
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,480
pick this one.

9
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,810
Look how pretty it is.

10
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,860
If we use this...

11
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,870
What?

12
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,840
What do you even know?

13
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,940
Have you got any taste?

14
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,590
Listen, small pieces

15
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,000
are just rags.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,170
Big pieces are perfect for your undies.

17
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,330
Son, look at this one.

18
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,530
Low-key, luxe, and sophisticated.

19
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,590
Got it? Good.

20
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,380
Dad, how can you like this?

21
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
This cloth, seriously?

22
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,000
- What's wrong?
- Tell me.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,490
It looks exactly

24
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,520
like that foot-wipe towel

25
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,840
you used in the modern days.

26
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,850
You know nothing.

27
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,900
- This is...
- Father.

28
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,740
- Jicai.
- Jicai.

29
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,400
Who is this?

30
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,810
Why is she so badly hurt?

31
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,960
I'll explain later.

32
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,730
Grab a string of coins
for her travel fare.

33
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,880
- Why?
- Just do it.

34
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,360
- Milady.
- Jicai.

35
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,690
Are you sending me away?

36
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,190
- I...
- Why?

37
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,590
I'm not sending you away;

38
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,560
we simply can't keep you.

39
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,870
Please let me stay.

40
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,780
I work fast.

41
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,060
I'm better than those bus boys.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,910
Well...

43
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,850
What's going on?

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,240
- No idea.
- Who is she?

45
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,780
No clue; she brought her back.

46
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,410
Jicai.

47
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,010
Who's the little girl?

48
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,730
She's quick with chores.

49
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,590
I saw her

50
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,710
at Yunlai Tavern.

51
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,870
Manager Feng was beating her,

52
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,960
so the Vice Prefect and I

53
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,210
figured out a way to free her.

54
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,940
Deyuan, give it to me.

55
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,800
You've had your Slave Deed.

56
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,290
You're free now.

57
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,790
You want to go back to Shu, right?

58
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,430
Take this money

59
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,630
and leave today.

60
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,610
If you stay any longer,

61
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,110
Feng Li might come after you.

62
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,500
But I have no family left.

63
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,100
If I go back,

64
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,690
I've got nowhere to live.

65
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,400
Please let me stay.

66
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
I'll work for you.

67
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
I don't need wages.

68
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,030
Food is enough for me.

69
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,560
Mom, she doesn't want money.

70
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,280
- Let me stay.
- Deyuan...

71
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,400
I really don't want wages.

72
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,910
- I don't need money.
- You...

73
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,970
Food is all I need.

74
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,360
- I...
- Let me stay.

75
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,360
Jicai.

76
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,970
Jicai, come out.

77
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,960
Jicai,

78
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,900
let's go.

79
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,060
You first.

80
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,120
Jicai,

81
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,280
I think

82
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,180
it's just one more mouth to feed.

83
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,180
Let the girl stay.

84
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,750
She's all alone

85
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,780
and wounded.

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,310
Where would she go

87
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,390
if we threw her out now?

88
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,730
Your mom's right.

89
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,510
Good workers like her

90
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,950
are rare these days.

91
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,510
When the diner opens,

92
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,070
we'll need extra hands.

93
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,120
You saved her;

94
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,510
having her in the diner means

95
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,270
- we can trust her.
- Yes.

96
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,210
Dad, Mom.

97
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,770
While we were street-vending,

98
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,170
we already clashed with Yunlai.

99
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,660
If we keep her,

100
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,360
we'll offend them even more,

101
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,920
and the fallout could get ugly.

102
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,120
Jicai, the moment you rescued her,

103
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,630
you crossed Yunlai.

104
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,740
Sending her away now

105
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,870
won't make Yunlai back off

106
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,070
or stop picking fights.

107
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,930
I know I've brought trouble.

108
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,600
This was never my business;

109
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,540
I should've

110
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,620
just walked away.

111
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,540
We're not blaming you.

112
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,540
Your dad puts it bluntly,

113
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,500
but what he means is

114
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,540
that now that we've chosen

115
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,780
to settle and do business here,

116
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,820
trouble will find us anyway.

117
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,660
Yong'an isn't lawless territory;

118
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,620
Yunlai can't just harm us in the dark.

119
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,500
Exactly.

120
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,180
Jicai, I'll call the shots.

121
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,420
Let's keep the girl.

122
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,980
But if we keep her,

123
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,260
the trouble only grows.

124
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,540
This isn't like you.

125
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,900
When we first landed here,

126
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,960
you were the most positive

127
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,100
of us all.

128
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,100
Hit a snag

129
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,460
and you'd invent a fix on the spot.

130
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,500
Yunlai hasn't even done anything now,

131
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,180
and you're the one

132
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,420
retreating first?

133
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,420
Yeah, Jicai.

134
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,300
Why the sudden retreat?

135
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,260
I just don't want to care anymore.

136
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,260
She's ancient history to us.

137
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,500
A ghost already.

138
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,900
Her fate was sealed centuries ago.

139
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,300
Whatever we do is pointless.

140
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,700
It's not like that.

141
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,180
Jicai,

142
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,100
the Vice Prefect came by

143
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,260
after finishing with Yunlai.

144
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,140
Where's Deyuan?

145
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,860
You mean the girl you brought back?

146
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,540
She was standing right there.

147
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,780
She heard you all talking,

148
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,980
said she was grateful,

149
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,180
and then walked off.

150
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,980
She just left?

151
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,460
Why didn't you stop her?

152
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,140
I tried,

153
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,180
but I failed.

154
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,300
Besides, she's a young girl,

155
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,780
and I'm a divorced single man.

156
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,780
If I wrestle her back,

157
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,160
- Come on.
- how would that look?

158
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,340
People will gossip.

159
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,700
Jicai, you've still got to decide.

160
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,580
Maybe it's better she left.

161
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,300
Didn't I tell you

162
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,740
not to let her go?

163
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,900
This girl...

164
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,060
Why is she like this?

165
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,940
Vice Prefect, forgive us.

166
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,360
Jicai's heart is golden.

167
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,500
She's never been like this.

168
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,140
She's just off today.

169
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,680
Normally, she never turns anyone away,

170
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,240
right?

171
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,740
Let me talk to her.

172
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,140
When you tried to help that girl,

173
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,420
you clenched the stone too hard, right?

174
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,620
It's nothing.

175
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,180
Reach out.

176
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,060
Do you think

177
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,220
I'm cold?

178
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,700
Cold enough

179
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,580
to grip a stone to save a stranger

180
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,580
and cut your own hand.

181
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,980
Does it still hurt?

182
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,100
I feel

183
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,660
I can't even steer my own life.

184
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,700
How can I shoulder someone else's?

185
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,980
We don't belong in this era;

186
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,500
we shouldn't meddle.

187
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Whatever I do won't matter,

188
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,580
yet I...

189
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,340
Yunshui Manor is roomy;

190
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,180
a dozen more could lodge inside.

191
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,540
If anyone storms our gate,

192
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,900
my roof tiles

193
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,700
can shelter you all.

194
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,460
It's about to rain.

195
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,300
If she's caught in it,

196
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,220
she'll catch a fever.

197
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,820
I have to bring her back.

198
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,340
Deyuan!

199
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,860
Deyuan!

200
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,260
Deyuan!

201
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,320
Deyuan!

202
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,740
Deyuan!

203
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,980
Deyuan!

204
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,060
Curfew's near.

205
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,300
Where could she go?

206
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,140
Don't panic; she's injured.

207
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,140
She can't have gone far.

208
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,140
- Deyuan!
- Deyuan!

209
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,700
Deyuan!

210
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,330
- Deyuan!
- Deyuan!

211
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,340
I'm sorry.

212
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,740
I'm so sorry.

213
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,780
It's fine now.

214
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,260
Come, come.

215
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,140
Let Jicai take a look.

216
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,660
Wounds have been dressed.

217
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,220
I found some fresh clothes for her.

218
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,260
You're so pretty.

219
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,900
Pretty, right?

220
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,300
Look at her.

221
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,020
I'll leave you two to talk.

222
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,100
Milady, what are you doing?

223
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,340
It smells amazing.

224
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,740
Let me help.

225
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,580
You're called Deyuan,

226
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,940
so I made fish balls.

227
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,600
We'll be one full circle
after eating it.

228
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,580
From today, you're also my family.

229
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,700
Milady,

230
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,340
I'll sell myself to you.

231
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,580
I'll follow you forever.

232
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,900
(Slave Deed; Zhen Deyuan)

233
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,860
Once our diner opens,

234
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,700
you'll earn honest wages with skill.

235
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,140
No deeds are needed.

236
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,100
But...

237
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,860
But if I work here

238
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,740
without a deed,

239
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,100
how can you trust me?

240
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,980
We'll sign a labor contract,

241
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,340
a work agreement.

242
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,220
You'll be hired

243
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,340
and paid by the hour.

244
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,820
I...

245
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,980
I don't quite follow

246
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,340
the words you're saying,

247
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,300
yet somehow I understand

248
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,460
you're being kind to me.

249
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,540
You're too kind.

250
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,500
You're too kind to me.

251
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,820
Why the tears?

252
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,660
You're helping us;
we should be thanking you.

253
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,100
Why thank me at all?

254
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,620
There, there, Deyuan, no more crying.

255
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,060
There, there.

256
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,340
Auntie looks brighter already.

257
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,420
My girl is

258
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,620
the toughest one I know.

259
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,740
I knew she'd come round.

260
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,700
Now that Jicai's mood

261
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,460
is fixed,

262
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,300
everything slips back on track.

263
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,920
Our diner

264
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,980
still has to take its cue

265
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,660
from Jicai in the end.

266
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,180
If I ask her to draft
the blueprints tomorrow,

267
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,420
will she even answer me?

268
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,620
Why are you always so clueless?

269
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,740
Alright, the dishes are ready.

270
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,700
Have a seat.

271
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,060
- Sit, Deyuan.
- Deyuan, sit.

272
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,020
From this day on,

273
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,820
Deyuan is family.

274
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,060
- Great.
- Great.

275
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,020
Welcome!

276
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,060
Perfect!

277
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,260
Deyuan can play with me.

278
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,820
But

279
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,340
what if

280
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,310
Yunlai Tavern

281
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,100
comes looking for trouble?

282
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,900
Don't worry.

283
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,900
I'll handle it.

284
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,340
Thank you, Vice Prefect.

285
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,420
Really?

286
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,380
Since Jicai and the Vice Prefect
have said so,

287
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,500
I hereby declare:

288
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,180
Deyuan is officially

289
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,700
one of us.

290
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,780
Let's eat!

291
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,940
- Dig in.
- Let's eat.

292
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,500
Pick up your chopsticks.

293
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,460
Dig in.

294
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,660
Here, Yangyang.

295
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,460
Here, Deyuan.

296
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,010
- I'll ladle you soup.
- This is tasty.

297
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,160
- Try this.
- Thanks.

298
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,700
Try this; it's tasty.

299
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,700
Careful, it's hot.

300
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,820
Thank you, Auntie.

301
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,300
Here, Deyuan.

302
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,500
Thanks, Yangyang.

303
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,020
Deyuan.

304
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,380
Vice Prefect, taste this.

305
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,180
It's good.

306
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,940
Milady,

307
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,620
I'm still craving something else.

308
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,300
Paupers' Joy?

309
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,580
What's Paupers' Joy?

310
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,620
Lard Rice

311
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,620
with a splash of soy.

312
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,860
What's soy?

313
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:58,900
Lard can go

314
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,180
on rice?

315
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,220
It's just clear sauce

316
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,180
mixed into rice.

317
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,460
It's quick and tasty.

318
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,980
A man of your stature

319
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,380
has surely never gone hungry.

320
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,940
It's to fill one's stomach.

321
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,420
No surprise you've never heard of it.

322
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,780
I've actually starved before,

323
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,900
slept in the streets,

324
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,860
too ashamed

325
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,380
to beg.

326
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,980
But

327
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,900
how could someone

328
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,660
as noble as you experience that?

329
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,500
You must be joking.

330
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,340
Indeed.

331
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,420
Only jesting.

332
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,100
Ever since I met Deyuan,

333
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,500
an idea has been simmering.

334
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,060
Yunlai and Guixiang

335
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,700
both cater to silk-clad guests.

336
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,580
Since we're opening in Yong'an,

337
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,980
why not serve the cotton-clad?

338
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,380
The cotton-clad?

339
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,100
What do you mean?

340
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,780
- Well...
- You're saying

341
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,180
you'll cook food that ordinary folk

342
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,700
can actually afford?

343
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,820
Yunlai and Guixiang

344
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,220
serve the wealthy,

345
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,380
but Yong'an is full of common people.

346
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,460
If we offer more tasty and cheap dishes

347
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,220
like Paupers' Joy,

348
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,460
our diner

349
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,940
will be worth far more.

350
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,340
I like Jicai's idea.

351
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,100
Good, inexpensive food

352
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,060
is a real service to the people.

353
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,620
You keep coining

354
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,300
fresh words.

355
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,180
The phrase Auntie just said

356
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,860
is fascinating.

357
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,980
Service to the people.

358
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,500
Whether in commerce

359
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,700
or governance,

360
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,380
we should aim to serve.

361
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,980
Vice Prefect,

362
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,860
you don't really know me.

363
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,940
When it comes to new words,

364
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,900
I can actually

365
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,100
say some, too.

366
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,420
I just don't flaunt it.

367
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,780
Right?

368
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,940
Still, I think

369
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,980
- we have
- Eat up.

370
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,580
to change the name.

371
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,820
You can't keep calling it Paupers' Joy.

372
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,060
Joy sounds fine,

373
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,460
but if we keep calling out paupers,

374
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,420
who'd buy that?

375
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,340
Would you?

376
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,300
Right?

377
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,060
Let's rename it

378
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,020
Everyman's Joy.

379
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,680
(Yunlai Tavern)
How dare Shen

380
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,980
take Chunyan away from me?

381
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,980
This is outrageous!

382
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,660
By the way,

383
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,380
did you find out

384
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,700
what kind of relationship she has

385
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,300
with the Vice Prefect?

386
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,820
I did.

387
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,440
I asked a relative to inquire

388
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,720
of a guard in the Capital Prefecture.

389
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,100
They said they're distant relatives.

390
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,820
Lady Shen is his cousin.

391
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,220
Cousin?

392
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,540
No wonder so domineering.

393
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,660
I thought Lin Yan was so upright,

394
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,420
but he's just another corrupt official.

395
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,180
Just you wait.

396
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,180
How clueless.

397
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,790
Tidy this up.

398
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,740
We're family.

399
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,100
Why the formalities?

400
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,700
Sorry, Vice Prefect.

401
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,100
We were enjoying the meal so much

402
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,300
that we lost track of time.

403
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,700
Now that curfew's in effect,

404
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,140
you can't return to Yunshui Manor.

405
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,540
You have to stay here for the night.

406
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,500
It's fine.

407
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,900
This is actually quite interesting.

408
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,060
Lady Shen,

409
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,380
could we talk in private?

410
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,860
No problem.

411
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,980
They'll talk in private?

412
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,780
Your family is opening a diner.

413
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,380
Do you have

414
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,100
any other plans for the future?

415
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,940
We want to expand our business

416
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,100
and strive for glory.

417
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,260
I mean

418
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,380
for yourself.

419
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,180
Me?

420
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,300
To be honest,

421
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,980
our family can't leave Yong'an

422
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,500
for the time being.

423
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,220
I used to feel a bit aimless,

424
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,380
but now I've found

425
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,740
some sense of belonging.

426
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,860
I have things I want to do,

427
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,260
like selling affordable meals.

428
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,820
How could Yong'an do

429
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,620
without a business genius like me?

430
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,500
Besides business?

431
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,300
Help my father win

432
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,980
the competition next spring.

433
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,460
Besides helping your father

434
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,020
win the competition,

435
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,300
have you

436
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,940
thought

437
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,220
about your future?

438
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,060
My future?

439
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,620
I can't think that far ahead.

440
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,740
What I mean

441
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,820
is

442
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,580
your marriage.

443
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,940
Your

444
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,900
marriage.

445
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,820
Vice Prefect, are you trying

446
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,340
to break off the engagement?

447
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,780
I'm right?

448
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,660
That's amazing.

449
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,800
You have no idea how long
I've been waiting for this.

450
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,300
You were hesitating.

451
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,820
Were you afraid I'd say no?

452
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,860
You really don't need to.

453
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,260
You should've said so earlier!

454
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,220
Come on.

455
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,140
I wake up every morning

456
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,670
planning for this exact moment.

457
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,620
I'm so glad you feel the same way.

458
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,620
That's great.

459
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,780
Wait here a moment.

460
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,940
What?

461
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,300
Why?

462
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,140
She plans for this every day?

463
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,660
(Letter of Engagement Dissolution)

464
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,100
Everyone, please rise.

465
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,700
Today, Shen Shaoguang dissolves
her engagement with Lin Yan,

466
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,340
formerly known as Cui Che.

467
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,540
This engagement is hereby invalid.

468
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,940
The Shen family

469
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,900
solemnly

470
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,820
repents

471
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,340
for ever bringing up this engagement.

472
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,400
From this day on,

473
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,980
we shall completely erase
all related memories.

474
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,860
Never again shall it be mentioned.

475
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,380
Should anyone bring it up again,

476
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,700
it shall be considered

477
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,580
a violation of human ethics,

478
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,340
a moral collapse,

479
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,620
and will be condemned
by all future generations

480
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,180
of the Shen family.

481
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,220
Vice Prefect,

482
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,380
it was our fault from the start.

483
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,700
How could we ever be engaged
to someone like you?

484
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,020
Yes, yes, Vice Prefect.

485
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,780
This is entirely our fault.

486
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,620
We should've ended

487
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,700
this engagement long ago.

488
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,840
- Sorry.
- Vice Prefect,

489
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,020
it's completely our fault.

490
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,820
We hope you can forgive us
in the afterlife.

491
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,340
Father, what are you saying?

492
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,380
We mean

493
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,340
we were wrong.

494
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,060
Let's just forget this engagement

495
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,260
ever happened.

496
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,660
Completely.

497
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,780
(Am I really so awful)

498
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,260
(that they'd go to such lengths
to avoid me?)

499
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,700
Vice Prefect?

500
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,980
I didn't mean anything else.

501
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,940
I...

502
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,580
Do you need to use the privy?

503
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,140
The toilet is in the back.

504
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,380
No, that's not it.

505
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,540
Then what do you need?

506
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,060
I just wanted to say

507
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,060
there's a cat in the backyard.

508
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,940
A cat?

509
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,400
- Calico?
- It's a Yumian cat.

510
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,500
You call it a Yumian cat?

511
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,620
You call it

512
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,580
Calico?

513
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,620
Kitty,

514
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,580
I got you.

515
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,740
You like cats?

516
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,740
I wanted one when I was a child,

517
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,020
but Father and Mother

518
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,100
already struggled

519
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,540
raising me and Gongcai.

520
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,260
With the diner to run,

521
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,980
another cat felt impossible.

522
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,650
Kitty,

523
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,900
are you just passing by

524
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,580
or planning to stay?

525
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,580
If you want the answer,

526
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,260
perform the cat-betrothal rite.

527
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,340
Betrothal?

528
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,780
I've drafted the deed.

529
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,260
If it eats the gift you set out,

530
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,740
it agrees to be your cat.

531
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,500
(Cat-adoption Contract)

532
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,780
Looks like it has zero objections.

533
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,220
Rites must be observed.

534
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,420
Our cat shall have

535
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,540
what other cats get.

536
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,620
Calico,

537
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,620
you walked

538
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,460
into our diner yourself,

539
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,100
so you can't escape now.

540
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,500
You can just live at home,

541
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
with no duties at all.

542
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,780
I will love you dearly.

543
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,180
Henceforth,

544
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,180
you need not roam,

545
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,460
need not catch mice,

546
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,820
and need not keep night-watch.

547
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,700
This contract bears witness

548
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,140
under heaven and earth.

549
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:22,420
(Cat-adoption Contract)

550
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,580
It licked me.

551
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,780
Did you see that?

552
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,020
I'm just so happy.

553
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,780
You...

554
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,940
You haven't named it yet.

555
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,940
Right.

556
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,740
Names.

557
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,860
What to name it?

558
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,180
I'm terrible at names.

559
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,180
Vice Prefect, you do it.

560
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,980
It's your kitten.

561
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,620
Why push the task on me?

562
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,180
We adopted it together.

563
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,660
How is it suddenly mine alone?

564
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,940
Fine, I'll choose.

565
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,580
I'll choose...

566
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,580
Let's call it Ming.

567
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,060
Ming.

568
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:37,820
Ming?

569
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,700
The plainer the name,

570
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,980
the luckier the cat.

571
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,020
The Xiao Erya says

572
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,700
Yan means Ming (bright).

573
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,300
That collides with your name.

574
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,340
I'll pick another.

575
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,380
Another...

576
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,620
I'm not good at naming things.

577
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,860
Ming it is.

578
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,780
It's good.

579
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,500
Ming.

580
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,140
Ming, Ming, Ming.

581
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,900
Ming.

582
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,780
Ming.

583
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,340
Ming, Ming.

584
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,900
Ming.

(Capital Prefecture Notice)
Yunlai Tavern in Juxian Alley

586
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,620
expanded illicitly

587
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,180
and encroached on the rear alley

588
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,060
and public passage.

589
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,580
It's to be demolished per statute.

590
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,060
In the 4th month,

591
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,980
a bookshop in Juxian Alley caught fire;

592
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,220
Yunlai Tavern failed
to report or assist.

593
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,660
The punishments shall be combined.

594
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,620
Excellent.

595
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,740
Excellent!

596
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,740
Let's see

597
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,980
if Yunlai Tavern dares again.

598
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,580
The new Vice Prefect

599
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,660
is here to do his job.

600
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,580
As the saying goes,

601
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,780
what goes around comes around.

602
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,860
- Yes.
- Right.

603
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,060
Folks, the Vice Prefect did splendidly.

604
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,140
As the saying goes,

605
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,500
justice lives in every heart.

606
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,060
What are you doing?

607
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,740
Why is it always you?

608
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,340
Sorry.

609
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,180
I didn't notice.

610
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,240
I didn't notice.

611
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,580
These punishments are nothing.

612
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,220
Money can solve everything.

613
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,340
Yunlai could even buy

614
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,460
your whole family's lives.

615
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,620
What did you say?

616
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,660
I heard you've leased a place.

617
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,820
You aren't planning to open a diner

618
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,580
in Juxian Alley, are you?

619
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,260
Manager Feng,

620
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,300
that laugh

621
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,260
is like the sort

622
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,060
that clueless villains

623
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,100
on stage wear.

624
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,060
What did you just say?

625
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,340
Clueless indeed.

626
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,580
You can't even follow me.

627
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,900
You just asked

628
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,020
if we're opening a diner here.

629
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,420
Are you trying to set us up?

630
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,380
I...

631
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,640
Yunlai Tavern won't let it go so easily.

632
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,980
That's right.

633
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,340
Everyone, please bear witness:

634
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,460
If our diner

635
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,100
ever faces dirty tricks,

636
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,840
first suspect Yunlai.

637
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,680
- Yes.
- You...

638
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,860
Fair point.

639
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,220
It's him. Remember this face.

640
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,260
Shen Shaoguang!

641
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,620
Fine.

642
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,820
Just you wait.

643
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,580
If your diner ever lasts,

644
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,260
I'll write my surname upside-down!

645
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,060
Just wait and see.

646
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,300
I'll surely

647
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,820
make our diner thrive.

648
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,860
Thrive!

649
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,020
- Just wait.
- Just wait.

650
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,660
- You wait.
- You all wait!

651
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,580
What a fuming monkey.

652
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,780
Fuming monkey, fuming monkey.

653
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,660
Move aside, move.

654
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,820
Enough already.

655
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,130
Hurry off!

656
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,220
Well said, Jicai.

Shen?

662
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,900
Just the character Shen?

663
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,980
Yes, only one character.

664
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,490
The Vice Prefect's handwriting.

665
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,060
Who else in Juxian Alley

666
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,940
can have that?

667
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,140
Who else?

668
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,220
A single Shen from you

669
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,740
is enough honor for us.

670
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,580
The thing is, it's free,

671
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,940
isn't it?

672
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,620
Watch your tongue.

673
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,320
That's the Vice Prefect
you're talking to!

674
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,140
He's got no manners.

675
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,500
Here's the thing.

676
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,780
It was Jicai's idea.

677
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,980
She'd like you
to write the character Shen

678
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,020
so we can enshrine it...

679
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,260
No, we can

680
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,420
print it

681
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,140
on our work-shirts.

682
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,460
That's all.

683
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,060

Yangyang, hurry.

687
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,020
I made this lollipop myself.

688
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,700
Sorry to trouble you.

689
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,380

690
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,140
It tastes great.
