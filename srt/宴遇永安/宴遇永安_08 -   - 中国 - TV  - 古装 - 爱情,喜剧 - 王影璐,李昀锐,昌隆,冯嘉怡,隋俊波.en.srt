00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,940
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,710
You can't swim.

4
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,860
What were you thinking, jumping in?

5
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,250
Before acting heroically,

6
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,350
could you people here

7
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,230
at least consider

8
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,310
your own safety?

9
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,410
I jumped in to save you!

10
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,070
You mustn't give up on life.

11
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,010
Understand?

12
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,300
Save me?

13
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,860
You thought I was trying to die?

14
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,150
No.

15
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,340
I just slipped.

16
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,660
No wonder.

17
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,970
I was wondering
how you swam back so easily.

18
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,060
Then I lost big time.

19
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,210
I risked my life

20
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,690
for nothing.

21
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,470
Lady, what were you thinking?

22
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,570
You can't swim, yet you jumped in.

23
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,470
So what?

24
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,400
Besides,

25
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,280
there was

26
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,660
nobody else around.

27
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,190
If you were suicidal

28
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,340
and I didn't act,

29
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,970
you'd really be gone.

30
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,130
Right?

31
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,530
Next time, prioritize your own safety

32
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,100
when saving others.

33
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,310
Relax.

34
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,480
My mother had my fortune told.

35
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,400
I'm blessed with nine lives.

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,280
See? Even when I rescue someone,

37
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,410
it's a swimmer like you.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,470
Who saved whom here?

39
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,940
Obviously, I saved you.

40
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,780
Next time, you rescue me.

41
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,180
Where's the fish?

42
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,340
Little guy,

43
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,180
let's go home.

44
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,060
Go home.

45
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,470
Well...

46
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,400
Lady,

47
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,970
our tavern is nearby.

48
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,120
Come change out of those clothes.

49
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,150
You're wet,

50
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,380
and you may catch a chill.

51
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,280
Sure.

52
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,500
Let's go.

53
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,100
(Yunlai)

54
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,120
Lady,

55
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,960
we're almost there.

56
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,900
Here.

57
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,530
You're from Yunlai?

58
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,360
Lady, please keep your voice down.

59
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,850
Don't let Manager Feng hear.

60
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,350
Lady,

61
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,150
I can't bring you through the front.

62
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,050
This hole's big enough.

63
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,660
I get through it. You can, too.

64
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,370
Heavens.

65
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,420
Lady,

66
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,410
you're so thin.

67
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,680
This is my smallest outfit,

68
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,560
yet it's still loose on you.

69
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,220
Come here. Sit.

70
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,220
Make yourself at home. Just sit.

71
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,660
Let me pour you water.

72
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,630
If you're this skinny,

73
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,730
young men won't fancy you.

74
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,330
Never mind.

75
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,740
Who cares what they like?

76
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,820
- Liking yourself matters most.
- Thank you.

77
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,730
Exactly.

78
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,600
In this dynasty,

79
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,200
plump figures like yours
are considered lovely.

80
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,700
What's the use of beauty?

81
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,070
Lady, you should eat more.

82
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,040
At least,

83
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,780
you could defend yourself

84
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,290
if bullied.

85
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,580
Well...

86
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,180
Lady,

87
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,420
my mother calls me Deyuan.

88
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,540
What's your name?

89
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,660
Deyuan?

90
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,380
I'm Jicai.

91
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,400
It means shepherd's purse.

92
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,460
Shepherd's purse?

93
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,260
How funny.

94
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,380
Naming someone after greens!

95
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,140
I've an elder brother, too.

96
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,020
His name's Gongcai.

97
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,980
Gongcai...?

98
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,820
Gongcai means dried mustard stems.

99
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,860
I'm from out of town.

100
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,060
We call them that.

101
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,860
Preserved Mustard is tasty.

102
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,340
Lady, your family must adore food.

103
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,460
We're in the catering trade.

104
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,340
Then your cooking must surpass Yunlai's.

105
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,620
You've just met me.

106
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,060
How can you judge?

107
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,340
I judge Yunlai's skills
with full confidence.

108
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,220
Do you know why?

109
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,060
They can't cook.

110
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,900
But they slap dishes

111
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,700
on silver plates, golden bowls,

112
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,300
and secret-color porcelain.

113
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,620
Then they charge exorbitant prices.

114
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,140
It's my first time

115
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,300
hearing Yunlai operate this way.

116
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,340
Alright.

117
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,350
Enough about them.

118
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,900
They're the big earners.

119
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,020
Lady, where are you from?

120
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,020
I come from Shu.

121
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,980
It's wonderful there.

122
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,100
Fewer rules

123
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,940
than in Yong'an,

124
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,940
more freedom.

125
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,300
Why do you come here?

126
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,020
Debts.

127
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,240
I pressed my thumb

128
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,900
on a Slave Deed,

129
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,860
lost

130
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,220
my commoner status,

131
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,700
and became a slave.

132
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,620
I can't go home now.

133
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,020
Me too.

134
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,460
I can't go home either.

135
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,820
Lady, can't you go back home either?

136
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,900
You must miss home badly.

137
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,540
Yong'an's summer heat

138
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,620
is unbearable.

139
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,260
It's not as cool as my hometown.

140
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,460
Ours is hot, too,

141
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,180
but we've ways to cope.

142
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,780
Lady, have you been to Shu?

143
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,620
I have!

144
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,540
Really?

145
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,540
We have so many delicacies there!

146
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,260
(Capital Prefecture)

147
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,860
Hu,

148
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,460
it's past noon.

149
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,580
Shouldn't we inform

150
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,060
Vice Prefect Lin about lunch?

151
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,420
Eat your meal.

152
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,820
Does the dynasty's most
promising young Vice Prefect

153
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,500
need your concern?

154
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,500
- Eat up, all.
- Fine.

155
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,940
I'll eat.

156
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,900
Young Master,

157
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,500
let's dine.

158
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,900
Let them eat first.

159
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,220
(Yong'an)

160
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,940
They've started.

161
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,340
At court and in the palace,

162
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,780
none dared slight you.

163
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,780
Yet here, petty guys test you.

164
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,540
They eat without the Vice Prefect?

165
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,380
How disrespectful!

166
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,580
A junior

167
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,540
surpassing them

168
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,140
naturally breeds resentment.

169
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,340
But martial men wear hearts
on their sleeves,

170
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,500
with no hidden schemes.

171
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,020
Unlike those

172
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,660
overly polite types,

173
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,900
who veil treacherous currents.

174
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,980
How exhausting.

175
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,260
But you seem poised.

176
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,340
You've already got a plan

177
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,340
to handle them,

178
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,300
right?

179
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,900
Handling is pointless.

180
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,220
I seek

181
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:47,620
genuine respect.

182
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,860
Here,

183
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,940
I feel adrift,

184
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,620
with no sense of belonging.

185
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,780
- Hungry?
- A bit.

186
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,460
Shall I cook for you?

187
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,820
But I've nothing here.

188
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,780
There's some lard I rendered.

189
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,740
Deyuan, do you eat lard?

190
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,100
Doesn't this dynasty

191
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,260
disdain pork?

192
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,220
How...?

193
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,420
When poor,

194
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,860
you eat what's there.

195
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,420
Sheep and sows

196
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,020
are both my four-legged treasures.

197
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,820
They call pork

198
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,460
"rank and cheap",

199
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,740
so they won't touch it.

200
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,820
What? Does that

201
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,940
make them noble?

202
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,980
Does it raise their wages?

203
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,420
Deyuan,

204
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,460
do you have any fermented sauce?

205
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,420
Fermented sauce?

206
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,620
This afternoon,

207
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,980
the Vice Minister of Works

208
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,740
will review
the Capital road repair budgets.

209
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,300
Who'd like

210
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,900
to assist?

211
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,740
What's this?

212
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,220
Who cooked?

213
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,700
The rice is half-raw.

214
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,500
Cheng Hu.

215
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,100
Oh, you're Yan.

216
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,500
My apologies.

217
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,820
I took a fall recently.

218
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,930
Bad leg,

219
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,780
sore back.

220
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,820
I can't handle this task.

221
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,020
Where are your manners?

222
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,960
Daring to address
my Young Master by name!

223
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,030
So what? I called him that,

224
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,900
so what?

225
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,500
I'm a rough man.

226
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,980
Besides,

227
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,940
the Vice Prefect is

228
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,260
younger than me.

229
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,980
He could call me "Uncle".

230
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,740
Exactly.

231
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,340
Cheng Hu,

232
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,940
do you know my relation

233
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,300
to Chancellor Meng?

234
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,650
How dare you

235
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,780
demand "Uncle"!

236
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,260
You...

237
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,420
you're Chancellor Meng's...?

238
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,820
But Vice Prefect,

239
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,460
I've heard
you're not from a noble house.

240
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,380
True.

241
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,940
I'm merely privileged to serve

242
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,620
alongside him.

243
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,660
You mocked me!

244
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,820
Yes.

245
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,500
Mocked.

246
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,620
Had you not fawned

247
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,180
upon learning of my "connection",

248
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,260
I'd have respected you.

249
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,900
What a pity. You're not that man.

250
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,420
Is that your integrity?

251
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,900
I know.

252
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,060
You doubt my capability

253
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,140
due to my youth,

254
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,620
and you resent following me.

255
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,420
But consider this.

256
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,900
The Capital Prefecture is a hot potato.

257
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,900
No noble scion would take it,

258
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,820
or they'd quit

259
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,100
within days.

260
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,100
You want achievements

261
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,300
in the Capital?

262
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,100
Good.

263
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,380
Then choose it.

264
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,660
You can

265
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:53,980
leave now.

266
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,500
I'll fund your departure,
no hard feelings.

267
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,100
Or

268
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,780
unite with me as true brothers.

269
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,380
You earn the right

270
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,180
to call me Lin Yan.

271
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,340
I swear that

272
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,540
if I prosper,

273
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,380
you'll build

274
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,060
legacies, too.

275
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,700
Everyone's here?

276
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,460
Perfect.

277
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,340
I brought food.

278
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,300
Auntie,

279
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,300
they're all hot.

280
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,620
Guaranteed

281
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,780
to make you

282
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,420
adore our dishes.

283
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,580
Here, pass these around.

284
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,620
Lamb Skewers

285
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,270
and chicken cutlets
bigger than your face.

286
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,860
Eat while it's hot.

287
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,500
Here.

288
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,460
Take some.

289
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,660
Here.

290
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,620
Smells good.

291
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,940
Why hesitate?

292
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,500
Quick, eat while hot.

293
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,140
Don't hesitate. Come on.

294
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,260
Vice Prefect,

295
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,820
I see

296
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,460
you've threatened

297
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,900
and now soothed.

298
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,820
Perfect.

299
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,820
Discuss over food.

300
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,060
That's perfect.

301
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,100
Everyone,

302
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,540
I'm Vice Prefect Lin's family.

303
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,420
Call me "Auntie"

304
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,300
if you like.

305
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,580
You work hard

306
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,980
daily.

307
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,060
Just eat up.

308
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,740
Eat while hot. Don't hold back.

309
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,460
Just taste it.

310
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,420
Quick, here.

311
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,260
Take it. Eat while hot.

312
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,140
Have milk tea.

313
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,980
Here.

314
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,900
Cheng Hu,

315
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,980
you're 37 years old,

316
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,220
poor,

317
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,260
and unmarried.

318
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,580
I can't promise you a wife,

319
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,100
but I'll secure your livelihood.

320
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,220
I've petitioned

321
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,420
to raise our salaries.

322
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,660
Really?

323
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,580
Second Master Xu,

324
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,220
second sons are often neglected.

325
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,980
You're one of them.

326
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,500
But by year's end,

327
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,500
there'll be promotion opportunities.

328
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,540
Return home then,

329
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,580
who'd dare slight you?

330
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,420
I'll strive

331
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,060
for each of your aspirations.

332
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,220
My word

333
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,260
is sworn to heaven.

334
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,620
Listen.

335
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,820
Listen!

336
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,540
I won't claim

337
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,740
Vice Prefect Lin is flawless.

338
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,260
But he empathizes,

339
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,420
if...

340
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,620
What does that mean?

341
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,860
It means

342
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,340
standing in your shoes

343
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,180
to address real needs.

344
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,860
You've worked here for years.

345
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,420
You know how rare that is.

346
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,860
Follow him,

347
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,980
and he won't shortchange you.

348
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,220
Now, quick.

349
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,340
Everyone, eat.

350
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,340
Food's getting cold!

351
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,980
Quick, move.

352
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,660
Hu...

353
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,420
Why stare?

354
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,890
Eat!

355
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,140
Here.

356
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,580
More milk tea.

357
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,180
I smelled it long ago!

358
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,340
Vice Prefect,

359
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,340
haven't eaten?

360
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,460
Sit.

361
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,580
Let's eat together.

362
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,660
Eat.

363
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,740
Here, sit down.

364
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,940
Vice Prefect.

365
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,880
- Please eat.
- Here,

366
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,340
try this.

367
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,580
Let me mix it for you.

368
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,100
What... what is it?

369
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,900
Cold skin noodles.

370
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,340
It's rice paste-based.

371
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,580
Rice...?

372
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,140
Let me try.

373
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,860
Wait.

374
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,020
Let me.

375
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,100
Must mix evenly.

376
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,620
There, taste it.

377
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,980
Then... I'll indulge.

378
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,460
Delicious!

379
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,540
So chewy!

380
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,540
Good, right?

381
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,780
Everyone, try some!

382
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,940
Try some.

383
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,860
Here.

384
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,740
Listen,

385
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,220
if you like,

386
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,220
when our eatery opens soon,

387
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,820
come feast!

388
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,020
Okay.

389
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,420
Auntie, your skills are superb.

390
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,900
We're blessed by the Vice Prefect.

391
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,660
Right.

392
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,980
Never tasted such snacks!

393
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,860
Vice Prefect, your family's so kind.

394
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,820
This one.

395
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,220
Food's ready.

396
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,500
We can eat soon.

397
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,460
Okay.

398
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,260
What's this?

399
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,940
A rabbit!

400
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,820
Gone already.

401
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,420
Next time, I'll make it again.

402
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,740
Smells great.

403
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,700
Is it ready?

404
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,260
- Try it.
- Okay.

405
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,220
Let me try it.

406
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,500
So fragrant. Tasty!

407
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,180
Such humble ingredients

408
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,300
become extraordinary
after being tossed with others.

409
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,980
What's its name?

410
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,580
There's no name.

411
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,340
I can only afford cheap grains.

412
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,760
But with fermented sauce

413
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,980
and lard for aroma,

414
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,140
even husks shine.

415
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,180
I think

416
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,900
it's the treasure of our poor people.

417
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,660
Just call it

418
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,020
"Paupers' Joy".

419
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,940
How do you like it?

420
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,980
Witty.

421
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,980
Now eat.

422
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,980
Deyuan, this injury...?

423
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,980
It's fine.

424
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,300
It's okay.

425
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,580
Chunyan!

426
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,020
Chunyan, are you in there?

427
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,540
Chunyan!

428
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,020
Hussy.

429
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,740
Why's the door locked?

430
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,380
Lady, I must work now.

431
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,220
Wait a while before leaving.

432
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,460
But you'll need

433
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,860
to exit the way we came.

434
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,860
At Yunlai, they call you "Chunyan"?

435
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,980
I hate that name.

436
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,580
Just call me Deyuan.

437
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,460
My family did that

438
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,660
when they were alive.

439
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,060
Alright.

440
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,020
Lady, I'll go now.

441
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,620
Keep the clothes.

442
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,980
We'll likely never meet again.

443
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,860
They're worthless.

444
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,740
Don't fret.

445
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,700
I'm leaving.

446
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,020
Deyuan...

447
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,900
Byebye.

448
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,460
(Forget it.)

449
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,620
(A fleeting encounter,)

450
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,180
(why should I meddle?)

451
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,940
Here, Vice Prefect.

452
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,180
Our family is opening an eatery.

453
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,860
We have been busy cleaning,

454
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,720
and we only had time
to make this bowl for you.

455
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,540
None for them, just for you.

456
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,740
Thanks, Auntie.

457
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,420
Mr. Liu,

458
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,580
what's wrong with your throat?

459
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,460
Unwell?

460
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,020
I'll bring honey water later.

461
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,980
Honey water?

462
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,380
Honey water for throat...

463
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,340
Auntie,

464
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,540
may I discuss something?

465
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,540
Urgent?

466
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,860
If not,

467
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,340
let's talk at home.

468
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,180
I must return to the shop.

469
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,260
Only Jianshe and Shaojie are there,

470
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,340
and they can't decide

471
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,220
anything about renovations.

472
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,220
I can't take care

473
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,340
of both sides.

474
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,500
And they are

475
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,220
useless to each other.

476
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,180
Yeah.

477
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,540
Actually,

478
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,420
it's... not that urgent.

479
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,020
Good.

480
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,260
Then eat, Vice Prefect.

481
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,460
I'll take my leave.

482
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,060
After work...

483
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,300
No.

484
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,420
After finishing your work,

485
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,420
bring the lunchbox back.

486
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,300
Okay.

487
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,620
I'll go.

488
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,460
Let me escort you.

489
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,260
No need, Vice Prefect.

490
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,660
Stay and eat.

491
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,500
I'm leaving.

492
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,810
- Byebye, Mr. Liu.
- Auntie, go safely.

493
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,780
About breaking the engagement,

494
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,210
Young Master, why can't you

495
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,340
bring yourself to tell Auntie Li?

496
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,380
Don't tell me

497
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,140
this meal

498
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,060
managed to win you over?

499
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,540
Did it make you feel at home?

500
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,500
You might even think:

501
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,940
why not go with the flow

502
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,740
and become a real family?

503
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,220
Fine. Who told you to eat it?

504
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,860
I'll explain.

505
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,340
(Yunshui Manor)

506
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,420
Why do you come here?

507
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,460
Debts.

508
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,420
I pressed my thumb

509
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,780
on a Slave Deed,

510
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,460
lost my commoner status,

511
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,820
and became a slave.

512
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,580
I can't go home now.

513
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,380
Auntie!

514
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,620
Grandpa and Grandma keep fighting
about the renovations.

515
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,860
What should I do?

516
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,820
Auntie, why won't you answer me?

517
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,340
Auntie!

518
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,580
Be good, Yangyang.

519
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,380
Vice Prefect.

520
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,220
Your mother sent me food.

521
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,980
I brought it back after my shift.

522
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,540
Thank you.

523
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,900
Thank you, Vice Prefect.

524
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,820
Lady Shen...

525
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,180
Yangyang, take it
to the kitchen, would you?

526
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,900
Okay.

527
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,680
- About the engagement...
- I have...

528
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,660
Vice Prefect, what did you say?
I didn't catch it.

529
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,580
You first.

530
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,740
Vice Prefect,

531
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,780
if someone voluntarily
signed a Slave Deed

532
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,620
and became a slave,

533
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,500
how can they regain commoner status?

534
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,260
That would

535
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,680
require a special pardon.

536
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,780
Or marrying an official.

537
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,190
Her husband could change her status.

538
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,820
Why?

539
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,980
Did you just say

540
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,500
someone willingly signed themselves

541
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,460
into slavery?

542
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,830
If she's a commoner
selling herself into slavery,

543
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,900
she must first go to the Market Office.

544
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,700
The registrar verifies her identity,

545
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,180
confirms parental status,

546
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,060
establishes a public contract,
and issues documentation.

547
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,020
Only then can she be a slave.

548
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,060
Merely signing a Slave Deed

549
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,660
doesn't count.

550
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,700
Thank you, Vice Prefect!

551
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,600
I need to step out briefly.

552
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,780
We can discuss upon my return.

553
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,900
Vice Prefect!

554
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,580
Where's Auntie?

555
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,580
She just left.

556
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,620
But Grandma said

557
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,780
Auntie was upset

558
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,780
and told me to watch her

559
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,220
and stop her from running off.

560
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,580
Why is she unhappy?

561
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,820
Because of you.

562
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,980
Me?

563
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,450
Auntie said

564
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,580
you were her last hope.

565
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,500
Now that's gone, too.

566
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,380
I've seen her cry
secretly several times.

567
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,820
Last hope?

568
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,540
But earlier,

569
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,260
she didn't seem eager to marry me.

570
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,260
Yangyang,

571
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,740
has she

572
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:20,740
guessed

573
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,020
I intend to break the engagement?

574
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,060
Vice Prefect, you want to break it?

575
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,500
Well...

576
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,300
It shouldn't matter.

577
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,860
This isn't her first broken engagement.

578
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,780
Don't you adults always say,

579
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,820
"first time strange,

580
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,060
second time familiar"?

581
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,340
Do you even know what it means
to break an engagement means?

582
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,700
Of course, I do!

583
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,050
Why ask a child?

584
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,580
You wretched trash!

585
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,620
You wretch!

586
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,460
Dodge! Let's see you dodge!

587
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,900
You worthless scum!

588
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,260
How dare you dodge!

589
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,220
Think I'm joking?

590
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,220
Filth!

591
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,340
I'll beat you dead!

592
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,740
(Yunlai)
I've every right to kill you!

593
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,460
You piece of trash!

594
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,620
I'll beat you dead!

595
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,820
Beat you dead!

596
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,380
You vermin!

597
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,740
Listen here,

598
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,260
catching my eye is your blessing.

599
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,900
You dare resist?

600
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,340
Listen,

601
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,820
your family's all dead.

602
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,860
Nobody's backing you, okay?

603
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,060
Besides,

604
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,580
I own your Slave Deed.

605
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,300
I've every right to beat you dead!

606
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,260
Every right!

607
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,220
Beat you dead!

608
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,340
You shameless wretch!

609
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,540
Showing off?

610
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,530
I'll show you what I'm capable of!

611
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,540
- Manager Feng!
- I'll...

612
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,780
Why such fury?

613
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,260
Don't harm your health.

614
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,260
Lady Shen,

615
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,340
to what do I owe this?

616
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,620
Earlier, this young lady

617
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,780
lent me clothing.

618
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,340
I came to return it,

619
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,940
and just happened to see

620
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,540
she displeased you.

621
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,580
Children misbehave,

622
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,380
but we can't just use rods.

623
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,690
If you truly dislike her,

624
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:17,660
sell her

625
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,740
for silver.

626
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,540
Or let me take her

627
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,540
and teach her manners for you.

628
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,980
So that's why she

629
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,820
grew bold lately.

630
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,140
Turns out she met Lady Shen

631
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,660
and thought she had backing.

632
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,580
Manager Feng, what nonsense.

633
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,740
Before you,

634
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,460
what backing could I possibly be?

635
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,820
Her boldness comes from

636
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,500
knowing your masculine virtue,

637
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,740
towering integrity.

638
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,740
You wouldn't stoop

639
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,300
to quarrel with a mere girl.

640
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,740
If she angers you so,

641
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,180
why keep her?

642
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,820
The neighbors say

643
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,020
you consult

644
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,060
diviners.

645
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,860
If you believe in mystical signs,

646
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,700
why choose her?

647
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,940
Frankly, Manager Feng,

648
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,300
I know physiognomy.

649
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,220
Her blade-sharp nose,

650
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,340
sunken marriage aspect,

651
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,820
and vicious glare

652
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,300
are textbook husband-killer signs.

653
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,180
Lady Shen,

654
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,980
let me be clear.

655
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,660
This trash's Slave Deed

656
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,900
belongs to Yunlai Tavern.

657
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,060
She's going nowhere.

658
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,180
As for discipline,

659
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,060
a lady like you shouldn't watch.

660
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,020
Maybe

661
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,140
you should leave.

662
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,220
Not so, Manager Feng.

663
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,020
People should heed omens.

664
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,620
Enough. No more.

665
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,020
Chunyan is a bought good.

666
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,260
Her life or sale is my decision.

667
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,860
She'll kill whom I say.

668
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,140
As long as I own her,

669
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,820
she can't touch me.

670
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,780
Well,

671
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,220
your family's opening an eatery

672
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,620
at Juxian Alley, yes?

673
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,580
Listen,

674
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,820
tend your own affairs.

675
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,780
Meddle

676
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,740
less.

677
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,300
Now leave.

678
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,700
Now leave, Lady Shen.

679
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,860
You wretch!

680
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,100
Daring to involve others?

681
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,740
Lady Shen,

682
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,060
you wouldn't have dealings

683
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,740
with this trash?

684
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,860
That's why

685
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,060
you came with this nonsense today?

686
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,860
You just wait!

687
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,900
Goodbye, and don't return.

688
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,500
(Yunlai)

689
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,740
(This is Yong'an,)

690
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,740
(where people can)

691
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,420
(be traded as goods.)

692
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,660
Who can I protect?

693
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,900
You wretch!

694
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,300
Daring to drag in Lady Shen?

695
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,940
Seeking backing?

696
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,980
Have a death wish?

697
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,220
Come here.

698
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,500
I'll beat you dead.

699
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,460
I...

700
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,730
- You wretch!
- Stop!

701
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,860
Get up.

702
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,180
Manager Feng,

703
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,140
let me clarify,

704
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,180
this young lady and I
aren't merely acquainted.

705
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,220
We're friends.

706
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,820
She told me she only signed

707
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,740
a Slave Deed to become a slave.

708
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:46,700
But as a commoner,

709
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,940
proper procedure requires

710
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,220
Market Office verification

711
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,480
by the registrar.

712
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,600
They confirm parental status,

713
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,120
establish a contract,
and issue documentation.

714
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,060
Then she can be a slave.

715
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,820
A mere signed Slave Deed is invalid!

716
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,860
What nonsense?

717
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,860
Afraid to admit it?

718
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,380
Then take the Slave Deed

719
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,880
to the Market Office for verification!

720
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,020
You...

721
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,460
You wouldn't dare.

722
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,780
Because you know,

723
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,260
without a full procedure,

724
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,020
you're coercing a commoner into bondage.

725
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,020
Manager Feng,

726
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,540
for a small tavern,

727
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,940
you're bold.

728
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,540
I thought you just illegally

729
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,980
expanded into the back alley.

730
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,060
Never imagined you traffic

731
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,940
in kidnapped commoners!

732
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,940
More lies and I'll rip your mouth!

733
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,100
Then you've persecuted another commoner.

734
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,420
Doubly guilty now!

735
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,660
Give me Deyuan's Slave Deed.

736
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,180
Guards!

737
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,700
Seal the gates.

738
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,980
Let's see you two

739
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,180
leave today.

740
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,980
The Capital Prefecture forces are here!

741
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,180
Keep them secured.

742
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,140
- Yes!
- Yes!

743
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,900
Vice Prefect!

744
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,780
Auntie!

745
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,420
You said

746
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,260
to seek your help

747
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,540
if in trouble?

748
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,220
I must go to Yunlai Tavern.

749
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,540
If I don't return,

750
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,580
bring some people

751
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,980
to catch them for illegal expansion.

752
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:17,980
A surprise inspection

753
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,220
can easily get evidence.

754
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,380
For you, new officials

755
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,420
need achievements.

756
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,300
Don't worry.

757
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,380
Manager Feng,

758
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,900
Yunlai Tavern's

759
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,220
back-alley expansion

760
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,260
violates

761
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,900
the Market Office's regulations.

762
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,340
Hello, Deputy Cheng.

763
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,860
Deputy Cheng,

764
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,580
why the strictness?

765
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,540
Listen,

766
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,260
all these years,

767
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,220
nothing

768
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,140
happened.

769
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,260
What are you doing?

770
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,580
What?

771
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,220
Besides,

772
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,820
nothing happened?

773
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,740
In April, the bookshop caught fire.

774
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,300
Your alley clutter

775
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,340
delayed rescue.

776
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,020
That's why it burned so fiercely!

777
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,140
Lies!

778
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,100
You...

779
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,180
The bookshop workers!

780
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,390
The bookshop workers are here.

781
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,300
Come here!

782
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,300
You! Come here.

783
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,420
You

784
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,500
tell him,

785
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,980
was this so?

786
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,940
Speak truth.

787
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,220
Speak!

788
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,100
No...

789
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,460
If you doubt me,

790
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,780
ask others.

791
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,300
You all.

792
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,580
You all!

793
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,700
Speak.

794
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,020
Tell him,

795
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,690
- is it true?
- No...

796
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,940
If it's true?

797
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,660
I don't know...

798
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,980
Really?

799
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,180
- Vice Prefect.
- Vice Prefect.

800
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,140
Vice Prefect.

801
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,260
It's the Vice Prefect.

802
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,620
You arrive on time.

803
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,980
Your officer slanders us

804
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,500
and blames Yunlai

805
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,020
for the delayed

806
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,380
bookshop rescue.

807
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,060
Injustice, Vice Prefect.

808
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,860
You must uphold the law.

809
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,780
Jinwu Guards records show

810
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,740
the April fire

811
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,860
killed three

812
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,900
because the Yunlai Tavern

813
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,220
blocked the alley.

814
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,460
If those dead souls

815
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,220
hear your denial,

816
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,900
would they crawl from hell

817
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,100
demanding vengeance?

818
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,060
No. That...

819
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,460
Manager Feng, you believe
in ghosts and gods.

820
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,860
Don't you

821
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:17,940
feel afraid?

822
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,740
It's... impossible!

823
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,580
That... that clutter blocked the alley,

824
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,140
but no deaths!

825
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,380
Just one...

826
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,900
He didn't get out,

827
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,750
but he just

828
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,220
burned his arms.

829
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,980
So you admit it.

830
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,980
No need

831
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,020
for further tricks.

832
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,980
You...

833
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,540
Vice Prefect,

834
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,340
do you know

835
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,220
who backs our owner?

836
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,300
Vice Prefect,

837
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,540
it's best for you to show mercy.

838
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,540
Your owner's connections?

839
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,140
Manager Feng,

840
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,580
are you suggesting I bend the law

841
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,300
for influential patrons?

842
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,260
I...

843
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,660
I see now.

844
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,020
The bookshop fire

845
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,980
was covered up

846
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,260
by you

847
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,700
in this way, too!

848
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,660
Right?

849
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,580
You have connections?

850
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,100
No wonder

851
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,140
witnesses stay silent!

852
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,720
- Vice Prefect.
- Demolish!

853
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,970
- Proceed!
- Yes!

854
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,870
Yes!

855
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,100
No! Wait!

856
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,060
Well...

857
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,500
You...

858
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,820
Release them!

859
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,990
- Vice Prefect!
- Don't move!

860
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,940
Halt!

861
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,820
All stop!

862
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,820
You! Out of my way!

863
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,580
And you!

864
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,340
Get away!

865
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,980
Impudent!

866
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,260
Dare strike

867
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,780
the Vice Prefect?

868
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,780
Go away!

869
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,020
Vice Prefect,

870
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,220
it's a misunderstanding.

871
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,700
Today,

872
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,820
that pancake-seller, Lady Shen,

873
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,950
in Juxian Alley,

874
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,140
tried to abduct my slave.

875
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,580
I merely

876
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,580
detained them.

877
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,020
You bullied her?

878
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,980
I...

879
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,740
I... I wouldn't dare bully Lady Shen.

880
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,620
He bullied you?

881
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,860
Vice Prefect! I wasn't abducting!

882
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,460
Manager Feng tricked a commoner.

883
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,420
Nonsense!

884
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,940
Continue.

885
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,580
Deyuan was a commoner.

886
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,860
Manager Feng fooled her

887
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,500
into fingerprinting a Slave Deed.

888
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,140
No Market Office visit.

889
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,100
Right, Deyuan?

890
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,660
The Market Office?

891
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,340
I never went.

892
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,220
See, Vice Prefect?

893
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,540
Deyuan never went.

894
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,620
She's still a commoner.

895
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,180
Manager Feng can't detain her.

896
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,660
Manager Feng,

897
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,660
is it true in this?

898
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,300
This...

899
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,700
The Slave Deed.

900
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,100
I'll count.

901
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,700
Three...

902
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,980
Two...

903
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,380
Fine...

904
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,580
(Slave Deed)

905
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,980
Buying commoners into bondage

906
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,820
requires bribes

907
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,060
and complex procedures.

908
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,260
You cut corners

909
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,020
and preyed on her naivety

910
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,580
with a fake thumbprint

911
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,420
for lifelong servitude.

912
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,860
Manager Feng,

913
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,100
do you know your crime?

914
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,180
Now,

915
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,660
destroying

916
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,980
this fake Slave Deed

917
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,660
won't suffice.

918
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,460
Do you mean

919
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,340
this Slave Deed is void?

920
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,620
It's illegal.

921
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,860
You were illegally imprisoned,

922
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,340
and you could sue him.

923
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,500
Feng Li,

924
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,260
when I first arrived
penniless in Yong'an,

925
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,780
you "kindly" bought me noodles,

926
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,100
and then, you claimed they cost gold.

927
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,020
I had no money.

928
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,620
So you tricked me
into signing the Slave Deed.

929
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,380
Now, even that was fake?

930
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,740
Feng Li.

931
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,140
Feng Li, I'll sue you to death!

932
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,100
Feng Li!

933
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,020
- Sue me?
- Feng Li! Spit it out!

934
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,100
Give it back!

935
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,700
Spit it out! Give it back!

936
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,540
Sue... me?

937
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,620
Enjoy chewing paper?

938
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,500
I'll burn you plenty more

939
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,460
to fill you!

940
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,420
Deyuan, you're free.

941
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,860
Let's go.

942
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,780
Dare you stop

943
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,060
those I release?

944
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,820
You can go.

945
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,220
Let's go.
