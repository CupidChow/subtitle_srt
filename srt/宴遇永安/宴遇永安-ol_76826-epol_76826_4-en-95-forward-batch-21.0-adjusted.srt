00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,940
=Episode 4=

3
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,700
No one's eating?

4
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,140
Listen,

5
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,780
this whole "bowing for blessings" thing,

6
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,620
how could he believe that?

7
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,260
And he actually let us out.

8
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,380
In my opinion, it's all thanks
to our ancestor.

9
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,140
Bonds across generations.

10
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,300
Even if bones break,

11
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,490
the sinews stay connected.

12
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,660
He didn't believe it at all.

13
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,140
Then why did he release us?

14
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,980
Exactly.

15
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,700
Vice Prefect, if you want me to leave,

16
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,980
I'll take my family and go.

17
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,980
Just say the word.

18
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,260
That's not what I meant.

19
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,620
It's just

20
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,180
that my childhood memories

21
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,380
of the Shen family are unclear.

22
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,780
Many things require confirmation.

23
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,060
Anyway, he didn't believe it.

24
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,940
What time is it now?

25
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,260
How can you still eat?

26
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,500
Exactly.

27
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,700
Since coming to Yong'an,

28
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,180
we've made too many mistakes.

29
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,020
We must review them thoroughly

30
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,450
and figure out whose faults they are.

31
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,060
Sorry, Mom.

32
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,140
My mistake.

33
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,580
I bear responsibility.

34
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,860
As for worshipping the ancestor,

35
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,020
I suggested it.

36
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,100
But you can't blame it

37
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,660
all on me.

38
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,860
If you ask me,

39
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,180
the biggest responsibility lies

40
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,140
with Jicai.

41
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,140
How is this my fault?

42
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,980
How isn't it...?

43
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,220
How isn't it your fault?

44
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,110
You told one lie

45
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,380
and needed a hundred more to cover it.

46
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,700
Wasn't it you who claimed to be

47
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,380
the ancestor's fiancee
with that upside-down logic?

48
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,200
Huh?

49
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,140
It...

50
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,060
No words now?

51
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,580
And tracing it back,

52
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,620
I blame her more.

53
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,020
Tell me,

54
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,760
if you hadn't dragged us
into filming that short video,

55
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,780
would we be here?

56
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,180
I'd be sleeping soundly at home.

57
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,340
Would I be in Yong'an?

58
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,260
I agree on this point.

59
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,220
What does this have to do with my video?

60
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,500
The script you wrote
was about our family

61
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,460
traveling back to ancient times

62
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,340
to cook for our ancestor, right?

63
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,580
Yeah. That dish... What was it called?

64
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,160
- Spring Water Lamb!
- Spring Water Lamb!

65
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,060
Auntie's script
was about time travel, right?

66
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,700
Jicai,

67
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,660
think carefully.

68
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,540
What else did your script say?

69
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,460
Auntie's script said

70
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,060
that our family accidentally
traveled to ancient times,

71
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,300
met a cold-blooded,

72
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,420
ruthless ancestor,

73
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,620
and finally, on a full moon night,

74
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,500
moved him with a perfect bowl

75
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,360
of Spring Water Lamb.

76
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,560
Then we returned to the modern era.

77
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,500
Thinking carefully,

78
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,020
the current plot

79
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,500
really matches my script

80
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,460
almost exactly.

81
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,700
Then this is simple.

82
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,700
Let's just keep acting

83
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,020
according to Jicai's script.

84
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,180
On the full moon night,

85
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,140
make a pot of Spring Water Lamb

86
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,340
for the ancestor.

87
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,900
Won't we go back then?

88
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,860
But the ancestor's suspicion of us

89
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,980
grows heavier.

90
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,900
We must find a way to stabilize him,

91
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,260
or we'll be sliced up

92
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,660
before the full moon.

93
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,980
How do we stabilize him?

94
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,820
By having you break

95
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,940
your limits for a marriage?

96
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,480
Stop talking nonsense!

97
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,750
Listen, if you keep spouting that,

98
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,610
when we all leave,

99
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,660
we'll leave you here alone.

100
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,900
Everyone,

101
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,380
bonding

102
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,100
happens

103
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,940
meal by meal.

104
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,620
Our ancestor eats

105
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,260
prison-like food daily.

106
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,660
If we cook something good,

107
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,820
and he eats happily,

108
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,740
won't he be easier to talk to?

109
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,940
Young Master, if you don't verify

110
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,490
the records of the Cui case personally,

111
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,980
you won't rest easy.

112
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,100
By rights, I should go with you.

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,720
But the Court of Judicial Review
is heavily guarded.

114
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,660
I...

115
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,980
dare not go.

116
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,820
I can only urge you, Young Master,

117
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,180
to be cautious in all things.

118
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,820
Excellent.

119
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,780
Young Master, without my protection,

120
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,980
you must be careful.

121
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,780
(East Kitchen)

122
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,380
Just marinating meat at night,

123
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,900
why do I feel like a thief?

124
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,660
Vice Prefect.

125
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,900
Good evening, Vice Prefect.

126
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,580
If nothing's wrong, I'll head off first.

127
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,580
You can recognize me?

128
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,380
(TV dramas never lie!)

129
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,530
(Ancient people truly believed)

130
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,100
(that a face mask was a disguise.)

131
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,700
Vice Prefect,
your stature is exceptional,

132
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,980
elegant,

133
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,820
and unmatched.

134
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,180
Of course, I recognize you.

135
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,700
Sneaking around late at night,

136
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,260
what are you doing?

137
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,020
Vice Prefect, please don't say that.

138
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,020
Look at yourself...

139
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,780
I didn't get full

140
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,290
from porridge and steamed buns tonight.

141
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,580
I wanted to check the kitchen

142
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,620
for leftovers,

143
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,820
but I found nothing.

144
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,130
You're traveling at night,

145
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,820
must be important business?

146
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,300
Relax.

147
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,060
I saw nothing.

148
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,100
Nothing at all.

149
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,860
(She's threatening me.)

150
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,020
I know where you come from

151
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,500
and your purpose

152
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,740
at Yunshui Manor.

153
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,980
(How could the ancestor know)

154
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,780
(that I'm from the modern era?)

155
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,220
Take me to see them.

156
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,980
Take you to see them?

157
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,020
You want to return with us?

158
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,900
No, that'd cause chaos!

159
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,820
I promise!

160
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,880
I promise to take you back!

161
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,540
(Agreeing so easily)

162
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,160
(and taking me
to meet those behind her,)

163
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,860
(is she afraid to die)

164
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,020
(or scheming something else?)

165
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,620
(Am I insane?)

166
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,480
(Promising to take an ancient person
to the modern era?)

167
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,340
(Have I lost my mind?)

168
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,980
What do your people

169
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,740
say?

170
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,900
My people?

171
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,580
(Not those crappy relatives, right?)

172
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,740
(Wait, how does he know everything?)

173
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,660
(But who dares question
this brutal ancestor?)

174
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,100
Speak!

175
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,100
What plans do those people

176
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,260
have for me?

177
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,300
What plans could they have for you?

178
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,980
They'd be terrified seeing you!

179
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,020
We want to find a way back, too.

180
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,300
But we're unsure.

181
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,620
Promising to take you

182
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,020
is just... doing our best.

183
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,700
Even if we take you,

184
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,060
they might refuse to see you.

185
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,340
They don't even see us,

186
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,220
and they rejected our New Year visits
over a dozen times!

187
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,580
Our family's fallen on hard times.

188
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,900
We're utterly unwelcome there.

189
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,900
So,

190
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,620
those people abandoned you?

191
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,180
Then what's the use of keeping you?

192
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,140
That's too harsh.

193
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,900
Selecting you

194
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,340
and arranging you here.

195
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,020
There must be a reason.

196
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,140
I wish I knew why, too!

197
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,180
Vice Prefect, rest assured.

198
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,700
If we find a way,

199
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,820
we'll take you back.

200
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,300
Okay?

201
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,820
Why would he want to come home with us?

202
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,460
Did you misunderstand something?

203
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,620
He recently thought

204
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,020
we were his fake relatives.

205
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,540
How does he know everything now?

206
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,380
I'm shocked too.

207
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,780
I wish it were a misunderstanding.

208
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,100
Honestly,

209
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,100
he's truly our ancestor.

210
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,460
All-knowing and omnipotent.

211
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,380
Dad, another mouth

212
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,740
to feed back home.

213
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,060
We return with nothing,

214
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,180
struggling to feed ourselves.

215
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,420
How can we support him?

216
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,540
But he is our ancestor.

217
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,140
If he asks,

218
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,780
can we descendants do nothing?

219
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,060
That's not right.

220
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,220
Filial piety, huh?

221
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:33,700
Our restaurant's

222
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,940
nearly bankrupt.

223
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,060
You'll starve yourself,

224
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,780
still thinking of supporting him?

225
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,340
Fine.

226
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,980
Since he's your ancestor,

227
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,860
you figure out how to feed him.

228
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,860
That's not what I mean.

229
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,580
Look, first, we travel back.

230
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,580
Then,

231
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,260
see if we can return here.

232
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,420
If successful,

233
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,260
we fetch the ancestor.

234
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,300
But likely, we can't return.

235
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,140
Because this travel

236
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,500
isn't reversible.

237
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,220
Then, we can't

238
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,300
fetch him,

239
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,220
and he can't

240
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,260
hold us

241
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,100
accountable.

242
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,980
Right?

243
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,340
My point is that

244
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,460
he can't blame us.

245
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,260
What do you think?

246
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,660
The people behind the Shen family

247
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,420
abandoned them,

248
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,100
yet sent them here.

249
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,740
That makes...

250
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,420
no sense!

251
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,900
Young Master,

252
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,140
why not interrogate

253
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,580
the Shen family privately?

254
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,500
Wouldn't the truth surface?

255
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,660
Scaring them

256
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,500
was one thing.

257
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,580
Real torture is inappropriate.

258
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,740
This isn't our place.

259
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,860
Everything near the capital
requires utmost caution.

260
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,060
Torture is easy.

261
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,480
Dealing with the aftermath isn't.

262
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,580
Young Master, consider this.

263
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,900
Could sending

264
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,980
these five fools

265
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,820
be meant

266
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,540
to lull you?

267
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,900
You mean,

268
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,460
against smart opponents,

269
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,700
you predict their moves.

270
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,660
But when it comes to fools,

271
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,220
they are

272
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,300
unpredictable.

273
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,660
Thus, achieving an unexpected victory?

274
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,820
Yes!

275
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,180
I find you

276
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,980
increasingly perceptive lately.

277
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,020
Young Master, you think so too?

278
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,620
I kept them hoping to trace the source.

279
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,020
But they seem

280
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,940
to be useless pawns.

281
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,420
They can't stay.

282
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,750
Last night, I failed
to find the Cui case files

283
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,800
at the Court of Judicial Review.

284
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,460
I'll go again tonight.

285
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,740
Meanwhile,

286
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,420
you handle the Shen family.

287
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,820
Bury

288
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,700
everything here.

289
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,620
Bury?

290
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,780
Wait, this task...

291
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,460
to me?

292
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,420
I don't want to harm anyone.

293
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,100
But I must protect my Young Master.

294
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,380
I must guard him well.

295
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,660
Brother!

296
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,660
Wake up!

297
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,900
Wake...

298
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,140
I truly can't bring myself to do it.

299
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,380
Deeper.

300
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,660
Dig deeper!

301
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,860
Deeper!

302
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,060
You're awake?

303
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,300
How are you awake?

304
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,020
Dramas lie!

305
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,900
You can't knock someone out.

306
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,300
Dad!

307
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,420
Who's there?

308
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,380
That guy broke curfew! After him!

309
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,860
Gongcai! Gongcai, wake up!

310
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,700
Gongcai.

311
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,700
Gongcai!

312
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,940
What's happening?

313
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,860
Lin Yan, you...

314
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,700
Shhh!

315
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,340
Vice Prefect, please!

316
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,100
A thief fled toward Yunshui Manor!

317
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,540
We must search!

318
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,020
Vice Prefect.

319
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,340
Vice Prefect!

320
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,780
What are you doing?

321
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,100
You dare ask?

322
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,020
Vice Prefect, please!

323
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,140
Caught traveling at night, huh?

324
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,380
Vice Prefect!

325
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,100
What now?

326
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,380
I can save you.

327
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,020
But remember, you owe me.

328
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,420
Apologies, everyone.

329
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,700
Tonight, I was traveling outside

330
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,860
and breaking curfew.

331
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,380
Lady,

332
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,500
that night traveler

333
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,580
seemed like

334
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,580
a man.

335
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,180
The night is deep.

336
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,620
Surely you misjudged, sir.

337
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,740
It was me.

338
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,580
I'm the Vice Prefect's cousin.

339
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,460
Tonight, Vice Prefect was hungry.

340
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,180
He's always particular.

341
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,740
I went out

342
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,900
hoping to find the night market.

343
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,700
Sorry for the trouble.

344
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,060
Lady, do you not know

345
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,740
that breaking curfew is a grave crime?

346
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,580
I do. But Vice Prefect...

347
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,380
Knowing violation increases the penalty!

348
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,700
No! No...

349
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,900
I... didn't know! I misspoke!

350
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,660
I'm new to Yong'an and unfamiliar...

351
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,020
Vice Prefect.

352
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,140
Apologies for troubling everyone.

353
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,240
Patrolling at night
and encountering this...

354
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,380
My cousin traveled

355
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,220
for my sake,

356
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,700
not willful violation.

357
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,380
She grew up

358
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,820
where curfews were lax.

359
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,660
She was new to Yong'an customs.

360
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,180
And

361
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,220
a young lady

362
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,940
could hardly cause trouble.

363
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,960
Could we follow the law:

364
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:09,940
pay a fine,

365
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,260
pledge

366
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,580
no future offenses?

367
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,140
Is that okay?

368
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,620
If you say so,

369
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,300
it...

370
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,940
Thank you.

371
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,780
Without you all,

372
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,060
Yong'an wouldn't be this peaceful.

373
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,850
My family and I

374
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,380
never intended to harm you.

375
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,980
Why did you try to kill us?

376
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,220
You covered for me earlier

377
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,420
only because you feared exposure.

378
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,940
A dignified Vice Prefect

379
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,220
sneaking around at night,

380
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,260
your secret is clearly worse!

381
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,820
But we truly saw you as...

382
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,300
as family!

383
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,860
We promised to take you back.

384
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,380
Do you know how hard that is?

385
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,740
Of course, it's hard.

386
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,140
You spies were

387
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,220
long abandoned by your masters.

388
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,860
You could never take me back.

389
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,700
Spies?

390
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,100
You think we're spies

391
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,660
planted near you?

392
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,980
Aren't you?

393
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,580
You're insane.

394
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,660
Call those soldiers back

395
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,140
and let them see what we are!

396
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,300
My family's only plan

397
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,740
was shelter

398
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,580
and finding a way...

399
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,060
home!

400
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,140
Yesterday, you said
you'd return with us.

401
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,220
We thought,

402
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,660
however difficult,

403
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,900
we'd try for you.

404
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,380
Yet you suspect us of spying!

405
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,540
What spy would offer

406
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,620
to take you to their base?

407
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,460
Answer that!

408
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,380
Then earlier,

409
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,160
you said you didn't know
why you were "arranged" here.

410
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,140
What does that mean?

411
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,380
Who arranged it?

412
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,660
What arrangement?

413
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,420
Vice Prefect Lin,

414
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,340
is it possible I meant

415
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,380
"why did fate arrange this"?

416
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,300
We didn't want to be stranded in Yong'an,
yet here we are.

417
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,340
I don't know
why fate arranges things this way!

418
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,100
Then,

419
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,540
how could you easily open

420
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,340
that lock with Huoxun Kingdom numerals?

421
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,420
Huoxun Kingdom numerals?

422
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,620
Vice Prefect,

423
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,020
for the trade, we learn

424
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,260
all counting methods.

425
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,580
What's strange?

426
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,060
I opened that lock by accident!

427
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,980
Eight is homophonic

428
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,060
for prosper.

429
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,900
Is it difficult for merchants?

430
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,500
Next time, if you need anything,

431
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,460
ask on the spot!

432
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,620
Don't invent

433
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,020
Huoxun spy

434
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,860
nonsense later!

435
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,100
How could you think that up?

436
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:43,940
The sow trotters...

437
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,460
aren't done yet.

438
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,540
I...

439
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,020
Vice Prefect,

440
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,780
please open your eyes.

441
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,940
My brother was drugged unconscious,

442
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,140
yet he snores on the spot.

443
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,380
My dad...

444
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,780
My dad follows my mom.

445
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,020
My mom!
My niece, who's barely a few years old!

446
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,540
Who here looks capable of opposing you?

447
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,180
Liu Chang!

448
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,060
Wake up!

449
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,220
Liu Chang,

450
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,380
why did you do this?

451
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,900
Didn't you say that day?

452
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,700
Eyes narrowed, gazing into the distance,

453
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,260
"You handle the Shen family.

454
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,900
Bury everything here."

455
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,140
You told me!

456
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,060
I meant bury the matter,

457
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,660
not the family!

458
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,580
Detain them somewhere,

459
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,900
isn't that fine?

460
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,860
Detain?

461
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,260
Clearly, house arrest!

462
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,580
Lin Yan, do you know
what we did tonight?

463
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,740
Cooked a whole table of delicacies

464
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,820
to thank you.

465
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,740
For this meal,

466
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,260
I marinated the meat
in the kitchen last night

467
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,380
and wanted to surprise you.

468
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,620
And you?

469
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,700
Your conscience eaten by dogs?

470
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,020
- Lady Shen...
- Shut up!

471
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,420
Alright.

472
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,660
I...

473
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,060
misunderstood
our Young Master's meaning.

474
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,860
My deepest apologies.

475
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,140
This is how you misunderstand?

476
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,140
Your misunderstanding

477
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,700
nearly buried my family alive!

478
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,620
The misunderstanding was mine.

479
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,740
Your anger is justified,

480
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,140
but I must

481
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,900
still apologize.

482
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,020
Young Master...

483
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,900
Don't blame him!

484
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,720
It's all my fault.

485
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,990
Punishment, beating, or scolding,

486
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,540
I accept it all!

487
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,940
Sorry, Uncle!

488
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,020
Sorry, Auntie! Sorry, Yangyang!

489
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,020
Sorry, Lady Shen!

490
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,700
Enough! Enough!

491
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,660
Stop this!

492
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,620
Vice Prefect, get up!

493
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,140
- Okay, Vice Prefect.
- Fine.

494
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,500
- I know.
- Okay. Fine.

495
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,060
- Alright, alright.
- Get up first.

496
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,780
It seems you two

497
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,820
truly realize your wrongs.

498
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,140
Let this matter pass.

499
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,100
But Vice Prefect Lin,

500
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,340
we do request your help.

501
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,300
We'd like to rely on our family ties

502
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,940
to stay here temporarily.

503
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,020
We have zero ulterior motives.

504
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,020
We also hope

505
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,620
you will stop such suspicions.

506
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,740
I'm truly sorry.

507
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,380
Then... this is settled?

508
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,500
Forget it, forget it.

509
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,340
Forget it.

510
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,320
- Here, Vice Prefect.
- Come.

511
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,140
- Sit down.
- Improper.

512
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,060
Listen to me!

513
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,860
Come here.

514
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,940
Sit down, Vice Prefect.

515
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,780
Eat it! Yangyang, here.

516
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,580
Starving.

517
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,380
Liu Chang,

518
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,420
eat it!

519
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,340
- This bamboo shoot is tasty.
- Not bad.

520
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,620
Eat it.

521
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,980
- Delicious!
- Eat more, Vice Prefect.

522
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,100
Nourish your brain.

523
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,780
Thank you, Lady Shen.

524
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,180
Vice Prefect, I'll wash them.

525
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,020
I'll wash them.

526
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,660
Brother Shen, the fault was mine first.

527
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,540
Such small tasks should be mine.

528
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,020
No, this is my job.

529
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,220
Plus, you're our...

530
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,460
landlord!

531
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,460
This isn't proper.

532
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,580
- I'll do it.
- No need.

533
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,300
Really, I insist.

534
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,700
- No way.
- Improper.

535
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,540
Stop arguing.

536
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,340
Let my brother wash.

537
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,650
Vice Prefect, please come with me.

538
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,220
Go.

539
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,860
Go. I'll handle this.

540
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,180
Oh my, you're washing dishes for me?

541
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,490
I don't want a shortened lifespan.

542
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,860
This is a snack from Qingyang,

543
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,700
rice tofu.

544
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,300
The process is complicated,

545
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,420
and it's freshly made.

546
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,020
Knowing you have had
a hard time these years,

547
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,940
you must miss the taste of home.

548
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,140
So I specially made this snack for you.

549
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,300
You almost buried us alive.

550
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,820
And we're still being so good to you.

551
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,700
Aren't you touched?

552
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,820
If you are touched,

553
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,900
then next time,
don't do such wicked things.

554
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,580
Sorry.

555
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,580
What were you doing out at night?

556
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,140
About some things,

557
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,700
it's better to know less.

558
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,460
Got it.

559
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,100
I got it.

560
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,580
Only people from Qingyang

561
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,260
know how to make rice tofu.

562
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,660
(Not necessarily.
People on the internet know too.)

563
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,020
You said

564
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,260
you wanted to go home,

565
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,500
meaning back to Qingyang?

566
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,300
Actually,

567
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,580
our hometown isn't Qingyang either.

568
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,220
We went to Qingyang later and met...

569
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,180
your parents.

570
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,620
Anyway, it was very circuitous.

571
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,980
We couldn't settle down anywhere,

572
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,300
and finally we came to Yong'an.

573
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,180
But we still really want

574
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,580
to go back to our real home.

575
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,460
Don't worry.

576
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,940
One day,

577
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,260
we'll find a way.

578
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,180
Enough talk, hurry up and eat it.

579
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,700
It won't taste good if it sits too long.

580
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,980
Rice tofu is mostly made savory,

581
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,380
but I like it sweet,

582
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,660
so I made yours sweet.

583
00:26:59,140 --> 00:26:59,980
In the past,

584
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,660
my mother liked to make it sweet too.

585
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,420
Over ten years,

586
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,420
I can hardly remember its taste now.

587
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,660
Your saying

588
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,940
makes my heart soften.
I can't stay mad at you.

589
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,580
Regarding today's events,

590
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,380
it was truly my fault.

591
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,940
I hope you can forgive me.

592
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,980
Before he knew Lady Shen,

593
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,180
his personality was
cold-blooded, ruthless, and merciless.

594
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,300
He isn't really as vicious
as Grandpa said.

595
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,220
What?

596
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,780
I'm saying that
for a Vice Prefect like you,

597
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,660
being willing to admit you're wrong
and willing to change

598
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,780
is rare.

599
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,970
Actually, seeing you like this,

600
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,780
my family stopped being angry long ago.

601
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,380
What about you?

602
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,740
Then what about you?

603
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,780
Do you trust the Shen family now?

604
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,220
(Sushui City)

605
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,660
(Prince Zhao's Mansion)

606
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,780
(Prince Zhao)

607
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,140
(Li Ang, Fourth Son of Prince Zhao)

608
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,220
I won!

609
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,020
Let me tell you,

610
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,060
if Anran were here,

611
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,180
this game of Chupu

612
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,060
wouldn't have been
so easy for me to win.

613
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,140
So boring!

614
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,220
Dad, how many times

615
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,020
have you mentioned Lin Yan?

616
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,420
I think

617
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,500
he must be your real son.

618
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,580
You named him Yan,

619
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,900
following the radical pattern

620
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,300
used in our brothers' names.

621
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,820
One day,

622
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,990
we might as well
have him acknowledge his ancestors.

623
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,140
If he really were my own son,

624
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,380
that would actually be better.

625
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,140
What about the letter you sent to Anran?

626
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,980
You gave the order,

627
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,420
how dare I disobey?

628
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,660
The letter has probably arrived by now.

629
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,980
(Gentle and Calm)

630
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,940
Young Master.

631
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,780
Young Master!

632
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,420
This is from His Highness, Prince Zhao,

633
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,660
written from Sushui City.

634
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,260
But didn't His Highness say that

635
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,900
since you entered the capital

636
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,920
and gained His Majesty's favor,

637
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,770
he should avoid suspicion

638
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,860
and reduce

639
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,980
this kind of correspondence?

640
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,100
Perhaps there's something urgent.

641
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,510
(I'm gratified
to hear it.)

642
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,520
(She is first
to know the situation.)

643
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,500
(Those close to her can also
know it.)

644
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,620
Prince Zhao

645
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,700
wants me to find a way
to get close to Princess Fuhui

646
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,130
to find out about court developments.

647
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,380
Princess Fuhui?

648
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:22,980
Is that the one

649
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,390
whose consort fell off a cliff
and has been in a coma for over ten years?

650
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,240
The one with the hobby

651
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,260
of widely collecting close servants?

652
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,540
Yes.

653
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:31,860
But

654
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,860
why would Prince Zhao suddenly

655
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,420
care about court movements?

656
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,400
His Highness has always cared
about the common people.

657
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,500
Maybe he just...

658
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,460
wants to care about it?

659
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,660
By the way,

660
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,470
last night I infiltrated
the Court of Judicial Review

661
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,300
and looked at the files
from the Cui case.

662
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,190
The evidence was solidly fabricated.

663
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,600
The mastermind behind it

664
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,100
must have deep roots in the court

665
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,300
to pull that off.

666
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,220
Then, aren't we in big trouble?

667
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,060
Young Master,

668
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,580
I observe that

669
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,300
you always seem to hold something back

670
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,660
from His Highness.

671
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,060
You've never even mentioned

672
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,780
our plans to overturn the case to him.

673
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,980
At this point,

674
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,380
don't you want

675
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,140
to ask His Highness for help?

676
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,500
Back then, when we fled the Cui family,

677
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,340
wandering destitute,

678
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,020
it was His Highness who lent a hand.

679
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,260
We only survived because of him.

680
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,980
His Highness has been kind
to both of us.

681
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,380
I don't want

682
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,740
to implicate him one day.

683
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,520
The Fifth Master Xiao
mentioned in Dad's notes

684
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,260
is probably the one
from the Princess's family.

685
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,900
The Princess has
wide connections at court

686
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,380
and is Fifth Master Xiao's wife.

687
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,580
Getting close to her

688
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,380
is bound to yield new clues.

689
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,700
By the way,

690
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,340
the Shen family

691
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,950
complained that our kitchen cooking
is too plain

692
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,600
and they couldn't get used to it.

693
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,920
They insisted on cooking for themselves.

694
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,180
I said that wouldn't do.

695
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,420
They're such a strange family.

696
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,620
If I let them into the kitchen,

697
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,260
what if one day they poison

698
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,180
our food?

699
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,540
Lady Shen was right.

700
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,580
They are indeed simpletons.

701
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,080
They'd never be chosen as spies,

702
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,140
no matter what.

703
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,540
Besides, up until now,

704
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,980
only I've hurt them.

705
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,420
They truly haven't wronged me

706
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,620
in the slightest.

707
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,140
Then...

708
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,220
do I still need to keep an eye on them?

709
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,860
No need.

710
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,180
Their rice tofu

711
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,700
is very authentic.

712
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,580
From now on,
they can use the kitchen freely.

713
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,650
You go buy more ingredients, too.

714
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,900
So fragrant.

715
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,660
Choose a lamb with a good mix
of lean and fat meat,

716
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,260
and simmer it slowly over low heat
for two full hours.

717
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,220
Clear broth, tender meat,
and aroma wafting everywhere.

718
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,780
This can absolutely be called

719
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,380
a perfect pot

720
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,620
of Spring Water Lamb!

721
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,340
It's definitely not that perfect.

722
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,340
Why?

723
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,600
But I can prove it.

724
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,720
This is absolutely
the best-tasting Spring Water Lamb

725
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,180
your dad is capable of making.

726
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,740
Want it to be better?

727
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,180
Absolutely impossible.

728
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,660
Honey, could you just

729
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,540
occasionally praise me once?

730
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,100
Alright, alright! Quick! Taste it!

731
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,100
Everyone, taste it!

732
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,860
Perfect! Dad is the best!

733
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,700
Really?

734
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,420
- Here, I'll pick you a piece.
- Tasty.

735
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,140
Here.

736
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,980
So, as long as we use this perfect pot
of Spring Water Lamb

737
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,700
to move our ancestor

738
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,780
on the full moon night,

739
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,580
we can return to modern times?

740
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,300
Most likely, yes.

741
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,420
But the full moon night
is still several days away.

742
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,300
How about

743
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,820
we use this last bit of time

744
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,740
to make some money?

745
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,260
Good!

746
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,420
When we came,

747
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,540
weren't my gold jewelry

748
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,820
and Yangyang's longevity lock

749
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,180
all brought over?

750
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,580
Then, the money we earn here,

751
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,480
if we exchange it for gold,

752
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,020
we can take it back, too?

753
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,220
Absolutely, we can!

754
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,300
Okay then! So tomorrow we'll continue...

755
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,460
continue making

756
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,340
- Jian...
- Bing...

757
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,220
- Guo...
- Zi!

758
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,140
Yeah.

759
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,860
Yeah!

760
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,120

00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,440
(Let's see
the officials' canteen in Yong'an.)

762
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,500
(Speaking of exploiting the ancestor,)

763
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,640
(let me read you the daily ration
allocated to Vice Prefect Lin:)

764
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:56,820
(2.2 sheng of fine rice
and 8 ge of non-glutinous rice.)

765
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,770
(2.4 sheng of flour,
1.5 sheng of wine, and 4 fen of lamb.)

766
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:58,840
(4 ge of sauce, 4 ge of vinegar,
and 3 melons.)

767
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,200
(Salt, fermented beans, scallions,
ginger, mallow, leeks, etc.)

768
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,300
(If he must attend the court,
he'll eat at the canteen at noon.)

769
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,420
(Leaving one portion of rations behind.)

770
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,710
(During festivals, the Emperor
bestows various sundries too.)

771
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,120
(Since Vice Prefect Lin usually just
eats steamed buns, rice, and pickles,)

772
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,530
(leaving it would be a waste.)

773
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:11,220
(So we'll confiscate it all
to use for the shop.)
