1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
You too, Miss Yang?

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,160
Yes, that's right.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,640
I know how the movie is going.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,040
I never imagined you would watch Internet Mummy and the 뭐太夏蕊的广告节两年了

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,600
How did she not mention And Dynasty Century and the Someone,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,360
W Kurt's One County

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,920
That is such a wise man,

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,480
But he is also a wayward young man.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,080
Huh?

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,480
I've damaged one of the dove and safe pewns,

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,960
Did someone there send their sow power up?

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,960
I suppose so...

13
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,960
But I hope you can put this marriage on your mind

14
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,960
These words should be said by the police when everything is ready

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,960
But now I just want to say it

16
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,960
I am 25 years old now

17
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,960
I am a pregnant woman

18
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,960
I am married to a prostitute

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,960
I have 7 houses, 8 houses, 98 houses, and a shop

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,960
I have 632 shops

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
You are so rich

22
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,960
Wait, does this smile mean that women are satisfied with everything you see?

23
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,960
I say this because I hope you can think about it

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,960
Why do you want to marry me?

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
You are smart

26
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
You are smart

27
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
You are more likely to be a prostitute than a prostitute

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
You and I are going to be married

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
We will be together for a long time

30
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,960
We are suitable

31
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
Because we are suitable

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,960
You should see that I am not an artisan

33
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,960
I am like your wife

34
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,960
We are suitable

35
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,960
You have a good taste and a good relationship

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
We are suitable

37
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,960
You and I are not like the old house and your 14 years old

38
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,960
Xiao Guang

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,960
After graduation, you don't have to go to the restaurant every day

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,960
I will go out to find a house

41
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,960
You can't find a job

42
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960
I will find you

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,960
Xiao Guang

44
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,960
I have a good job now

45
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,960
It's not suitable for you

46
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
You can leave and have a good impression

47
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,960
But I'm so bad at talking

48
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
You are so stupid

49
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
Mr. Liu, I can't agree

50
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,960
Mr. Liu is good and upright

51
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,960
He is an irreplaceable man

52
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
But we have different views on marriage

53
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
Mrs. Shen, don't worry about it

54
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,960
I understand

55
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
It's sudden

56
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
But you and I are suitable

57
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
Otherwise, Mrs. Shen will think about it

58
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
Sorry, I have thought about it

59
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
Mr. Liu, wait a minute

60
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
I didn't have time to return the wedding dress

61
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
I will go now

62
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
Young master

63
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
Why are you here?

64
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
This is my house

65
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,960
I passed by

66
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
Don't go out to find

67
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
Mr. Liu, it's late

68
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
The garden is hot

69
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,960
I'll send you out after the road is hot

70
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
No

71
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
This way, please

72
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
Go, this way

73
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
I'm going out to take a walk

74
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
I don't mean anything

75
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
I'm going out to take a walk

76
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Take a walk

77
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
OK

78
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
OK, take a walk

79
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
Wait

80
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Young master

81
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
What did you say?

82
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
It's going to winter

83
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,960
It's hard to avoid a cold

84
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,960
It's a pity that this is Yongan

85
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
If it's in the future, it's good

86
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,960
There is a machine called a washing machine in the future

87
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,960
It can wash dishes by itself

88
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
So that you don't have to touch the cold water in winter

89
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
Your hands won't hurt the window

90
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
Washing machine

91
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
What is it?

92
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
It's a square metal

93
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Then

94
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Let me draw it for you

95
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
This is probably the case

96
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
There is a pipe here

97
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
It can drink water by itself

98
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
There is a pipe here

99
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
It's a water flow here

100
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
It can be charged by itself

101
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
So it can wash dishes by itself

102
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
This thing is so powerful

103
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
But how can it move by itself?

104
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Zhao Ying's thinking

105
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Is the reason why people go to the future

106
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
But Yongan doesn't have this condition

107
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
I guess it's still the person who takes the initiative to pull

108
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,960
Do you like this washing machine?

109
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,960
I didn't have money at home

110
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
I can't afford to buy a washing machine

111
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
I just want to grow up quickly

112
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
I made money by myself

113
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
I finally grew up and made money

114
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
I bought a washing machine

115
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
It's Yongan

116
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,960
I can't use it anymore

117
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
I feel quite uncomfortable

118
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
Then my family thinks

119
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
I'm old

120
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,960
How can I be unhappy for so long?

121
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,960
I always wanted to get what I wanted when I was a child

122
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
But I only have what I want

123
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,960
And you have never heard of this

124
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
Who owns will lose

125
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
Then you will feel better

126
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
死了

127
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
viable

128
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,160
So in the end you just repaid

129
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,960
with my friend

130
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
I will just go out

131
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,960
You just get the little lories

132
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,960
How much younger someone is

133
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,960
I can just sleep

134
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,160
I have enough

135
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,560
I can die

136
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,440
Kris, look at me.

137
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,600
I quit.

138
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,360
What's wrong with your hand?

139
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,200
When I was young, it was impossible to keep up with exciting girl's season.

140
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,080
Besides, you are soens.

141
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,200
Un pistol hasבהou Seouln Transit Identification

142
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,320
Please call all the police once.

143
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,920
I could be brought out by 10005 tax郊

144
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,500
I could be brought out by 30005 tax郊

145
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,680
I could be brought out by 10005 tax郊

146
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:23,460
the

147
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:23,500
a

148
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,700
Blah

149
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,560
Maybe I can make him trust me

150
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
Second brother, please

151
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,560
This is the white pot that Shen family just sent

152
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,560
I've always said I want to invite you, but you always invite me

153
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
This is a pleasure

154
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Good

155
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,560
To be honest, I have something to ask you today

156
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,560
Brother, you know it doesn't matter

157
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,560
I want to invite you to meet the princess

158
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,560
You are not making things difficult for me

159
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,560
You know that I'm friends with the princess

160
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,560
Why are you going to help the princess?

161
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,560
Actually, I'm sorry

162
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,560
I have something important to ask the princess for help

163
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,560
But I have to invite the second brother, I'm afraid this will be done successfully

164
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,560
I really have no other way

165
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,560
If the second brother is willing to help me, I will do my best

166
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
No problem

167
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,560
Please, second brother

168
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,560
All right

169
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Actually, we have known each other since we met

170
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,560
But you always helped me a lot

171
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
I owe you

172
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
Answer you

173
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,560
Brother, although we have known each other for a long time

174
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560
But I am willing to come out

175
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
You seem to have some secrets

176
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,560
Don't worry, I won't ask you

177
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,560
You will need help in the future

178
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,560
I can't help you, but I will help you with your friend

179
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Thank you, I don't need to do this

180
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
Your Highness

181
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
Your Highness

182
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,560
Pei Lang is here, please sit

183
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
Pei Lang is good at chess

184
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
I'm a little good at chess, but I'm not good at chess

185
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,560
Your Highness, you just let me play chess

186
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
One more game

187
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,560
The winner can ask the loser a question, how about it?

188
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,560
Okay

189
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Okay

190
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
I lost

191
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,560
According to the rules, I can ask you a question

192
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Your Highness, please ask

193
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
Please ask Pei Lang, does Pei Lang like

194
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
Li Nudu or Xi Cui

195
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,560
Li Nudu

196
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
Next sentence

197
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
That's all

198
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
Just ask this

199
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,560
Actually, when I was a child, I raised Li Nudu

200
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,560
Because my second sister was lost by my cousin

201
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,560
But my cousin didn't want to apologize to me for this

202
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,560
In his eyes, my second sister is like me

203
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
No one is important

204
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
From now on, I will make a bet

205
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
I must win

206
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
But I am too self-righteous

207
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Slowly

208
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
I also accept my own friend

209
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
But

210
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
But I can't find my second sister again

211
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,560
I accept

212
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
I admit to my father

213
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
Your Highness, please ask

214
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
Please ask Pei Lang

215
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,560
Who is the most cherished person in the world?

216
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
It's my mother

217
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,560
My mother didn't want me to grow up when my grandfather died

218
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
I swore on the first day of my self-reliance

219
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,560
I want to take her to Beijing to live with me when I grow up

220
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
But these years

221
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
They never let me grow up

222
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
I'm willing to give up

223
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
I'm going to get married

224
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
Who is the most hated person?

225
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
That's enough

226
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,560
For example, my cousin who lost his second sister

227
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
My cousin who lost his second sister

228
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
My cousin who lost his second sister

229
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
My cousin who lost his second sister

230
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
Anyway, I have a lot

231
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
I said it all

232
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,560
Pei Lang has been talking about big things since he was a child

233
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,560
We all know about big things

234
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
Let's ask Pei Lang

235
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,560
Have you ever regretted it?

236
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Of course

237
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,560
For example, the market of Qixi

238
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
I don't know

239
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
I don't know

240
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,560
I don't know

241
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
I don't know

242
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
No, no, no

243
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,560
Please forgive me

244
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
Please forgive me

245
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
Why didn't I win?

246
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
I really won, didn't I?

247
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
Congratulations, Pei Lang

248
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,560
I'll ask Pei Lang a question

249
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
Then I'll ask

250
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
The princess just asked me a question

251
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
What's wrong with the song

252
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Did you regret it?

253
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,560
I regret marrying Li Ruoxin to Xiaolong

254
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
Things have not been as good as before

255
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
As a princess

256
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,560
I don't regret it

257
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,560
But as Li Ruoxin

258
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,560
I don't feel good

259
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,560
For my own good

260
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
For Uncle Xiao

261
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
To be able to help my brother

262
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,560
Marry me to Xiaolong

263
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,560
Xiaolong has his own account

264
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,560
We are a poor couple

265
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,560
The marriage is not enough

266
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
He was so full

267
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,560
I could have killed him

268
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,560
But I think he's a poor man

269
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
From then on, he has been living a good life

270
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
Day and night

271
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Take care of a person who is not awake

272
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,560
He can't be released

273
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
I didn't expect it to be so late

274
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,560
Pei Lang, why don't you have dinner before you go?

275
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,560
Forget it

276
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,560
I'm sorry

277
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
I can stay in this house alone

278
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,560
Why do you need Pei Lang to accompany me?

279
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,560
Your Highness

280
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,560
I'll have dinner before I go

281
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Is it good?

282
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,560
Thank you, Young Master Lin

283
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,560
Last night, I had a good talk with Pei Lang

284
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
Last night

285
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
Young Master

286
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,560
The things before the payment

287
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
The new number is stored here

288
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
The new number is stored here

289
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:35,920
The

290
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,560
How come

291
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,560
Your Highness

292
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,560
The phone on the river is ringing

293
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,560
The patient is in a critical condition

294
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
There is a suspicious person in front

295
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,560
It seems that the thief just stole the food

296
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,560
The guards in the house are very suspicious

297
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,560
The Prince Consort was wearing the key with him

298
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
After the accident

299
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,560
The key is also gone

300
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
Is the Prince Consort awake?

301
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,560
I was scared to death

302
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
I thought I really liked it

303
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,560
I didn't mean that

304
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
I also hope that the Prince Consort can recover soon

305
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,560
Your Highness

306
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
The Prince Consort is in the house

307
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,560
The thief is in the house

308
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,560
I dare to commit crimes in the house

309
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,560
If I catch him, I have to hide him

310
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
Guards, go to the capital to report

311
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
Your Highness

312
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,560
The Prince Consort is already here

313
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,560
No need to go to the capital to save him

314
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,560
Yes

315
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
Your Highness

316
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
There is a thief in the house

317
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,560
Why didn't this thief go to the gold and silver jewelry?

318
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
Only took the Prince Consort's toothbrush

319
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,560
What is he doing with it?

320
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,560
It's different from the Prince Consort

321
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,560
It's different from others

322
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,560
Has the Prince Consort been in danger recently?

323
00:11:46,560 --> 00:12:10,540
Since the time of the

324
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,540
White hair

325
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,540
It's really hard to make up for it

326
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,540
The next person is also a flower

327
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,540
The best is the boss

328
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,540
If you finish eating, you will be in heaven

329
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,540
The first cat is Su Shiyi

330
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,540
What kind of fresh stuff is this?

331
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,540
It's so interesting

332
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
Your Highness

333
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
This is a newly developed snack by a famous woman

334
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,520
It's called a rock candy gourd

335
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,520
Rock candy gourd?

336
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,520
This is a candy

337
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
It's made of sugar

338
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,520
It can turn sugar into ice and thin

339
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
And it's rich in ginseng

340
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
Your Highness, it's good that you like it

341
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,520
Ginseng is good for your skin

342
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
Rock candy is a good way to get rid of the cold

343
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,520
We plan to make more flowers

344
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Buy it at the store outside the hall

345
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
If you like it, I'll walk down

346
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
Okay

347
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,520
Your Highness

348
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
Did you find anything?

349
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
The handkerchief on the wooden box

350
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
7 inches wide and 3 inches wide

351
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,520
The culprit is a man

352
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,520
Height 60

353
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
The man in the house is 60 cm tall

354
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,520
Less than 60 cm

355
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,520
The princess is not afraid of the situation

356
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,520
The thief in the mansion

357
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,520
Destroyed a wooden box of the prince

358
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,520
Steal things inside

359
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,520
I locked the yard door for the thief

360
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
Gather everyone together

361
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
No one is serving now

362
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,520
I'm afraid it won't go for a while

363
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
It's okay

364
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
We're happy that the princess likes our food

365
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,520
But I just heard from the young master

366
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,520
There are a dozen suspects

367
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
This is not easy to calculate

368
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,520
Is there a fingerprint on the wooden box except for the fingerprint?

369
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,520
Fingerprint?

370
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,520
What is this for?

371
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
Your Highness

372
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,520
The princess is going to fingerprint

373
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,520
The previous dynasty had already found

374
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,520
The fingerprints on each person's fingers

375
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,360
There are screws and

376
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,520
The contract documents are also printed and pressed

377
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
The fingerprint can be identified

378
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
Everyone's identity

379
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
You just said that the wooden box has not been touched for a long time

380
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
You didn't see the lock on it after you were found

381
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
The fingerprints on it

382
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,520
It must be the same person

383
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
I have it

384
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,520
Today the crown prince suddenly came to visit

385
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,520
Wei Zhou全部

386
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,520
Close the garden for the time being

387
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
The eldest princess thinks that everyone is not changing

388
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,520
The beauty is always in the past

389
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,520
Come on

390
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,520
The prince is still in the past

391
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,520
Please give me a fingerprint

392
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,520
I'll go to the prince

393
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,520
Li Sheng

394
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,520
Yes

395
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
Li Sheng

396
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
Yes

397
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
Wei Da Wang

398
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,520
Yes

399
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,520
The crown prince ordered a public service

400
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,520
Can't come today

401
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,520
The door is open

402
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
Please make yourself at home

403
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,520
Your Highness

404
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,520
The fingerprint is different

405
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
The fingerprint is fake

406
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,520
I am

407
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
I am the one who stole it from the box of the fingerprint

408
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
I stole it from the box of the fingerprint

409
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
After you arrived at the palace

410
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Immediately leave the princess's mansion

411
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
I am also worried about someone's enterprise

412
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,520
I plan to take the afternoon train to go out

413
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
Even the princess of the city

414
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,520
The prince arrived at noon

415
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
I closed the garden door

416
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
I have been hiding the fingerprint

417
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
The door of the kitchen is open

418
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
I'm going back to the dormitory

419
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
The crown prince's certificate is here

420
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
No matter

421
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,520
But the crown prince is usually in the mood

422
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
I can't say it out in the garden

423
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,520
It's not the same

424
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
The prince

425
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
The prince

426
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
The prince

427
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,520
The prince

428
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
The prince

429
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
The prince

430
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,520
The prince

431
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
The prince

432
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
The prince

433
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,520
Probably

434
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:56,400
It seems that he already released the

435
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
gas

436
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,400
If I leave it here

437
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
It's really making a mistake

438
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,400
In addition, someone sent aidade

439
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,220
I door

440
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,220
Open it

441
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,220
This is the room

442
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,220
Look at his villa

443
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,220
Let's go

444
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,220
Why is there something written on this part?

445
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,220
It seems that the things on the top of the little fox are all cleaned up

446
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,220
But it is very far away, so it is not clean

447
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,220
It is still possible to see the appearance of the self on it

448
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,220
The most interesting thing

449
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,220
What is it?

450
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,220
Things are quiet

451
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,220
It's a foreign cat

452
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,220
I can't see it

453
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,220
So you have to go to the second floor

454
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,220
The original location

455
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,220
One line, one sentence

456
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,220
What are you doing?

457
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,220
Second floor, second floor

458
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,220
Does the second floor have a good friend?

459
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,220
Yes

460
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,220
There is no bell in the second floor

461
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,220
There is definitely a good friend

462
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,220
I asked this person

463
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,220
The brother of the second aunt's son and the second aunt's brother

464
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,220
He said that 20 years ago

465
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,220
Zhao Xuzhi is the master of Jing Zhao

466
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,220
Zhao Xuzhi

467
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,220
This is a washing machine

468
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,220
I don't need you to help me verify the identity of the criminal

469
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,220
I will go to the police station to return the things

470
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,220
I have to thank you

471
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,220
I want to give you a present

472
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,220
Washing machine

473
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,220
What kind of thing is that?

474
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,220
You know what? I'll draw it for you

475
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,220
There is a tube here

476
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,220
You can drink water by yourself

477
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,220
There is a tube here to drain water

478
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,220
There is a water flow here

479
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,220
You can wash yourself

480
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,220
You really did it

481
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,220
I just said it casually

482
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,220
That night, you didn't say too much

483
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,220
I thought about going

484
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,220
I still don't know if I can let him drive

485
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,220
I had to suddenly make a request

486
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,220
I made a hand-pulled gun

487
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,220
Do you want to try it?

488
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,220
I took a few glasses from the hall

489
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,220
This is water

490
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,220
This is water

491
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,220
This is water

492
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,220
You really can't wash it

493
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,220
Of course

494
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,220
It took a long time to lock the machine, right?

495
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,220
Didn't it take a long time to lock the machine?

496
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,220
No, it's a good thing

497
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,220
I'm sorry

498
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,220
Is this a washing machine?

499
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,220
No, it's for the rescue

500
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,220
It's not related to the wound

501
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,220
It's related to the washing machine

502
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,220
Please call the young master

503
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,220
And do it yourself

504
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,220
Yes, I won't bother you

505
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,220
Shao Wang

506
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,220
Are you happy?

507
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,220
How many people are there?

508
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,220
I don't sleep, I don't

509
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,220
Not a single one

510
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,220
Not a single one, I never

511
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,220
Wait, how fast is the back wheel?

512
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,220
I'm coming

513
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,220
I really like you

514
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,220
Do I really like you?

515
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,220
What did you say?

516
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,220
No

517
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,220
What are you doing?

518
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,220
Chen Yangze

519
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,220
Chen Yangze

520
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,220
Chen Yangze is not here

521
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,220
Hurry up, hurry up

522
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,220
Don't let him in

523
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,220
Uncle, young master

524
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,220
Why are you here?

525
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,220
It's midnight

526
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,220
Shouldn't you rest?

527
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,220
Shen Yangze is in the water

528
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,220
I'll come and see

529
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,220
How is he?

530
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,220
It's okay, it's okay

531
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,220
I just don't know how to get water

532
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,220
Besides, the water in the water tank is not yet filled

533
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,220
I can't get it

534
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,220
Why would I fall into the water?

535
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,220
If it's convenient, I'll take the young master to have a look

536
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,220
It's not convenient

537
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,220
It's really not convenient

538
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,220
Chang'an is like the fifth house

539
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,220
The people of the fifth house

540
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,220
The fifth house

541
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,220
Excuse me, is this Du Daliang?

542
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,220
Little sister

543
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,220
Little sister

544
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,220
Here we are

545
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,220
The third house in the third house of Anye school

546
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,220
Du Daliang said that the previous house was a big one

547
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,220
But it's okay

548
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,220
This house is bigger, better, more spacious

549
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,220
How about it?

550
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,220
It's really big

551
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,220
It's pretty big

552
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,220
You are really beautiful

553
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,220
Beautiful

554
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,220
That's right

555
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,220
That's right

556
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,220
Where is the big guy?

557
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,220
Who is the big guy?

558
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,220
Where is the big guy?

559
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,220
Come here

560
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,220
You are a cheater, aren't you?

561
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
You are a cheater, aren't you?

562
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,220
You said you didn't know

563
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,220
I don't know what's going on

564
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,220
You have a brain

565
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,220
Do you have the right to see it yourself?

566
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,220
Those days, I didn't even fix the windows

567
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,220
Why can't I see it?

568
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,220
You didn't even see it

569
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,220
You gave me the money

570
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,220
I'm sorry, young master

571
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,220
Mom

572
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,220
Why are you laughing?

573
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,220
It's just that it looks like it

574
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,220
But why is it the same as mom?

575
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,220
I don't know either

576
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,220
But it's really not

577
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,220
I haven't checked it

578
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,220
So you are because

579
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,220
He and mom look very similar

580
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,220
That's why it was cheated

581
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,220
Young master, we have a little group

582
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,220
But Yang Yang is a kid

583
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,220
I don't know if young master

584
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,220
What did you say to Yang Yang?

585
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,220
But this is too dangerous

586
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,220
He didn't do it

587
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,220
You think I'm using Yang Yang

588
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,220
I believe young master is not such a person

589
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,220
But if you don't have any such thoughts

590
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,220
Why did you bring him back to tell us this?

591
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,220
You think so

592
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,220
No

593
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,220
I

594
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,220
It's like this

595
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,220
Yang Yang is not my child

596
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,220
I don't understand what I say

597
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,220
So I brought him back to see you

598
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,220
You stand in my way

599
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,220
If he has this suggestion, I understand you

600
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,220
Then I'm not a person

601
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,220
I'm sorry

602
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,220
I didn't think enough

603
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,220
It's just that I'm afraid of you

604
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,220
I have that feeling

605
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,220
I'm afraid of you

606
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,220
I'm afraid of you

607
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,220
I have that feeling

608
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,220
Okay, three, two, one

609
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,220
Three, two, one

610
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,220
It's a good tool

611
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,220
Is it good?

612
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,220
I'm not sure

613
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,220
It's a good tool

614
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,220
Three, two, one

615
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:57,220
You have to decorate your

616
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,220
You understand me

617
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,220
You understand me

618
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,220
You understand me

619
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,220
You are the old master

620
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,220
You know

621
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,220
You know

622
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,220
You know

623
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,220
You know
