1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,420
There we go 18 Wait recipe

2
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,420
Yangyang, today is your first day of school.

3
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,420
You must learn well.

4
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,420
Ta-da!

5
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,420
So beautiful!

6
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,420
Your aunt made this for you this morning.

7
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,420
It's called Dingsheng cake.

8
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,420
It's easy to paint.

9
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,420
You're a great grandma.

10
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,420
I was late and you scolded me again.

11
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,420
I said I'd have breakfast on the way,

12
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,420
but I was late.

13
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,420
No, you have to say no.

14
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,420
No, you have to say no.

15
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,420
She said she could change her temper.

16
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,420
I don't think so.

17
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,420
Grandpa, do you think after coming to Yongan,

18
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,420
everyone has changed?

19
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,420
What's different?

20
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,420
My dad has fans.

21
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,420
Grandpa, you're a chef.

22
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,420
Your aunt has become more powerful than before.

23
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,420
I have a good school.

24
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,420
But grandma, she seems to be the same as before.

25
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,420
I don't know what grandma likes.

26
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,420
Do you know?

27
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,420
Yes.

28
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,420
Here we are.

29
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,420
We've arrived.

30
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,420
Go inside by yourself.

31
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,420
OK.

32
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,420
Find something to eat.

33
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,420
Goodbye, Grandpa!

34
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,420
You gotta watch your heads!

35
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,420
What a lucky boy!

36
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:24,120
tea

37
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,420
Slow down.

38
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,660
Fengxiang!

39
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,220
Catch it!

40
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,980
The box!

41
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,860
Shen Qianshe, what are you doing?

42
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,460
What is this?

43
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,820
This is called the carriage box.

44
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,180
It's a lock for the carriage.

45
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,860
You can just understand it as a key.

46
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,460
I'm telling you, this is not a normal key.

47
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,420
This is the most luxurious and luxurious carriage in Yongan City.

48
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,220
Shen Qianshe, how old are you?

49
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,820
And you're doing this dangerous thing.

50
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,740
You're not afraid of falling.

51
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,140
You think you're a dragon?

52
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,700
What do you want?

53
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,700
I just want to give you a surprise.

54
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,100
I've been thinking about it for a while.

55
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,980
I found out that our family has changed.

56
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,300
It's different from before.

57
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,500
Our family has successfully entered the upper social class of Yongan City.

58
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,460
Boss Liu of Guixiang House,

59
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:00,460
he looks up to me and helps me to open the shop next door.

60
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,620
We can live here from now on.

61
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,020
In short, everything is developing in the right direction.

62
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,140
Only you didn't share my happiness.

63
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,980
So you're in a bad mood.

64
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,100
You're not in a good mood.

65
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,300
You can understand.

66
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,420
What do you want to say?

67
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,260
In the past, when we were poor, we didn't have money.

68
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,860
You can't buy anything you want.

69
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,220
You work hard all day long.

70
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,740
You have to work in the shop and you're tired.

71
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,700
Now it's different.

72
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,420
I just came back from the horse shop.

73
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:35,300
I bought you a four-wheeled, spacious, luxurious carriage as your exclusive.

74
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,740
And I officially announce that you don't have to work in the shop.

75
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,260
I'll hire two guys for you.

76
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,180
I'll hire...

77
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,980
No, not two guys.

78
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,060
Four guys.

79
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,020
You don't have to do anything.

80
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,540
You just have to do what they do.

81
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,860
From now on, your task is to ride the big carriage I bought for you.

82
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,420
You can go around Yongan City.

83
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,260
You can buy whatever you want.

84
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,060
You can buy a lot of things.

85
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,860
You can buy whatever you want.

86
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,620
You'll feel better when you see something.

87
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,140
You'll feel better.

88
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,540
You won't be so angry.

89
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,540
You won't be so angry.

90
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,140
Are you not going to scold me?

91
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,980
What?

92
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,620
Shen Jianshe.

93
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,460
You think I'm angry because you didn't make money before?

94
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,780
Of course.

95
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,780
Come on!

96
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:21,860
Don't move!

97
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,580
Are you okay?

98
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,340
Don't move!

99
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,700
I'm so handsome.

100
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,860
Can you help me?

101
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,860
I've bought you such a big carriage.

102
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,860
Can't you help me?

103
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,180
You have to make it clear.

104
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,180
What's the reason for my temper?

105
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,700
How do I know why you have a bad temper?

106
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,140
I've asked myself this question thousands of times.

107
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,660
You've always been like this.

108
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,060
You always come up when I say something wrong.

109
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,140
You have a bad temper when you're in love.

110
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,260
You have a bad temper when you're married.

111
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,580
You still have a bad temper when you're married.

112
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,980
You only hit me, pinched me, scolded me, and kicked me.

113
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,380
What else do you know?

114
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,180
Okay.

115
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,620
I'm a man.

116
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,020
I have dignity.

117
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,900
I'm under a lot of pressure.

118
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,220
You can't feel bad for me.

119
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,140
Besides, I've succeeded.

120
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,700
I have fans.

121
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,460
Why can't you just let me be?

122
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,460
Why can't you be nice to me?

123
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,540
This is the most luxurious carriage in Yongan City.

124
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,540
It's small.

125
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,460
The sky is like a poor stove, covered in four directions.

126
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,340
The earth is like a chessboard, round and round.

127
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,940
The sky is like a chessboard, round and round.

128
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,140
The sky is like a chessboard, round and round.

129
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,140
The earth is like a chessboard, round and round.

130
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:05,140
Everything in the world is in line with this order.

131
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,140
Only then...

132
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,140
Only then can we live together.

133
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,140
You, teach him.

134
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,140
Mr. Xie Xiao.

135
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,140
Mr. Xie Xiao.

136
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,140
What did you think?

137
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,140
You said the sky is like a poor stove.

138
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,140
The sky is like a poor stove?

139
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,140
That's not right.

140
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,140
How can the sky be round?

141
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,140
How can the earth be square?

142
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,140
We live on the earth.

143
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,140
The sky is the atmosphere.

144
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,140
The earth is the ground we step on.

145
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,140
The sky and the earth are all round.

146
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,140
How can it be square?

147
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,140
What earth, atmosphere, nonsense.

148
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,140
Mr. Shen Xiao.

149
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,140
The sky, the earth and the ground are all round.

150
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,140
The sky, the earth and the ground.

151
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,140
You guys are reading too little.

152
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,140
Mr. Shen Xiao.

153
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,140
What is the evidence of your theory of the Golden Age?

154
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,140
Students, teacher, have you ever raised a cat?

155
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,140
Cats like to put things on the ground.

156
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,140
If the ground is square,

157
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,140
then the cats in the world would have put everything on the ground.

158
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,140
The sky and the earth are round.

159
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,140
We live in a ball.

160
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,140
So the cats didn't mess up the things.

161
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,140
It's the earth.

162
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,140
Enough.

163
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,140
Be quiet.

164
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,140
Mr. Shen Xiao, please sit.

165
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,140
What does he mean?

166
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,140
What does he mean?

167
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,140
If it wasn't for the fact that you treated me like a dog,

168
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,140
I would never have taken you in.

169
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,140
It would be troublesome for a lady to come in.

170
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,140
But you love your daughter very much.

171
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,140
I admire you very much.

172
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,140
That's why I let you go.

173
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,140
You're a child.

174
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,140
You need to be taught.

175
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,140
Since her father is not here,

176
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:34,140
I have to ask the lady to come and talk to you.

177
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,140
Yes, you're right.

178
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,140
So Yang Yang...

179
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,140
It's good that Yang Yang dares to say it.

180
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,140
But in this world,

181
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,140
there are many people who are in danger.

182
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,140
The family must take the responsibility of the governor.

183
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,140
So that the evil will come.

184
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,140
I thought it was Yang Yang who caused trouble.

185
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:07,140
I thought you were going to tell me to come and talk to me.

186
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,140
Yang Yang is a good cat.

187
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,140
He's born with a good nature.

188
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,140
If you can correct it,

189
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,140
you will have a good future.

190
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,140
Really?

191
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,140
You must keep your mind.

192
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,140
You must be consistent.

193
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,140
Fu Zi is different from what I thought.

194
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,140
How do you say it?

195
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,140
Fu Zi is born to be a Fu Zi.

196
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,140
But he can be a Fu Zi in the Hongwen Hall where the Crown Prince studied.

197
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,140
I think he's still studying outside the school.

198
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,140
It's more important to practice.

199
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,140
In this world,

200
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,140
it's better than a person who knows everything.

201
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,140
I also often wish for a life.

202
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,140
To have a life in this world is one or two fates.

203
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,140
Fu Zi.

204
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,140
My family is in the 14th floor.

205
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,140
I want to thank you for the meal.

206
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,140
Please come and see me.

207
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,140
I won't disturb you.

208
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,140
As a teacher,

209
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,140
it's my duty to teach students.

210
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,140
I won't disturb you.

211
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,140
14th floor is fixing the building and taking care of the guests.

212
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,140
Our family really wants you to come.

213
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,140
Fu Zi, please look at the environment.

214
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:39,140
It's convenient to know how to educate Yang Yang in the future.

215
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,140
Since it's like that,

216
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,140
then it's good.

217
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,140
Thank you, Lady Shen.

218
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,140
Thank you, Fu Zi.

219
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,140
Thank you, Fu Zi.

220
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,140
What kind of person is Zhao Xun?

221
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,140
He's a man of his word.

222
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,140
You're doing this for me.

223
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,140
Just for me.

224
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,140
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,140
But it's too risky to invite Zhao Xun to dinner.

226
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,140
He's already invited.

227
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,140
The risk is too high.

228
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,140
You'd better not waste this opportunity.

229
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,140
How can I afford it?

230
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,140
Young Master, why are you so sad?

231
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,140
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,140
I'm sorry.

233
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,140
I'm sorry.

234
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,140
Young Master, why are you saying this?

235
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,140
You helped us a lot before.

236
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,140
We have to pay it back.

237
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,140
We can't count on that.

238
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,140
Why can't we?

239
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,140
Young Master has been loyal for many times.

240
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,140
Can we afford it?

241
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,140
This time it's different.

242
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,140
This time it's your loyalty.

243
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,140
But I...

244
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,140
You want to find out the truth.

245
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,140
We want to help you.

246
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,140
There's a chance to test him.

247
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,140
Isn't it good?

248
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,140
If he has a problem,

249
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,140
it's better to find out the truth.

250
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,140
But I really like Master Zhao.

251
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,140
He doesn't scold me.

252
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,140
He's reasonable.

253
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,140
I like to go to the Red Library.

254
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,140
Such a good teacher.

255
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,140
Is he a bad person?

256
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,140
Let's drink together.

257
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,140
To Master Zhao.

258
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,140
To Master Zhao.

259
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,140
Come on.

260
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,140
All the people are here.

261
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,140
Let me toast you.

262
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,140
Come on, Master.

263
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,140
Let me pour you this.

264
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,140
Thank you.

265
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,140
Let me toast you again.

266
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,140
Okay.

267
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,140
Please.

268
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,140
Please.

269
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,140
Thank you.

270
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,140
Thank you.

271
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,140
Thank you.

272
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,140
Master, come on.

273
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,140
Let me toast you.

274
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,140
Thank you for taking care of Yangyang.

275
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,140
Thank you so much.

276
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,140
You're welcome.

277
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,140
Let me toast you.

278
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,140
Okay.

279
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,140
Master, you're so good.

280
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,140
The ingredients.

281
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,140
Good wine.

282
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,140
Master, my parents are all toasting you.

283
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,140
I have to follow you.

284
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,140
Come on.

285
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,140
Okay.

286
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,140
Sit down.

287
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,140
Sit down.

288
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,140
Okay.

289
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,140
Okay.

290
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,140
You're so good.

291
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,140
Master.

292
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,140
Yangyang, I'm learning from you.

293
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,140
Don't worry.

294
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,140
I'm not.

295
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,140
Let me toast you again.

296
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,140
Come on.

297
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,140
Hurry up.

298
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,140
I just did some things that I can't do.

299
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,140
Cheers.

300
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,140
Cheers.

301
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,140
Yangyang is so naughty.

302
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,140
He must have put a lot of effort into it.

303
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,140
He is a good student.

304
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,140
He is patient and loving.

305
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,140
We really don't know how to thank you.

306
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,140
Yes.

307
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,140
Let me toast you again.

308
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,140
Okay.

309
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,140
Thank you.

310
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,140
Who is it?

311
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,140
Mr. Cui?

312
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,140
Young Master.

313
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,140
Your clothes look like Mr. Cui's.

314
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,140
Mr. Cui?

315
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,140
Who is Cui?

316
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,140
Is he your old friend?

317
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,140
Sit down.

318
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,140
I have a question.

319
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,140
I want to ask you a favor.

320
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,140
Okay.

321
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,140
I heard about your hometown.

322
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,140
Please tell me.

323
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,140
Liji.

324
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,140
Liji.

325
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,140
Liji.

326
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,140
Liji has a long history.

327
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,140
It's a long history.

328
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,140
What do you want to know?

329
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,140
I want to know if you were a Liji.

330
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,140
Who are you?

331
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,140
I'm a young master of Qing and Zhao.

332
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,140
I'm a man of no name.

333
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,140
I'm a man of no name.

334
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,140
17 years ago, the Yongan case was closed.

335
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,140
Someone changed the statement and the case was closed.

336
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,140
I want to know

337
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,140
if that person

338
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,140
wanted to do this himself

339
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,140
or was forced by someone

340
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,140
and became a Liji.

341
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,140
Liji.

342
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,140
What is it?

343
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,140
Watch it!

344
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,140
Sit at present!

345
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,140
Liji!

346
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,140
Liji moved from 15 years!

347
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,500
Liji,

348
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,140
Black Fang came!

349
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,140
Liji,

350
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,140
Black Fang came!

351
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,140
Would you request

352
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,140
what my son only wanted?

353
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,140
Is it new?

354
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,140
Too soon.

355
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,140
Too soon to make my father afraid.

356
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:59,140
So, one day I might have to send him to be with you.

357
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,140
I'm sorry for him.

358
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,140
Father, you'd better care more about the living.

359
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,140
Lin Yan has found Zhao Xunzhi.

360
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,140
Zhao Xunzhi values his reputation the most.

361
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:41,140
Once you miss something, you can't turn back.

362
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,140
If Bao Shuya recommends Guan Zhong to do something different,

363
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,140
and Guan Zhong kills Bao Shuya,

364
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,140
he will not say anything.

365
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:59,140
But if Guan Zhong thinks that father is not the Qi Huanggong he wants to achieve,

366
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,140
and he turns into Chengyin,

367
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,140
and he is willing to sacrifice himself for the Zhao family,

368
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,140
what will father do?

369
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,140
Zhao Xunzhi has been in the Shen family for ten times.

370
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,140
He hasn't returned yet.

371
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,140
Then let Ju Xianxiang's face move.

372
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,140
Let's go.

373
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,140
Zhao Xunzhi has agreed to testify.

374
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,140
You can rest assured.

375
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:03,140
I don't think it will go so well.

376
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,140
Young Master, bad news!

377
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,140
Yingying?

378
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,140
What's wrong?

379
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,140
Master Zhao is not coming to class.

380
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,140
He is missing.

381
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,140
He is missing?

382
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,140
Young Master,

383
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,140
the news from the workshop says

384
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,140
Zhao Xunzhi has submitted a letter to the South Ming County.

385
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,140
It is reported that he will return.

386
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,140
He just disappeared from Yongan.

387
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,140
It will take three or five days to get to the South Ming County.

388
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,140
How could it be possible?

389
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,140
He is missing.

390
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,140
He is missing.

391
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,140
It will take three or five days to get to the South Ming County.

392
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,140
How could it be possible?

393
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,140
Zhao Xunzhi is old.

394
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,140
His parents are missing.

395
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,140
He is missing.

396
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,140
He is missing.

397
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,140
He is missing.

398
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,140
Young Master,

399
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,140
there are some things

400
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,140
that we cannot talk about now.

401
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,140
Go to the South Ming County.

402
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,140
Find Zhao Xunzhi.

403
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,140
We must see him alive.

404
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,140
We must see him dead.

405
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,140
Yes.

406
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,140
Go.

407
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,140
Come on.

408
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,140
Get up.

409
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,140
Come on.

410
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,140
Come on.

411
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,140
Come on.

412
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,140
Thank you.

413
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,140
Thank you.

414
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,140
I'm sorry.

415
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,140
Can you stop blaming yourself?

416
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,140
I...

417
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,140
I didn't do anything wrong.

418
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,140
I'm still trying to figure out a solution.

419
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,140
I was waiting for you.

420
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,140
I thought you wouldn't come.

421
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,140
So I...

422
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,140
I ordered some food.

423
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,140
I'm a little hungry.

424
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,140
Grandma asked me to bring the food.

425
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,140
Who knew that I wouldn't knock at the door?

426
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,140
That's why I was late for half an hour.

427
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,140
Yang Yang.

428
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,140
I'm leaving.

429
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,140
Thank you.

430
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,140
But Shao Ying still doesn't look too good.

431
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,140
A letter from last night.

432
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,140
King Zhao knows that Yang Yang is in the Red House.

433
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,140
He said that Zhao Xunzhi is a man of steel and a good teacher.

434
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:07,140
He's pretending not to know that Zhao Xunzhi is missing.

435
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,140
He even wrote a letter to show him.

436
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,140
He's so arrogant.

437
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,140
What does he want?

438
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,140
Sir!

439
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,140
Sir!

440
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,140
How is it?

441
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:26,140
Zhao Xunzhi has never shown himself after he returned to Nanming.

442
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,140
He never married a girl.

443
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,140
He doesn't have any relatives.

444
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,140
But those people don't know what they've done.

445
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,140
They're just trying to kill him.

446
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,140
He's just not willing to show himself.

447
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,140
I doubt...

448
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,140
I doubt that he's already...

449
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,140
He's not as violent as he used to be.

450
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,140
Okay, we'll beat the one who's the worst.

451
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,140
Just like how we beat that bad guy.

452
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,140
Sir!

453
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,140
Why are you starting?

454
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,140
You're starting too.

455
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,140
I'm not.

456
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,140
I'm not.

457
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,140
I'm not.

458
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,140
Don't break it.

459
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,140
I'm not?

460
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,140
I'm not!

461
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,140
You're pretty good.

462
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,140
Is it easy to break things?

463
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,140
I'm not.

464
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,140
I'm not.

465
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,140
I'm not.

466
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,140
I'm not.

467
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,140
Are you feeling better now?

468
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,140
Much better.

469
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,140
Don't worry.

470
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,140
I'm not.

471
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,140
You'll find a way out when you get over your emotions.

472
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,820
I used to be like this.

473
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,380
Better be a better man,

474
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,900
you won't earn anything in life.

475
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,460
Let me help you,oshina.

476
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,220
Chef An.

477
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,740
Let me help you,honey.

478
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:50,780
Ok.

479
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,180
No worries.

480
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,020
Küra…

481
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,060
Don't worry.

482
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,500
I have done it already.

483
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,500
Young Master.

484
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,500
I can't help it.

485
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,500
Yangyang, tell me.

486
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,500
Who would want a good man to stay in the yard during the New Year?

487
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,500
Cut bread and cakes.

488
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,500
I can't help it.

489
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
I really can't help it.

490
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,500
Young Master, you have to go too.

491
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,500
Aunt, did we prepare new clothes for him?

492
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,500
Okay.

493
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,500
I'll go.

494
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
12 eggplants.

495
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,500
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

496
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
Carrots.

497
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,500
12 cabbage.

498
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
Aunt, how could you say that?

499
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,500
I'm just concerned about the mess.

500
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,500
How could I think that you are that kind of person?

501
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,500
I am you, but you are not.

502
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,500
Forget it.

503
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,500
I know what you mean.

504
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,500
It's good that you don't mind.

505
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
I can't help it.

506
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,500
Cabbage.

507
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
Young Master, you have to go too.

508
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,500
Aunt, I'll make you new clothes.

509
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,500
How is it?

510
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,500
I'll go.

511
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,500
I'll go.

512
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,500
It's okay.

513
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,500
I can do it.

514
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,500
I'll make it a name.

515
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
I'll be famous.

516
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,500
I can't help it.

517
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,500
Congratulations!

518
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500
Congratulations!

519
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,500
I'm leaving.

520
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
See you later.

521
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,500
See you later.

522
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,500
See you later.

523
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,500
What is this?

524
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
This is a necklace.

525
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,500
A necklace?

526
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,500
The new year is coming.

527
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,500
I wish you a happy new year.

528
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,500
I wish you a happy new year.

529
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,500
May you have a good business.

530
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
Thank you.

531
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
See you later.

532
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,500
Happy new year!

533
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,500
Okay.

534
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,500
Happy new year!

535
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Happy new year!

536
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
Here comes the good news.

537
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
Thank you, Aunt.

538
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
What is this?

539
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,500
What is this?

540
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,500
I'll tell you.

541
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,500
A coin?

542
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,500
Yes.

543
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,500
We'll wrap the coin in the dumplings.

544
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:17,500
Whoever eats this dumpling will have a good life.

545
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,500
What about the rest?

546
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,500
The rest is up to each person.

547
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Wrap it all up.

548
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,500
It will look good when you eat it.

549
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,500
I heard that Miss Shen went to the countryside to buy some food.

550
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
She's going to eat New Year's Eve dinner.

551
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,500
Why hasn't she come back?

552
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,500
Right.

553
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,500
Qi said she'll be back in five days.

554
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,500
Why hasn't she come back?

555
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
I was thinking, if she doesn't come back tomorrow,

556
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,500
I'll ask her grandpa to look for her.

557
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,500
Right.

558
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,500
Where did she go to buy food?

559
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,500
I'll go look for her now.

560
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
No need to bother.

561
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,500
Qi must know something.

562
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,500
She'll be back tomorrow.

563
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,500
Mom, listen.

564
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
Look, she's back.

565
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,500
Miss Shen is back.

566
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,500
I'm back.

567
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,500
You're back.

568
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,500
What's this?

569
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,500
It's so mysterious.

570
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,500
Let me see.

571
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,500
Isn't this the Chinese New Year's Eve dinner?

572
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,500
You went to Qingyang?

573
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,500
I happened to pass by Qingyang when I was in the goods.

574
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,500
People in Qingyang eat Chinese New Year's Eve dumplings.

575
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,500
It's nice to meet you.

576
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,500
I'm Qi.

577
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,500
I'm Qi.

578
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,500
Are you a Chinese?

579
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,500
Yes.

580
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,500
We haven't eaten for years.

581
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,500
There's a lot of food outside.

582
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,500
Yuan, help me with the dishes.

583
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,500
Miss Shen,

584
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,500
did anyone else know that you went to Qingyang?

585
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,500
Did anyone stop you from checking the food?

586
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
Did anyone suspicious follow you?

587
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,500
Don't worry.

588
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,500
I was very careful.

589
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,500
I went to the mountains and the mountains.

590
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,500
I didn't enter Qingyang.

591
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,500
I stepped into a wild pond at the crossroads of Qingyang.

592
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,500
I didn't step into the pond.

593
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,500
I didn't step into the pond.

594
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,500
That's good.

595
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,500
Thank you for your hard work.

596
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,500
Thank you, Miss Shen.

597
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,500
Well,

598
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,500
there's nothing to thank.

599
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
She just went along the way.

600
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,500
Yes, yes.

601
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,500
It's not a big deal.

602
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,500
But I don't think

603
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,500
she's a good person.

604
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,500
I'll go get something else.

605
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,500
Thank you.

606
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,500
Thank you.

607
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,500
Thank you.

608
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,500
Thank you.

609
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
Thank you.
