Episode 15

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,200
Move aside.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,200
What's going on?

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,440
How...

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,280
How could this happen?

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,600
Water! Water!

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,920
Water!

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,040
Water!

9
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,360
The houses were destroyed.

10
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,120
They're all wooden.

11
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,000
We need to save them.

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,480
Or they'll be burned one by one.

13
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,600
Liu Chang, Cheng Huo.

14
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,800
You stay here and stay with Shuzhan.

15
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,320
Yes.

16
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,400
The rest of you,

17
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,280
go to the wine cellar near the village

18
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,960
to borrow water and electricity.

19
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,800
Save them with fire.

20
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,800
Yes.

21
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,440
Hurry up.

22
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,560
You go to Liu Chang's house later.

23
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,840
Take care of yourself and your family.

24
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,840
Be careful.

25
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,480
How do we do this?

26
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,760
We can all take it.

27
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,360
We can't just let it go.

28
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,800
How can we just let it go?

29
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,800
Hurry up.

30
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,440
Save me.

31
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,000
Hurry up.

32
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,800
Look after Yangyang.

33
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,920
Be careful, Yangyang.

34
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,000
Xiaoming is still in the shop.

35
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,160
Yuan, take care of Yangyang.

36
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,400
Water!

37
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,600
Save me!

38
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,280
Help!

39
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,000
Help!

40
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,720
Help!

41
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,120
Help!

42
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,720
Don't be afraid. We're here to save you.

43
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,760
Help!

44
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,760
Be careful.

45
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,800
Get out of the way.

46
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,320
Yuan Tianzi.

47
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,160
Hurry up. Follow me.

48
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,640
Be careful.

49
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,360
Hurry up.

50
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,840
Be careful.

51
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,840
Hurry up.

52
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,480
Hurry up.

53
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,120
You must know

54
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,160
the story of the ancestral clan.

55
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,920
Then,

56
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,720
a fire broke out

57
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,360
in the 14th house of the Shen family.

58
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,120
The Shen family

59
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,520
was in the fire.

60
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:08,960
Shi Langzhen.

61
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,120
Shi Langzhen.

62
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,200
I remember.

63
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,320
This is the fire.

64
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,560
This is the fire.

65
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:18,840
Hurry up.

66
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,560
Let's go.

67
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,880
Hurry up.

68
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,720
Hurry up.

69
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,560
Hurry up.

70
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,400
Hurry up.

71
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,160
Hurry up.

72
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,000
Hurry up.

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,800
Hurry up.

74
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,680
Hurry up.

75
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,400
Hurry up.

76
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
Hurry up.

77
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
It should be fine.

78
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,680
I'll go inside and have a look.

79
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,680
Be careful.

80
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,480
Hurry up.

81
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,240
Hurry up.

82
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,200
Hurry up.

83
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,120
Be careful.

84
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,920
Hurry up.

85
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,040
Yangyang.

86
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,040
Ji.

87
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,200
Ji.

88
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,000
Ji.

89
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,720
Listen to me.

90
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,000
I saw his face just now.

91
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,480
He was the one who set the fire.

92
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,720
He even held a small firefly.

93
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,960
I chased him all the way here.

94
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,920
He must have entered our restaurant.

95
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,560
I'll go with him.

96
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,080
You go to report to the police.

97
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,680
Ji.

98
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,440
Listen to me.

99
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,360
In the past,

100
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,000
this fire was our destination.

101
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,920
Ji.

102
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,720
Yangyang.

103
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,560
He's not good.

104
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,000
Yangyang is in danger.

105
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,160
Yangyang.

106
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,000
Yangyang.

107
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,880
Мос 비� ber insteng.

108
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,240
Yaobyue Commandery Zihng is in danger.

109
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,160
Yaony.]

110
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,480
Yangyang.

111
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,240
Yaemary.

112
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,920
Yaoyue.

113
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:54,220
Ya

114
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,440
Are you all right?

115
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,760
Listen to me.

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,320
You...

117
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,400
You let my daughter go.

118
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,760
Are you crazy?

119
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,440
Yes.

120
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,080
I'm crazy.

121
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,160
My father,

122
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,240
my second brother, and my third brother

123
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,800
are all my family's ancestors.

124
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,040
Am I crazy?

125
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,480
No.

126
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,400
Who are you blaming?

127
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,400
You're the one who committed the crime.

128
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,640
It's all your fault.

129
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,120
I want to take you to the grave with me.

130
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,680
Listen.

131
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,040
I'll go there.

132
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,920
You're afraid that I'll explode.

133
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,280
Can you let my daughter go?

134
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,040
No.

135
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,680
Listen.

136
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,800
My father has nothing to kill.

137
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,320
You come with me.

138
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,440
You can't kill us.

139
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,800
You're really a family.

140
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,880
What do you mean by death?

141
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,560
I want to see who will die of the fire.

142
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,440
I want you to see who will die of the fire.

143
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,400
Take her down.

144
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,040
Hurry.

145
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,920
Don't hurt her.

146
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,040
Mother, you go first.

147
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,120
Mother.

148
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,440
You only want my life.

149
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,920
It's boring for you to leave others.

150
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,200
It's more troublesome.

151
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,400
I'm begging you.

152
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,120
Don't say anything.

153
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,520
Don't hit yourself, okay?

154
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,400
Go.

155
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,200
Liya.

156
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,800
Don't hurt me.

157
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,480
I'm begging you.

158
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,360
Please kill me.

159
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,040
No.

160
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,080
Go and get Lin Ye.

161
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,600
Hurry.

162
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,320
Don't hurt her.

163
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:48,880
Don't hurt her.

164
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,520
I'm begging you.

165
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,400
I'll kill her.

166
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,240
Hurry.

167
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,080
Don't hurt her.

168
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,600
Lin Ye.

169
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,240
Don't hurt her.

170
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,880
Don't hurt me.

171
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,640
Go and get Lin Ye.

172
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,520
I told you not to move.

173
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:56,960
You move.

174
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,720
I'll kill you.

175
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,320
Go.

176
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,360
Ji.

177
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,080
Be careful.

178
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,480
Go.

179
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,160
Ji.

180
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:05,960
Go.

181
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,680
Be careful.

182
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,320
Be careful.

183
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:07,920
Ji.

184
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,360
Ji.

185
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,040
Be careful.

186
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,440
Ji.

187
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,040
Go.

188
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,560
Go.

189
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,360
Go.

190
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,200
Ji.

191
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,160
You're so stupid.

192
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,120
Ji.

193
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,240
Lin Liang.

194
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,640
Listen to me.

195
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,760
Listen to me.

196
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,560
I can understand your feelings now.

197
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:26,960
Really.

198
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,800
Look at Lin Ye.

199
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,640
Not only did he provoke King Zhao,

200
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,920
but also because King Zhao has been

201
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,280
favoring him for so many years.

202
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,760
What you want most

203
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,640
is to get your father's approval,

204
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,600
right?

205
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,200
He's your elder brother.

206
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,560
He also hides your light.

207
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,400
Lin Ye.

208
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,120
He's like your brother.

209
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,400
He took away your father's attention.

210
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
It's his fault.

211
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,880
Lin Ye.

212
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,600
What does Lin Ye mean?

213
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,480
Your father loves you the most.

214
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,360
Why do you compare yourself with him?

215
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,320
You're so smart.

216
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,040
You don't need me to tell you.

217
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,200
You must understand it.

218
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,040
So you don't need to be angry with Lin Ye.

219
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,640
You're the son

220
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,920
your father loves the most.

221
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,800
Don't talk nonsense.

222
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,480
If it weren't for you and Lin Ye,

223
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,840
I wouldn't have come to this world.

224
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,440
King Zhao was forced to be a big brother.

225
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,440
He was forced to marry a man who was more than 20 years old.

226
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,320
He was forced to die.

227
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,360
I'm late.

228
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,240
Lin Ye.

229
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,320
I want you to die.

230
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,400
Be careful.

231
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,120
Lin Ye.

232
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,960
What?

233
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,360
Now you want to grow up with me

234
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,840
and go to the shou la?

235
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,160
Lin Ye.

236
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,040
You're too emotional.

237
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Just die with me.

238
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,960
Lin Ye.

239
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,440
Die.

240
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,520
It hurts so much.

241
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,080
When you saved me in Su Ren City,

242
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,280
you were badly hurt.

243
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,680
You didn't even let go of my hand.

244
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,280
Lin Ye.

245
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,440
Jin.

246
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,560
Jin.

247
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,040
Your wound.

248
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,040
It's fine.

249
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,840
Come on.

250
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,080
I'll take you out.

251
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,360
Let's go.

252
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,200
Let's go.

253
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,320
Jin.

254
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,000
Listen.

255
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,080
In the past,

256
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,920
this party is the end of us.

257
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,840
This is the end.

258
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,440
We've been in the history of the temple.

259
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,120
After a thousand years,

260
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,520
our family still exists.

261
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,720
So,

262
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,040
history will not change.

263
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,040
We won't die.

264
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,440
It will disappear.

265
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,600
It will...

266
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,480
It will be the same.

267
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,880
Hurry up.

268
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This way.

269
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,040
Young Master.

270
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,520
Young Master.

271
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,680
Young Master.

272
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,720
Young Master.

273
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,600
Young Master.

274
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,960
Young Master.

275
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,720
Jin.

276
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,720
Come on.

277
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,040
It's really Jin.

278
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,280
What?

279
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,320
What's wrong?

280
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,800
I have to say goodbye.

281
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,520
Si.

282
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:45,760

I really

286
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,040
I really

287
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,440
I really

288
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,120
I really

289
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,600

290
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,320
I really

291
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:56,640

292
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,200

293
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,640
really

294
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,200
I really

295
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,920
I really

296
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:09,520
It's like Later In The Switch Lydia

297
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,480
and the light and darkness are interlocked.

298
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,760
How many times have I been

299
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,640
in the dark and the light are blinding?

300
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,600
Shao Ying!

301
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,400
Shao Ying!

302
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,040
Shao Ying!

303
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,720
Shao Ying!

304
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,800
Shao Ying!

305
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,680
Shao Ying!

306
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,480
Shao Ying!

307
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,520
Shao Ying!

308
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,280
A'Jie.

309
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,240
If it weren't for the pain in my heart,

310
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,120
I wouldn't have known it.

311
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,400
I've been waiting for half a year.

312
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,200
Shao...

313
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Shao...

314
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,240
Shao...

315
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,160
The fire is out.

316
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,360
I'm going to call for help.

317
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,320
You should have a rest.

318
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,160
Impossible.

319
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,000
It's impossible.

320
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,400
Why is there nothing?

321
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,600
A'Jie,

322
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,040
once the fire is out,

323
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,520
you have to look for help.

324
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,400
No, no, no.

325
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:27,880
I can't do it.

326
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,760
I can't do it.

327
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,560
I can't do it.

328
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,280
I can't do it.

329
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,040
I can't do it.

330
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,920
I can't do it.

331
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,920
I can't do it.

332
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,720
I can't do it.

333
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,800
I can't do it.

334
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,520
I can't do it.

335
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,440
I can't do it.

336
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,040
Once the fire is out,

337
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,200
you have to look for help.

338
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,320
What are you looking for?

339
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,080
Tell me.

340
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,640
I'll look for it with you.

341
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,600
What if something happens?

342
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,040
How can we open the door?

343
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
Something happens?

344
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,240
Thank you for your help, Young Master.

345
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,960
Thank you for saving my life last night.

346
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,680
Last night,

347
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,680
the one who saved you last night was Lady Shen.

348
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,320
Don't you remember?

349
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,240
Lady Shen.

350
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,240
It was Young Master and the people of Jinzhao House

351
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,800
who saved us.

352
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,240
Where is the one who opened the temple?

353
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,560
It's been abandoned for years.

354
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,640
We've never seen anyone

355
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,920
who opened the temple.

356
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,880
Are you stupid?

357
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,720
Young Master.

358
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,920
I've told you many times.

359
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,440
We don't know Lady Shen.

360
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,520
You're tired of hearing me.

361
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,680
Are you stupid?

362
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,080
Impossible.

363
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,760
Impossible.

364
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,560
Impossible.

365
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,640
Impossible.

366
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,880
You must write all the Construction Book,

367
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,320
for coming to Jinzhao House.

368
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,440
I'll take all the flyers and

369
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,800
build a pagoda for you.

370
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,720
If your father always tells you to be proud and cheery,

371
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,120
I'll do whatever I do.

372
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,380
pensa

373
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,200
The wind...

374
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,780
This is a miracle.

375
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:24,680
Love...

376
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,400
Love-

377
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,480
Love.

378
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,280
answer

379
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,160
Complaint

380
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,760
Wosing

381
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,960
Wosing

382
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,480
They really existed.

383
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Liu Cheng,

384
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,480
if you don't believe me,

385
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,480
I believe you.

386
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,480
He used to be my wife.

387
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,480
They used to be my family.

388
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,480
I used to be your wife.

389
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,480
But I always forget some things every day.

390
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,480
One day,

391
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,480
I will forget him.

392
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
In this world,

393
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
who will remember them?

394
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,480
What can I remember?

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
My lord.

438
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,480
This is...

439
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:37,480
If he comes back one day and sees that dead child,

440
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:43,480
he will not be able to take a step back.

441
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:39,560
If he comes back one day and sees that dead child,

442
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:44,560
he will not be able to take a step back.

443
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,240
So beautiful!

444
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,100
A Ji

445
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,600
Hm,ISA

446
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,640
You wake up already

447
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,000
You only open your mouth

448
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,520
Wake up.

449
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,040
Ah Ji.

450
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,360
What's wrong with you?

451
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:33,760
Aunt.

452
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,200
Ah Ji.

453
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:34,880
Aunt.

454
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,680
Ah Ji, wake up.

455
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,640
Don't scare me.

456
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,200
Aunt.

457
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,720
Ah Ji.

458
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,640
Wake up, aunt.

459
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,360
Ah Ji.

460
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,040
Aunt.

461
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,880
What's wrong with you?

462
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,760
Ah Ji.

463
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,640
What's wrong with you?

464
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,480
Aunt.

465
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,280
Aunt, you're finally awake.

466
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,760
Wake up.

467
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,200
Come on.

468
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,240
Hurry up.

469
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,680
What's wrong?

470
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,200
Sit here.

471
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,280
Are you okay, aunt?

472
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,800
Ah Ji.

473
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,560
You're finally awake.

474
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,760
You scared us to death.

475
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,120
What's wrong with him?

476
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,720
Ah Ji.

477
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,400
Are you okay?

478
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:56,920
Aunt.

479
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,120
You scared us to death.

480
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,120
You're hurt.

481
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,240
Are you feeling unwell?

482
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Talk to us.

483
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,200
What's wrong?

484
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,160
Aunt, are you okay?

485
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,800
This is Yunshui Courtyard.

486
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,240
What?

487
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,920
This is the ancient city of modern times.

488
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,840
We're really back.

489
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,800
The ancient city of modern times.

490
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,280
Why are you still here?

491
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,440
We haven't gone home yet.

492
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,000
Are you stupid?

493
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,120
Do you remember

494
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,840
you wanted to find someone to visit our ancestors?

495
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,880
You've been there for a long time.

496
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,720
We went to find you.

497
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,360
But we found you were unconscious.

498
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,520
Don't scare us.

499
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,400
Aunt.

500
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,480
Could it be that you fainted?

501
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,200
Grandma has already taken the first and second

502
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
and second aid.

503
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,520
The ambulance will be here soon.

504
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,120
Yes, the ambulance will be here soon.

505
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,000
Aunt.

506
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,280
Why is the child crying?

507
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,320
What's wrong?

508
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,160
Don't cry.

509
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,760
What's wrong?

510
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,240
Ah Ji.

511
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,880
You're stupid.

512
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,640
You're stupid.

513
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,640
Don't talk nonsense.

514
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,320
You're a fool.

515
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:46,840
Ah Ji.

516
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,160
It's okay.

517
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,800
What should we do?

518
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,560
I'm here.

519
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,360
My daughter.

520
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,480
It's okay.

521
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,140
Look, the

522
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,280

523
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,800

Come on.

535
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,080
Sit down.

536
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,240
Boss.

537
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,320
Boss.

538
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,760
Delivery.

539
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,280
Come on.

540
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,080
Just put it here.

541
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,040
Thank you.

542
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,960
I want it here.

543
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,000
Come and eat when you're free.

544
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,280
I'm afraid I can't come.

545
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,280
You can.

546
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:56,920
You're busy.

547
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,920
Okay, go slowly.

548
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,760
Boss.

549
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,120
A perfect

550
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,040
full-fledged lamb

551
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,200
for the full moon night.

552
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,480
Another one.

553
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,080
Yes.

554
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,080
Okay, six bowls.

555
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,600
Okay.

556
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,440
It seems that this handsome man

557
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,640

558
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,040
Yes.

559
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,840
Isn't it?

560
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,880
Your restaurant is so popular now.

561
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,480
Thank you.

562
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:21,880
What?

563
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,960
You want to eat food in the traditional time?

00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,040
Yes.

566

The food inside is so interesting.

567
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,240
It's so interesting.

568
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,680
What else do you want?

569
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,160
That's all.

570
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
Okay, it's fast.

571
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,320
And it's sure to be delicious.

572
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:32,840
Don't worry.

573
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,440
Okay, come on.

574
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,040
This way.

575
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,440
Inside.

576
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,240
This way, please.

577
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,280
Which table am I in?

578
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:38,880
Let me see.

579
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,640
The second table inside.

580
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,840
Go to the second table inside.

581
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,440
Mom.

582
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,040
Mom.

583
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,320
The order for the second table.

584
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:46,640
Okay.

585
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,320
This table is faster.

586
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,040
Okay.

587
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
I want to eat too.

588
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,440
Your cooking skills have improved recently.

589
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,040
You are practicing secretly for me.

590
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
Let me tell you.

591
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,720
Since Adi's video

592
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,960
changed our restaurant into a business,

593
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,040
I don't know why

594
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,840
but I feel more and more inspired.

595
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,840
I feel more and more powerful when I work.

596
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,440
That's good.

597
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,160
The food is ready.

598
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,640
Come on.

599
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,160
Dad, you have to keep working hard.

600
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,880
You are the best internet celebrity chef

601
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,440
in the local search of Yongan.

602
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,400
You can keep an eye on it.

603
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,200
I know.

604
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,200
I know.

605
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,200
The meat of the villain is here.

606
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,120
Keep working hard.

607
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,000
Internet celebrity chef.

608
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,720
Keep going.

609
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,320
Keep going.

610
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,080
Boss.

611
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,440
Boss.

612
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,200
Table No. 3, please.

613
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,000
Okay.

614
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,600
This way.

615
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,320
Yang Yang.

616
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,000
Table No. 3.

617
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,800
128 yuan.

618
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,000
You are a little fairy.

619
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,720
You can calculate it by looking at it.

620
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,600
So cute.

621
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,600
So cute.

622
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,920
Thank you.

623
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,800
See you next time.

624
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,800
But

625
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,000
if you make a short video,

626
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,280
you will get a new dish.

627
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,200
Now we are all internet celebrity restaurants.

628
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,640
My classmates are all saying that.

629
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,240
It's not aunt's invention.

630
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,440
I just used the table

631
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,800
we made in ancient times.

632
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,480
Aunt.

633
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,360
You are still thinking about the dream

634
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,640
of meeting the ancestors through the past.

635
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,280
But didn't your grandparents

636
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,280
tell you to forget it?

637
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,840
If it's a dream,

638
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,600
why did dad suddenly make such delicious dishes?

639
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,000
Why did brother suddenly become a Qin fan?

640
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,240
And Yang Yang.

641
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,480
He just went to elementary school

642
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,320
but suddenly became so familiar with the family.

643
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,920
Lin Yan.

644
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,600
He is from Qingyang.

645
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,600
Then he came to Yongan to be a young master of Jingzhao.

646
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,480
After we left,

647
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,880
the dream was still going on.

648
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,600
I was already gone.

649
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,440
I just looked at Lin Yan

650
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,880
from a side view.

651
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,040
He was alone in the end.

652
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,440
So lonely.

653
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,440
Come in.

654
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,680
Ah Jie.

655
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,600
This is the cherry on top that your dad bought online.

656
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,320
It's quite fresh.

657
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,120
Try it.

658
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,520
Didn't mom and dad tell you that

659
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,440
what you wrote is your privacy?

660
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,520
We won't peek.

661
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,320
But you said that you have been

662
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,720
always thinking about it.

663
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,440
We are really worried about you.

664
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,800
I'm fine.

665
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,400
And I...

666
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,440
I'm just...

667
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,400
You're still thinking about that dream, right?

668
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,120
Silly girl.

669
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,560
Didn't I tell you that

670
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,720
dreams don't come true?

671
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
And you said

672
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,280
that the ancestors were all people from a thousand years ago.

673
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,000
Even if you really met him,

674
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,960
when you wake up from the dream,

675
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,000
you should live your life well.

676
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,720
Right?

677
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,400
Yes.

678
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,640
Don't worry.

679
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,880
I know it.

680
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,800
I just have a headache these days.

681
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,800
I'll be fine in a few days.

682
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,920
Just like chasing stars.

683
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,560
Think about it.

684
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,680
When I'm chasing stars,

685
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,680
how long do I have to hold on?

686
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,240
Okay.

687
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,400
I hope you can get over this soon.

688
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,120
Don't think too much.

689
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,000
Do you know?

690
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,480
Okay.

691
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,440
It's almost time.

692
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,480
Go to sleep.

693
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,680
Okay.

694
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,600
Don't forget to eat cherries.

695
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,560
I'll close the door.

696
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,120
Boss, one more.

697
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,760
One more.

698
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,760
Boss, one more.

699
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,760
Which one is better?

700
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,760
This white peach is good.

701
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,320
The ones you made are all good.

702
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,320
White peach.

703
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,320
Hello, please come in.

704
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,320
Put your phone down.

705
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,320
Please come in.

706
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,320
I just saw the group chat.

707
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,320
After the work today,

708
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,320
I have to have a meeting.

709
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,320
I don't feel like going.

710
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,320
I'm so tired.

711
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,320
I'm so tired.

712
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,320
I'm so tired.

713
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,320
I'm so tired.

714
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,320
I'm so tired.

715
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,320
I'm so tired.

716
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,840
I didn't see it.

717
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,840
Shen Shaoguang.

718
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,840
Why did you know my name?

719
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,840
I had a strange dream

720
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,840
on the way back to the island.

721
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,840
What strange dream?

722
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
You were so stupid.

723
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,840
I didn't know that.

724
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
But I know now.

725
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
I just know it.

726
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,840
You were so stupid.

727
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,840
You were so stupid.

728
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,360
What strange dream?

729
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,360
I forgot about you.

730
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,360
I don't want to forget.

731
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,360
I just want to find the result.

732
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,360
Sometimes I'm right, sometimes I'm wrong.

733
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,360
I'm sorry.
