00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
The Long Ballad

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,680
Episode 16

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,760
This family has so many tricks.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:17,920
Your Highness,

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,160
Shao Ying has gone to find the Shen Family.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,680
What should we do?

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,200
Buchi,

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,760
I'm giving you a bad name.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,240
Send someone to chase her immediately.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,760
Don't change her.

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,160
Bring the Shen Family back.

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,080
Yes.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,800
For this family,

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,960
Lin Yan came to me without hesitation.

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,840
They are much more important

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,680
than I thought.

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,120
But I hate this family.

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,160
They are so arrogant.

19
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,680
I'll let them run away.

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,960
Or I'll open their mouths.

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,400
Instead of using the Shen Family to make Lin Yan suffer,

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,560
there's a simpler way.

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,640
Tell me.

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,560
Kill her.

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,480
I know.

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,240
Lin Yan has been in the dark for years.

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,640
But it's not easy to bring her back.

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,600
This is a crime.

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,760
The Shen family

30
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,600
is garlic!

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,680
Where're the garlic?

32
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:58,500
I

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's not easy to walk on the horse that has been chosen.

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560
Let's take a break.

35
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,280
They can't catch us even if they help us.

36
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,920
Take a break.

37
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,600
It's not easy.

38
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,600
Take a break.

39
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,240
Don't get caught.

40
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,640
Let me see.

41
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,280
Are you okay?

42
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,520
Did you fall down?

43
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,040
Sorry, Yangyang.

44
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,680
Sorry.

45
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,600
Be careful, Qi.

46
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,640
We found the fruit.

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,080
Uncle, Grandma.

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,080
Do you want to see this?

49
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,280
Grandma, go and have a look.

50
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:27,920
Okay.

51
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,600
Grandma, have a look.

52
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,600
What did Yangyang step on?

53
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,360
Dao Jie, get up and work.

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,880
Why are you lying here?

55
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,240
What?

56
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,000
Qi, look.

57
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,400
Yangyang, where did you step on it?

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,360
It's in here.

59
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,600
Look, it's all wet.

60
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,360
It seems to be a spicy food.

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,560
Is it spicy?

62
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,080
What? Can it be eaten?

63
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,280
You have to try it.

64
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,200
If it's, you can eat it.

65
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,880
Who will taste it?

66
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,360
Who can taste the grass?

67
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,800
You know how to use the stick.

68
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,480
It's better than your dad.

69
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,440
You found food?

70
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,880
What is this?

71
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,080
Dad, why are you eating?

72
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,800
You want to eat it?

73
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,080
Dad.

74
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,600
Dad.

75
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,120
Dad.

76
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,440
Dad.

77
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,480
Hurry up.

78
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,520
It's stinky.

79
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,720
It's stinky.

80
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,320
Dad, hurry up.

81
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:24,960
It's stinky.

82
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,160
Dad.

83
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,480
Okay.

84
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,840
Okay.

85
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,360
Did you spit it out?

86
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,880
I didn't die.

87
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,080
You killed me.

88
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,280
Dad, let me see.

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,240
It's okay.

90
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,200
This is it.

91
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,280
This thing is really spicy.

92
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,080
It's spicy.

93
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,720
Spicy.

94
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,000
Spicy means it can be eaten.

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,440
Then we can make spicy food.

96
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,400
Spicy powder.

97
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,800
Boiled fish.

98
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,160
Washed tofu.

99
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,200
Spicy chicken feet.

100
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,160
It's delicious.

101
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,120
Dad.

102
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,920
Dad.

103
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,880
Dad.

104
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,400
Aunt,

105
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,560
can you bring more spicy grass back?

106
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,680
I want to eat spicy food.

107
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,520
Yangyang,

108
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,600
why don't you let me make it for you?

109
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,680
I'm sure I can't make it.

110
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,360
Don't worry.

111
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,600
I just dug several pig's feet.

112
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,160
After planting,

113
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,760
I can make a special spicy dish.

114
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,520
Spicy chicken feet, spicy chicken feet,

115
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,640
spicy tofu.

116
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,480
It's much better than the favorite pig's feet.

117
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,000
Look,

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,120
if the child is in the world,

119
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,320
he can't make it.

120
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,680
He can't eat spicy food.

121
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,840
You don't want to eat the last one, right?

122
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,720
I'll do it.

123
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,080
Dad, I want to eat it too.

124
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,840
Yangyang,

125
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,520
let's do rock-paper-scissors.

126
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,480
The winner eats it.

127
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,280
I'll count one, two, three.

128
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,080
I'll count five.

129
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,640
Okay?

130
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,360
Come on.

131
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,520
One, two, three.

132
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,680
I won.

133
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,480
You're so mean.

134
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,440
You're so mean.

135
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,640
Dad,

136
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,600
you even lied to your daughter

137
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,120
for the dog food.

138
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,560
Mom,

139
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,840
why are you so mean?

140
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,960
It's not a joke.

141
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,640
It's not worth believing.

142
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,520
When you grow up,

143
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,200
you won't be fooled by other men, right?

144
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,920
Say it.

145
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,120
You're always right.

146
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,480
Okay, Yangyang, don't be angry.

147
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,120
It's your turn.

148
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,920
I'll get it for you.

149
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,760
Grandma.

150
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,880
Don't move.

151
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,080
Don't move.

152
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,920
It's here.

153
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,520
I finally found you.

154
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,960
Did you find it

155
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,360
in our game?

156
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,160
I can find it here.

157
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,800
Stop talking nonsense.

158
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,920
Take Yangyang away.

159
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,800
Yes.

160
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,440
Ji,

161
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,400
take Yangyang away.

162
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,640
I want them to know

163
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,320
what a great woman is.

164
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,520
Mom,

165
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,560
can you do it?

166
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,760
You don't know your mom.

167
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,800
She can do it.

168
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,920
When I was young,

169
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:42,720
I used to be a good

170
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,440
Go, throw it Hayang.

171
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,280
Yeah, keep throwing.

172
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,680
No way.

173
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,600
Give me a way.

174
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,520
I was wrong.

175
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,080
Taizhen,

176
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,440
I'm sorry.

177
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,400
I'm sorry.

178
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,040
It's okay.

179
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,360
I'll throw it.

180
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,280
Hurry up.

181
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,400
Run.

182
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,760
Come on.

183
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,320
Go.

184
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:18,880
Yeah.

185
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,680
I know I know.

186
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,240
It must be this way.

187
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,760
Come on.

188
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,360
Zhili.

189
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,960
Get in.

190
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,360
Okay.

191
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
I'll hide in here.

192
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,480
You can't escape.

193
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,760
Yangyang,

194
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,600
hide here.

195
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,200
Don't make any noise.

196
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,160
I'll make you some hot cakes.

197
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,760
Don't make any noise.

198
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,360
I'm scared.

199
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,400
I'm scared.

200
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,720
Little bastard, come here.

201
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,600
Catch me.

202
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,160
Come on.

203
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,360
Dad.

204
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,320
Tae your moves.

205
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,220
Why are you holding

206
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,080
the stone?

207
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,360
I'll shoot you.

208
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,360
So what?

209
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,240
Mom.

210
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,400
Muchas!

211
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,920
Mr. Yuan.

212
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,160
I'll kill you.

213
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,240
I'm looking for you.

214
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,240
It's you.

215
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
Young Master.

216
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,240
Are you all right?

217
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,240
Say something.

218
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,240
If you dare to hurt the Shen family again,

219
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,240
I won't let you off easily.

220
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,240
Let's go.

221
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,240
Get lost.

222
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,240
Be careful.

223
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,240
Young Master.

224
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
Where are Jing and Yangyang?

225
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,240
They ran that way.

226
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240
Let's go.

227
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
Let's go.

228
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,240
Let's go.

229
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
Slowly.

230
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,240
Yangyang.

231
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,240
Lady Shen.

232
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,240
Jing.

233
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
Yangyang.

234
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,240
Young Master.

235
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
Young Master.

236
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
Jing.

237
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
Yangyang.

238
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
Be careful.

239
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Yangyang.

240
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Yangyang.

241
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,240
Lady Shen.

242
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Jing.

243
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
Yangyang.

244
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Yangyang.

245
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,240
Jing.

246
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
Shen Shaoguang.

247
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
Yangyang.

248
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
Slowly.

249
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
Shen Shaoguang.

250
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
Yangyang.

251
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
Say something.

252
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,240
Jing.

253
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
Young Master.

254
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
Shen Shao...

255
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
Young Master, I'm here.

256
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,240
Yangyang.

257
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,240
Hurry.

258
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,240
I'm here.

259
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
Yangyang.

260
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Young Master.

261
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,240
I'm here.

262
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Yangyang.

263
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
I'm here.

264
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,240
Yangyang.

265
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
I'm here.

266
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
Yangyang.

267
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Yangyang.

268
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
Yangyang, are you okay?

269
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
I didn't hurt you.

270
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
Yangyang, stop.

271
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,240
Are you okay?

272
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
Yangyang.

273
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Where's your aunt?

274
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
Where's Jing?

275
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
Yangyang, did she run with you?

276
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
She ran away to save me.

277
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
She ran away with the bad guy.

278
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,240
Why did she come back?

279
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Yangyang.

280
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,240
She went that way.

281
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,240
Young Master.

282
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
Young Master.

283
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
Young Master.

284
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
Young Master.

285
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Young Master.

286
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Young Master.

287
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
Young Master.

288
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,240
Young Master.

289
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,240
Young Master.

290
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Young Master.

291
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
Young Master.

292
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,240
Young Master.

293
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,240
Young Master.

294
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,240
Young Master.

295
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,240
Young Master.

296
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Young Master.

297
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,240
Young Master.

298
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Young Master.

299
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Young Master.

300
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
Young Master.

301
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Young Master.

302
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,240
Young Master.

303
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
Young Master.

304
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,240
Young Master.

305
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
Young Master.

306
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,240
Young Master.

307
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,240
Young Master.

308
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
Young Master.

309
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,240
Young Master.

310
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,240
Young Master.

311
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
Don't go back.

312
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,240
Come back with me.

313
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
I promise I won't kill you.

314
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,240
Young Master.

315
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
If you didn't save your life,

316
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
how could you play tricks on me here?

317
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Since you're so smart,

318
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
cut your hands and feet

319
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
and become a hostage.

320
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,240
No.

321
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
It's meaningless to be a hostage.

322
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
It's better to be self-sufficient.

323
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
I won't lie to you anymore.

324
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
Young Master.

325
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Do you think I'll believe you again?

326
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
Young Master.

327
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Young Master.

328
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
I told you it's real.

329
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
You don't believe me.

330
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Young Master.

331
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Are you okay?

332
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,240
It's dangerous here.

333
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Let's go.

334
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
Young Master.

335
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Shangguang.

336
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
Hold on to me.

337
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
Young Master.

338
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
Help me.

339
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,240
Help me.

340
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
Don't worry.

341
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
I'll save you.

342
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
Young Master.

343
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,240
Don't let go.

344
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
I'm not dead yet.

345
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
I have many things to eat.

346
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:18,820
I didn't make Sheng Jiaqiao the

347
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,820
Hold on to me.

348
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,820
Don't let go.

349
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,820
Young Master.

350
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,820
You're hurt.

351
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,820
Does it hurt?

352
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
Can you still hold on to me?

353
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
I won't die here, will I?

354
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,820
Just hold on to me.

355
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,820
You won't die.

356
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,820
I won't let you die.

357
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,820
I won't die.

358
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,820
Lin Yan.

359
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,820
Didn't you want to turn the case against the Cui family?

360
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,820
Now you're going to die for a woman.

361
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,820
Hold on to me.

362
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,820
Don't let go.

363
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,820
Young Master.

364
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,820
You're so stubborn.

365
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,820
Young Master.

366
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
There's a legend in the future.

367
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
As long as you have the leading role,

368
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,820
no matter what the ten thousand-fold fate,

369
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,820
nothing will happen.

370
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,820
After you die,

371
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,820
remember to kill that guy.

372
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,820
Shen Xiaoguang.

373
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,820
Hold on to me.

374
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,820
No, Shen Xiaoguang.

375
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
Shen Xiaoguang.

376
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,820
Hold on to me.

377
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,820
You're really something, Lin Yan.

378
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,820
I'm sorry to make you my big brother.

379
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,820
I'm sorry.

380
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,820
I'm sorry.

381
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,820
I'm sorry.

382
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,820
I'm sorry.

383
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,820
I'm sorry.

384
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,820
I'm sorry.

385
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,820
I'm sorry.

386
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,820
I'm sorry.

387
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,820
I'm sorry.

388
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,820
I'm sorry.

389
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,820
I'm sorry.

390
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,820
I'm sorry.

391
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,820
Lin Yan made you my big brother.

392
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
He lied to her.

393
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,820
He was willing to die for you.

394
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,820
Guess what?

395
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,820
He's dead.

396
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
Do you have a chance to live?

397
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,820
Shut up!

398
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,820
Young Master.

399
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
Please take care of our family more in the future.

400
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,820
I'm so grateful to you.

401
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,820
You're really a good brother.

402
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
You will succeed in the future.

403
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,820
Shen Xiaoguang.

404
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,820
Don't be impulsive.

405
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,820
I'm afraid to meet you in this life.

406
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,820
Lin Yan.

407
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,820
I can see the love at first sight.

408
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,820
But I can only guess.

409
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,820
Love is like a game.

410
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,820
Interesting.

411
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,820
I have to watch this play of love.

412
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,820
A'Qing.

413
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,820
Uncle.

414
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,820
A'Qing.

415
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,820
Go find something.

416
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,820
Uncle.

417
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,820
Let me go.

418
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,820
I don't want to die.

419
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,820
Help me.

420
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,820
Help me.

421
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,820
Come on.

422
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,820
Dad.

423
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,820
A'Qing.

424
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,820
A'Qing.

425
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,820
Hold on.

426
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,820
A'Qing.

427
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,820
A'Qing.

428
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,820
A'Qing.

429
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,820
Xiaoguang.

430
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,820
Hold on.

431
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,820
Hold on, A'Qing.

432
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,820
Hold on.

433
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,820
Hold on.

434
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,820
Let go.

435
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,820
Come on.

436
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,820
Come on.

437
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,820
Be careful.

438
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,820
A'Qing.

439
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,820
A'Qing.

440
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,820
Come on.

441
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,820
A'Qing.

442
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,820
It's okay.

443
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,820
A'Qing.

444
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,820
Hold on.

445
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,820
A'Qing.

446
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,820
Come on.

447
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,820
It's okay.

448
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,820
A'Qing.

449
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,820
Come on.

450
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,820
Uncle.

451
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,820
I thought...

452
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,820
I thought...

453
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
I thought I couldn't save you.

454
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,820
Xiaoguang.

455
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,820
If you still want to

456
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,820
be with me

457
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,820
because of me,

458
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,820
then I'll be with you.

459
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,820
I'll be with you.

460
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,820
I'll be with you.

461
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,820
I'll be with you.

462
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,820
I'll be with you.

463
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,820
It's okay.

464
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,820
It's okay.

465
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,820
It's okay.

466
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,820
I'm fine.

467
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,820
Do you still feel the pain when you pinch my shoulder?

468
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,820
Uncle.

469
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,820
What about the wound?

470
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,820
It's okay.

471
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,820
It'll be fine after a while.

472
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,820
The most important thing now

473
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,820
is to leave here

474
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,820
and return to Yongan.

475
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,820
Okay.

476
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,820
Come on.

477
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,820
Come on.

478
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,820
Slowly.

479
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,820
Come on.

480
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,820
What should we do?

481
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,820
But

482
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,820
we can't report him to the police.

483
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,820
What if he's thrown here

484
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,820
and eaten by a beast?

485
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,820
He's so special.

486
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,820
Leave him alone.

487
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,820
If he doesn't mind,

488
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,820
he's lucky.

489
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,820
Someone will find him soon.

490
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,820
Let's go.

491
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,820
The boat will pick us up soon.

492
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,820
Yes.

493
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,820
Everyone, follow the boat.

494
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,820
I can't even get a minute.

495
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,820
I'm here.

496
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,820
Let's go.

497
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,820
Let's go.

498
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,820
Hurry.

499
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,820
Go.

500
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,820
Go.

501
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,820
Welcome.

502
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
It's so good.

503
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,820
It's time to save money and spend.

504
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,820
The discounted buffs are discounted.

505
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,820
If you have enough food and drinks,

506
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,820
you can save money.

507
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,820
You can save money.

508
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,820
You can save money.

509
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,820
You can save money.

510
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,820
You can save money.

511
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,820
You can save money.

512
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,820
You can save money.

513
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,820
If you have enough food and drinks,

514
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,820
you can save money.

515
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,820
It's just a small injury.

516
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,820
It can be cured without medicine.

517
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,820
Drink the medicine first.

518
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,820
Wait.

519
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Your hand is not convenient, right?

520
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,820
Let me do it.

521
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,820
I can do it myself.

522
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,820
Mom and Dad can't stand it.

523
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,820
They need to rest first.

524
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,820
Yangyang is frightened.

525
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,820
Brother has to stay with him.

526
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,820
If Shang Ying has something to do tonight,

527
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,820
call me.

528
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,820
Does it hurt?

529
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,820
No.

530
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,820
Sorry.

531
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,820
Let me do it.

532
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,820
I don't know who wrote this paper.

533
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,820
This person must be good at writing.

534
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,820
How can he score the paper?

535
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,820
It's the same meaning.

536
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,820
Writing a paper

537
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,820
is not the same as the meaning.

538
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,820
Then don't worry.

539
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,820
The point is

540
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,820
his paper is neat.

541
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,820
Ordinary people don't write articles so carefully.

542
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,820
How many times do you write?

543
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,820
I don't know.

544
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,820
I don't know.

545
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,820
I don't know.

546
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,820
I don't know.

547
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,820
I don't know.

548
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,820
I don't know.

549
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,820
I don't know.

550
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,820
I don't know.

551
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,820
He is very careful.

552
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,820
He will change some marks.

553
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,820
He didn't.

554
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,820
He is like a new writer.

555
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,820
As you said,

556
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,820
there are no mistakes or mistakes in the paper.

557
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,820
It's obviously copied.

558
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,820
I was too careless.

559
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,820
I was studying the contents of the paper.

560
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,820
But I didn't think

561
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,820
the key information was outside of my control.

562
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,820
An Qing was so urgent that year.

563
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,820
Xiao Wu Lang spent time

564
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,820
to copy it on purpose.

565
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,820
Then he handed it to the Jingzhao Mansion and the Dali Temple.

566
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,820
He must have a secret.

567
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,820
It's a pity.

568
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,820
Xiao Wu Lang is in a coma now.

569
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,820
He can't ask anything.

570
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,820
Xiao Wu Lang

571
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,820
is usually

572
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,820
a stubborn person.

573
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,820
But he is very diligent.

574
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,820
He will carry the household register when he goes to court.

575
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,820
He even walks with different food

576
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,820
and food.

577
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,820
He will record the events.

578
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,820
So someone laughed at him.

579
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,820
He and those

580
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,820
who record the events at any time

581
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,820
and who are in a good mood

582
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,820
will be the victims.

583
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,820
He has a nickname

584
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,820
called the Chidu Prince.

585
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,820
So I think

586
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,820
when he is investigating the case,

587
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,820
he will also carry the food and food.

588
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,820
If Prince Xiao

589
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,820
left the food and food

590
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,820
recorded at any time

591
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,820
there may be new clues.

592
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,820
By the way,

593
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,820
Zhao Wang sent a letter to apologize.

594
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,820
He said that the Shen family was all played by Li Ang.

595
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,820
He has already taught him a lesson.

596
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,820
When I was young,

597
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,820
he was a prince.

598
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,820
He felt that he was wrong

599
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,820
and would apologize to me as a child.

600
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,820
I thought he was reasonable

601
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,820
and unworthy.

602
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,820
He must be a fair person.

603
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,820
Now he has given all the responsibility to Li Ang.

604
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,820
He is just like

605
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,820
a man who is not good at everything.

606
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,820
He is just a guard.

607
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,820
In the case of the imperial court,

608
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,820
many officials who traded were on the ice.

609
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,820
Maybe

610
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,820
they didn't do it for money.

611
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,820
The ears, tongue and mouth of the court

612
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,820
were replaced by others.

613
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,820
That person

614
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,820
is not a real official.

615
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,820
Wolf King,

616
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,820
I don't understand

617
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,820
what you are saying.

618
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,820
I mean

619
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,820
maybe

620
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,820
Zhao Wang is related to all this.

621
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,820
In the age of the saint,

622
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,820
there are still several brothers who are of high status

623
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,820
who can get the benefit from the case of the imperial court.

624
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,820
If that is the case,

625
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,820
Zhao Wang must not want us to continue to investigate.

626
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,820
And even if Zhao Wang has a lot of doubts,

627
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,820
it is not enough to determine

628
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,820
that he is related to that thing.

629
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,820
I don't want to think about it anymore.

630
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,820
Now,

631
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,820
Zhao Wang doesn't dare to

632
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,820
take the initiative to come to Yongan.

633
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,820
He wrote this letter

634
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,820
to stabilize us.

635
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,820
Both parties are angry.

636
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,820
If the other party is anxious,

637
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,820
it will be a mess.

638
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,820
Then,

639
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,820
should we send the Shen family

640
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,820
away first?

641
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,820
Greetings, Young Master.

642
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,820
Let's come over and have a look.

643
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,820
How is Young Master's injury?

644
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,820
I am fine.

645
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,820
Thank you for your concern.

646
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,820
Come in and sit.

647
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,820
We have one more thing to tell you

648
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,820
besides visiting Young Master.

649
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,820
On the day of Su Shui City,

650
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,820
Zhao Wang, the son of the one who chased after A Ji,

651
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,820
came to the dungeon to interrogate us.

652
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,820
He asked us if we knew your secret.

653
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,820
There are things

654
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,820
that can be said and things that cannot be said about Young Master.

655
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,820
We don't know what to say

656
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,820
and what not to say.

657
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,820
I just thought of it.

658
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,820
Young Master, you told me

659
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,820
that Zhao Wang knew your real identity.

660
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,820
That day when you were taking off your clothes in the carriage...

661
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,820
No.

662
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,820
That day, Young Master was wearing a official uniform.

663
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,820
He couldn't have eaten at the restaurant

664
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,820
in the uniform.

665
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,820
He could only change it temporarily.

666
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,820
He didn't want to change his clothes?

667
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,820
So,

668
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,820
you said that you knew my identity?

669
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,820
It's just that

670
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,820
to save my life,

671
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,820
I have to say something that they don't know.

672
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,820
It can't affect Young Master.

673
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,820
So I said

674
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,820
that Young Master and the Princess Royal

675
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,820
were not close.

676
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,820
I'm sorry that I've affected your reputation.

677
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,820
It's just a reputation.

678
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,820
You don't have to be hurt by them.

679
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,820
The door...

680
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,820
It doesn't matter.

681
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,820
It's because of me

682
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,820
that you are in this dilemma.

683
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,820
Young Master,

684
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,820
we are family.

685
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,820
You don't have to say that.

686
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,820
Actually, we all know that

687
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,820
Young Master is determined to solve the case.

688
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,820
Yes.

689
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,820
Then, Zhao Wang took us as his hostage

690
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,820
is also related to Young Master's plan to solve the case?

691
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,820
It's okay. If Young Master doesn't want to say it,

692
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,820
we won't ask.

693
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,820
Don't worry.

694
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,820
I risked my life

695
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,820
to protect you.

696
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,820
I know that

697
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,820
people have different views on life and death.

698
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,820
They think that many things are more important than life.

699
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,820
But Young Master is family to us.

700
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,820
We just hope that

701
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,820
our family can live well.

702
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,820
Young Master, I also want to say something.

703
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,820
As the owner of this family,

704
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,820
I'll tell you,

705
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,820
first,

706
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,820
the Cui family's plan is very important.

707
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,820
Second,

708
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,820
Zhao Wang has given you a lot of evidence.

709
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,820
When we came here,

710
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,820
we had a meeting and discussed it.

711
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,820
We decided to stand by your side

712
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,820
firmly and help you

713
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,820
to solve the case for the Cui family.

714
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,820
How can that be?

715
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,820
What's wrong with that?

716
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,820
You said that

717
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,820
since we came to Yongan City,

718
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,820
we have received a lot of help from Young Master.

719
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,820
And I can see that

720
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,820
Young Master has done all this

721
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,820
from the bottom of his heart.

722
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,820
So we will never

723
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,820
leave Young Master alone.

724
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,820
Yes.

725
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,820
Young Master,

726
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,820
I want to ask you one more thing.

727
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,820
In fact,

728
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,820
we should have moved out long ago.

729
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,820
But if we move out now,

730
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,820
it's easier for others to harm us.

731
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,820
So you have to

732
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,820
make a decision about this.

733
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,820
I've got you all involved.

734
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,820
Although we've moved out,

735
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,820
you are my only family in this world.

736
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,820
I thought

737
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,820
I should keep you two by my side

738
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,820
to be relieved.

739
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,820
But the future is not easy.

740
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,820
Look at this child.

741
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,820
Young Master has planned

742
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,820
so much for us.

743
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,820
Young Master,

744
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,820
in the eyes of your uncle and I,

745
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,820
you are just a child.

746
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,820
How can you

747
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,820
take on so much

748
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,820
on your own?

749
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,820
Didn't Young Master say

750
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,820
he would also

751
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,820
stay with us?

752
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,820
Young Master,

753
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,820
from now on,

754
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,820
you don't have to be afraid.

755
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,820
If anything happens,

756
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,820
we will help you.

757
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,820
We will help you.

758
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,820
No, Dad.

759
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,820
At this time,

760
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,820
adults are the parents.

761
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,820
Yes, yes.

762
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,820
In my eyes,

763
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,820
Young Master is the same as you and Gongcai.

764
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,820
We are all children.

765
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,820
Right?

766
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,820
Young Master,

767
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,820
as long as you are happy,

768
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,820
from now on,

769
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,820
you can take us

770
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,820
as your parents.

771
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,820
It's not suitable.

772
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,820
It's not suitable.

773
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,820
What's not suitable?

774
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,820
It's suitable.

775
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,820
I think it's very suitable.

776
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,820
From now on,

777
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,820
you can take us as your parents.

778
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,820
Right.

779
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,820
It's suitable.

780
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,820
In that case,

781
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,820
you will be my brother in the future.

782
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,820
Brother.

783
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,820
Don't worry.

784
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,820
No matter how difficult the future is,

785
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,820
we two

786
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,820
will go through it together.

787
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,820
Brother.

788
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,820
What's going on?

789
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,820
What's wrong, Mr. Liu?

790
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,820
I can't speak.

791
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,820
I can't speak.

792
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,820
Don't move.

793
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,820
From now on,

794
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,820
we are all your family.

795
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,820
Do you understand?

796
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,820
We are all family.

797
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,820
Come on.

798
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,820
Family.

799
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,820
Family.

800
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,820
The restaurant

801
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,820
is like the tea house later.

802
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,820
Since ancient times,

803
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,820
all the three churches and the nine rivers

804
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,820
liked to come to this kind of place to eat.

805
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,820
We

806
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,820
are very observant.

807
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,820
We are very obedient.

808
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,820
Maybe we can get information

809
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,820
that can help Young Master.

810
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,820
Why are you standing here

811
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,820
and not cooking?

812
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,820
I'm not sending out the information.

813
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,820
I have to go.

814
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,820
This is a man's job.

815
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,820
It's dangerous for women.

816
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,820
Why are you hiding it from me?

817
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,820
I think you owe me a favor.

818
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,820
Go and cook.

819
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,820
Honey.

820
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,820
Look at Young Master.

821
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,820
You two, get in.

822
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,820
What are you doing?

823
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,820
Do you want to eat?

824
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,820
Go.

825
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,820
It's okay.

826
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,820
You two.

827
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,820
What are you doing?

828
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,820
I'm sorry.

829
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,820
I'm sorry.

830
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,820
Go.

831
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,820
Look at this big beard.

832
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,820
This is a horse's brain.

833
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,820
No money.

834
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,820
Eat slowly.

835
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,820
Eat slowly.

836
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,820
Whether it's the guests in the restaurant

837
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,820
or the passers-by outside,

838
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,820
they may be the other party's stall.

839
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,820
Thank you.

840
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,820
Young Master, get out.

841
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,820
No.

842
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,820
Step aside.

843
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,820
What are you looking at?

844
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,820
What are you looking at?

845
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,820
I'm following him.

846
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,820
Who are you following?

847
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,820
No.

848
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,820
That man.

849
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,820
See?

850
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,820
He must have a problem.

851
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,820
What problem?

852
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,820
He hasn't been poisoned, right?

853
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,820
He has four sprays on his face.

854
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,820
What does it mean?

855
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,820
He must have used the spray

856
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,820
to send out the signal.

857
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,820
No.

858
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,820
Who is he following?

859
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,820
You.

860
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,820
Who?

861
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,820
No.

862
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,820
Go away.

863
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,820
You're a kid.

864
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,820
You don't believe me?

865
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,820
You have a problem with your brain?

866
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,820
No.

867
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,820
He has a problem.

868
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,820
You're helping others to solve cases.

869
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,820
I think you're looking for an existence.

870
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,820
What?

871
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,820
You're so smart.

872
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,820
You even found out the news.

873
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,820
The news you found out

874
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,820
was also revealed to you on purpose.

875
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,820
What?

876
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,820
Young Master,

877
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,820
it's enough for you.

878
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,820
But we can't help you

879
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,820
even if we can't help you.

880
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,820
Dad.

881
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,820
What?

882
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,820
What can you do?

883
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,820
What?

884
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,820
Young Master,

885
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,820
I have a news.

886
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,820
It's Wen San Lang.

887
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,820
He has a big beard.

888
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:49,400
His cousin is working in the

889
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,820
cat market.

890
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,820
Why are you looking at me?

891
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,820
The cat of the saint is lost.

892
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,820
That's a cat.

893
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,820
Isn't this a big knife?

894
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,820
This cat has been found.

895
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,820
The crown prince likes it.

896
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,820
He took it back to the court.

897
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,820
The saint has taught him a lesson.

898
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,820
By the way, Young Master,

899
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,820
I found out

900
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,820
that the chief minister's

901
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,820
left servant, Meng Lao,

902
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,820
is worried about

903
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,820
his granddaughter's marriage.

904
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,820
I heard that

905
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,820
his daughter's marriage is not good.

906
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,820
She is pregnant.

907
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,820
He doesn't want

908
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,820
his granddaughter to repeat the same mistake.

909
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,820
Meng Lao also mentioned it to me.

910
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,820
Marriage?

911
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,820
Then Young Master agreed.

912
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,820
You agreed?

913
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,820
No, no, no.

914
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,820
If Young Master agrees,

915
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,820
Chen Yong An will know

916
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,820
if he agrees.

917
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,820
Yes, yes, yes.

918
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,820
He can't agree.

919
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,820
He is moved.

920
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,820
He is moved?

921
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,820
Mother,

922
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,820
this is his private matter.

923
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,820
Let's not ask him.

924
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,820
You're right.

925
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,820
Thank you

926
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,820
for finding out

927
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,820
so many secrets about Qing Chong.

928
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,820
Actually, we've been

929
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,820
studying Yang Yang's school recently.

930
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,820
At this time,

931
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,820
girls often invite

932
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,820
the teacher to come back to class.

933
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,820
We also met some girls,

934
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,820
but they were not satisfied.

935
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,820
Then after a survey,

936
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,820
we found that

937
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,820
the best school is Hongwen School.

938
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,820
The imperial tutor Zhao Xun Zhi

939
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,820
is also taking classes here.

940
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,820
I asked...

941
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,820
When did you ask?

942
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,820
Your aunt is too honest.

943
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,820
I asked this person.

944
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,820
The one who sent the fish to Aunt Ge's house,

945
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,820
the third brother's wife's cousin,

946
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,820
the second aunt's son's sworn brother,

947
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,820
is the one who is the gold guards.

948
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,820
He said that 20 years ago,

949
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,820
Zhao Xun Zhi was the disciple of Jing Zhao Yi.

950
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,820
Why didn't he tell me?

951
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,820
He is indeed my father's disciple.

952
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,820
After the accident at home,

953
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,820
he wanted to avoid suspicion,

954
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,820
so he never mentioned it again.

955
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,820
Fragrant pouch, fragrant pouch.

956
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,820
Fragrant pouch with a special smell.

957
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,820
Madam, look at the fragrant pouch.

958
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,820
I found out that

959
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,820
the chief minister's uncle, Zuo Puyi, Meng Lao,

960
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,820
is worried about his grandson's marriage.

961
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,820
Meng Lao also mentioned it to me.

962
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,820
What's wrong, madam?

963
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,820
Something on your mind?

964
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,820
Fragrant pouch.

965
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,820
Nothing.

966
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,820
Why are you like this?

967
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,820
You are always absent-minded today.

968
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,820
Okay.

969
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,820
Actually, I read the article.

970
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,820
It's quite far.

971
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,820
It's quite far.

972
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,820
What article?

973
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,820
It's so hard to read.

974
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,820
Can you not read it?

975
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,820
What article?

976
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,820
I mean I read

977
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,820
a sad story.

978
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,820
What story?

979
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,820
The lady in the story

980
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,820
accidentally fell off the cliff.

981
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,820
At that time,

982
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,820
a handsome man came to save her.

983
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,820
He thought that

984
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,820
there was no death without death.

985
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,820
It doesn't matter if you lose your arm.

986
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,820
As long as you can save me, it's okay.

987
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,820
The lady is so heartless.

988
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,820
Yes.

989
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,820
But she is so heartless.

990
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,820
She fell off the cliff

991
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,820
to save her.

992
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,820
She must love that man very much.

993
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,820
No.

994
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,820
How could it be?

995
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,820
It doesn't matter.

996
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,820
Anyway,

997
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,820
the savior will marry someone else sooner or later.

998
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,820
Why is the story like this?

999
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,820
What's the lady's heart?

1000
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,820
No.

1001
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,820
She is not heartless.

1002
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,820
How could she be heartless?

1003
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,820
It's so abnormal.

1004
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,820
Why are you so excited?

1005
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,820
What do you want to say?

1006
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,820
I don't understand.

1007
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,820
Nothing.

1008
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,820
Nothing really.

1009
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,820
Is it okay to be friends?

1010
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,820
Didn't Shao Ying say

1011
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,820
that he didn't plan to make friends?

1012
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,820
People change.

1013
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,820
Then we are friends.

1014
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,820
In Wei Daxiang,

1015
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,820
friends should shake hands.

1016
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,820
Catch me.

1017
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,820
Don't let go.

1018
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,820
Don't let go.

1019
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,820
Don't let go.

1020
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,820
Don't let go.

1021
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,820
