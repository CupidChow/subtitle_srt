00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,720
(Looking back at Yong'an,)

2
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,670
(where nations gather in homage
and brocades pile up,)

3
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,030
(with a myriad of splendors,)

4
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,440
(our dynasty thrives,)

5
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,830
(never complacent or stagnant.)

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,070
(The court)

7
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,480
(embraces foreign doctrines,)

8
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,830
(and new trends emerge
among the commoners.)

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,920
(Everyone is willing
to embrace the new,)

10
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,640
(especially for the commoners'
dining habits.)

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,760
(The best delicacies in the world
are in Yong'an,)

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,920
(and the best dishes of Yong'an
are in Juxian Alley.)

13
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,740
(The delicacies in Juxian Alley)

14
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,150
(Juxian Alley)
(concern each commoner.)

15
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,710
(In this era, there were
no methods like stir-frying.)

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,860
(When chefs cook,)

17
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,470
(they either go for bold and hearty)

18
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,240
(or focus on elegance.)

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,600
(There are two most famous diners
in Juxian Alley.)

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,840
(One is)

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,640
(the magnificent)

22
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,240
(Yunlai Tavern.)

23
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,260
(Yunlai Tavern)

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,390
Camel meat is here!

25
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,760
Stuffed goose in roasted sheep!

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,590
Serve the dish!

27
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,230
(The other is
the elegant Guixiang Tavern.)

28
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,660
(Pure and Virtuous)

29
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,050
Braised chicken gizzards!

30
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,990
Serve the dish!

31
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,280
(Shen's Diner)
(But the most eye-catching place)

32
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,950
(in Juxian Alley recently is
the unassuming diner)

33
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,070
(my family and I opened.)

34
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,470
(Delicious, fragrant, and warm)
(Here,)

35
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,300
(we are cooking dishes)

36
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,660
(a thousand years ahead of our time,)

37
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,640
(and we have had a farcical story)

38
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,070
(with our ancestor...)

39
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,510
(the ancestor we thought we had.)

40
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,910
(Yes.)

41
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,420
(Welcome)
(We do not belong to this era,)

42
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,340
(but why exactly)

43
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,960
(Shen's Diner)
(are we opening a diner)

44
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,090
- (in Yong'an?)
- Come in.

45
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,030

46
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,870

Express delivery.

54
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,150
Dad, Mom,

Shen Gongcai.

59
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,600
- No more sleep, get up.
- Shen Jicai.

60
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,220
Do you even know I am your brother?

61
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,620
How disrespectful!

62
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,820
You scared me to death.

63
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,460
Then act like a brother.

64
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,540
The stuff has all arrived.

65
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,480
Hurry up and get ready.

66
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,020
Jicai,

67
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,660
is your video

68
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,420
going to take us back to ancient times

69
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,140
and cook for our ancestors?

70
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,540
Can this really work?

71
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,120
Absolutely.

72
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,060
I've put in all the savings
I made from writing

73
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,700
for that internet celebrity company.

74
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,100
But it's only enough for five episodes.

75
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,700
So, we can only succeed,

76
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,540
not fail.

77
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,500
We must make our diner a hit.

78
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,060
Get into costume.

79
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,440
Auntie, where are we going
to shoot the video?

80
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,020
(Shen's Diner)
To our ancestral home.

81
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,060
The very popular spot now,

85
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,860

(Portrait of Lin Yan)

88
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,140
Yangyang, come here.

89
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,620
I'm Shen Jianshe.

90
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,780
I brought my wife Li Fengxia,

91
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,260
our children Shaojie

92
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,300
and Shaoguang,

93
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,760
and our granddaughter Yangyang,

94
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,660
to pay our respects to our ancestors.

95
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,340
We hope you will bless

96
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,260
our Shen's Diner

97
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,660
with better business

98
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,620
and bring it back to life.

99
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,980
Grandma,

100
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,100
what kind of person

101
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,420
was our ancestor?

102
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,860
You should ask your father

103
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,900
and your aunt about that.

104
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,020
Your great-grandpa only told them.

105
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,500
Well.

106
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,900
You must remember

107
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,380
the story of our ancestor.

108
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,500
Over a thousand years ago,

109
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,500
Lin Yan,
Vice Prefect of Capital Prefecture,

110
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,420
came to the Capital to take office

111
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,900
and moved into Yunshui Manor.

112
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,980
Vice Prefect Lin

113
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,380
married into our family.

114
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,260
What happened next?

115
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,300
I'll tell you later.

116
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,140
Let's hurry up,

117
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,080
or we'll lose the light.

118
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,780
Exactly. Hurry up.

119
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,060
Jicai, don't we still need someone

120
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,580
to play our ancestor Lin Yan?

121
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,940
Wait here. I'll grab someone.

122
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,580
(We've been disconnected
for so many generations.)

123
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,380
(Who knows what happened in between?)

124
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,180
(Grabbing someone)

125
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,900
(shouldn't be offensive, right?)

126
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,820
What?

127
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,940
I'm at the Yunshui Manor.

128
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,220
I'll go find you later.

129
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,140
Alright, got it.

130
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,960
Is this okay?

131
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,170
Try another one. Change the pose.

132
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,100
Okay.

133
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,620
Hi, friend.

134
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,220
I'm not a bad person.

135
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,460
I just need a favor.

136
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,460
You...

137
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,780
Friend.

138
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,180
Friend?

139
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,100
Where did he go?

140
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,500
Hi?

141
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,900
Is anyone there?

142
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,940
Hello?

143
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:16,220
(Ancestral Temple, Kitchen)

144
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,820
Hi.

145
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,340
Handsome guy?

146
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,100
He left through the back door?

147
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,420
Everyone, watch closely.

148
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,290
Okay.

149
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,340
Eat.

150
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,060
Huamo is ready.

151
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,580
Isn't there a mountain
outside the back door?

152
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,220
What's going on here?

153
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,420
It smells so good.

154
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,860
Something's not right.

155
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,780
Is anyone here?

156
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,300
Anyone here?

157
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,420
Is anyone here?

158
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,300
Jicai!

159
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,420
- Jicai!
- Auntie!

160
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,860
- Over here.
- Jicai.

161
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,700
Auntie.

162
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,780
- Auntie.
- Jicai.

163
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,200
You scared me to death.

164
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,500
- Auntie.
- What's wrong?

165
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,780
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

166
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,860
Yunshui Manor is gone.

167
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,100
It's gone.

168
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,660
Yunshui Manor is gone?

169
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,220
How did you guys get here?

170
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,820
We were just looking for you.

171
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,060
There was a sudden fog.

172
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,770
Yes.

173
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,140
We were walking and ended up here.

174
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,060
There was the fog.

175
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,400
Auntie,

176
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,140
is this a new project
for the scenic spot?

177
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,620
Let me tell you, Jicai.

178
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,820
Don't worry.

179
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,860
This must be an event here.

180
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,940
We got in for free.

181
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,580
- Let's go.
- A flower cart parade.

182
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,740
It's really lively.

183
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,580
Let's check it out.

184
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,940
- So beautiful.
- This place.

185
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,500
Everyone is in ancient costumes.

186
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,380
Look, your clothes are still here.

187
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,220
Jicai.

188
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,700
This is so unique.

189
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,660
What kind of dance are they performing?

190
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,180
If I'm not mistaken,

191
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,540
this must be a large-scale

192
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,220
live-action role-playing game.

193
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,340
What's a role-playing game?

194
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,260
You don't know role-playing games?

195
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,300
Have you ever played one?

196
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,660
I haven't.

197
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,820
Let's go.

198
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,260
Look at all the money
they must've spent.

199
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,220
Quite a spectacle.

200
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,540
(Jinwu Guards Wanted Notice)
Look.

201
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,660
There's a wanted notice.

202
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,660
They drew a fat man.

203
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,260
This is so much fun.

204
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,580
- Look.
- How vivid.

205
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,340
(Jinwu Guards Wanted Notice)
These details.

206
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,900
- Jinwu...
- Really.

207
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,100
How to pronounce this?

208
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,940
Jicai.

209
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,980
Guard.

210
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,900
Isn't that the actor?

211
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,040
He looks so much like him.

212
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:19,740
Yes, he does.

213
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,300
- You don't get it.
- Just like him.

214
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,300
In a role-playing game,
they aren't called actors.

215
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,460
They're called NPC.

216
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,580
The Jinwu Guards are working.

217
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,980
Make way.

218
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,940
The game has started.

219
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,780
It has started.

220
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,700
- Good.
- Good.

221
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,000
The acting is so good.

222
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,140
- It feels real.
- Yes, Dad.

223
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,540
It does feel very real.

224
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,820
Look at their performance.

225
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,580
Dad, Mom,

226
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,300
something feels off to me.

227
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,180
You guys have never played this game.

228
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,390
- Too sensitive.
- Amazing.

229
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,180
- Wow.
- So good.

230
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,100
It must be fake.

231
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,740
The blood is

232
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,860
- just ketchup.
- Gongcai...

233
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,130
Time to get off work.

234
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,140
- Gongcai, what's wrong?
- Dad.

235
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,260
- Dad.
- He's dead.

236
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,580
Dad, I'm scared.

237
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,610
Dead?

238
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,660
Make way, make way.

239
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,280
Yangyang, hurry.

240
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,980
- Don't obstruct official duties.
- Dad.

241
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,920
- Yangyang.
- Yangyang.

242
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,300
- Drag him back.
- Come here.

243
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,440
- Yes.
- What are you doing?

244
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,700
How could this be real death?

245
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,640
Run!

246
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,480
To the police station.

247
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,540
To the police station!

248
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,940
Hey,

249
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,860
where is the police station?

250
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,800
There's a dead person.

251
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,940
We need to report it.

252
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,300
Sir, what are you saying?

253
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,360
You must be too scared.

254
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,580
They are arresting a thief.

255
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,520
They have to kill him.

256
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,700
You guys should leave.

257
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,520
Once it gets dark,

258
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,460
there will be a curfew.

259
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,740
I'm leaving first.

260
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,420
Isn't this a role-playing game?

261
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,140
Isn't this supposed to be a game?

262
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,900
What's going on?

263
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,580
Ouch.

264
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,780
What are you doing?

265
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,300
This isn't a dream.

266
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,400
- It's not a dream.
- What's happening?

267
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,300
We...

268
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,500
Could it be

269
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,620
we've time-traveled?

270
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,100
Time-traveled?

271
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,940
If I'm not mistaken,

272
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,820
this is

273
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,300
Yong'an.

274
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,220
(Minfu Inn)

275
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,780
(Minfu Inn)

276
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,420
This really is Yong'an.

277
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,780
Heavenly blessings.

278
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,220
What are you talking about?

279
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,540
We've time-traveled.

280
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,820
We need a standard room.

281
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,940
We...

282
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,900
We'll squeeze into one.

283
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,380
What do you mean?

284
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,500
A room.

285
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,420
A small one will do.

286
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,420
Yes, yes.

287
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,380
Mom.

288
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,420
Well.

289
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,780
Can we use this to pay for the room?

290
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,140
It's pure 24-karat gold.

291
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,300
Yes, no problem.

292
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,860
That's great.

293
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,900
(Earth Room 1)

294
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,300
The challenge we faced today

295
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,300
is the most severe one

296
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,460
our family has ever encountered.

297
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,980
So, today's family meeting

298
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,420
is to discuss

299
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,140
what we should do next.

300
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,420
Shen Jianshe,

301
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,580
you start with some constructive advice.

302
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,780
I'll just say a few things briefly.

303
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,140
The challenge we faced today

304
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,940
is the most severe one

305
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,300
our family has ever encountered.

306
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,140
We need to look at this issue

307
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,980
comprehensively and objectively.

308
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,620
As for what

309
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,260
we should do next,

310
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,500
I think we should go back first.

311
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,780
That's it?

312
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,820
That's it.

313
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,020
All nonsense.

314
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,300
I knew I couldn't count on you.

315
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,780
Hey, Shen Gongcai.

316
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,780
Give your opinion.

317
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,300
How to go back

318
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,820
is especially important.

319
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,460
We need to analyze it carefully,

320
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,500
but I really can't come up
with anything.

321
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,820
Fortunately, Jicai came with us.

322
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,080
She's good at history.

323
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,740
She knows
how to exchange gold for money.

324
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,220
Otherwise, we might all be in jail now.

325
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,580
All nonsense.

326
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,660
I knew I couldn't count on you.

327
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,740
Dear, let me discipline him for you.

328
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,820
If you don't speak,
no one will think you're mute.

329
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,540
Jicai,

330
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,940
you tell us.

331
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,260
Based on the map we saw

332
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,460
at Yunshui Manor,

333
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,580
the manor is in that direction.

334
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,900
Since we came through Yunshui Manor,

335
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,920
we need to go there
to figure something out.

336
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,060
Yunshui Manor...

337
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,290
(Yunshui Manor)

338
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,620
Round 1.

339
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,140
Can this get us in?

340
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,260
We have to try.

341
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,140
Stop!

342
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,980
This is the private residence
of the Vice Prefect.

343
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,900
You can't enter.

344
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,340
Sir,

345
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,740
please let us in.

346
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,780
This is pure 24-karat gold.

347
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,700
Go!

348
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,100
Why would you risk bribery

349
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,180
just to break into the mansion

350
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,020
of the Vice Prefect?

351
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,300
Don't get excited.

352
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,980
My mother has hysteria.

353
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,380
I'm taking her home right away.

354
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,940
You're about to have an episode.

355
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,580
Let's go home.

356
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,660
(Day 3)

357
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,380
- Here.
- Thank you.

358
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,220
Take it.

359
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,460
Round 2.

360
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,740
Did you see anything?

361
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,660
What are you doing?

362
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,940
It's none of my business.

363
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,460
- Stop!
- None of my business.

364
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,300
Stop!

365
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,220
Gongcai!

366
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,060
(Day 5)

367
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,900
Here.

368
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,570
Round 3.

369
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,140
It seems no one's around.

370
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,660
If no one's here, move aside.

371
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,500
Let me do it.

372
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,620
Hurry, hurry.

373
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,220
(Day...)

374
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,700
We don't have much money left.

375
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,380
Let's save

376
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,900
half of this pancake for tomorrow.

377
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,460
Eating pancakes every day.

378
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,900
I'm about to go crazy.

379
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,820
I really can't eat another bite.

380
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,740
You won't eat it?

381
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,060
Then let me have it.

382
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,780
Having pancakes is not bad at all.

383
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,860
Besides,

384
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,020
right now, our whole family

385
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,580
is relying on your mom's

386
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,940
gold jewelry.

387
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,220
We have to save.

388
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,060
Isn't that right, Fengxia?

389
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,740
That makes sense.

390
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,140
Everyone, I've found out
from the shopkeeper

391
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,320
that our ancestor Lin Yan

392
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,300
is about to take office

393
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,580
and will soon enter the Capital.

394
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,420
Really?

395
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,220
That's great!

396
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,660
He should be responsible for us.

397
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,860
He can't just bring us into this world
and ignore us.

398
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,700
Everyone,

399
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,180
hope is coming.

400
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,490
Let's have a meeting.

401
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,700
A meeting.

402
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,500
Jicai.

403
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,340
Come and sit here.

404
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,010
- Jicai.
- I'm fine where.

405
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,060
- We need to talk.
- Dad.

406
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,060
- What for?
- The usual.

407
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,250
It's nothing.

408
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,420
Auntie, come here.

409
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,140
- Listen to me.
- Okay.

410
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,860
Before, the master wasn't home,

411
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,740
so the guards

412
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,980
didn't dare let us in.

413
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,660
If Lin Yan arrives,

414
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,460
and we get close to him,

415
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,380
then we might have a chance to go home.

416
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,340
That's what I mean.

417
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,740
Now, there's a more serious problem.

418
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,220
What problem?

419
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,340
Gold

420
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,940
will eventually run out.

421
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,620
We'll soon have no money left.

422
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,820
We need to find a way
to make some money.

423
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,940
Shen Jianshe,

424
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,660
I hope you can give

425
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,780
some constructive ideas
on how to make money.

426
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,980
Me?

427
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,540
Well.

428
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,500
Why is it always me?

429
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,180
Well, I think

430
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,540
making money

431
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,860
is out of the question.

432
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,780
We just have to save money.

433
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,020
To save money, you have to eat less.

434
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,980
If you eat less, you move less.

435
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,000
Best not to move at all.

436
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,580
If you don't move, you won't be hungry.

437
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,340
If you're not hungry,
you won't spend money.

438
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,380
Listen

439
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,620
to what you're saying.

440
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,660
Do you realize now

441
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,900
how you managed

442
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,420
to ruin our diner?

443
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,540
Is that thing on your neck

444
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,740
just for show?

445
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,420
What kind of silly idea is that?

446
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,860
Mom, no, no.

447
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,260
Don't get worked up.

448
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,100
What Dad is trying to say

449
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,140
is about cutting expenses

450
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,580
and increasing income.

451
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,580
Well.

452
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,420
Dad is just not very articulate.

453
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,340
Dad, that's not right.

454
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,940
Get up.

455
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,760
What are you saying?
Mom has explained it,

456
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,020
and you still don't understand?

457
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,140
At such a critical moment,

458
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,260
how can you say that?

459
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,140
As usual.

460
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,340
I just spoke up for you again.

461
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,460
Give me another 20.

462
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,700
I don't have any money.

463
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,820
Will you give it to me?

464
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,100
I really don't have any.

465
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,860
Mom, what Dad actually meant...

466
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,700
Gongcai.

467
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,140
You just made

468
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,500
a point.

469
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,300
What Dad actually meant

470
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,100
was that he should've brought

471
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,540
some gold or silver

472
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,080
to ease our worries, right?

473
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,220
- Yes.
- He meant that.

474
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,460
Could he have thought of that?

475
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,860
- I was just thinking.
- Gold?

476
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,460
I have gold, too.

477
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,460
Great-grandpa gave it to me.

478
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,260
Before our ancestor takes office,

479
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,140
we need to find a way to survive.

480
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,020
How about

481
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,380
going back to the old business?

482
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,220
Why don't we

483
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,940
set up a small stall

484
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,220
and sell some snacks?

485
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,500
I can do that.

486
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,260
Can we make Jianbing Guozi?

487
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,140
I love Jianbing Guozi the most.

488
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,940
That's a good idea.

489
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,500
Let's split up.

490
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,960
Yangyang and I will try
to get close to our ancestor

491
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,360
and find a way into Yunshui Manor.

492
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,340
You guys set up the stall
and make money.

493
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,860
I've got an idea

494
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,760
that's sure
to make Jianbing Guozi a hit.

495
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,660
(Xuanzheng Hall)

496
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,780
I've heard that the newly appointed
Vice Prefect Lin Yan

497
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,660
is not from a prestigious family,

498
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,580
nor did he study
under any famous mentors.

499
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,700
He's made his way up

500
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,420
entirely on his own merits

501
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,660
without any patronage.

502
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,220
His Majesty has promoted him
by exception

503
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,060
and even granted him
a jade belt and a gold fish token,

504
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,500
making him like a Rank III official.

505
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,200
I've also heard

506
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,900
that His Majesty
even decided his salary,

507
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,860
equivalent to a Rank II official.

508
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,820
(Lin Yan, Vice Prefect
of Capital Prefecture)

509
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:19,380
Mr. Lin is extremely talented
and handsome.

510
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,980
(Mr. Meng, Left Supervisor)
Your granddaughter

511
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,500
is of marriageable age.

512
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,420
Why don't you ask him?

513
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,960
There will be so many suitors

514
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,500
that his doorstep will be worn down.

515
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,700
I'm afraid

516
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,340
I can't match up.

517
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,540
You must be joking.

518
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,220
- Vice Prefect Lin.
- Vice Prefect Lin.

519
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,300
You flatter me.

520
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,540
We're outside the hall.

521
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,380
I'm the junior here.

522
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,500
I should greet you all first.

523
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,340
It's fine.

524
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,900
His Majesty is not feeling well today,

525
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,900
so please go back.

526
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,900
His Majesty won't listen
to reports today.

527
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,420
Vice Prefect Lin, wait a moment.

528
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,580
His Majesty has asked you to see him.

529
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,940
(Emperor Yuanfeng)

530
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,500
Your Majesty.

531
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,060
Since you're unwell,

532
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,180
you should rest.

533
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,420
Why call me to play Chupu?

534
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,820
Eunuch Qin, please take it away.

535
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,180
Don't.

536
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,820
Alright, alright.

537
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,860
I won't cheat.

538
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,300
Just finish this game.

539
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,140
I'm already in the Capital.

540
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,020
I'm ready to play anytime.

541
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,460
But right now,

542
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,720
there's something more important
I need to report.

543
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,380
You're using official business
to block me.

544
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,740
Go ahead.

545
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,740
You asked me to handle
the embezzlement case

546
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,500
of disaster relief funds
in Huaiyuan County.

547
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,980
The ringleader is the local magistrate.

548
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,300
He wanted to redeem his crime with gold,

549
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,340
but I rejected it.

550
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,380
He was beheaded two days ago.

551
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,660
You've done a good job.

552
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,020
But the surname of this magistrate

553
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,500
is Dou,

554
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,940
and he is a relative
of Noble Consort Dou.

555
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,660
Lin Yan,

556
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,300
how dare you!

557
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,020
Please let me explain.

558
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,800
The amount of pepper stored
in Magistrate Dou's residence

559
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,460
is enormous,

560
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,220
enough to supply
the East and West Areas for four years.

561
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,380
The price of pepper per jin

562
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,640
is far more valuable than gold.

563
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,020
At that time,
the displaced people suffered greatly.

564
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,300
The commoners couldn't get food,

565
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,860
and even exchanged children for food.

566
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,500
If such a huge embezzler
could be spared from death,

567
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,500
I really don't know

568
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,660
how to convince the people.

569
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,380
This case has been investigated
for years without results.

570
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,500
How did you get the evidence?

571
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,540
Under Magistrate Dou,

572
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,220
there was a Yun,

573
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,980
who was a love-struck fool.

574
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,500
How dare you torture me?

575
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,820
When I get out of here,

576
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,260
I'll kill you first.

577
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,780
Mr. Yun,

578
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,860
how could I torture you?

579
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,900
It's just that there is something

580
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,060
that is not convenient
to show in public,

581
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,620
so I invited you

582
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,260
for a private talk.

583
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,580
Familiar?

584
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,900
How did this letter end up with you?

585
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,220
Give it to me.

586
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,540
Give it to me!

587
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,860
(Dear, ever since I saw you,
my mind has been restless.)

588
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,580
You've been following Magistrate Dou
for such a long time

589
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,820
that you've fallen in love
with his concubine.

590
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,580
Guess.

591
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,420
How would he treat you?

592
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,220
Why not

593
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,580
hand over the evidence

594
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,300
and send him on his way?

595
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,580
Then,

596
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,540
you can be together

597
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,860
with your beloved.

598
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,820
What a disappointment.

599
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,540
Well.

600
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,100
It's only right to execute
the ringleader

601
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,220
of the embezzlement case.

602
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,980
Just now, you mentioned
the East and West Areas.

603
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,820
It seems you know

604
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,620
the annual expenses there.

605
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,700
You must've done some homework
before taking office.

606
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,860
Han people
and other ethnic groups trade there.

607
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,800
Everyone can be there.

608
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,320
Officials and eunuchs engage

609
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,200
in business there
for profit under a pretense.

610
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,440
The situation is complicated.

611
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,060
To do things in the Capital,

612
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,340
it is crucial

613
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,620
to control those areas.

614
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,460
The previous Prefects
of Capital Prefecture

615
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,860
have all resigned.

616
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,340
They were worried

617
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,140
that they couldn't get through
the key points.

618
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,060
If you were in charge,

619
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,700
what would you do?

620
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,280
Food matters the most to the people.

621
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,900
I want to start with Juxian Alley,

622
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,420
which is famous for its food,

623
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,740
starting with the small things.

624
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,980
Quite a few people in the court

625
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,500
see you as a thorn in their side,

626
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,460
but I

627
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,660
have high hopes for you.

628
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,940
You must control the Areas,

629
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,420
but do not rush.

630
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,500
For now, mainly conduct inspections.

631
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,060
Once you have secured your position,

632
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,900
you can take action.

633
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,300
I am willing to serve you.

634
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,180
(Liu Chang, Lin Yan's attendant)

635
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,780
Young Master,

636
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,220
Juxian Alley is just ahead.

637
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,980
Shall we go down and inspect?

638
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,100
(Juxian Alley)

639
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,460
Come on, passers-by,

640
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,780
(Jianbing Guozi)
don't miss out.

641
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,820
Take a look, have a look.

642
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,060
The one-of-a-kind pancake of Yong'an,

643
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,580
Jianbing Guozi.

644
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,860
Take a look.

645
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,980
Come on, everyone.

646
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,620
Take a look, have a look.

647
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:38,980
Today,

648
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,620
the Shen Jianbing Guozi Auction

649
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,340
officially begins.

650
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,420
Starting bid at five qian

651
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,500
for one Jianbing Guozi.

652
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,780
Limited quantity.

653
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,060
First come, first served.

654
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,500
What do you mean by bidding?

655
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,820
What's a starting bid?

656
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,460
That means the initial price

657
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,300
of this

658
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,340
is five qian.

659
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,540
What if other customers also want it?

660
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,860
You can openly bid higher.

661
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,980
The highest bidder wins.

662
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,580
Highest bidder wins?

663
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,240
This is just taking advantage of us.

664
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,100
Five qian is already a lot,
and you want more?

665
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,020
Let's go.

666
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,460
Wait, wait, everyone.

667
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,180
Calm down.

668
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,580
Do you know

669
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,140
who my dad...

670
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,620
Father.

671
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,140
My father.

672
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,420
Do you know who he is?

673
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,700
Let me tell you.

674
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,860
He is the master

675
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,100
of cuisine across time,

676
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,620
the only one of his kind in the world,

677
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,820
and the undisputed ruler

678
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,940
of the pancake realm.

679
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,420
Is that true?

680
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,580
That's amazing.

681
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,980
Of course, it's that amazing.

682
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,580
And look at this dish.

683
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,100
It's called Jianbing Guozi.

684
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,340
Have you ever heard of it before?

685
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,260
I haven't.

686
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,200
That's because my father

687
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,900
once traveled the world

688
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,340
and visited

689
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,060
a legendary place

690
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,020
called

691
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,060
Tianjin.

692
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,500
Where is that?

693
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,940
It is

694
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,980
an extremely prosperous port.

695
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,420
What's Tianjin?

696
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,460
Never heard of it.

697
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,330
Going to Tianjin

698
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,980
is like facing 81 tribulations.

699
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,260
Back in the day,

700
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,820
my father, with my mother,

701
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,060
my sister, and my daughter,

702
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,060
went through a lot.

703
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,820
♪You carry the load♪

704
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,260
♪I lead the horse♪

705
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,140
That's interesting.

706
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,740
♪We welcome the sunrise♪

707
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:29,100
♪We bid farewell to Fengxia♪

708
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,500
Farewell to the evening glow.

709
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,590
After all the difficulties,

710
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,280
they arrived in Tianjin.

711
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,540
On a whim,

712
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,900
they combined pancakes

713
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,460
with the locals' favorite fruit.

714
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,460
What's this?

715
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,460
It's crispy and delicious.

716
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,820
And thus, they combined together.

717
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,100
The greatest

718
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,300
culinary creation in history,

719
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,820
Jianbing Guozi, was born.

720
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,740
That's amazing.

721
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,700
Great, great.

722
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,180
- This is good.
- Good.

723
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,220
Jianbing Guozi is

724
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,860
really something new.

725
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,060
It smells so good.

726
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,740
I'll bid five qian

727
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,100
to give it a try.

728
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,980
Excuse me, sir.

729
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,620
Didn't we just agree?

730
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,100
Our pancake

731
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,580
is for auction.

732
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,140
- Auction?
- Starting at five qian.

733
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,380
And our Chef Shen

734
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,660
can only make five pancakes a day.

735
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,140
At most one every two hours.

736
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,620
So, if both of you

737
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,140
want to try this pancake,

738
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,580
you'll have to bid higher.

739
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,740
Bid higher.

740
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,900
He doesn't want it; I do.

741
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,740
No, no.

742
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,540
I didn't say I don't want it.

743
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,540
- I bid
- Queue up.

744
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,570
- six qian.
- Okay.

745
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,780
Six qian.

746
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,420
It's already six qian.

747
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,300
I'll bid eight.

748
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,080
Eight qian.

749
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,780
- Is that the final bid?
- I'll bid ten.

750
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,300
Ten qian, ten qian.

751
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,940
- Any more bids?
- 11 qian.

752
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,340
This stall here

753
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,580
is using some tricks.

754
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,780
It's just taking advantage
of these commoners

755
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,940
who don't know

756
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,760
that there's no such port
called Tianjin.

757
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,940
- 11 qian.
- I'll bid 12.

758
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,940
12 qian.

759
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,780
I'll bid 12 qian.

760
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,260
(Divine Pancake)
(The ancestor returns home today.)

761
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,420
(I'll definitely run into him here.)

762
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,500
Auntie,

763
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,660
are we setting up this stall

764
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,980
to wait for our ancestor?

765
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,140
Yes.

766
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,460
We're making delicious food
right at his doorstep

767
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,020
to catch his attention,

768
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,300
do business with him,

769
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,500
befriend him,

770
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,500
and then get invited to his home.

771
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,420
But Auntie,

772
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,580
have you thought

773
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,940
that what if our ancestor

774
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,780
doesn't like Jianbing Guozi?

775
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,260
Our family has loved Jianbing Guozi

776
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,580
for three generations.

777
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,220
It's in our genes.

778
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,820
The ancestor

779
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,920
(Yunshui Manor)
will surely like it.

780
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,140
You...

781
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,220
- What?
- Young Master.

782
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,140
Sir,

783
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,260
I have a few questions for you.

784
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,460
- This?
- You...

785
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,780
The batter is made from flour.

786
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,100
You can buy a peck for 20 qian.

787
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,620
Scallions cost two qian a bunch.

788
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,540
Sesame and salt are more expensive,

789
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,700
but it doesn't cost much.

790
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,060
Why does this pancake

791
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,180
have to be 12 qian each?

792
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,580
What's wrong with you?

793
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,500
Are you just causing trouble?

794
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,180
Inflating the market price.

795
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,200
If this is reported
to the Market Office,

796
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,740
it won't be a small matter.

797
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,580
Threatening me?

798
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,160
Do you think I was raised to be scared?

799
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,580
What Market Office?

800
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,300
- Fengxia.
- Why grab me?

801
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,700
- This...
- Ancestor...

802
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,940
- What ancestor?
- Ancestor...

803
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,140
The portrait in the ancestral hall.

804
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,980
The ancestral hall?

805
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,240
- The portrait?
- The portrait.

806
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,260
- In that case,
- Look.

807
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,620
I'll go report it.

808
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,940
So much money.

809
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,780
Exactly.

810
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,500
Unscrupulous merchants.

811
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,830
Exactly.

812
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,780
Calm down, calm down.

813
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,100
- I...
- Be normal.

814
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,780
My ancestor.

815
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,940
Vice Prefect Lin.

816
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,260
Vice Prefect Lin, please wait.

817
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,380
Vice Prefect Lin.

818
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,180
I'm sorry.

819
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,020
Vice Prefect Lin.

820
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,140
We didn't mean it.

821
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,820
We're just running a small business,

822
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,820
trying to make a bit more money.

823
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,820
Could you

824
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,340
give us another chance?

825
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,780
My name is Shen Jianshe.

826
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,740
Today,

827
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:06,620
I'm truly honored to meet you.

828
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,940
Be normal.

829
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,140
Calm down.

830
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,140
Ma'am,

831
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,900
you know me?

832
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,260
I didn't recognize you at first,

833
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,580
but after a second look,

834
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,470
you're a person of extraordinary talent.

835
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,280
You impressed me.

836
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,020
How could I not recognize you?

837
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,140
A person of extraordinary talent.

838
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,660
Talented indeed.

839
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,260
Alive...

840
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,100
Vice Prefect, a misunderstanding.

841
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,260
I was wrong.

842
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,420
At least you know that.

843
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,020
I'll give you another chance.

844
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,340
Restore the normal market price,

845
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,190
and never do it again.

846
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,060
Otherwise,

847
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,700
I'll go to the Market Office

848
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,900
and convict you.

849
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:47,940
- Okay.
- Vice Prefect.

850
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,780
You decide.

851
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,640
They were

852
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,500
just joking with you.

853
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,860
These pancakes

854
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,940
are all one qian each.

855
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,780
- One?
- Okay.

856
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,220
- One qian?
- That's right.

857
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,220
That's right.

858
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,220
Go, go, go.

859
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,620
Ancestor.

860
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,500
Am I dreaming?

861
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,900
We saw our ancestor here.

862
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,990
I'll take one, please.

863
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,460
My goodness.

864
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,820
Ancestor.

865
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,920
No pushing.

866
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,540
No need to rush; everyone will get some.

867
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,380
My shoe fell off.

868
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,060
Don't worry; everyone will get some.

869
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,020
Auntie.

870
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,060
Please make way.

871
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,220
Excuse me.

872
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,820
I haven't bought yet.

873
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,090
- Auntie.
- Don't leave.

874
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,340
I still want to buy.

875
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,110
- Vice Prefect, wait.
- Don't leave.

876
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,940
Be careful!
