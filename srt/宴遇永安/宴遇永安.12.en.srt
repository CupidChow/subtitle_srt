3
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Here it comes!

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hurry up and eat!

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But I'll take care of it myself!

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Sure!

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Here's another one.

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Recently, the whole Dongxi City is busy with business.

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We need your cooperation.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I will also ask for your help.

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Young Master, we should work hard.

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
How can we let you help us?

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Right?

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes!

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's settled then.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No need to refuse.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Thank you, Young Master.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Young Master Lin.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Greetings, Young Master.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I didn't expect you to be busy in the middle of the autumn.

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I have work to do.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I can't be late.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But it's the middle of the autumn.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You should relax.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The osmanthus flowers in the Princess Royal's mansion are blooming.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The Princess Royal ordered me to come and ask you to come and enjoy the osmanthus flowers.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm sorry for your concern.

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But I can't be of any help.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm afraid I can't follow your order.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
After this, I will personally go to the palace to apologize.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
In that case, I won't bother you.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Take care.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If I remember correctly,

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
it's the third time that the Princess Royal comes to invite us.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Don't be too busy.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What's wrong?

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Young Master looks like Song Yu.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If I were a lady, I would like to be like her.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Right?

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes!

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hu, I'm not talking about you.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If you were a lady, you would be so hot.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
How can Young Master look at you?

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What's wrong?

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why is he so hot?

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Is he my Young Master?

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Why are you so happy?

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The osmanthus flowers are here.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Come on.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I prepared some jade balls for everyone.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Come on.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Hurry up and try it.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Come on. Open it.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Open it.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
There are jujube, osmanthus, and pear.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If you like to eat, take it.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
My daughter thought of this.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
She said this is called a band's money.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's the same as the money you get from the temple.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
When you get the band,

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
you get your own band's money.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The outside is money, and the inside is money.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What a coincidence!

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Good.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The moon shines bright and the people are happy.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The one who holds the band will get a good husband.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
A good husband!

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
A good husband!

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Good!

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's great!

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Although Young Master has been here for a short time,

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
the one who wants to marry him

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
can be from the east of Yongan City to the west of the city.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Young Master, I want to ask you.

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What kind of person do you like?

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Tell us.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Young Master,

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
even if you want to be a natural god,

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
it's not too much.

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Tell us.

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yes.

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What are you going to tell us?

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Young Master, I'm also curious.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What kind of person do you like?

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Tell us.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Why are you looking at me?

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What are you doing?

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You like me?

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Stop talking nonsense.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You...

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Why are you laughing?

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm just kidding.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'll introduce you to this band.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
There must be good music in it.

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
According to your order,

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
the people of the Jingzhao family have already gone back to repair the tomb.

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The whole thing will be dealt with again after the Mid-Autumn Festival.

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Young Master, let's go back and rest.

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Liu Chang,

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
since I took the post,

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I've been very polite and direct

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
as the young master of Jingzhao.

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But I've read the files over and over again.

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
All the evidence is that my father is guilty.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I haven't been able to get into the battle today.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
This case is complicated.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's hard to understand.

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We've been waiting for so many years.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's not too late.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I understand.

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Liu Chang,

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
go back to the Yuan Shui Garden first.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You can still feel the heat.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Young Master, it's the Mid-Autumn Festival today.

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You can't...

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You can go back first.

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Then you come back early.

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Liu Chang

120
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Auntie, the dinner is ready.

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Be careful.

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Go home early and cook me some meatball.

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Okay.

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Today, we'll have a good dinner.

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
We'll have a good dinner.

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We'll go home and celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival.

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Okay, Auntie.

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
We'll have meatball tonight.

129
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We'll eat sweet and sour.

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay.

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Dad, is this delicious?

132
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's delicious.

133
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Auntie,

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
try it.

135
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
How do you sing the next line?

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:49,400
The beautiful and beautiful

137
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,000
Everyone is busy.

138
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
My husband has a meeting today.

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He's not here.

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
My husband has work to do today.

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Let's not prepare dinner for him.

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay.

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay, I got it.

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What kind of doctor is he?

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't know if he cares about me.

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He's a heartless man.

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Liu Chang,

148
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
wait.

149
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Wait.

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Wait.

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Wait.

152
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Wait.

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Try it.

154
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
How is it?

155
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Thank you, wife.

156
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
One for Grandpa.

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
One for Mom.

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Thank you.

159
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
One for me.

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Ah Che is so good.

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This piece is very good.

162
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's a good match for fat and skinny.

163
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Eat it for Ah Che first.

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Grandpa gave it to Mom.

165
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I won't eat it.

166
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Auntie,

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
this is a gift from us.

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Wow, so awesome.

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You must invite him to eat it.

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Young Master.

171
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Young Master.

172
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Don't be busy.

173
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Come and eat.

174
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's Mid-Autumn Festival.

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Let's get together.

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We'll get together after we finish eating.

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Get together.

178
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Come on.

179
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Come on.

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Come on.

181
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
There are so many delicious dishes.

182
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Come on, Young Master.

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This is for you, Uncle Liu Chang.

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

185
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Oh.

186
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Come on, let's get together.

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Come on.

188
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Come on.

189
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

190
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

191
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yang Yang is so smart.

193
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
If I had a daughter like you,

194
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I would pick up the round moon

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and send it to you.

196
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Don't worry.

197
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You'll have one sooner or later.

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Really?

199
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Come on, Young Master.

200
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Eat a chicken wing.

201
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Eat.

202
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Come on, try it.

203
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Thank you.

204
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Okay, try it.

205
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Come on, Yang Yang.

206
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What are you doing?

207
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Your neck...

208
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You're so round.

209
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You're so cute.

210
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yang Yang.

211
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yang Yang.

212
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Come on, Yang Yang.

213
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Be careful not to hurt your hand.

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Okay.

215
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Come on, Yang Yang.

216
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Eat some vegetables.

217
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Come on, Yang Yang.

218
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll give you this.

219
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Young Master, are you worried about something?

220
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

221
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We should have a reunion.

222
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
My husband will miss his family.

223
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Liu Cheng, eat.

224
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's delicious.

225
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Mom, dad,

226
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
do you remember when my grandfather

227
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and I were not happy

228
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
when my uncle passed away?

229
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yes, I do.

230
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But you were too young.

231
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You can't understand why

232
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
we can't see our father from now on.

233
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Then you lied to us.

234
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You said that when people died,

235
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
they became stars in the sky

236
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and looked at us forever.

237
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But you let A Ji expose it.

238
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You said that stars are stars.

239
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
They are not human beings.

240
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Young Master, I'm sorry to make you laugh.

241
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Because A Ji has been reading since childhood.

242
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's hard for her to lie.

243
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So, her grandfather and I

244
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
can only tell the truth.

245
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Look,

246
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
people died and they are gone.

247
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Those words are for the living.

248
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The people who left

249
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
must love you very much.

250
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
They don't want you to feel pain

251
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
when they leave.

252
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
They want you to be happy

253
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
every day.

254
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yes, yes, yes.

255
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
We should be happy every day.

256
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yes.

257
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Thank you.

258
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Feng Xia and I

259
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
never had any differences.

260
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The reason why I can

261
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
educate you so well today

262
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
is because your mother is very good.

263
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Since the day you married me,

264
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I knew that I had a good wife.

265
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I didn't choose the wrong one.

266
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You don't know that

267
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
at that time, my family was poor.

268
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I could only give her two thousand and fifty cents a month.

269
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Just this little two thousand and fifty cents,

270
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
your mother made the food

271
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and the dishes of the whole family.

272
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
At that time, I knew that

273
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I married a good wife

274
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
who could spend the rest of her life with me.

275
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I give you a toast.

276
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Feng Xia, I love you.

277
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Come on.

278
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You live with me

279
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
because of the money you give us every month.

280
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I can cook for you

281
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
very well, right?

282
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
No.

283
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You misunderstood me.

284
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I mean

285
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
your mother loved me so much

286
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
when I was poor.

287
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's different now.

288
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Now we have money.

289
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's totally different from that time.

290
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Look at your mother.

291
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
She wears a crown like a chicken.

292
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The crown on her body

293
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
is not expensive.

294
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Dad, I bought the crown and the flute

295
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
myself.

296
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What does it have to do with you?

297
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
How did you buy it?

298
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Right?

299
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I must have bought it.

300
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Right?

301
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Who cooked the dishes

302
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
in the kitchen?

303
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I don't know.

304
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Fried, fried, fried, cooked, cooked,

305
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
and cooked.

306
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I cooked them.

307
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
How can you say that?

308
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Pork, stir-fried dishes,

309
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
which of these are not your daughter's idea?

310
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Grandma.

311
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Besides,

312
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
you haven't eaten them before.

313
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It must have something to do with money.

314
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You can say you used to be.

315
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You didn't make money before.

316
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I never disliked you.

317
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
At least you used to be calm and modest.

318
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Look at you.

319
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Look at you.

320
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Look at you.

321
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Look at you.

322
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Look at you.

323
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Grandma.

324
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You can't see me as good

325
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
or as talented as me.

326
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Why?

327
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You don't improve.

328
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Right?

329
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You are jealous.

330
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I am jealous.

331
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Dad.

332
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Isn't that so?

333
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Shen Jianshe,

334
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
you really make me laugh.

335
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I can't even laugh.

336
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
What's wrong?

337
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I can't improve, right?

338
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I don't improve.

339
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Okay.

340
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Let's divorce.

341
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Who said you are good?

342
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Who are you looking for?

343
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Mom.

344
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Grandma.

345
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's okay.

346
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
How can you say that?

347
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's not right to be so impulsive.

348
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I told you when we got married.

349
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
No matter when,

350
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
no matter who is right or wrong,

351
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
you can't say that.

352
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Don't be impulsive.

353
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Say it properly.

354
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Tell your mom

355
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
to take back what she said.

356
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Don't be afraid.

357
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

358
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What?

359
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Why should I take it back?

360
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Why shouldn't you take it back?

361
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I didn't hear it.

362
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Uncle, auntie.

363
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Calm down.

364
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What on earth are you going to do?

365
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You.

366
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What are you going to do?

367
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What on earth are you going to do?

368
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Do you want to divorce?

369
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What are you doing?

370
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Do you really want to divorce?

371
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You dare to laugh at me?

372
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You hit me.

373
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You want to divorce?

374
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Okay.

375
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Divorce.

376
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Uncle, auntie.

377
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Uncle.

378
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Aunt, don't cry.

379
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's a big deal to divorce.

380
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Don't cry.

381
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Don't be too hasty because of your face.

382
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's not a matter of face.

383
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

384
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's not easy for everyone to have a meal together.

385
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Look what she said.

386
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What did you say?

387
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Okay, Yangyang.

388
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You're being reasonable.

389
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yangyang, don't cry.

390
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Don't cry.

391
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Yangyang, don't cry.

392
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yangyang, go back with grandma.

393
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I won't cry.

394
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Mother.

395
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Let's go.

396
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What are you going to do?

397
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Let's go.

398
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Don't come back.

399
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Go to the restaurant.

400
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Mom.

401
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I won't go back.

402
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm not Shen Jianshe anymore.

403
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm not Shen Jianshe anymore.

404
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Dad, dad, dad.

405
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Dad.

406
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Who am I?

407
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm the best chef in Yongan.

408
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Liu Chang, go and see this.

409
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What are you doing?

410
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What are you doing?

411
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Dad.

412
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Dad.

413
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Dad.

414
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Dad.

415
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Dad.

416
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Dad.

417
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Dad.

418
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Dad.

419
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Dad.

420
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Dad.

421
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What's going on?

422
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Mom.

423
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
No.

424
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Are you going to eat or not?

425
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yangyang.

426
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Mom.

427
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Don't be angry.

428
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Don't be angry.

429
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm sorry.

430
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I made a good night like this.

431
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I wanted to spend a good Mid-Autumn Festival with you.

432
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
But you made fun of me.

433
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Do you think you live in Yunshui Garden

434
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
so I'm just your housekeeper?

435
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Or do you think you're doing business

436
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
with me?

437
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm working in the Palace of Zhao.

438
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So I'm a person

439
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
you can flatter.

440
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
No, absolutely not.

441
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We treat Young Master as family.

442
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Me too.

443
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You know I have a problem with my household.

444
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's okay if it doesn't work.

445
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Once it's exposed, it's a deceit.

446
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You didn't take advantage of this

447
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
and ask for benefits from me.

448
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Instead, you always look after me and help me.

449
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You can accept my displeasure.

450
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Why do you think your parents are fighting?

451
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'll laugh at you.

452
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's not that I laugh at others.

453
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's my problem.

454
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I think it's a joke.

455
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Do you think I can treat you like a book?

456
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You're not Young Master

457
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
if you're separated from me.

458
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You're my hole.

459
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Hole?

460
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm the hole on the tree?

461
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
No.

462
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The hole is that

463
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Young Master is someone

464
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I can tell my troubles and secrets

465
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
to and trust.

466
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I see.

467
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Before I came to Yongan,

468
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
my family was poor.

469
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
My mother took a lot of responsibility.

470
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
My father couldn't make money,

471
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
but he was nice to his family.

472
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
But after I came to Yongan,

473
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
my father's dishes were popular.

474
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
He changed a little.

475
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
He often talked to my mother.

476
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I knew it would go wrong.

477
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
But I pretended nothing happened.

478
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Nothing happened?

479
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I didn't think you would laugh at me.

480
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's my problem.

481
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I think they're rude.

482
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But they're my parents.

483
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
How can I be so selfish and pitiful?

484
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Everything is about the mind.

485
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You didn't hurt anyone.

486
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Your thoughts are just thoughts.

487
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
If you don't want to be a saint,

488
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
why are you so harsh on yourself?

489
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You're a tree hole. You can't comment on it.

490
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm sorry.

491
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I know.

492
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Even if I have

493
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
a bad thought about them,

494
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
maybe they will have

495
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
a moment of being dragged down by me.

496
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But it doesn't matter.

497
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What matters is that we're family.

498
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
We won't leave each other at any point.

499
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I used to think that the Shen family was so unlucky.

500
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
There's no way they could have a family.

501
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But now I know

502
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
that someone has always been there for us.

503
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Thank you.

504
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Can you talk now?

505
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I can't talk.

506
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Can you talk now?

507
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Tree holes can't talk.

508
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Shao Yin can.

509
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Actually,

510
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I didn't do anything.

511
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
As long as you support each other,

512
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
there's nothing I can't do.

513
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Maybe I can be a tree hole for Shao Yin.

514
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Do you have any troubles?

515
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm sorry.

516
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I was at the banquet just now.

517
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Thank you for opening the door.

518
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Actually,

519
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
at every moment

520
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
when we should have reunited,

521
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I blamed myself.

522
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm sorry.

523
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Shao Guang,

524
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
my parents

525
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
are not sinners.

526
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
My father was a courtier.

527
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
He was a civilian,

528
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
but he was framed.

529
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And I

530
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
changed my name

531
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
and became Shao Yin.

532
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
But it doesn't matter.

533
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I really don't know

534
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
what I can do

535
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and what I can't do.

536
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Let's go.

537
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Let's go.

538
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's not like that.

539
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
People are very small.

540
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Don't be too excited.

541
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
If your parents were alive,

542
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
they must want to see you

543
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
happy every time

544
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
in every family.

545
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You don't need to be qualified to think.

546
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You don't need to be ashamed to live.

547
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You just need to enjoy all of this.

548
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You need to feel happy.

549
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Don't forget to get close to me.

550
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
To be reborn, only we can do it.

551
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Young Master didn't eat well just now.

552
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'll give you a five-person meatball.

553
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Five-person meatball?

554
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Try it.

555
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I've never had a five-person meatball.

556
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Let me try it.

557
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's delicious.

558
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's delicious.

559
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I didn't expect you to enjoy the five-person meatball.

560
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Don't many people like the five-person meatball?

561
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Not only that.

562
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
In the future, people who eat meatball will be divided into two types.

563
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
One side is supportive of the five-person meatball.

564
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
The other side thinks the five-person meatball is the most evil.

565
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
This problem will even seriously make friends.

566
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm the only one in my family who is a five-person meatball.

567
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
This year,

568
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
in the spring,

569
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Yong An also had a fight.

570
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
The young masters were arguing about whether to sleep in the peach pillow or the wooden pillow.

571
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
They brought up a lot of things in Guixiang House.

572
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
They were arguing.

573
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
What's so funny?

574
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Then I'll give a young master a cotton pillow.

575
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's better than those.

576
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It's good for the neck and neck.

577
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But I can't do it for the female workers.

578
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It's still for my mother.

579
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Your mother and father are reasonable people.

580
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
They will speak frankly.

581
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I think that young master is really like a friend to me.

582
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
But for me, he should be a friend.

583
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
He can't be like that.

584
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
He's a friend.

585
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
He's a friend.

586
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
He's a friend.

587
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I'm sure you can't finish it.

588
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Me?

589
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I can't finish it.

590
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
What about the rest?

591
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Do you still think so?

592
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'm not sure.

593
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm not sure.

594
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm not sure.

595
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I'm not sure.

596
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm not sure.

597
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm not sure.

598
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I'm not sure.

599
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm not sure.

600
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm not sure.

601
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I'm not sure.

602
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I'm not sure.

603
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm not sure.

604
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm not sure.

605
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I'm not sure.

606
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm not sure.

607
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm not sure.

608
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm not sure.

609
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm not sure.

610
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm not sure.

611
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm not sure.

612
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm not sure.

613
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm not sure.

614
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm not sure.

615
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm not sure.

616
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I'm not sure.

617
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I'm not sure.

618
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm not sure.

619
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm not sure.

620
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I'm not sure.

621
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm not sure.

622
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I'm not sure.

623
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm not sure.

624
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm not sure.

625
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm not sure.

626
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I'm not sure.

627
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm not sure.

628
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I'm not sure.

629
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm not sure.

630
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm not sure.

631
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I'm not sure.

632
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I'm not sure.

633
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm not sure.

634
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm not sure.

635
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm not sure.

636
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm not sure.

637
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm not sure.

638
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm not sure.

639
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I'm not sure.

640
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm not sure.

641
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I'm not sure.

642
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I'm not sure.

643
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I'm not sure.

644
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm not sure.

645
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I'm not sure.

646
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I'm not sure.

647
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I'm not sure.

648
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I'm not sure.

649
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm not sure.

650
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I'm not sure.

651
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I'm not sure.

652
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I'm not sure.

653
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I'm not sure.

654
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm not sure.

655
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I'm not sure.

656
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm not sure.

657
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I'm not sure.

658
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm not sure.

659
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm not sure.

660
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm not sure.

661
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I'm not sure.

662
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm sorry.

663
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I'm really sorry.

664
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I dare not to drink again.

665
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I dare to report to my bosses

666
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
that I have the most unforgivable punishment.

667
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm sorry.

668
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I'm sorry.

669
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm sorry.

670
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I dare not to drink again.

671
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Lady clean,

672
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
what happened last night?

673
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I don't remember.

674
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You're not a child anymore.

675
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I remember we had a band last night.

676
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I was the tree hole.

677
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Then we drank together.

678
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Then...

679
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Then I can't remember.

680
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Did something bad happen?

681
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You don't remember?

682
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You said you were sorry for the whole family.

683
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
What did you do?

684
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
No.

685
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I shouldn't have let you drink so much.

686
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
If I'm late for work today,

687
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
it's my fault.

688
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
That's it.

689
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Then why did you kneel down?

690
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I...

691
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I feel that wine is the source of all evil.

692
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
There are not many good people like you.

693
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I should be ashamed to take you to drink with me.

694
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I should be ashamed.

695
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I'll go and cook the soup for you.

696
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
You're sick?

697
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I really have a fever.

698
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It's okay, I'm really sorry.

699
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I'll go and cook the soup for you.

700
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
You're sick?

701
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You're sick?

702
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I'm sorry, I deserve it.

703
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Wait for me.

704
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I'm sorry.

705
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
No, no, no.

706
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Wait for me.

707
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
What are you doing?

708
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
No.

709
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Young Master, I can't.

710
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I really can't.

711
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I can't go into your room.

712
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I'll go and call your family first.

713
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Then I'll go and find a doctor for you.

714
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I don't care.

715
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Why do you suddenly care about this man and woman's room?

716
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
When we were playing the game,

717
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
we even played together.

718
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
What's wrong?

719
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I should care about it.

720
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You usually don't say anything that others don't understand.

721
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
But in some words,

722
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
you should be more cautious.

723
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
You rest well.

724
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'll go.

725
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
How can it be so hot?

726
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Girlfriend,

727
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
are you feeling unwell?

728
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
There's no medicine for colds in this place.

729
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
What should we do?

730
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
What should we do?

731
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And your wife.

732
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
You said you wanted me to go to the restaurant.

733
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
But I left home and got sick.

734
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
What should we do?

735
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You have time to pretend.

736
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You should ask your ancestors

737
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
if the doctor can cure you.

738
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
You can't be so cold.

739
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
The hotter the colder.

740
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You can't let her go.

741
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
She needs to get out of the sun.

742
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
You have to cover her.

743
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
If you let her go, she'll catch a cold again.

744
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Do you know?

745
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
The second cold is very serious.

746
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
In this dynasty,

747
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
the mortality rate is very high.

748
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Do you know?

749
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Can you spit out some toothpaste?

750
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Wuhan is not good for heat dissipation.

751
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Your method is not scientific.

752
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You're nagging all day.

753
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I always feel cold when I'm nagging.

754
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Stop it.

755
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Don't quarrel.

756
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
A Ji is not comfortable.

757
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
She'll be more upset if you quarrel.

758
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But isn't my aunt a cold?

759
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
She ate three boxes of medicine yesterday.

760
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Is she on fire?

761
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Three boxes?

762
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You ate so much.

763
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
What do you want?

764
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Don't be shy.

765
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You're not sick at all.

766
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Dad.

767
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Can you shut up?

768
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I'm not jealous.

769
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm being punished.

770
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
What?

771
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
What did you say?

772
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I said I ate three boxes of medicine.

773
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I deserve it.

774
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You definitely deserve it.

775
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
You ate so much.

776
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Can you stop talking?

777
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Here's the medicine.

778
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Here.

779
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Here's the medicine.

780
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Here.

781
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
A Ji, take the medicine.

782
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
You'll be fine after taking the medicine.

783
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
No, it's too bitter.

784
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Be good.

785
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
It's too bitter.

786
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You're a child.

787
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
How old are you?

788
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Can you get better if you don't take medicine?

789
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
How can you scold a child?

790
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You're dead and alive.

791
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
It's not polite.

792
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
No, no.

793
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You're so big.

794
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Can you let me feed you?

795
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Come on.

796
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I'll see if you can feed him.

797
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
He's capable.

798
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Dad.

799
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Girl, give me a bowl of noodles.

800
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Let's have a sip.

801
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Come on.

802
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Just one sip.

803
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
It's bitter.

804
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Just one sip.

805
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Just one sip.

806
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Just one sip.

807
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Dad.

808
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Just one sip.

809
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
What's wrong with you?

810
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
You let Young Master Lin feed him.

811
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Is he the Young Master of Jingzhao or our ancestors?

812
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I don't believe him.

813
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
He's not good.

814
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Young Master.

815
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Brother Bang, really.

816
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
You're not the same.

817
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You're the ancestor of our family.

818
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
No.

819
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
You're the young master.

820
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
He doesn't dare to listen to you.

821
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
No matter what, let him take this medicine.

822
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Please.

823
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Please.

824
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Thank you.

825
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Thank you.

826
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Thank you.

827
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Take the medicine.

828
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Here.

829
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Take the medicine.

830
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Look.

831
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
So fast.

832
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I'm going to sleep.

833
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You guys go out.

834
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You finished drinking so fast.

835
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
All right.

836
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
A Ji is going to sleep.

837
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Let's go.

838
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Let's go.

839
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Let's go.

840
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
A Ji, have a good sleep.

841
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I'll take it.

842
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Let's go.

843
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Have a good sleep, A Ji.

844
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
If you feel uncomfortable, call someone.

845
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Oh.

846
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Oh.

847
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Oh.

848
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Oh.

849
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Oh.
