1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

43
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
People Build Halls

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,600
How could the ancestors

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,600
never know that I'm from the Sinohua Family?

46
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,200
Bring me to them

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,560
Take you to see them

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,380
for holly

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll think of another way.

50
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Where's the stove for the tea?

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,500
Yesterday at midnight, the Shen family borrowed a lot of things from the mansion.

52
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,000
They said they were better than the ones they had in the shop.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,500
Didn't you also tell them yesterday that they can use it in the kitchen?

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,000
I thought about it and gave it to them.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I haven't made up my mind for the Cui family's case.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,500
Even if I say that the Shen family is a cousin,

57
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,500
one day, they will still be involved.

58
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,000
You mean to terminate the engagement and send them out of Yongan?

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,500
The Shen family is not too adamant about the engagement.

60
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
They came to the Cloud Water Court to ask.

61
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,000
They just want to make their family have a place to stay.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,500
They also said that they really want to go back to their hometown.

63
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,000
Isn't that perfect?

64
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,000
The Shen family was involved in the Cui family's accident.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I can't pretend not to know if the Shen family is involved.

66
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Even if I have to let them go,

67
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,500
I should take responsibility to ensure their future.

68
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Then, why don't you give them some money?

69
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,000
It's like driving them away.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,500
It's better to be treated as a stranger than to be treated as a stranger.

71
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,500
It's not easy for them to do business, so they should help them.

72
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Liu Cheng, it's hard for you to watch them.

73
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,500
If they need anything, just give them to them.

74
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Understood.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I've...

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I've taken everything.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The scale for the fire, the stove, the fire, and salt.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I've borrowed them all.

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You're really...

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
welcome.

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Guizi.

82
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Guizi, the thing that the ancestors made is good.

83
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Look at the stove. It doesn't smoke. It doesn't smoke.

84
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,000
Look at this. Look at this.

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,500
The unique pancake fruit in Yongan City.

86
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
One for one.

87
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,000
The unique pancake fruit in this dynasty is re-released.

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,500
The tyrant won't regret it.

89
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Come on. Come on. Don't miss it.

90
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Look at this.

91
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
Look at this.

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I was wondering, in such a short time,

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,500
they ate my pancake fruit.

94
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,000
You...

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The pancake fruit is...

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's really delicious.

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
There's a lot of food in it. It's really delicious.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,500
Dad.

99
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,000
I know. I saw it. I saw it.

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Where did they get the pancake fruit?

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Pancake fruit.

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,500
The special offer of the giant elephant. Three for one.

103
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
It's rare to have one.

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I have all the fresh ones.

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
They sell pancakes on the other side too?

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Let's go.

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Take care, sir.

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Fresh pancakes.

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Fresh pancakes.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What's this?

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Sir, sir.

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Three for one. Three for one.

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Three for one. Three for one.

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Three for one.

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Fresh pancakes.

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Fresh pancakes.

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Isn't this our pancake fruit?

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Sir, sir.

119
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
He's such a big character.

120
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
He's over our price.

121
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Why is he so shy?

122
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
Don't push. Don't push.

123
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
To make money, there's nothing to be shy about.

124
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,500
So what?

125
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
He's over our price. The price is lower than ours.

126
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Then, why don't we also lower the price?

127
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Then Yunlai's goods must be cheaper than ours.

128
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,500
It's a price war. No advantage.

129
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
No advantage? You...

130
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
This is the pancake fruit that Yunlai's supermarkets plagiarized.

131
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
I bought all the flavors.

132
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
Let's try it.

133
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Here, Yangyang.

134
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
It's fish.

135
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
It's so delicious.

136
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
The taste is really good.

137
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
Put it in here.

138
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
It's so delicious.

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Put it in here.

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Taste it.

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The taste is normal.

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's better than ours.

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But this pancake fruit

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
doesn't have any technical content.

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It'll be easy to learn if you put some effort into it.

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Who said this pancake fruit doesn't have technical content?

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Sir.

148
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
This is a whole pancake.

149
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Sir.

150
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Hurry, sit.

151
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Sit.

152
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Sir, try it.

153
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
Okay.

154
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Sir.

155
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Here, try one.

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Thank you, aunt.

157
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
These pancakes are soft.

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The one with the umbrella is like garlic.

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's delicious.

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What do you think, young master?

161
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's delicious.

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But

163
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
the food today

164
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
is not good.

165
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
No.

166
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
These pancakes are made by Yunlai Jiu Temple.

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
They are for us.

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
No one cares.

169
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Young master, you have to

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
help us.

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yes, master.

172
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
There is no law

173
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
that can punish them.

174
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's okay, young master.

175
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
We can handle it.

176
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Besides,

177
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
we'll always be in trouble

178
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
if we want to make money.

179
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
We're fine.

180
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Actually, this pancake

181
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
is nothing.

182
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Right, Liu Chao?

183
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
It's a good pancake.

184
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
This pancake

185
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
is the same as the one in your family.

186
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
It's chewy and delicious.

187
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
Uncle Liu Chao,

188
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,000
you're lying, right?

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Uncle Liu Chao?

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Please don't comfort us.

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yunlai is starting to follow the trend.

192
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I guess soon,

193
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
there will be a trend.

194
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The market will be saturated soon.

195
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
We should change the track as soon as possible.

196
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What is the market

197
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
and what is the track?

198
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's all words we created.

199
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Simply put, it's a change.

200
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Little Chao,

201
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
as long as you can keep up with us.

202
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,500
Young master,

203
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
but we really need to find a way out.

204
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,000
Let's pour them into a tray or something,

205
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
yes, yes, heavens willing.

206
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
What are we going with?

207
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Wait and see.

208
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,000
Don't look for it, General.

209
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
It must be Yuwen 돌� MONSTER.

210
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,000
Now that the livestream has started,

211
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
today is a pro-election day!

212
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,500
ru

213
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,000
Tam director

214
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,680
Bake some chicken

215
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:27,940
Hey all, Acai beat you with the Seila

216
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,440
I like this acacia

217
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
I can't stop eating

218
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,440
I can't stop eating

219
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
It's so hot

220
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
Let's go, let's go, let's go

221
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
This is so delicious

222
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,440
Don't go, don't go

223
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
Don't go

224
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,440
Sir, I tell you

225
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,440
I've never eaten such delicious yam since I was a kid

226
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:02,440
It's so delicious

227
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Manager Wang, they started selling skewers again

228
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
They made some new tricks

229
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,440
They took everyone away

230
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Usually, a handful of lamb skewers

231
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,440
It's worth 30 or 40

232
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,440
Today, we'll lower the price

233
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
Lower the price

234
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,440
Today, as long as you buy it in the store

235
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,440
We don't want 40

236
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
No

237
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
We want 30

238
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,440
No

239
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
We don't want 20

240
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
20 is cheap

241
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,440
As long as you buy it for 10

242
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,440
You can have a handful of lamb skewers

243
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,440
Okay

244
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
10 is not a thousand miles

245
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
10 is not a thousand miles

246
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,440
10 is not a thousand miles

247
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440
10 is not a thousand miles

248
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
Isn't it not enough?

249
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,440
Let's buy one and give it away

250
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
Isn't it not enough?

251
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
I'll give you another one

252
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,440
Girl, you can't give it away

253
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,440
We'll lose if we give it away

254
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,440
We'll lose if we give it away

255
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,440
Girl

256
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Give it away

257
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
We can't give it away

258
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,440
No

259
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,440
Customers are like family

260
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,440
I must let the family enjoy the most affordable price

261
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,440
Today

262
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,440
Only today

263
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,440
You can enjoy three handfuls of lamb skewers in the store

264
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,440
Is it very fresh?

265
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,440
Yes

266
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
Family who want to join

267
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
Give me the delicious lamb skewers

268
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,440
On the road

269
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:36,440
Delicious lamb skewers

270
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,440
Okay

271
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,440
Three two one

272
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,440
Lamb skewers

273
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,440
Okay

274
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
Come on

275
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
Come on

276
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,440
My

277
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
Mine

278
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
Mine

279
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,440
Mine

280
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
Mine

281
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,440
I said I would treat you to dinner

282
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,440
But that day

283
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,440
I just drank

284
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,440
I didn't eat well

285
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
I drank too much

286
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,440
I don't remember anything

287
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,440
We left early today

288
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,440
An Ran is going to Xishi to look for tea

289
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
I'll make it up for you

290
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,440
An Ran

291
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
The young master and the jade master

292
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,440
It's not easy to call each other

293
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
It's not suitable to call you A Yan

294
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,440
An Ran

295
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,440
I'll call you An Ran

296
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,440
I'm in the 12th rank

297
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,440
You can call me 12th

298
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,440
Mr. Pei

299
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,440
We seem not

300
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
When you don't work

301
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
You call me 12th

302
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,440
12th

303
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,440
You don't have to be so polite

304
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,440
No polite

305
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,440
We don't have to be polite

306
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,440
The Shen family who ate free food before

307
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,440
I heard that the meat skewers are selling now

308
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Three big ones only cost ten

309
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
I still can afford it

310
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
Let's go and try it

311
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,440
But I'm a little curious

312
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
This lamb is so precious

313
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
You see, my salary is not high

314
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
Not enough quality

315
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,440
I can't get a single one every year

316
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
This Shen family's lamb

317
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,440
Why can it be sold so cheap

318
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,440
I really don't understand

319
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
Want to copy

320
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
As long as you can keep up with us

321
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Please borrow us again

322
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,440
what

323
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440
If I'm not wrong

324
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,440
The young master's appointment

325
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,440
The government's supply should have sheep

326
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,440
How many sheep can An Ran bear a year?

327
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,440
It's gone

328
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,440
That is

329
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,440
At least four or five sheep

330
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Don't take it

331
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,440
I took it

332
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,440
Fresh lamb skewers

333
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
Fresh lamb skewers

334
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Finally arrived

335
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
You said that our ancestors' welfare treatment is good

336
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
Can send so many sheep

337
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
Let me tell you

338
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,440
This team is for the ancestors

339
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,440
When you go, don't forget to eat delicious food

340
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Don't worry

341
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
Don't worry

342
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Don't worry

343
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
All have

344
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Don't worry

345
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,440
Line up

346
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,440
The stall is not big

347
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,440
I'm not brave

348
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,440
Dare to work with our original

349
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
Don't worry

350
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,440
Be careful

351
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
Don't worry

352
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
Don't worry

353
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
Don't worry

354
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,440
Don't worry

355
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,440
Don't worry

356
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
Let go

357
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
Let go

358
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
Let go

359
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
Let go

360
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
Let's go

361
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
Let's go

362
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,440
Let's go

363
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Let's go

364
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
Let's go

365
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,440
Let's go

366
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
Let's go

367
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,440
It seems to be a problem

368
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,440
Take a look first

369
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
Our original guests

370
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
Are all of high status

371
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
In our original meal

372
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,440
Mainly pay attention to a record

373
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
Look at you

374
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,440
The guests are not eating

375
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
How polite

376
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
Move

377
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
Don't move

378
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,440
Don't move

379
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,440
Don't move

380
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,440
What are you doing

381
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,440
Don't move

382
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,440
Don't move

383
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,440
Yang Yang

384
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
Yang Yang

385
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
Go away

386
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,440
Don't touch my daughter

387
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
Yang Yang

388
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
Put down

389
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
What are you doing

390
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
See who dares to touch our family

391
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,440
See who dares to touch our family

392
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
Are you okay

393
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
What are you doing

394
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
What are you doing

395
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
Be careful

396
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,440
You are hurt

397
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,440
Yang Yang, are you okay

398
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
My wife

399
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,440
I dare not move

400
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
Who dares to move

401
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,440
Want to die

402
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
This man

403
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Which one of the official orders

404
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Said that there was no stall outside the restaurant

405
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,440
What

406
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,440
You don't move

407
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,440
The eyes of the people

408
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
Just know

409
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,440
We never stopped any store

410
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
If you want to force us to open the stall

411
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
I'm afraid we have to inform the Marquis

412
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,440
The little lady dared to be in my original place

413
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
Marquis

414
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
Have you ever thought

415
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
Marquis Wu is here

416
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,440
How to judge you

417
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,440
I hope that at that time

418
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
The little lady is in that prison

419
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Can also be like today

420
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
Stable

421
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Prison

422
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,440
How did it become a prison

423
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
In the valley of Ju Xian Xiang

424
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,440
There is such a bank

425
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,440
Can be a prison

426
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Where did you come from

427
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,440
We were in Ju Xian Xiang

428
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
It's been too long since the last time

429
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
What about

430
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,440
Everyone dares to come to the light

431
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440
Who

432
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,440
Who

433
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,440
Let me see who

434
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
Who

435
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
There is someone

436
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,440
Young master Lin

437
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,440
But look clearly

438
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
What is in the field

439
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,440
Lin Young Master Lin

440
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,440
Feng Mao is never too good

441
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
You still don't kneel

442
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,440
How dare you

443
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,440
Not me

444
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
You are so big

445
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
Dare to call young master

446
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
What is this

447
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,440
What a dog

448
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,440
You want to die

449
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
Young master

450
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,440
Just now

451
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,440
It's the people below

452
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
Don't know the rules and talk nonsense

453
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
I have taught him

454
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,440
Not me

455
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,440
Not me

456
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
Misunderstood young master

457
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
Today

458
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,440
It's this Shen family's stall

459
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,440
Blocked the way

460
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,440
Serious hinders our Ju Xian Xiang

461
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,440
This ten-time business

462
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,440
Feng Mao is good at persuading the group

463
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,440
I didn't expect

464
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,440
Shen family

465
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
Strong attitude

466
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,440
We are the master

467
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,440
You are so blood-thirsty

468
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,440
Young master

469
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
What nonsense

470
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
This is

471
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
The shopkeeper misunderstood a little

472
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,440
I'm not new

473
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,440
From the beginning you brought people

474
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,440
I'm watching

475
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,440
Thank you, Feng shopkeeper

476
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
Pei Yu Shi

477
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
I just arrived in Jingzhao

478
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,440
When the way is checked

479
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,440
It's a bad thing

480
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
Today

481
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
Thanks to the shopkeeper

482
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
I am not easy to be an official

483
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,440
Especially strong and weak

484
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,440
For me

485
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,440
Increase a little credit

486
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
I will give you a good lesson

487
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
This one

488
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,440
Be strong and weak

489
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
Eliminate evil

490
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,440
Thank you, Pei Yu Shi

491
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,440
Misunderstanding

492
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,440
I remember the big misunderstanding

493
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,440
Just what I said

494
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
It's all a joke

495
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,440
In fact, Feng Mao sees

496
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,440
Shen family

497
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,440
He is hard

498
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
So Feng Mao brought some people

499
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,440
I think they need help

500
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,440
Go find people

501
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
You are still kneeling

502
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,440
Help me

503
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,440
Get up and help me

504
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,440
Thank you, young master

505
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,440
Help me

506
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,440
Thank you young master

507
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
Thanks

508
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
What are you doing

509
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,440
Take your hands away

510
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
Who is the one who gave you money

511
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,440
I also help

512
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,440
I also help

513
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,440
Be strong and weak

514
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,440
Just say it

515
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,440
Brother An Ran is really unbeatable

516
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,440
Kai Tuo

517
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
Boss, give me another one

518
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,440
The shopkeeper of the Shen family is too much

519
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,440
How about we change it

520
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
Yesterday

521
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,440
12th brother

522
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
Please

523
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,440
Wait

524
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
Wait

525
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,440
Wait, Beilan, you go

526
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,440
Aunt

527
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
Wei

528
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
Beilan, you go

529
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,440
Pei, Pei, Pei

530
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
Sorry, young master

531
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,440
I ran too fast

532
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,440
I didn't turn my head at once

533
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,440
I'm bad

534
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,440
Sorry, young master

535
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,440
Sorry

536
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,440
Don't worry

537
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
Thank you for helping us just now

538
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
And this is A Ji

539
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,440
No, no, no

540
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
This is the lamb skewers that our Shaoguang just roasted

541
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,440
You can take it

542
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,440
Aunt

543
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,440
This is not true

544
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,440
Hurry up, young master

545
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,440
No, no, no

546
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,440
Really

547
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,440
Young master's friend is still here

548
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
Then I won't bother you

549
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
But young master

550
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Without you, our business can't be done

551
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,440
But your uncle said we have to give it to you

552
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,440
I went to the part where I bought lamb

553
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
Asked the price

554
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
And added another one

555
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
Not much

556
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
Young master, don't mind

557
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
Take it, take it

558
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,440
No, no, young master

559
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,440
You have to take it

560
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
We have made a deal

561
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
Hurry up, take it

562
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
Eat while it's hot

563
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
Take the car back

564
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
Take it

565
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,440
Son-in-law

566
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
What son-in-law

567
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,440
You heard it wrong

568
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,440
My ears

569
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,440
Since I was a child, I can hear any sound within three beats

570
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,440
In the past, in the countryside

571
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
All the rumors of the eight villages in the ten miles

572
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,440
Can enter my ears

573
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,440
I can never hear it wrong

574
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
He is calling you son-in-law

575
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,440
I know the Shen family

576
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
My parents have been engaged to me and Shen Niangzi

577
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
Please help me to keep this secret

578
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,440
Only father is engaged

579
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,440
The Shen family is a merchant

580
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
Such a family

581
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
You and Yuzhi get married

582
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,440
If it is spread

583
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,440
It will affect the master's disciple

584
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,440
Don't worry

585
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,440
I won't spread it

586
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,440
This is nothing

587
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,440
Nothing

588
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,440
How can this be?

589
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,440
You will accumulate children after you marry

590
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,440
Only father is engaged

591
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:15,360
That means no more

592
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,440
You

593
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,440
Their family is using this kind of food

594
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,440
Want to entrap you

595
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,440
It smells like a good food

596
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,440
It's delicious

597
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,440
It smells good

598
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
Let me taste it

599
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,440
I have a good taste in food

600
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
I have a good taste in food

601
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,440
The common food of the villagers

602
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,440
Can't get rid of me

603
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,440
Delicious

604
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,440
It's delicious

605
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,440
It's delicious

606
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
Delicious

607
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
It's really delicious

608
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,440
It's just the best

609
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,440
Compared with this

610
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,440
The delicious dishes I've seen

611
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,440
It's not worth mentioning at all.

612
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,440
I can't believe that this Shen Niangzi

613
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,440
can make such delicious food.

614
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,440
This woman is rare in the world.

615
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,440
It's rare.

616
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,440
In fact, it's nothing to hurt people.

617
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,440
Anshun,

618
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,440
I suddenly feel that

619
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,440
if you marry Shen Niangzi,

620
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,440
you should send her away as soon as possible.

621
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
Okay?

622
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,440
Nothing.

623
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,440
I'll give you all of these.

624
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,440
An Ran,

625
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,440
I'm treating you to dinner.

626
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,440
This is not good.

627
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,440
I've never seen so much money.

628
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
How good is this Yongan?

629
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,440
Just sell some lamb skewers

630
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
and earn so much money.

631
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,440
Ancient people have a taste.

632
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,440
He knows to appreciate my cooking.

633
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,440
He made me not want to come back.

634
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,440
Mr. Shen,

635
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,440
you did something that the people here

636
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,440
haven't eaten

637
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,440
based on the information of modern people.

638
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,440
If you're really capable,

639
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,440
our restaurant

640
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,440
won't be destroyed by you.

641
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,440
Then the lamb skewers are mine.

642
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,440
One skewer for each.

643
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,440
What did you say?

644
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
Come on, make it louder.

645
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
I said,

646
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,440
I said you, you, you're right.

647
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,440
Although ancient money is in good condition,

648
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,440
it doesn't have any value.

649
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,440
If you can't settle down,

650
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,440
you can't go online, you can't pursue.

651
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
No chili, no air conditioner.

652
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,440
You have to use water to make it yourself.

653
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,440
You have to go to the toilet yourself.

654
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
Yes,

655
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
this is the only place.

656
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
You can't play games.

657
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
You can't watch TV dramas.

658
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,440
I think we should

659
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
go back to the modern world

660
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
with gold.

661
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
It's a good thing to settle down.

662
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
Brother,

663
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
when did you settle down?

664
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
How come?

665
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Your sister is right.

666
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,440
You really have to learn from me.

667
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,440
I can go out and listen to her.

668
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,440
I can go out and scare her.

669
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,440
I'm handsome and perfect.

670
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,440
I look like a master.

671
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,440
You only have a few words left.

672
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,440
You don't know what your last name is.

673
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,440
My last name is Shen.

674
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
Actually, I like ancient money too.

675
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,440
We can earn so much money

676
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,440
in a day.

677
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,440
And I don't have to go to school,

678
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,440
don't have to study,

679
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
and don't have to write homework.

680
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,440
Grandma told you,

681
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,440
when we go back,

682
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,440
you have to make up for all your homework.

683
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
Don't be like your dad.

684
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,440
I, I, I,

685
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,440
I used to do homework on time.

686
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,440
Let's do it again.

687
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,440
When we can earn money now,

688
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,440
we have to earn more.

689
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,440
Then we can live better.

690
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,440
Mom,

691
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,440
I wear lamb skewers every night.

692
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,440
They are so red.

693
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,440
Look at my hands.

694
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,440
They smell like lamb.

695
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,440
I wear it too.

696
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,440
I'm still grilling.

697
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,440
It takes time to marinate the lamb skewers.

698
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,440
It's really hard to make a skewer.

699
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,440
If we want to earn more,

700
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,440
we have to sell things that can be produced in batches

701
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,440
and have high prices.

702
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,440
What?

703
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,440
What?

704
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,440
Some customers said that

705
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,440
they ate too much and choked.

706
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,440
Can we make some drinks

707
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,440
and sell them together?

708
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,440
That makes sense.

709
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,440
What's this?

710
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,440
It's so fragrant.

711
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,440
It smells so good.

712
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,440
You eat it.

713
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,440
Thanks.

714
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
Brother,

715
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,440
you can't be lazy today.

716
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
Mom and dad bought it.

717
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,440
It's up to you.

718
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,440
I know.

719
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
I'm not that reliable.

720
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,440
You have a deep understanding of me.

721
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,440
Okay.

722
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,440
I'll go.

723
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
I'll go.

724
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
I'll go.

725
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,440
I'll go.

726
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,440
I'll go.

727
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,440
I'll go.

728
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,440
I'll go.

729
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,440
Everyone.

730
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,440
Everyone.

731
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,440
Have you ever been disappointed?

732
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,440
Have you ever experienced

733
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,440
the feeling of being touched by your heart?

734
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,440
You feel cold

735
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,440
and cold inside.

736
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,440
Today,

737
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,440
our restaurant has developed a new way of enjoying life.

738
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,440
One of the signs

739
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
is called

740
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,440
Revenge of the Heart.

741
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,440
Revenge of the Heart.

742
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,440
It can be suppressed

743
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,440
and can be carried out with your body.

744
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
More importantly,

745
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,440
you can experience the feeling of being hit by your heart.

746
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,440
Everyone,

747
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,440
please come here.

748
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,440
Everyone,

749
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,440
this is the process

750
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,440
of making the Revenge of the Heart.

751
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
At this time,

752
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
don't suppress your emotions.

753
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,440
Let it come out.

754
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,440
Let all the pain in your heart

755
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
come out.

756
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
Think about the person in your heart.

757
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,440
Don't control yourself.

758
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,440
Don't control yourself.

759
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,440
You have to take revenge.

760
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,440
Revenge of the Heart.

761
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,440
Revenge of the Heart.

762
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,440
Revenge of the Heart.

763
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,440
Revenge of the Heart.

764
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,440
Revenge of the Heart.

765
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,440
Revenge of the Heart.

766
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,440
Revenge of the Heart.

767
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,440
Revenge of the Heart.

768
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
Brother,

769
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,440
please don't

770
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,440
think of running away with my ex-sister-in-law.

771
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,440
Everyone,

772
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,440
please come here.

773
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,440
It smells so good.

774
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,440
First,

775
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,440
the past is gone.

776
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,440
Second,

777
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,440
the future is beautiful.

778
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,440
Third,

779
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,440
the rich Chang An Ning.

780
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,440
Please open the red fortune.

781
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,440
Open the red fortune.

782
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,440
It's so fresh.

783
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
What's this smell?

784
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,440
There are ice cubes.

785
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,440
Ice cubes.

786
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,440
Ice cubes.

787
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,440
It's so good to eat ice cubes.

788
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,440
Everyone,

789
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,440
I'll taste it for you.

790
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,440
How is it?

791
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,440
I've never had such delicious tea before.

792
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,440
It's so delicious.

793
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,440
It's so delicious.

794
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,440
Okay.

795
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,440
I want a piece of lamb skewers.

796
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,440
I want this.

797
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,440
Okay, help me.

798
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,440
I want a glass of green tea.

799
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,440
Green tea is good.

800
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,440
I want this.

801
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,440
I want this.

802
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,440
This is it.

803
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,440
Of course.

804
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
One by one.

805
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,440
One by one.

806
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,440
One by one.

807
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
One by one.

808
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,440
I know this.

809
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,440
One by one.

810
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,440
One by one.

811
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,440
One by one.

812
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,440
One by one.

813
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,440
One by one.

814
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,440
One by one.

815
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,440
I said I'd treat Brother An Ran to dinner.

816
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,440
But I didn't.

817
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,440
But I let you treat me again.

818
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,440
I feel so sorry.

819
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
What's this?

820
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,440
This is a tea made by the Shen family.

821
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,440
It's called...

822
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,440
Wu Mei...

823
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,440
It's called...

824
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,440
Wu Mei...

825
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,440
Liu Cheng.

826
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,440
This tea is called...

827
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,440
Wu Mei Bo Bo, everything is as it should be.

828
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,440
That's right.

829
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,440
Wu Mei Bo Bo, everything is as it should be.

830
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,440
Everything is as it should be.

831
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,440
Good name.

832
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,440
Why can't I say it?

833
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,440
It's good.

834
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,440
It's called Shen Niangzi, right?

835
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,440
She's so smart.

836
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,440
Brother An Ran, you're so lucky.

837
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,440
I heard...

838
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,440
that you want to make a fortune.

839
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,440
Did something happen?

840
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,440
This Zhang Shi Lang...

841
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,440
He pushed me back.

842
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,440
And you said it out.

843
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,440
What a person.

844
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,440
If there's anything difficult,

845
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,440
you can tell me.

846
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,440
It's nothing.

847
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,440
I thought Shi Lang Lang was a friend.

848
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,440
How can I hide it from friends?

849
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,440
Actually, it's...

850
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,440
It's the Princess's wedding.

851
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,440
She sent the invitation to the imperial court.

852
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,440
Wedding?

853
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,440
What's so difficult about a wedding?

854
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,440
It's not a normal banquet.

855
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,440
But the Princess's wedding...

856
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,440
is a famous banquet.

857
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,440
I really want to see the people.

858
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,440
But I can't.

859
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,440
I don't have a good dress.

860
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,440
So I want to give up.

861
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,440
But Zhang Shi Lang doesn't agree.

862
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,440
So I won't go.

863
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,440
That's all?

864
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,440
I'll make a dress for Shi Lang Lang.

865
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,440
Really?

866
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,440
Really.

867
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,440
Forget it.

868
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,440
No.

869
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,440
Jingzhao Mansion is a mess.

870
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,440
It's not easy to earn your salary.

871
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,440
Forget it.

872
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,440
Forget it.

873
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,440
Then...

874
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
How about...

875
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,440
You lend me a dress?

876
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,440
Okay.

877
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,440
I'll choose.

878
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,440
Thank you, An Ran.

879
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,440
You didn't invite me to dinner.

880
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,440
But I borrowed your dress.

881
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,440
It's a long way to go.

882
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,440
Shi Lang Lang knows that...

883
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,440
Jingzhao Mansion is a mess.

884
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,440
I've been in contact with the Princess.

885
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,440
I'm a new official.

886
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,440
I don't have the courage to ask for an invitation.

887
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,440
How can you do that?

888
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,440
An Ran, don't worry.

889
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,440
It's not easy to ask for an invitation.

890
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,440
I'll take care of it.

891
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,440
The Princess doesn't like the cook.

892
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,440
So I'm looking for a good cook.

893
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,440
I'll arrange a poetry meeting.

894
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,440
A good cook with a good intention.

895
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,440
You have a suitable candidate.

896
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,440
The Princess doesn't like the cook.

897
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,440
So I'm looking for a good cook.

898
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,440
An Ran, don't worry.

899
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,440
I'll arrange a poetry meeting.

900
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,440
I'll take care of it.

901
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,440
Thank you, An Ran.

902
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,440
I'm sorry.

903
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,440
I'm sorry.

904
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,440
I'm sorry.

905
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,440
I'm sorry.

906
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,440
I'm sorry.

907
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,440
I'm sorry.

908
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,440
I'm sorry.

909
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,440
I'm sorry.

910
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,440
You're almost full.

911
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,440
Good job, Guan Yaoyao.

912
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,440
This is a pile of homework.

913
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,440
You're just a gold medalist.

914
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,440
You're just like a little girl.

915
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,440
You have a good intention.

916
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,440
You're more than a little girl.

917
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,440
You're so considerate.

918
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,440
You're so careful in everything.

919
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,440
Yaoyao, listen.

920
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,440
Your aunt is not good enough.

921
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,440
That's why she's not good enough.

922
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,440
She just wants to say it.

923
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,440
You're a weirdo.

924
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,600
You know how to speak Chinese?

925
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,040
What is the meaning of the Chinese word for break?

926
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,120
Why can't I?

927
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,720
It's just...

928
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:29,520
It's just...

929
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,120
Break.

930
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
It's just break.

931
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
Break?

932
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,440
This tea is new.

933
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,560
Can you prepare it

934
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,800
and send it to the army tomorrow?

935
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,520
Master Qu.

936
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,080
No problem.

937
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,360
We'll go later.

938
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,760
If you want to send it to the army,

939
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,880
please don't be too smart.

940
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:44,880
You...

941
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,200
Why?

942
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,040
The general said the army

943
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,400
refers to the Yulin Army.

944
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,920
The emperor is responsible for defending the imperial army.

945
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,720
The food and the food are the most important.

946
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,880
How can ordinary people

947
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,600
send tea to the army?

948
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,800
Even if it's tea,

949
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,680
I dare not do it.

950
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,040
I'm the one who's in charge.

951
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,520
I'm afraid.

952
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,760
General.

953
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,200
The tea is boiled in our pot

954
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,440
or in the camp.

955
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,200
Isn't it the same?

956
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,800
Why don't you let the cook cook it?

957
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,880
You want to sell my prescription?

958
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,600
We won't stay in Yongan for long.

959
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,560
There's no need to hide the prescription.

960
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,760
If you don't sell tea,

961
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,640
you're worried that you can't take responsibility.

962
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,120
But I'm willing to be checked.

963
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,680
The imperial army protects the peace.

964
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,160
It's time to taste the best tea in Yongan.

965
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,960
You said you were not brave.

966
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,320
I was wrong.

967
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
General, please wait a moment.

968
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,840
General, please wait a moment.

969
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,360
Yes.

970
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,160
I dare to think about it.

971
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,040
If he stays in Yongan all the time,

972
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,600
it will be a long time

973
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,600
before he becomes a big man.

974
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,200
You actually

975
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,560
appreciate the good woman.

976
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,200
Nonsense.

977
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,520
General, here's the prescription.

978
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,040
Thank you.

979
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,720
Let's go.

980
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,360
Look.

981
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,600
I'm rich.

982
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,080
I'm rich.

983
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,480
It's okay. There are so many.

984
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,480
What are you afraid of?

985
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,760
Aunt, the young master is here.

986
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,000
Young Master, Mr. Liu.

987
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,440
Do you have any drinks?

988
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,400
No.

989
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,720
I'm here to discuss with the maidservant.

990
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,440
Well.

991
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,360
Here are two cups of

992
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,640
Mi De Ruyi's super-sweet tea.

993
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,360
Please have a taste.

994
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:33,880
Thank you.

995
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,680
Thank you.

996
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,240
Okay. You two have a chat.

997
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,400
Yan, come on.

998
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,920
This super-sweet tea

999
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,320
tastes good

1000
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,720
when it's made by Mr. Liu.

1001
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,320
Does it?

1002
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,480
Yes.

1003
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,760
Isn't it called

1004
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,240
Mi De Ruyi's super-sweet tea?

1005
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,320
Did you change the name?

1006
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,960
No.

1007
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,600
You're right.

1008
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,280
You did it on purpose.

1009
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,440
Yan, you're so rude.

1010
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,840
I didn't think

1011
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,040
that you would say it

1012
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,840
when I read it.

1013
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
Stop laughing, Ji.

1014
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,200
It's interesting to tease others.

1015
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,320
Young Master, what's the matter?

1016
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,960
The Princess of Fu Hui

1017
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,720
is looking for someone to hold

1018
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,960
the annual Seven-star Poetry Conference.

1019
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,240
I asked a friend of the Imperial College

1020
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:50,880
to make a joke.

1021
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,320
Would you like to try it?

1022
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,080
What?

1023
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,360
Let us hold

1024
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,720
the Seven-star Poetry Conference?

1025
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,720
Well...

1026
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:42,240
DCommission

1027
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,760
The paper heart needs love to succeed.

1028
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,760
The night is opening, what is expected

1029
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,760
What is its future, can't wait to be eliminated

1030
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,760
I wish to come back and be happy, but it's hard to get a new heart

1031
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,760
Time flies too fast, we all have to be happy once in our life

1032
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,760
When the sun rises, the moon and the moon are bright

1033
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,760
When the sun rises, the mountains and seas are not yet full

1034
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,760
When the sun rises, the dragon will rise to the end

1035
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:23,740
You're in the

1036
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,740
special...

1037
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,740
The sky is too hot, the moon is too cold

1038
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,740
The moon is too hot, the moon is too cold

1039
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,740
The moon is too hot, the moon is too cold

1040
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,740
The moon is too hot, the moon is too cold

1041
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,740
The moon is too hot, the moon is too cold

1042
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,740
The moon is too hot, the moon is too cold

1043
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,740
The moon is too hot, the moon is too cold

1044
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,740
The moon is too hot, the moon is too cold

1045
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,740
The moon is too hot, the moon is too cold

1046
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,740
The moon is too hot, the moon is too cold

1047
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,740
The moon is too hot, the moon is too cold

1048
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,740
The moon is too hot, the moon is too cold

1049
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,740
The moon is too hot, the moon is too cold

1050
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,740
The moon is too hot, the moon is too cold

1051
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,740
The moon is too hot, the moon is too cold
