Episode 18

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,880
Hurry up! Hurry up!

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,680
Hurry up!

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,360
Hurry up!

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,200
Young Master.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,720
Wake up. Wake up.

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,400
Young Master.

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,320
Wake up.

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,280
Lin Ye.

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,880
Look at me.

11
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:19,720
Lin Ye.

12
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,760
Don't fall asleep.

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,400
Look at me.

14
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,120
Don't fall asleep.

15
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,600
Don't fall asleep.

16
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,200
Lin Ye.

17
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,320
Lin Ye.

18
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,760
Hurry up!

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,920
Hurry up!

20
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,480
Lin Ye, hang in there.

21
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,240
Lin Ye, we're going home.

22
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:35,800
Hurry up!

23
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:39,640
Lin Ye.

24
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,560
Lin Ye.

25
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,200
Lin Ye.

26
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,240
Lin Ye.

27
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:55,840
Lin Ye.

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:57,960
Lin Ye.

29
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,160
You promised me that you wouldn't fall asleep.

30
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,320
Wake up.

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,440
Wake up.

32
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,560
Don't fall asleep.

33
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,680
Don't fall asleep.

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I promised you.

35
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,440
I didn't.

36
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,560
This wound is too deep.

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,360
I was afraid that it wouldn't work

38
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,240
since I was buried yesterday.

39
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,160
Don't lie to me.

40
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,360
Don't lie to me.

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,040
It's written in the book.

42
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,400
There's a phoenix tree at this time.

43
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,120
Didn't the flower have the pain of three-leafed moths?

44
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:25,960
Master,

45
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,520
you can put his wound up with this.

46
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,520
No, no.

47
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,960
I only read these in the book.

48
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,400
I've never seen anyone look at it like this.

49
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:31,840
I...

50
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,880
I can't.

51
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,520
I don't have any numbness here.

52
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,600
You're already dead.

53
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,200
What are you afraid of?

54
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,960
You just run away like a phoenix.

55
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,240
This is a sign of the young master.

56
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,400
I didn't hit it hard.

57
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,240
If something happens to me, I can't bear it.

58
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,840
Honey,

59
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,000
you'd better go to find the flower.

60
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,760
I beg you.

61
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,320
Doctor,

62
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,520
please save our doctor.

63
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,280
Doctor, I beg you.

64
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,800
Doctor, I beg you.

65
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,920
Please save our doctor.

66
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,680
Please.

67
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,240
You can do it, doctor.

68
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,320
Please save him.

69
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,960
Lin Ye.

70
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,000
Lin Ye.

71
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,320
Lin Ye.

72
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,000
Lin Ye.

73
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,440
Sister.

74
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,400
Sister, you can do it.

75
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,520
No, no, no.

76
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,320
Sister,

77
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,680
you're already dead.

78
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,840
If you do something wrong,

79
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,760
you'll be in trouble.

80
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,680
How about this?

81
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,640
I'll do it.

82
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,600
I can sew clothes.

83
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,560
If anything happens to you,

84
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,360
you'll be the one to blame.

85
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,280
I'll do it.

86
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,400
I'll do it.

87
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,360
I'll do it.

88
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,560
And this fire.

89
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,480
It's to...

90
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,480
To disinfect.

91
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,280
To disinfect.

92
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,480
Brother Pei.

93
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,160
I'm fine.

94
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,200
Ji CHeng

95
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,800
Insert the needle.

96
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,640
Just wipe another name here.

97
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,280
to go on living peacefully and gracefully.

98
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,680
Ay precis sure

99
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:19,580

101
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,360
Useless! Useless! Useless!

102
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,160
por ke

103
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,920
Luo

104
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,000
Great

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,800
You're a police officer.

106
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,560
You have to be punished and imprisoned.

107
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,680
Let go of my hand.

108
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,080
I don't understand what you said.

109
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,720
I just know

110
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
as long as you work hard to get rid of it,

111
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,200
you can leave.

112
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,000
So,

113
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,640
this is your choice.

114
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,760
Lin Ye,

115
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,000
yes, this is my choice.

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,120
So what?

117
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,120
Can we cross the border of morality

118
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,560
and cross the boundary of love?

119
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,840
Are you crazy?

120
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,200
You don't choose so many healthy relationships.

121
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,160
Why are you doing this to me?

122
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,120
Is it true love?

123
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,280
I don't understand what you said.

124
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,360
I don't want to hear it.

125
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,160
Lin Ye,

126
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,800
you're a police officer.

127
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,200
As long as you don't choose me,

128
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,040
you'll live very well.

129
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,600
You'll be lucky.

130
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,880
You'll get married.

131
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,760
There will be a gentleman named Shen

132
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,080
who will be kind and kind

133
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,680
to live with you.

134
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,600
You'll be so selfish

135
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,520
and not afraid of me.

136
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,680
If it wasn't for you,

137
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,840
I wouldn't go.

138
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,800
You can't choose for me.

139
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,760
Shaoguang,

140
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,480
is this

141
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,360
serious

142
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,080
in your time?

143
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,600
Nonsense.

144
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,920
To me,

145
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,200
it's just a long story.

146
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,040
I can't tell the story.

147
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm a lowly man.

148
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,640
I'm not filial.

149
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,680
I'm a man of the family.

150
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,680
I can't rest in peace.

151
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,000
And I

152
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,280
will die for nothing.

153
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,640
I won't forgive myself

154
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,160
for the law, rules, and heaven and earth.

155
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,240
But I

156
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,720
still don't want to let go.

157
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,520
Brother Hu.

158
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,640
Brother Hu.

159
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,840
Mr. Shen.

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,800
The Qin branch.

161
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,440
Wait.

162
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,120
What's going on?

163
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,840
What's going on?

164
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,640
Our young master

165
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,640
wants us to stay here for a few days.

166
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,920
No one can come in or out.

167
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,680
Are there assassins again?

168
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,640
Did they come?

169
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,760
No.

170
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,640
But he told us

171
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,680
no one can come in or out.

172
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,200
Come again some other day.

173
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,760
Come again some other day.

174
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,840
I'm the most despicable coward in the world.

175
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,600
I dare to bow to your father secretly again.

176
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,240
I dare not even write his name.

177
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,280
I guess

178
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,120
your father

179
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,320
really made you his friend.

180
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,000
You still

181
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,240
won't stand here with me

182
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,560
today.

183
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,040
Without you,

184
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,280
I will never

185
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,480
die for my father.

186
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,360
After I framed your father,

187
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,200
I was forced to be the Crown Prince's servant.

188
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,600
I was the Grand Tutor.

189
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,520
I was a student.

190
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,760
He sent someone to the court

191
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,960
to be the Grand Tutor.

192
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,960
The Ministry of War, Ministry of Revenue,

193
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,720
Ministry of Personnel and Imperial Court.

194
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,600
His hands

195
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,600
were given to me by my father

196
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,920
and your father.

197
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,720
I've taken the facts

198
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,080
and evidence

199
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,080
and put them all in it.

200
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,160
You can give them to His Majesty.

201
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,360
According to the law,

202
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,680
even if I'm the criminal,

203
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,360
I'll be executed.

204
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,360
Can you consider me

205
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,080
as a regular?

206
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,400
You can't die for nothing.

207
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,200
You can't be a regular.

208
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,920
But I think

209
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,320
also your father.

210
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,520
Under the tutelage,

211
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,960
if you pay him got,

212
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,760
he still would

213
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,520
ηinvite you to speak it out.

214
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:30,880
what happened

215
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,720
Are you erreicht?

216
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,840
Where have you been these days

217
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,840
I can't argue with you for this reason.

218
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:42,840
I thought you'd ask me when I'd let you go.

219
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,960
But you care more about me.

220
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,960
Lin Ye, I told you I don't like Zhinü.

221
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,080
She's trapped when her clothes are hidden.

222
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,960
I'm sorry.

223
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,080
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,960
I'm sorry.

226
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,080
I'm sorry.

227
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Lin Ye, you're making it hard for yourself by keeping me trapped.

228
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
You used to like me only a little bit.

229
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
But you locked me up...

230
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,760
...and trapped yourself.

231
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,880
Is it necessary?

232
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,760
We can always be together.

233
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
I can't do it.

234
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
Then try again.

235
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
It's not that hard.

236
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,440
Let's pretend nothing happened.

237
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
I've been in danger for days.

238
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,880
He's so mischievous.

239
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What if...

240
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
What if...

241
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
The point is we don't know.

242
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,560
He's a master of the Jin Dynasty.

243
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,680
What if we get caught?

244
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
We can't sue him.

245
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,920
He's our ancestor.

246
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
If we sue him, we'll be punished.

247
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,160
It's Ji.

248
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,280
If it really happened, I'll kill him.

249
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,400
If it really happened, I'll kill him.

250
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,520
But I don't think he'd do that.

251
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Why is he so mischievous?

252
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
My goodness.

253
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
Ji.

254
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
Are you okay?

255
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,640
Ji.

256
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
Did anything happen?

257
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,880
Ji, are you okay?

258
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
No.

259
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
Do you want me to cook something for you?

260
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,240
Ji, tell me.

261
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
What do you want from me?

262
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,480
Tell me.

263
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,080
Ji, tell your family what happened.

264
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
I'm fine.

265
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
Nothing happened.

266
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,440
Shao Yin was injured.

267
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,560
I took care of him for a few days.

268
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,680
That's it.

269
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
I'm going to rest.

270
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,920
Rest.

271
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Dad, mom.

272
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
I told you.

273
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
It won't happen.

274
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
You're all crazy.

275
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
I told you it wouldn't happen.

276
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,520
It's impossible.

277
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,640
I saw it with your mom.

278
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,760
Why did you pinch me again?

279
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,880
It's good that you're okay.

280
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm not.

281
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,920
Let me go.

282
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,280
Dad, I'm now

283
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,120
all because of Lin Ye.

284
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,520
If he learns to live in this world,

285
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,600
he will avenge me

286
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
with all his life.

287
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
Do it.

288
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
Yes.

289
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
The festival is coming.

290
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,040
It's not convenient for the saint to summon you.

291
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,160
But I have something important to do.

292
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,680
I've sent someone to report it.

293
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
I need to see the saint as soon as possible.

294
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Wait.

295
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Why didn't Qin Zhonggui

296
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,640
come to report to His Majesty?

297
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,760
Qin Zhonggui is ill.

298
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,760
What does it mean?

299
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,880
Qin Zhonggui is ill.

300
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,640
It seems that the manager is not in good shape.

301
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,760
Is it because of the recent failure?

302
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,280
I haven't seen anyone.

303
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
The one who came out to thank the guest today

304
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,600
is a new eunuch who has never been invited.

305
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,320
He said Qin Zhonggui was ill.

306
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,640
But he's a teacher.

307
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,480
How can he have a life?

308
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,440
Yes.

309
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,760
That's the problem.

310
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
Qin Zhonggui will teach us anything.

311
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,960
Even if he's ill,

312
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,080
he will be the eunuch.

313
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,000
We shouldn't be

314
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,120
a face-to-face little eunuch.

315
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
Yes.

316
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,320
The saint is in the car.

317
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,080
Wang Yun.

318
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Yes.

319
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,200
12th brother.

320
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,320
Brother Anshan.

321
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,920
I wanted to go to the clouds and the moon to find you.

322
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,920
Fortunately, I couldn't.

323
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,200
What's the hurry?

324
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,320
I'll talk to you in the car.

325
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,080
What's the matter?

326
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,080
Here's the thing.

327
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Today,

328
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,840
I happened to pass by the Princess Royal's mansion.

329
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,560
And...

330
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,800
It's not a coincidence.

331
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,920
My mother-in-law

332
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,400
asked me to bring some dumplings.

333
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,360
They were delicious.

334
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,520
I wanted to

335
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
send them to her and let her try them.

336
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,760
That's not the point.

337
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,600
The point is

338
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,840
someone in the mansion said

339
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,840
the Princess Royal

340
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,280
was invited to the palace to spend the afternoon this morning.

341
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,640
This morning?

342
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,960
Yes. This morning.

343
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,680
It's reasonable to say that it's strange.

344
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,600
After all,

345
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,320
it was the Wei family who came to the palace.

346
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,680
The Crown Prince

347
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,560
was going to the red-worn house

348
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,880
to read the imperial edict.

349
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,880
Go to the red-worn house.

350
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
Go to the red-worn house.

351
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,560
The princess is in the palace?

352
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,200
Then...

353
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,520
The Empress is still in the palace?

354
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,120
Today is the morning.

355
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,360
The palace sent someone to invite the Crown Prince

356
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
to attend the banquet.

357
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,320
I'm curious.

358
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,400
The Crown Prince

359
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,520
is in the palace.

360
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,160
I'm curious.

361
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,960
The Crown Prince

362
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,080
is taking her with him.

363
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,640
What do you think Yang Yang

364
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,640
is doing?

365
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,600
He's not going to school.

366
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,000
Why would he go to the palace?

367
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,480
What...

368
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,760
What will happen in the palace?

369
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,240
Will something really happen?

370
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,640
The history book

371
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,000
doesn't mention anything about the rebellion.

372
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,960
Grandpa didn't mention it

373
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,040
when he was telling the story.

374
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,000
That means the King of Zhao

375
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,520
didn't take the risk this time.

376
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,800
He doesn't deserve to be remembered.

377
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,040
Yes. Yes. Yes.

378
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,600
Before I went to Fenglin Town,

379
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,840
I went to the palace to see someone.

380
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,640
You're going to the red-worn house

381
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,720
to welcome me

382
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,080
to attend the banquet.

383
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,880
I've heard your edict

384
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,360
and asked you to rest at home.

385
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,560
But you should know that

386
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,560
you're the old Duke

387
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,880
I want to keep for A'Xu.

388
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,480
I trust you.

389
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,480
But you insist on asking for an audience today.

390
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,640
Not just to play chess with me, right?

391
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,680
I'm sure

392
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,960
I'm already

393
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,160
in your expectation.

394
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,360
King of Zhao.

395
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,120
Give me your washed paper.

396
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,120
Your Majesty,

397
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,400
Prince Episode 26

398
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,560
Much the opposite.

399
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,400
I only hope

400
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,720
after the morning slippers are done,

401
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,760
his Majesty comes to the palace

402
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,040
so that she can be asked a question by a young lady.

403
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,400
How was your sacrifice,

404
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,360
Your Majesty?

405
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,480
It wasaffle for thethis.

406
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,080
I'm sure the palace is always prepared.

407
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,560
Master, I shouldn't have said much about the truth.

408
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,560
But I have to make you feel at ease.

409
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,760
I promise that Yang Yang won't do anything.

410
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,160
I have to go. You stay here and wait for my news.

411
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,040
Young Master, hurry up!

412
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,440
This...

413
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,640
The Young Goруг will find Zhiyuan envolved in this.

414
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,460
Elder Brother,

415
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,440
we are doing siempre wooing on this possiamo.

416
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,040
So today I brought,

417
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,460
a some of my people, dear to my palace to exchange a bite.

418
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,460
They are more stupid than they are now.

419
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,260
They don't know that

420
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,460
they might also be in the Eastern Palace.

421
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,460
The Eastern Palace?

422
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,460
It's so funny. Take it.

423
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,460
You killed them all,

424
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,460
but you might not

425
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,460
be able to sit in this position.

426
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,460
That's why

427
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,460
I want to ask for a rightful heir.

428
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,460
You've been ill for many days.

429
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,460
The Crown Prince doesn't believe you.

430
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,460
He wants to see you.

431
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,460
He wants to see you.

432
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,460
He wants to see you.

433
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,460
But the Crown Prince is not filial.

434
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,460
He's not in a good mood.

435
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,460
He's planning to

436
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,460
make you leave the throne.

437
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,460
He has no choice

438
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,460
but to follow the order of the Qing Army.

439
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,460
So,

440
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,460
have you thought about

441
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,460
how to write

442
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,460
the imperial edict?

443
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,460
I don't know

444
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,460
what's going on with Yang Yang.

445
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,460
Is she hungry?

446
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,460
Is she afraid?

447
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,460
Yang Yang is blessed.

448
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,460
She'll be able to get better.

449
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,460
She'll be able to.

450
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,460
She'll be able to.

451
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,460
I'm so sorry.

452
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,460
Can you not turn me around?

453
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,460
I'm dizzy.

454
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,460
The Crown Prince knows

455
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,460
that Yang Yang is fine.

456
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,460
Father, I still remember the imperial edict.

457
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,460
I can't believe the Crown Prince.

458
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,460
But Yang Yang is my daughter.

459
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,460
I can't just sit here

460
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,460
and die.

461
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,460
I can't do anything.

462
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,460
All right.

463
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,460
Don't worry.

464
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,460
We'll go together.

465
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,460
But I'm worried

466
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,460
that we'll be in trouble.

467
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,460
What trouble?

468
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,460
They're all out of control.

469
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,460
They can't be in trouble.

470
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,460
Listen.

471
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,460
Three scoundrels

472
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,460
will be the main target.

473
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,460
What about the four of us?

474
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,460
I mean, attack and save them.

475
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,460
Yes, attack.

476
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,460
Save them.

477
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,460
Hurry up.

478
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,460
Hurry up.

479
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,460
Little Brother Cao.

480
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,460
Write a confession letter

481
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,460
that you're on the Duanwu Palace Banquet

482
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,460
on purpose.

483
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,460
Your father's morale is down.

484
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,460
He's disloyal, unfilial, and unfaithful.

485
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,460
Oh my god.

486
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,460
Li Ang.

487
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,460
Your father is stubborn.

488
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,460
You still have a chance to get back at him.

489
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,460
Aunt.

490
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,460
No matter who is in charge of the state,

491
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,460
you're the eldest princess.

492
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,460
If you're on Li Xu's side,

493
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,460
you can only chase after him after you die.

494
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,460
Think about it.

495
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,460
As long as you write a letter,

496
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,460
I'll take you to the palace to see your father.

497
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,460
You can't write it.

498
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,460
You'll be in trouble if you write it.

499
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,460
Do you think he'll let us off?

500
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,460
I'll kill you.

501
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,460
Let them go.

502
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,460
Or I'll die.

503
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,460
It won't be easy.

504
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,460
You have no right to bargain with me.

505
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,460
Father.

506
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,460
Are you all right?

507
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,460
Are you all right?

508
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,460
Don't be afraid.

509
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,460
Your dad is here.

510
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,460
Go.

511
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,460
Go.

512
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,460
Hurry.

513
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,460
Go.

514
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,460
Your dad is here.

515
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,460
Go.

516
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,460
Go.

517
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,460
Go.

518
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,900
398.

519
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,720
I'm Li Ye.

520
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,100
Hurry up.

521
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,300
Ye San, how dare you betray us?

522
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,060
You're not worth anything.

523
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,420
You don't know

524
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,620
how many hostages we've lost in the battle of Fengming.

525
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,540
Young Master has sent someone to help you.

526
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,740
Chang Si.

527
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,580
What are you doing here?

528
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,580
You're so good at fighting.

529
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,660
If you hadn't come earlier, I would have died.

530
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,220
Cut the crap.

531
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,020
Come with me.

532
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,620
Come up.

533
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,020
What's wrong?

534
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,860
What did you do just now?

535
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,740
Just now, I...

536
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,900
I did it for the country's great cause,

537
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,820
for Anran.

538
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,820
I'm in a close relationship with Anran now.

539
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,700
You go to the palace later.

540
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,060
Meet with the First Princess first.

541
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,260
I'll go to get the people from Zhao.

542
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,140
You...

543
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,420
If you don't want to write,

544
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,420
I'll listen to you.

545
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
As long as you sign the seal

546
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,100
and hand over the letter and the military uniform,

547
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,020
I'll let you be the Crown Prince.

548
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,220
I...

549
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,300
Sleep.

550
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,580
Why are you still doughing?

551
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:40,580
Li Xu, I will take the responsibility if I have to.

552
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,660
I'm asking you one last time.

553
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,060
Where are the military uniforms and the treasure?
