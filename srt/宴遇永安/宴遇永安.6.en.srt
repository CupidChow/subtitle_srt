Princess Royal is here!

Greetings, Princess Royal.

299
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
The Great Master of the Shen Family is reading the Dao and is reading the Zhuji.

300
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It's interesting.

301
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's a pity that my appearance is a bit rough.

302
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Otherwise, I wouldn't have the chance to be the princess of the palace.

303
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Your Highness is right.

304
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
My brother is not fit to be the princess.

305
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
That's right.

306
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
All the ladies in Yongan are very beautiful.

307
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I'm afraid that I don't deserve any of them.

308
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
The more you say it, the better you will be.

309
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
The more you say it, the better you will be.

310
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
What other unique insights do you have?

311
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You can tell me more.

312
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I can also ask someone to write it down

313
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
and teach the lords to learn to speak.

314
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It's over.

315
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I won't open it.

316
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The poem will continue.

317
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I won't be able to open it when I come.

318
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Continue.

319
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

320
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Continue.

321
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Continue.

322
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I look ugly.

323
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
This is five times more than what we agreed on.

324
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
The banquet was well done.

325
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
His Highness also gave a few copies of the silk

326
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
and asked Liu Chang to bring them back for you.

327
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Thank you, Young Master.

328
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Lady Shen, the First Princess is here to see you.

329
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

330
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Rise.

331
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
The food you cook is really to my taste.

332
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I called you here to ask

333
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
if you would like to be the cook.

334
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
You don't have to be so formal.

335
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
If you want to leave, just tell me.

336
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Thank you for your kindness.

337
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But I'm from a rural family.

338
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm used to being scattered around.

339
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And we don't know how to cook in Yongan.

340
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm afraid it's not good to serve you.

341
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
You're leaving?

342
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
What a pity.

343
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
If you don't want to be the cook in my house,

344
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
you can just open a restaurant in Yongan.

345
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
That's a good thing.

346
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
You flatter me.

347
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I was at a poem meeting today.

348
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You didn't mind, but added to it.

349
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm sorry.

350
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It's not my fault.

351
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:51,700
Poems are about the

352
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,000
good and the bad.

353
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Your family is doing well.

354
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I just gave you a few more silk.

355
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It's not my fault.

356
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Young Master, I asked the Princess.

357
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
She only gave you a few silk.

358
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
The rest is yours.

359
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
We can't accept it.

360
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm also confident in making you a poem meeting.

361
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
The Princess likes to sing.

362
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You're good at cooking.

363
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I recommended her.

364
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
She will be happy to hear it.

365
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
She will be happy to hear it.

366
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You're a businessman.

367
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
You know how hard it is to be a businessman.

368
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Thank you.

369
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
If you need anything, just call me.

370
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I've already given you a lot of my property.

371
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I can't afford to be a businessman.

372
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
What do you think?

373
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I'm grateful to Young Master.

374
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
If it weren't for him,

375
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
we would have been in trouble

376
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
if we didn't pretend to be noble

377
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
at the feast.

378
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You dare to do that?

379
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
What should I do?

380
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I can't let people bully my family.

381
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Yes.

382
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It's always wrong.

383
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
You're a good person.

384
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Young Master, can you spare some time?

385
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
What's wrong?

386
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
We want to treat you to a meal.

387
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Okay.

388
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It's a deal.

389
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You can go ahead.

390
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I won't bother you.

391
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
That's all the money you've earned.

392
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You've changed it?

393
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
We've returned to Beijing.

394
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
The saint has also added more money to you.

395
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
But it's only been two months.

396
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
That's enough for their family

397
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
to spend the rest of their lives in their hometown.

398
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
When will you be so generous to me?

399
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
How about this?

400
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
You tell me right away.

401
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I'll prepare a pension for you.

402
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
What do you think?

403
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
No need.

404
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I'll just follow you

405
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
and get the money.

406
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
But now you have no one to depend on.

407
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
You can also

408
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
get a divorce from the Shen family.

409
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm afraid that I can't cry in the middle of the night.

410
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I'm afraid that I can't meet you in the end.

411
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

412
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

413
