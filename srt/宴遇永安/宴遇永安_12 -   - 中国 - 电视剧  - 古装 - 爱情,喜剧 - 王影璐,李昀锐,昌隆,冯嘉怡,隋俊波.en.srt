00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 12=

3
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,840
(Capital Prefecture)

4
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,780
Coming, coming.

5
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,280
Come on.

6
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,810
Come on, eat up.

7
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,200
Help yourselves.

8
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,140
Sure.

9
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,740
Here, Mr. Lin.

10
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,310
I've been busy sorting out the markets.

11
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,660
I'll need your cooperation.

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,790
I'll try to give you some allowance.

13
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,680
Mr. Lin,

14
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,410
it's our duty to work hard.

15
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,710
No need for allowance, right?

16
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,970
- Exactly.
- Yes.

17
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,150
It's settled then.

18
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,100
No need to decline.

19
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,290
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

20
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,020
Mr. Lin.

21
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,850
Greetings.

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,780
I didn't expect you

23
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,250
to still be working
on the Mid-Autumn Festival.

24
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,030
Duty calls.

25
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,030
We can't afford to delay.

26
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,630
But today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

27
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,100
You should relax a bit.

28
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,750
The osmanthus flowers are in full bloom.

29
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,080
Her Highness has sent me

30
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,570
to invite you to appreciate

31
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,230
the flowers and taste the wine.

32
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,680
Thanks for her concern,

33
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,860
but I can't leave my post.

34
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,950
I'm afraid I can't go.

35
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,300
Once this period is over,

36
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,300
I'll visit her in person to apologize.

37
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,580
In that case,

38
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,300
I won't disturb you further.

39
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,300
Goodbye.

40
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,380
If I'm not mistaken,

41
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,940
this is the third time

42
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,820
the Princess has invited Mr. Lin, right?

43
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,060
Don't meddle.

44
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,180
What's wrong?

45
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,380
Mr. Lin is so handsome.

46
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,500
If I were a young lady,

47
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,860
I'd like someone like him, too.

48
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,820
Right?

49
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,760
Yes.

50
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,180
Hu.

51
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,500
Don't get me started.

52
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,060
If you were a young lady,

53
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,220
how fierce you'd be.

54
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,020
How could Mr. Lin like you?

55
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,140
What? He might happen to like my type.

56
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,060
Right, Mr. Lin?

57
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,660
What's so funny?

58
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,380
Auntie, you're here.

59
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,900
Come on.

60
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,660
I've prepared some mooncakes for you.

61
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,140
Come on, taste them.

62
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,020
Open it.

63
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,980
Let's take a look.

64
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,020
There are jujube paste fillings,

65
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,860
osmanthus fillings,

66
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,340
and even bean paste fillings.

67
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,300
Take the one

68
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,460
you like.

69
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,260
This is my daughter's idea.

70
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,540
She calls this Mooncake Fortune.

71
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,660
It's like drawing lots

72
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,060
for divination in the temple.

73
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,300
Once you get a mooncake,

74
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,080
it's like you've drawn your own fortune.

75
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,380
The outside is the fortune text,

76
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,820
and the inside is the interpretation.

77
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,300
How clever.

78
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,820
The moon rises bright;

79
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,940
the belle is so fair.

80
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,980
Whoever has this mooncake

81
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,180
will surely find a fine wife.

82
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,140
A fine wife.

83
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,900
A fine wife.

84
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,460
Listen.

85
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,680
Though Mr. Lin just came here,

86
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,300
the line of ladies who want to marry him

87
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,060
could stretch
from the east end of the city

88
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,740
all the way to the west.

89
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,980
- Of course.
- Mr. Lin.

90
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,460
I have a question.

91
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,940
What kind of girl do you like?

92
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,180
Tell us.

93
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,300
Mr. Lin is so talented.

94
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,700
He even deserves

95
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,860
a heavenly fairy.

96
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,500
Tell us.

97
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,300
Come on, tell us.

98
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,460
Tell us, Mr. Lin.

99
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,660
Mr. Lin, I'm also curious.

100
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,500
What kind

101
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,060
of girl do you like?

102
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,820
Tell us, Mr. Lin.

103
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,020
Tell us.

104
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,380
Why look at me?

105
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,740
Do you like someone like me?

106
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,900
Stop talking nonsense.

107
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,740
You...

108
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,340
How dare you joke about Mr. Lin?

109
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,540
It's the festival. Just a joke.

110
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,660
Just a joke.

111
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,110
Eat up.

112
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,100
(You'll find a fine wife)
Let me introduce this.

113
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,820
There must be

114
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,180
good fortune inside.

115
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,100
(Capital Prefecture)

116
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,540
As you instructed,

117
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,900
I've let the officials

118
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,500
go home early for their holidays.

119
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,820
The reorganization affairs

120
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,940
will be handled after the festival.

121
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,020
Young Master,

122
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,580
let's go home and rest.

123
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,260
Liu Chang,

124
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,420
since I took office,

125
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,060
I've been doing my best

126
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,620
as the Vice Prefect.

127
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,540
(Qingyang Cui Case)
I've read this file many times.

128
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,300
All the proof confirmed Father's guilt.

129
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,940
Up to now,

130
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,180
I haven't made any progress.

131
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,020
This old case is so complicated

132
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,580
that it's hard to sort out.

133
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,540
Young Master,

134
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,260
we've waited for so many years.

135
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,260
We don't need to rush.

136
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,860
I understand.

137
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,140
Liu Chang,

138
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,620
you go back to Yunshui Manor.

139
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,180
You can still catch a hot meal.

140
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,020
Young Master,

141
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,540
today is a holiday. You can't...

142
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,500
Go back first.

143
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,420
Come back early.

144
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,180
(31 criminals from Qingyang
were executed.)

145
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,260
Father,

146
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,580
the dishes are cleared.

147
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,060
- Take it easy.
- Come home early

148
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,620
and make mooncakes for me.

149
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,060
Okay.

150
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,580
Today,

151
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,740
let's close the stall early.

152
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,980
Let's go home

153
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,980
and celebrate the festival.

154
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,140
Alright, Father.

155
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,240
I want sweet sesame fillings

156
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,980
for my mooncake.

157
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,940
Okay.

158
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,500
(Yunshui Manor)

159
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,420
(East Kitchen)

160
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,980
Dad, is this delicious?

161
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,660
Yes.

162
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,940
- Auntie.
- Try it.

163
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,340
How does the next line go?

164
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:43,020
Fragrant on the branches with grace,

165
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,660
jasmines are loved by everyone.

166
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,140
Oh, you're still busy.

167
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,340
My young master

168
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,740
is still busy with work.

169
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,680
No need to prepare dinner for him.

170
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,520
Alright.

171
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,980
Okay, I know.

172
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,340
What an attitude.

173
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,900
You don't even care
about my young master.

174
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,140
How heartless.

175
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,500
Liu Chang.

176
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,900
Wait.

177
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,940
Wait.

178
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,000
Wait.

179
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,100
Wait.

180
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,980
(Qingyang Cui Case)

181
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,300
(Deal with it swiftly
to serve as a warning.)

182
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,020
Taste it and see how it is.

183
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,020
Thanks, dear.

184
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,940
One for Father.

185
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,020
One for Mother.

186
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,020
Thanks.

187
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,020
One for me.

188
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,300
Che, good boy.

189
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,860
This piece is particularly good,

190
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,340
with layers of fat and lean meat.

191
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,860
Give it to Che first.

192
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,740
Father is serving this to Mother.

193
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,100
I'm not eating it.

194
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,420
Auntie, I made this mooncake.

195
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,860
So impressive.

196
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,580
You must let Mr. Lin try it.

197
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,100
Mr. Lin.

198
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,020
- Mr. Lin.
- Stop working.

199
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,980
- Come.
- Come and eat.

200
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,920
Today is a festival.

201
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,360
Let's all gather together.

202
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,660
You can continue after dinner.

203
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,260
Young Master, come on.

204
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,500
- Mr. Lin.
- Mr. Lin, come.

205
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,900
There are so many delicious dishes.

206
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,100
Come on, Mr. Lin.

207
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,460
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival

208
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,600
to Mr. Lin

209
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,820
and Mr. Liu Chang.

210
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,860
Let's do it together.

211
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,886
Come on, come on.

212
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,620
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

213
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,180
Yangyang is so smart and clever.

214
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,500
If I had a daughter like you,

215
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,340
I'd pick that round moon

216
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,620
and give it to you.

217
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,620
Don't worry.

218
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,900
You'll have it sooner or later.

219
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,860
Is that so?

220
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,180
Come on, Mr. Lin.

221
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,540
Have some chicken wings.

222
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,500
Eat up.

223
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,420
- Try it.
- Here.

224
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,380
Thanks.

225
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,140
Alright, try it.

226
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,020
Here, Yangyang.

227
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,020
What are you doing?

228
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,460
Your neck...

229
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,140
Go that way.

230
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,380
Come on.

231
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,780
We'll never part this way.

232
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,020
Yangyang.

233
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,820
Come on, Yangyang.

234
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,680
Be careful not to hurt yourself.

235
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,900
Alright.

236
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,180
Here, Yangyang.

237
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,140
Have some vegetables.

238
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Here, Yangyang.

239
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,700
Let me serve you some of this.

240
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,300
Is there something on Mr. Lin's mind?

241
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,140
At this festival,

242
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,420
families should be together.

243
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,060
My young master just misses his family.

244
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,020
Liu Chang,

245
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,460
eat.

246
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:07,980
So delicious.

247
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,260
Father, Mother,

248
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,340
when Grandpa...

249
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,140
Grandfather passed away,

250
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,900
Gongcai and I were also sad.

251
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,020
We remember.

252
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,340
You were too young at that time.

253
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,380
You couldn't understand why

254
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,580
you'd never see Grandfather again.

255
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,540
Then

256
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,660
you lied to us

257
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,100
and said that when people die,

258
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,600
they become stars in the sky

259
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,000
and watch over us forever.

260
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,180
Jicai exposed it on the spot,

261
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,540
saying that stars are just stars

262
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,100
and they are not people at all.

263
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,420
Mr. Lin,

264
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,660
sorry about this.

265
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,900
Jicai has loved reading books

266
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,260
since she was young.

267
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,420
She's not gullible.

268
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,300
So, her father and I

269
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,900
had to tell her the truth.

270
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,180
You see,

271
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,620
when people die,

272
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,780
they are gone.

273
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,940
Those words are

274
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,700
made up for the living.

275
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,220
But the deceased

276
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,860
must've loved you very much.

277
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,740
They wouldn't want

278
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,860
their departure to cause you pain.

279
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,380
Instead, they'd hope

280
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,140
that you live happily every day.

281
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,140
Yes, yes, yes.

282
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,100
You must be happy

283
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,780
every day.

284
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,740
Indeed.

285
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,210
Thank you.

286
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,100
Fengxia and I

287
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,780
have never had any disagreements.

288
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,060
You doing so well

289
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,620
nowadays

290
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,340
is all thanks

291
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,620
to your mother.

292
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,980
Ever since the day you married me,

293
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,220
I knew

294
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,660
I had a good wife.

295
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,260
I was not wrong.

296
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,500
You have no idea.

297
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,620
Back then, we were poor.

298
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,060
I could only give her 2,500 a month.

299
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,060
With just that meager amount,

300
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,440
your mother

301
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,500
managed the entire household's expenses,

302
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,820
from food to clothing.

303
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,380
That's when I knew

304
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,780
I had a wife

305
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,260
who'd stick with me

306
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,420
through thick and thin.

307
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,420
I'll drink to you.

308
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,380
Fengxia,

309
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,340
I love you.

310
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,620
Come on.

311
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,820
So, you chose

312
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,380
to be with me

313
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,620
because I could manage

314
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,940
to keep the household in order

315
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,180
with your meager wage,

316
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,140
right?

317
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,100
No.

318
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,900
You've got it wrong.

319
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,340
What I mean is

320
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,940
that even when we were so poor,

321
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,820
your mother still loved me.

322
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,820
It's different now.

323
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,940
Now,

324
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,660
we have money.

325
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,140
It's different from back then.

326
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,020
Look at your mother,

327
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,100
with the headdress

328
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,960
like a cockscomb

329
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,340
and those

330
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,540
expensive robes.

331
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,460
They're pricey.

332
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,420
Dad.

333
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,900
I bought these headdresses

334
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,820
and robes with my own money.

335
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,940
What's it to you?

336
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,980
With your own money? I don't think so.

337
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,900
Of course, that's my money.

338
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,220
Who's been in the kitchen,

339
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,200
cooking all the dishes

340
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,660
- one by one?
- Stop them.

341
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,340
Frying, roasting, boiling,
stir-frying, steaming, and grilling.

342
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,740
I've done it all.

343
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,820
Aren't you ashamed at all?

344
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,420
Pork, stir-fried dishes.

345
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,340
All these ideas were from Jicai.

346
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,300
Grandma.

347
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,260
Plus, people here haven't tasted

348
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,100
those dishes before.

349
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,660
It has nothing to do with you.

350
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,700
You've changed a lot.

351
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,720
I never looked down on you

352
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,140
when you were poor.

353
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,620
At least you were down-to-earth
and humble.

354
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,500
Look how arrogant you've become.

355
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,420
Let the kids see

356
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,740
how arrogant you've become.

357
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,780
Grandma.

358
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,340
You just can't stand to see me do well.

359
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,920
You can't bear to see me show my talent.

360
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,660
Why?

361
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,580
Because you're not making progress.

362
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,900
You're jealous.

363
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,380
Jealous?

364
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,220
Dad.

365
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,260
That's right.

366
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,220
Shen Jianshe,

367
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,860
you really crack me up.

368
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,460
I'm losing my teeth from laughing.

369
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,330
What's the matter?

370
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,640
I can't stand to see you do well?

371
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,760
I'm not making progress?

372
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,460
Fine.

373
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,820
Let's get a divorce.

374
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,180
Find a woman who thinks you're great.

375
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,380
- Mom.
- Grandma.

376
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,540
It's okay.

377
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,140
How can you say such things

378
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,220
on the Mid-Autumn Festival?

379
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:45,900
It's so unlucky.

380
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,540
When we got married, I told you

381
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,740
that no matter what,

382
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,940
no matter who's right or wrong,

383
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,300
we should never talk about divorce.

384
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,100
Don't be impulsive. Let's talk it out.

385
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,440
Tell your mom

386
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,500
to take those words back.

387
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,800
I'll pretend I didn't hear them.

388
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,900
Why should I take them back?

389
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,820
Why shouldn't you?

390
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,180
You can hear it or not.

391
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,340
Uncle, Auntie.

392
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,500
Calm down.

393
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,740
What are you trying to do?

394
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,260
What do you want?

395
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,340
What are you doing?

396
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,180
Are you serious?

397
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,220
Are you serious about it?

398
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,420
What? Rolling up your sleeves?

399
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,780
- Are you...?
- Trying to hit me?

400
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,340
If you want a divorce, fine.

401
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,500
Divorce it is.

402
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,700
Uncle, Auntie.

403
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,620
- Uncle.
- Uncle.

404
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,480
Yangyang, don't cry.

405
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,860
Divorce is serious.

406
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,580
Don't rush into it
just because of pride.

407
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,780
It's not about pride.

408
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,780
Today is a festival.

409
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,660
It's not easy for us to gather here.

410
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,020
Listen to what she said.

411
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,700
What did you say?

412
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,460
- Yangyang.
- Try to be the reasonable one?

413
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,340
Yangyang, stop crying.

414
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,540
Don't cry, don't cry.

415
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,660
Come on, go back with me.

416
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,540
Don't cry, good girl.

417
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,500
Where are you going?

418
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,820
Leave.

419
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,400
Don't come back.

420
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,660
Go sleep at the diner.

421
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,540
Mom.

422
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,700
Fine, I won't go back.

423
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,580
I'm not the same Shen Jianshe as before.

424
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,540
Why all of a sudden...?

425
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,580
I...

426
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,660
Dad, Dad.

427
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,060
Who am I?

428
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,420
I'm the Best Chef in Yong'an.

429
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,460
Liu Chang,

430
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,420
keep an eye on things.

431
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,380
What are you doing?

432
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,620
Mother.

433
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,260
Are we still having dinner?

434
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,620
Yangyang.

435
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,510
Mother.

436
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,740
Don't be angry.

437
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,380
I'm sorry.

438
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,740
I ruined

439
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,260
a perfectly good evening.

440
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,380
I wanted to celebrate
the festival with you,

441
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,980
but instead, I made a fool of myself.

442
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,020
Do you think

443
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,700
that I'm just your landlord

444
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,660
because you live in my house?

445
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,700
Or do you think

446
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,180
that I'm someone you should cling to

447
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,860
because you run a business

448
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,260
in Juxian Alley

449
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,300
and I'm the Vice Prefect?

450
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,580
No, absolutely not.

451
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,460
We consider you as family.

452
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,500
I do, too.

453
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,340
You knew my identity issue.

454
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,580
It'll be fine if no one finds out,

455
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,640
but if someone does,
you'll be committing a crime.

456
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,060
You didn't use this to get
any benefits from me.

457
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,980
Instead, you took care of me

458
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,980
and comforted me.

459
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,700
You accepted my shortcomings.

460
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,340
Why would you think

461
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,860
that I'd enjoy

462
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,340
your parents' quarrel?

463
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,740
It's not that.

464
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,380
It's my problem.

465
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,540
I thought it was a joke.

466
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,940
Mr. Lin, can I treat you as a tree hole?

467
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,940
Separated by a screen,

468
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,620
you're not the Vice Prefect anymore.

469
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,780
You're my tree hole.

470
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,900
Tree hole?

471
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,820
Am I

472
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,580
a hole

473
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,940
in a tree?

474
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,980
No.

475
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,980
A tree hole means

476
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,020
that you're someone

477
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,220
I can confide my secrets and worries to,

478
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,500
someone I can trust.

479
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,460
I see.

480
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,140
Before coming to Yong'an,

481
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,320
our family business wasn't doing well.

482
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,300
Mother took on a lot.

483
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,620
Father couldn't earn much money,

484
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,260
but he was very good to us.

485
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,540
But after coming to Yong'an,

486
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,020
Father's dishes became popular.

487
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,820
He changed a bit.

488
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,260
He often quarreled with Mother.

489
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,190
I knew

490
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,100
that this would lead to problems,

491
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,740
but I wanted to pretend
nothing had happened.

492
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,180
Just now, I didn't think

493
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,500
that you'd enjoy this.

494
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,900
It's my problem.

495
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,340
I thought they acted improperly,

496
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,900
but they are my parents.

497
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,660
How could I be so selfish
and despicable?

498
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,860
In everything,

499
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,140
we judge actions, not intentions.

500
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,900
You haven't done anything

501
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,140
to hurt others.

502
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,820
Thoughts are just thoughts.

503
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,700
You're not trying to become a saint.

504
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,420
Why be so hard on yourself?

505
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,360
Now, you're just a tree hole.

506
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,560
You can't comment.

507
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,660
Sorry.

508
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,220
I know

509
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,780
even if I had the thought

510
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,500
that they acted improperly,

511
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,660
maybe they also had moments

512
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,540
when they felt burdened by me.

513
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,700
But none of that matters.

514
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,020
What matters is that we are a family.

515
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,980
We'll never abandon each other.

516
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,220
Before, I thought

517
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,660
that my family was so unlucky

518
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,980
that there couldn't be
any ancestral protection.

519
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,580
But now I know:

520
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,660
Someone's been protecting us all along.

521
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,500
Thanks.

522
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,820
Can the tree hole speak now?

523
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,940
The tree hole can't speak,

524
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,060
but Mr. Lin can.

525
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,460
Actually,

526
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,940
I haven't done much.

527
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,140
A family stuck together

528
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,820
can achieve anything.

529
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,540
Maybe I can also be your tree hole.

530
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,820
Do you have any troubles?

531
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,060
Thanks for your comfort

532
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,580
just now at dinner.

533
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,980
Actually,

534
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,900
on every occasion

535
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,940
when families should be together,

536
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,940
I feel very guilty.

537
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,180
Shaoguang,

538
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,020
my parents

539
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,140
were not criminals.

540
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,220
My father used to be the Prefect.

541
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,020
He dedicated himself to the people,

542
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,860
but he was framed.

543
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,060
I changed

544
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,020
my name

545
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,580
and became the Vice Prefect,

546
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,700
yet I've achieved nothing.

547
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,260
I really don't know

548
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,220
what qualifications
I have to enjoy myself

549
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,580

00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,300
We ruined your dinner,

572
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,300
so I prepared
a mixed nuts mooncake for you.

573
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,700
Mixed nuts?

574
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,380
Give it a try.

575
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,860
I've never had such a mooncake.

576
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,980
Let me try it.

577
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,900
It's delicious.

578
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,540
I didn't expect you

579
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,420
to appreciate this filling.

580
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,780
Are many people

581
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,260
not fond of this filling?

582
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,220
More than that.

583
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,580
In the Future Village,

584
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,140
mooncake lovers
will be divided into two camps.

585
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,260
One side supports this filling,

586
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,140
while the other thinks

587
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,220
this filling is extremely bad.

588
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,380
This issue can even

589
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,060
make friends fall out.

590
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,340
In my family,
I'm the only one who's fond of it.

591
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,900
This year,

592
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,140
at the spring equinox,

593
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,180
Yong'an also had a heated argument.

594
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,380
The scholars debated

595
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,660
whether a pottery pillow

596
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,500
or a wooden pillow was more elegant,

597
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,180
and they filled a whole wall

598
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,660
of Guixiang Tavern with poems,

599
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,620
insulting each other.

600
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,140
What's the point of that?

601
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,820
Then I'll present you

602
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,820
with a cotton pillow
from the Future Village.

603
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,260
It's better than those.

604
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,500
It's soft to sleep on,

605
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,420
not cold in winter,

606
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,620
and good for the neck bones.

607
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,500
But my sewing skills aren't good.

608
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,860
My mother is best at this.

609
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,940
Your parents

610
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,940
are reasonable people.

611
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,620
They will talk it out.

612
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,580
Now, I think

613
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,700
you're really

614
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,300
like my friend.

615
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,820
But for me,

616
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,620
you should be revered,

617
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,500
and I can never

618
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,980
disrespect you.

619
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,940
I

620
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,420
can't be disrespected?

621
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,220
Do you still

622
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,580

(Yunshui Manor)

643
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,540
I'm so sorry. I'll never dare again.

644
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,420
Last night,

645
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,300
after getting drunk,

646
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,180
I offended

647
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,380
the man I respect the most.

648
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,000
I deserve to be killed and sent to hell.

649
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,320
I'm sorry to my family and you.

650
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm so sorry. I'll never drink again.

651
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,900
Lady Shen,

652
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,060
what happened last night?

653
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,580
I don't remember.

654
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,260
I remember

655
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,020
we ate mooncakes together.

656
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,540
I became a tree hole,

657
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,420
and then

658
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,540
we drank wine together.

659
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,140
After that,

660
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,580
I can't remember clearly.

661
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,780
Did something bad happen?

662
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,340
You don't remember?

663
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,900
You just said

664
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,980
you're sorry to your family

665
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,020
and me.

666
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,660
What did you do?

667
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,460
Nothing, nothing.

668
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,620
I shouldn't have let you

669
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,500
drink so much wine.

670
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
If it delays your duties today,

671
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,010
that'd be my fault.

672
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,700
Just for that?

673
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,300
Why did you kneel to me?

674
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,740
Well.

675
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,980
I feel alcohol

676
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,220
is the source of all evil.

677
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,060
There aren't
many good officials like you.

678
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,500
Yet I dragged you into drinking.

679
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,300
I really should repent.

680
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,660
I'll go and make you some sobering soup.

681
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,900
You're sick.

682
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,060
Oh, I'm having a fever.

683
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,900
It's okay; this is retribution.

684
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,420
I'll make some sobering soup for you.

685
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,220
You're sick.

686
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,380
You're ill.

687
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,580
I deserve this. It's my retribution.

688
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,400
Sorry.

689
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,820
Wait a minute.

690
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,300
What are you doing?

691
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,820
Come on.

692
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,420
Mr. Lin.

693
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,020
I can't take it.

694
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,260
I'm not feeling well.

695
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,860
I can't go into your room.

696
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,220
I'll call your family first

697
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,500
and find a physician for you.

698
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,980
I don't mind.

699
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,540
Why are you suddenly

700
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,220
concerned about the boundaries?

701
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,340
Because of the curfew,

702
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,740
we even spent a night in the diner.

703
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,500
What's wrong?

704
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,420
Well.

705
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,700
I should care.

706
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,260
You often say things

707
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,660
that others don't understand.

708
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,740
It's nothing serious.

709
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,140
However,

710
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,500
in some word choices,

711
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,460
you should

712
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,380
be more cautious.

713
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,060
Take a rest.

714
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:44,660
(Clear and Bright)

715
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,460
How could the fever get so bad?

716
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,020
Jicai,

717
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,060
do you feel unwell?

718
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,100
We can't even

719
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,340
find cold medicine here.

720
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,780
What should we do?

721
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,580
What to do?

722
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,780
It's also your fault, dear.

723
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,620
You insisted

724
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,940
that I sleep at the diner.

725
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,140
As soon as I left home,

726
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,380
our daughter got sick.

727
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,580
What should we do?

728
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,700
What to do?

729
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,580
Stop pretending to be anxious.

730
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,020
Go ask your ancestor

731
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,860
if the physician's medicine is ready.

732
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,940
Don't cover her like this.

733
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,100
She'll get hot.

734
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,500
Don't do that.

735
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,020
She needs to sweat now.

736
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,140
We have to cover her up.

737
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,020
If you uncover her,
she'll catch a cold again.

738
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,220
Do you know?
Secondary colds can be very serious.

739
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,220
In this era,
the mortality rate is quite high.

740
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,180
Do you know?

741
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,260
Can't you say something good?

742
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,940
This is not conducive to cooling down.

743
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,540
Your method is not scientific at all.

744
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,420
Do you know?

745
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,820
Nagging all day long.

746
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,670
When I was a child,

747
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,640
that's how it was done.

748
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,460
Stop all that.

749
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,300
Enough, stop arguing.

750
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,540
Jicai is already unwell.

751
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,420
With the quarreling,

752
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,660
she'll be even more upset.

753
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,820
But

754
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,580
what if it's not a cold?

755
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,620
She ate three boxes

756
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,420
of mixed nuts mooncakes yesterday.

757
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,740
Maybe she's got heat in her body.

758
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,580
Three boxes?

759
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,430
Why eat so many?

760
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,640
Are you a hoarder or something?

761
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,140
Your illness

762
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,080
is not strange at all.

763
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,220
Dad,

764
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,780
can you just keep quiet?

765
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,540
It's not about that.

766
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,460
I'm being punished.

767
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,420
What?

768
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,340
What did she say?

769
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,020
I said I ate three boxes of mooncakes.

770
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,980
I deserve this.

771
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,220
You absolutely deserve it.

772
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,300
You ate so much.

773
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,060
Can you stop talking?

774
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,420
The medicine is here.

775
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,840
- Come on.
- The medicine is here.

776
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,800
Come on.

777
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,220
Come on, Jicai.

778
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,180
Take your medicine.

779
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,540
Take it, and you'll get better.

780
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,380
I won't drink it. It's too bitter.

781
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,780
- Good girl.
- Can I not drink it?

782
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,100
It's too bitter.

783
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,840
You silly child.

784
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,900
How can the fever go down

785
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,220
if you don't take the medicine?

786
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,340
Why scold her?

787
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,820
Those words

788
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,020
are unlucky.

789
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:44,940
I...

790
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,540
Let me feed her, okay?

791
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,900
Come on, you do it.

792
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,440
Let's see
if you can make her drink it.

793
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,580
Show us how it's done.

794
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,070
- Dad.
- Good girl.

795
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:53,940
Do me a favor.

796
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,100
Just take a sip.

797
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,700
Come on, just one sip.

798
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,900
Good medicine tastes bitter.

799
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,860
Take a sip.

800
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,180
Just take a sip.

801
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,340
Take a sip.

802
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,360
- Gongcai.
- One sip.

803
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,220
Dad.

804
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,620
Good-for-nothing.

805
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,620
Let Mr. Lin feed her.

806
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,820
He's the Vice Prefect

807
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,900
and our ancestor.

808
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,340
She'll surely drink it.

809
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,820
Mr. Lin.

810
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,020
Please help.

811
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,460
Your status is different.

812
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,220
You're our ancestor...

813
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,460
No.

814
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,460
You're the Vice Prefect.

815
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,340
She'd surely listen to you.

816
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,580
No matter what,

817
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,020
make her drink the medicine.

818
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,300
Please help.

819
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,860
Please.

820
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,500
Please help us.

821
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,500
Thanks, thanks.

822
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,020
Drink the medicine.

823
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,060
Here.

824
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,940
Drink the medicine.

825
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,940
Look.

826
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,300
So soon.

827
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,740
I want to sleep now.

828
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,700
You should leave.

829
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,420
She finished so soon?

830
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,580
Alright, Jicai wants to sleep. Let's go.

831
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,500
Yangyang, let's go.

832
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,540
Let's go.

833
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,460
- Let's go.
- Jicai, sleep well.

834
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,660
I'll take it. Let's go.

835
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,700
Sleep well, Jicai.

836
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,460
If you feel unwell,

837
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,780
just call out.
