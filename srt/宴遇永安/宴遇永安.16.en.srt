благодар

31
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:53,500
It was

32
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
Why are you still here?

33
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
I've been working all day.

34
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm tired.

35
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
You're tired?

36
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
Then go back to your room and sleep.

37
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,500
Fengxia,

38
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,500
why don't we stop?

39
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Let me sleep.

40
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500
That little restaurant

41
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
is cold and quiet.

42
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,500
The key is that it's not warm

43
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,500
without you.

44
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
You're blind.

45
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
You want to come back and sleep?

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Yes.

47
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
Really?

48
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Really?

49
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
You say it.

50
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
I'll take care of your money.

51
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
I'll give you ten dollars a month.

52
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
If you

53
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,500
are too lazy to be a chef,

54
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
I'll deduct your money.

55
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
You give me ten dollars in total.

56
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
You deduct my money.

57
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
How much do we earn a month?

58
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Ten dollars is too much.

59
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Can you increase it?

60
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
If you don't agree,

61
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
I won't force you.

62
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
We're still the same.

63
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
We'll still be equal in the future.

64
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
You can go back to your restaurant and sleep.

65
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
I...

66
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
I don't want to go back to the restaurant.

67
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
It's getting late.

68
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Go back to sleep.

69
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
I'm not sleepy.

70
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
Go.

71
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
Ten dollars?

72
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,500
You're too much.

73
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
See you.

74
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,500
I'm not going to sleep.

75
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Mister! Mister!

76
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
You're making me feel better.

77
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
What's wrong?

78
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
It's late.

79
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
Why are you in the yard?

80
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
What are you talking about?

81
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
I'm going to ask him about the prince.

82
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Tonight, the prince is avoiding me.

83
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
I have to ask what he said to Uncle Shen.

84
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
There's an important information.

85
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
There are 32 people who came to the city

86
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
to kill themselves.

87
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
This is the place where Mister Yuan was.

88
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
We have to go and see.

89
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,500
They're waiting for us.

90
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Let's go.

91
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Honey, you asked me to come to the water park with you.

92
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Are you worried about something?

93
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Do you want to talk to someone?

94
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,500
I don't understand why the prince asked us to go to the water park.

95
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Why is it Zhao?

96
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Isn't it Shao Ying?

97
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
I saw you two on the horse today.

98
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
You two are like that.

99
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
What are we like? We have nothing.

100
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
I saw it.

101
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
No, you misunderstood.

102
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
I'm devoted to Shao Ying.

103
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
I see her as an ancestor, an angel.

104
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Don't say such a big lie.

105
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
I...

106
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,500
I'm thinking about Zhao.

107
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
If she thinks

108
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
we're dragging her down,

109
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
she can give us money.

110
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
Why does she draw a water-patterned pen

111
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
and make us go there?

112
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,500
Maybe I've made her and Shao Ying's relationship

113
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
simpler.

114
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
It's impossible that she's taking us as hostage.

115
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,500
What?

116
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
I'm not going.

117
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Young Master.

118
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,500
Young Master.

119
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
The study is dark.

120
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
He's not in the bedroom.

121
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
Where is he going?

122
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,500
Maybe he has work to do.

123
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
Shao Ying often goes to Jinzhao Mansion at night.

124
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Why don't we ask him tomorrow?

125
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
Let's go.

126
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Shao Ying went to Chengzhou last night

127
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
for a business trip.

128
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Why so suddenly?

129
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,500
I'm not sure about work.

130
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Thank you.

131
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Shao Ying.

132
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Who? Who climbed on my bed?

133
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
Me? Your father?

134
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,500
Dad?

135
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Dad?

136
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Are you okay?

137
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Come here.

138
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,500
I just fell asleep.

139
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
You almost kicked me.

140
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
I didn't know it was you.

141
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
I thought you were taking advantage of me.

142
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,500
Why did you climb on my bed?

143
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,500
It was too late yesterday.

144
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
I was too lazy to go back to the shop.

145
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
I wanted to stay overnight with you.

146
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Stop it.

147
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
My mom didn't let you in.

148
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
It's a big deal. Stop singing.

149
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,500
I can sing. 20.

150
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Who is it?

151
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
I'll go check.

152
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Coming.

153
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Who is it?

154
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Zhong... Zhong... Zhong what?

155
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,500
Zhong Gui.

156
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
Isn't Zhong Gui with Prince Zhao?

157
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Why is he here?

158
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Yes. Why are you here?

159
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
His Highness was busy.

160
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
He left last night.

161
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
His Highness said to be more cautious.

162
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Women can stay still.

163
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
I think you should go to the city first.

164
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
What?

165
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Zhong Gui.

166
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
You came suddenly.

167
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
We haven't prepared yet.

168
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,500
We didn't discuss it clearly.

169
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
How about we give it back?

170
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Yes.

171
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,500
You didn't discuss it clearly.

172
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
You said you were in a hurry.

173
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
But you didn't want to go.

174
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Never mind.

175
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,500
I'll go and report it.

176
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,500
No.

177
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
No.

178
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,500
You can't go.

179
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
If you don't...

180
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Zhong Gui.

181
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Wait.

182
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
You're so fast.

183
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500
I'm the fastest.

184
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
You're fast.

185
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
What are you doing?

186
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Go.

187
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Mom.

188
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
Mom.

189
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Prince Zhao asked us to go to Su Wei City.

190
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,500
My dad thinks we're too busy.

191
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
It's not appropriate to go.

192
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
So we'll go and see.

193
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
Go.

194
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
We'll go first.

195
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
It's not good to be worried.

196
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Slow down.

197
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Be careful.

198
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
Wait.

199
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Why are you so impulsive?

200
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
We should discuss it with A Ji and the young master.

201
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
What's there to discuss?

202
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
It's a good opportunity.

203
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Besides, they're leaving soon.

204
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
There's no time to discuss.

205
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
You're in a hurry.

206
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
No one is going with you.

207
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
What if you get into trouble?

208
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
What trouble?

209
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
If there's a problem, I can't handle it.

210
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,500
Sorry.

211
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
I have to go early to report it.

212
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,500
It's late.

213
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,500
It's late.

214
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
It's late.

215
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
Go.

216
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Shen Jiansheng.

217
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
You like to go, right?

218
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
You go by yourself.

219
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Mom.

220
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Mom.

221
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Mom.

222
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
You can't let my dad go alone.

223
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
I want to go.

224
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
Look at him.

225
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
He's so enthusiastic.

226
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Look at the carriage.

227
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,500
He's so energetic.

228
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Look.

229
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
The King of Zhao invited us.

230
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,500
He sent us to pick up the luggage.

231
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,500
If we don't go,

232
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
we'll be disrespectful to the luggage.

233
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Let's go.

234
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,500
There's a lot to see.

235
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
What about Yangyang?

236
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
We can't let A Ji go to see Yangyang.

237
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
A Ji is tired of watching the store every day.

238
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500
That's right.

239
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Your father,

240
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
I took my parents to Sihui City to check.

241
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,500
I'll pick you up when I'm done.

242
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
They're all gone?

243
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Why don't you stop them?

244
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Your family?

245
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
What's wrong with us?

246
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
I'm sorry.

247
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
I was in a hurry.

248
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Where are you going?

249
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
I'll take care of the restaurant.

250
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Okay, go ahead.

251
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,500
Your Highness,

252
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
the Shen family is on the road.

253
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
I think

254
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
it's time to go to Chengzhou.

255
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
The governor said

256
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
32 cows died in the disaster.

257
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
It's a cow.

258
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
It's not a normal cow.

259
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
It's the cow that was offered by the city.

260
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
I respect cows.

261
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Cows are all

262
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
one of the ten evils.

263
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Cows are our support.

264
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
32 cows?

265
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
They're all going to die.

266
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
It's a big deal.

267
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
We can't handle it.

268
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
What should we do?

269
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Young Master Lin,

270
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
32 cows died.

271
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
We must catch the murderer.

272
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
You can check

273
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
the water source and materials

274
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
to see if anyone has poisoned the cows.

275
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
But 32 cows died in a row.

276
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Most of them are animals.

277
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
We need to be careful.

278
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
We'll see.

279
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Finally, we'll hold a ceremony for the cow.

280
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
I see.

281
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
No wonder

282
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
you're so young.

283
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
You're so smart.

284
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
You're so thoughtful.

285
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
What's so hard about it?

286
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
You're so stupid.

287
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
How dare you

288
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
invite Young Master Jingzhao from Yong'an?

289
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Did someone mention it?

290
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
They said they could send someone

291
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
to the capital to ask for help.

292
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,500
Yes, yes.

293
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
How did you know?

294
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
A few days ago,

295
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
I didn't know what to do.

296
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
Someone wrote to me

297
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
and told me to go to Young Master.

298
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
He said he was a good man.

299
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
He said I could find him

300
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
if I needed anything.

301
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
Who? Did he die?

302
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
No.

303
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Go!

304
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
What's wrong?

305
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Uncle! A'Jing!

306
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Wait for me.

307
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Why are you here?

308
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
Miss Shen.

309
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
You're going to Su Shui City, right?

310
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
Please get in the car.

311
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
I'll talk to my family

312
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
first.

313
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
Please. A'Jing.

314
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,500
Get off.

315
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,500
No, no.

316
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,500
A'Jing, get in.

317
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
You're so cold.

318
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
Get in.

319
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,500
Get in.

320
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,500
You're so brave.

321
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
You're not afraid of being dragged away?

322
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
You're thinking too much.

323
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
How did the ancients know

324
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
about this?

325
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Everyone, if you delay the trip,

326
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
you'll be blaming me.

327
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Get off.

328
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
Get off what?

329
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
We'll go there and see what happens.

330
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Besides, we've already

331
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
been half way there.

332
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
No, no.

333
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
I told them both

334
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
not to listen.

335
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Get off.

336
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Be careful.

337
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
It's too dangerous.

338
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
Get off.

339
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
A'Jing.

340
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
A'Jing.

341
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
What are you doing?

342
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Are you okay?

343
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
It's okay.

344
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
It's okay.

345
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
Go.

346
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Go.

347
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
It's so big.

348
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,500
You mean

349
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
they're not going to

350
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500
welcome us to the party?

351
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
It's possible.

352
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
There's no one here.

353
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
What are you doing?

354
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
Why is the door closed?

355
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
This...

356
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Welcome.

357
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
You're so good at making up.

358
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
You deserve to be spared.

359
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
You deserve to be spent.

360
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:31,120
The discounted

361
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
she doesn't love you

362
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
more.

363
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,740
You are

364
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,500
god身

365
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
should be

366
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
happy.

367
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
You deserve it.

368
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Time will be

369
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,520
willing to

370
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
find out what happened.

371
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:03,460
The

372
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,960
adventures

373
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,960
Whose responsibility is the biggest?

374
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,960
This time...

375
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
This time...

376
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
This time...

377
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
Dad, what time is it already?

378
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Why are you still doing this?

379
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,960
Mom, did you see that? My dad tried to bribe me, and I found out.

380
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,960
Mom, I already criticized him.

381
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
Should I say it or not,

382
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
this time, you are indeed the one who is responsible.

383
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,960
What do you mean I am responsible?

384
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,960
That... am I your dad?

385
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
You are still denying it.

386
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
I am responsible, but the government is also responsible.

387
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
Dad,

388
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
you are also very active and actively trying to leave with him.

389
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
That's right! Look at you!

390
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
You can't even listen to Yangyang anymore!

391
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
Can you two be a little more serious?

392
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
You are always doing useless things. What are you going to do in the future?

393
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
I will be a new person.

394
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
Can you do it?

395
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,960
Yes.

396
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
Okay, sit down.

397
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,960
Think about it. The standards you have on the road to receive us are all very high.

398
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
You didn't let us worry too much.

399
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
It was until we entered the city of water and water,

400
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
that King of Zhao turned his head and put us in a corner.

401
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,960
Then my previous guess might be right.

402
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,960
King of Zhao and Lin Yan's relationship is not simple at all.

403
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,960
Then King of Zhao

404
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,960
just wants to use us as hostages.

405
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
As hostages?

406
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,960
No way.

407
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,960
I have a small idea.

408
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,960
Someone wants to use us.

409
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
I think the simplest way

410
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,960
is to turn yourself into a useless person.

411
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
Right?

412
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Who do you think will use a bunch of useless people?

413
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
How about this?

414
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,960
How about we just confess?

415
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,960
That we are not the group

416
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
that is engaged to the ancestors.

417
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,960
We are mostly

418
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
the hostages and the bad guys.

419
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
We are not familiar with the ancestors.

420
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
How do you think King of Zhao will use us?

421
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,960
Just say it.

422
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
How long have we been living with the ancestors?

423
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Hey,

424
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
this is working.

425
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
Your brain is working better than your son.

426
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
Shut up.

427
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
The ancestors are so good to us.

428
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,960
You can't just

429
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,960
think of yourself when you are in trouble.

430
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,960
You can't just...

431
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
I...

432
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Right. The ancestors are family.

433
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
Grandmother said

434
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,960
family should take all the responsibility.

435
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
See? We are so smart.

436
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,960
Before I came to find everyone,

437
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
I went to the King of Zhao's mansion.

438
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,960
They said that

439
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
the ancestors were sent out at this time.

440
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
What a coincidence.

441
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,960
It's not normal.

442
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
It's not normal.

443
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
It's not normal.

444
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
It's not normal.

445
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,960
It's not normal.

446
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
It's not normal.

447
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
It's not normal.

448
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,960
Come on.

449
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
Come on.

450
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
Come on.

451
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,960
You can't just

452
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,960
let me see all the people in the mansion.

453
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,960
You are crazy.

454
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
You are crazy.

455
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,960
Who?

456
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
Who?

457
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,240
Why do I feel familiar with this scene?

458
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
Young Master Lin was scaring us.

459
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
But these people...

460
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
Why do they look like they're coming for real?

461
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,240
Oh my god.

462
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,240
It's okay.

463
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,240
I'm afraid that you're the young prince.

464
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
Young prince?

465
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,240
You're holding us, so we're still useful.

466
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,240
If you hurt us now,

467
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,240
we'll be too small.

468
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
What's wrong?

469
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
You're a princess,

470
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,240
but why did you bring her here?

471
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,240
You don't understand.

472
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,240
It's not a big deal.

473
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,240
I know you want to know everything.

474
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
But you're not interested in what we know.

475
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
I'll tell you.

476
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
Don't do that.

477
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
Young Master Lin was scaring us.

478
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
Young Master Lin was scaring us.

479
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,240
Young Master Lin was scaring us.

480
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Young Master Lin was scaring us.

481
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
Young Master Lin was scaring us.

482
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,240
How about this? Let's play a game.

483
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,240
Let's use this soup to turn the wheel.

484
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,240
Whoever knows the cake, will answer the question.

485
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,240
Good answer.

486
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,240
Maybe you guys can pick one.

487
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
If the answer is not good,

488
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,240
then drink this poisonous soup.

489
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
How about it?

490
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
Is it interesting?

491
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,240
I don't know.

492
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,240
I don't know.

493
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,240
Is it interesting?

494
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,240
What is interesting?

495
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,240
You want us to pick one?

496
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,240
You want us to pick one?

497
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,240
You are so unfair.

498
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
I'll play with you.

499
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
No.

500
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,240
You have to follow the rules.

501
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,240
You are so unfair.

502
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,240
Dad!

503
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,240
You are cheating!

504
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Dad!

505
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,240
This is...

506
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,240
This is yours.

507
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,240
No!

508
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,240
He is just a kid.

509
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,240
Hand in hand!

510
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,240
I'll play with you.

511
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,240
Dad!

512
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240
Say it.

513
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
Tell me what you know.

514
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
I'm asking you what I know.

515
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,240
Why do you guys like to make trouble?

516
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,240
You don't ask me what I know.

517
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,240
How can you not know what I want to ask?

518
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,240
I ask...

519
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,240
your life.

520
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,240
I have a secret.

521
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,240
Let me think.

522
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,240
I found a good man.

523
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,240
I encouraged him to meet new life.

524
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,240
He went to the place where he lived.

525
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,240
I sent him there.

526
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
You can say that?

527
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
I'll show you.

528
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,240
Grandpa!

529
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,240
Don't be rude!

530
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
Can I be rude?

531
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,240
What do you think?

532
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Your wife ran away.

533
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,240
You killed her and her husband.

534
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
You said that?

535
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
Are you a man?

536
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
I totally agree with you.

537
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
Why are you so excited?

538
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,240
Besides,

539
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
if my wife ran away,

540
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
I would be a man.

541
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,240
The point is,

542
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
I'm useless.

543
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,240
She found a better man.

544
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,240
What's wrong with that?

545
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
Isn't that a human nature?

546
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
Are you talking about humanity?

547
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
Is that what you said?

548
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,240
Tang Jun!

549
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
What's going on?

550
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,240
What did I do?

551
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,240
What are you talking about?

552
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,240
I'll explain!

553
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,240
Grandpa!

554
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
Isn't this a good chat?

555
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,240
Come out!

556
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,240
Come out!

557
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,240
Come out!

558
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,240
Yang Yang!

559
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,240
Yang Yang!

560
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,240
Say or not,

561
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,240
If you don't say,

562
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,240
she'll die.

563
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,240
No!

564
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Brother!

565
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
I beg you!

566
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,240
Don't do it!

567
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,240
Kill me!

568
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
She's still a child!

569
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,240
Brother!

570
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,240
Yang Yang!

571
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,240
Kill me!

572
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,240
Kill me!

573
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,240
Can you?

574
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,240
Yang Yang!

575
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,240
I know about Grandpa Lin.

576
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,240
Qi!

577
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,240
She cares about me.

578
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,240
But it's not convenient for the elders to talk about the official affairs.

579
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
You can't talk about the official affairs.

580
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,240
You can talk about the personal affairs.

581
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,240
Then you talk about it.

582
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,240
Lin Ye.

583
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,240
His name is Cui Che.

584
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,240
The Cui family was a major criminal in the court.

585
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,240
The whole family was killed.

586
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,240
Lin Ye changed his name and changed his household name.

587
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,240
He survived.

588
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,240
You are covering for criminals.

589
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,240
You also want to talk to me?

590
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,240
You're so calm.

591
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,240
I think you know more about Lin Ye than we do.

592
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,240
Then say something that you don't know.

593
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,240
Lin Ye.

594
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,240
He married me to help the elder princess.

595
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,240
To help the elder princess to cover for her identity better.

596
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
Yang Yang.

597
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,240
Lin Ye is heartless to us.

598
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,240
Do we have to be loyal to him?

599
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,240
Yang Jun.

600
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,240
We are on the same side as you.

601
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,240
Yes.

602
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,240
We are on the same side as you.

603
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,240
We are on the same side.

604
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
That's right.

605
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
I think so too.

606
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,240
You observe from the side.

607
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,240
What does Lin Ye mean recently?

608
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,240
I don't know.

609
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,240
I don't know.

610
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,240
I don't know.

611
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,240
I don't know.

612
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,240
I don't know.

613
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
I don't know.

614
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,240
I don't know.

615
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,240
I don't know.

616
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,240
I don't know.

617
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,240
I don't know.

618
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,240
What's the problem with her recently?

619
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,240
She is always abnormal.

620
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,240
She is a dead man.

621
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,240
She is a big official in Jingzhao.

622
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
How can she be normal?

623
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,240
Yang Jun.

624
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,240
Let us go.

625
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,240
We will help you investigate her.

626
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
We will help you investigate her.

627
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,240
We will investigate her together.

628
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,240
I think so too.

629
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,240
I just didn't say it out loud.

630
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,240
Lin Ye's father, the eldest princess,

631
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
proposed to cancel the marriage.

632
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,240
The Shen family said that they wanted to take revenge on her.

633
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,240
Father asked me to inquire about their family.

634
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240
I also asked.

635
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,240
Qingyang dialect is difficult to understand.

636
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
Son forced to listen to that concept.

637
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,240
The family who married Cui is indeed Shen.

638
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,240
But,

639
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,240
I don't know what kind of family they are.

640
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,240
I don't know what kind of family they are.

641
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,240
I don't know what kind of family they are.

642
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,240
I don't know what kind of family they are.

643
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,240
But,

644
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
Qingyang dialect was removed long ago.

645
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,240
After the accident, the Cui family was cut off.

646
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,240
They are indeed a poor family.

647
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,240
Now, they can't be a Panfu.

648
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,240
They still have a grudge.

649
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,240
I have talked to the Shen family.

650
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,240
Actually,

651
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,240
this family

652
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,240
really has feelings for Anran.

653
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,240
They are not purely Panfu.

654
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,240
If Anran has a grudge against the eldest princess,

655
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
I will not be suspicious.

656
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,240
How about this?

657
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,240
Let them starve first.

658
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
After that,

659
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,240
I will ask them in person.

660
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,240
Father cares about Lin Yan again.

661
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,240
He doesn't let me move towards them.

662
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,240
He is not satisfied with my question.

663
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,240
What should I do?

664
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,240
Lin Yan and we are not on the same page.

665
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,240
You have raised them for more than ten years.

666
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,240
And you are still in love with a dog?

667
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,240
Sometimes I really don't understand.

668
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,240
Am I your son?

669
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,240
Or Lin Yan is your son?

670
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,240
You have grown up.

671
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,240
I can tell you.

672
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,240
If you have the ability of Anran,

673
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,240
I will also look at you.

674
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,240
I will help you analyze.

675
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,240
Since they have already married,

676
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,240
Anran still keeps them in her house.

677
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,240
Why?

678
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,240
This means that

679
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,240
Shen Jiari is Anran's pet.

680
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,240
You don't understand.

681
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,240
I understand.

682
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,240
Your Highness,

683
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,240
Lin Yan has found the wrong place.

684
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,240
Let's go back to the capital together.

685
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
Young Master.

686
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,240
What's up?

687
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,240
You have been gone for two days.

688
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,240
Shen Niazi came to see you.

689
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,240
I heard that they went to Yunshui Garden.

690
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,240
They left in the same car.

691
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,240
They said they went to Su Shui City.

692
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,240
Is the governor of Chengzhou really being attacked?

693
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
They are...

694
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,240
Young Master.

695
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,240
Young Master.

696
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,240
Slow down, Young Master.

697
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,240
Young Master Lin.

698
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,240
Slow down, Young Master.

699
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,240
Where are you going?

700
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,240
His Majesty heard that Young Master Lin is going back to the capital.

701
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
He asked me to come.

702
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,240
This...

703
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
Thank you.

704
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,240
Before he went to Chengzhou,

705
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,240
he...

706
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,240
He was in a bad mood.

707
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,240
He has been busy these days.

708
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,240
He hasn't been able to sleep.

709
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,240
He has been rushing back to the capital.

710
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,240
He can't sleep.

711
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,240
He is in a bad mood?

712
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,240
Didn't Young Master Lin just ride his horse?

713
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,240
He...

714
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,240
He is in a hurry to see the doctor.

715
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,240
He needs to ride his horse faster.

716
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,240
Come.

717
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,240
Go.

718
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,240
Go.

719
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
Come.

720
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
This is good.

721
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,240
This soup is good.

722
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,240
It's good. It's delicious.

723
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,240
This is good too.

724
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,240
Try it.

725
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,240
Come.

726
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,240
Come.

727
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,240
Pour it in.

728
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,240
Come.

729
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,240
I want to drink too.

730
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,240
Don't worry.

731
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,240
Eat as much as you want.

732
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,240
Is it good?

733
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,240
It's delicious.

734
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
Is it good?

735
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,240
It's delicious.

736
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,240
Where did you buy it?

737
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,240
I can't stand it.

738
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240
The taste is good too.

739
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,240
What are you doing?

740
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,240
It's been two days.

741
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
You don't eat or drink.

742
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
Do you want to starve to death?

743
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
Do you have any humanity?

744
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,240
Can't you see that you still have children?

745
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,240
What?

746
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,240
It's a heavy meal.

747
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,240
You can shout so loudly when you're hungry.

748
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,240
You learn dog barking.

749
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,240
I'll reward you.

750
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,240
How is it?

751
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,240
You...

752
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,240
Hurry up.

753
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,240
Hurry up.

754
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,240
Hurry up.

755
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,240
What is this?

756
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,240
What is this this time?

757
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,240
Hurry up.

758
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,240
Hurry up.

759
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,240
Hurry up.

760
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,240
What are you doing?

761
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,240
Let go of me.

762
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,240
I'll kill you.

763
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,240
The boss told me not to touch them.

764
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,240
Don't touch them.

765
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,240
Wake up.

766
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,240
Let's go.

767
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,240
Go.

768
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,240
Be quiet.

769
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,240
I'll starve you to death.

770
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,240
Come on.

771
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,240
Come on.

772
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,240
You're so bad.

773
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,240
Go.

774
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,240
Go.

775
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,240
The distance is all a lie.

776
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,240
Which family can put the key in the waist

777
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,240
and wait for the prisoner to be hurt?

778
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,240
Why is there a clean table here?

779
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,240
Clean table?

780
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,240
The old prison was too unobtrusive.

781
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,240
It didn't have a water-proofing system.

782
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,240
The prison should not be so unobtrusive.

783
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,240
It's so casual.

784
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,240
Did the private room change, Dad?

785
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,240
It's not a private room.

786
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
It's a private room.

787
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
It's a private room.

788
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,240
It's a private room.

789
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,240
It's a private room.

790
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,240
Did the private room change, Dad?

791
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,240
Go.

792
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,240
When Prince Zhao taught swordsmanship,

793
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
did you forget the rules?

794
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,240
All the strong are the most powerful.

795
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,240
You're all my enemies.

796
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,240
You shouldn't stand when you see me.

797
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,240
How dare you fight me?

798
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,240
It's the side of the Prince's dance.

799
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,240
They asked me to change.

800
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,240
Where is Shen Family now?

801
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,240
I don't know.

802
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,240
Banren, listen to me.

803
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,240
The Shen Family has retired from you.

804
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,240
If you stay in your mansion

805
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,240
and someone finds out,

806
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,240
how will you deal with it?

807
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,240
Leave this matter to me.

808
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,240
I will handle it properly.

809
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,240
Where is the Shen Family now?

810
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,240
Why are you so stubborn?

811
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,240
I did all this for your own good.

812
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,240
Please let them go.

813
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,240
Stop.

814
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,240
Banren,

815
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,240
since you've made up your mind,

816
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,240
I won't stop you.

817
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,240
You,

818
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,240
take her away.

819
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,240
Yes.

820
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,240
Father sent Lin Ye again.

821
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,240
Didn't he say he would keep the Shen Family?

822
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,240
Lin Ye is going to take her away now.

823
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,240
You,

824
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,240
why are you still so stubborn?

825
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,240
Could it be that

826
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,240
father has another plan?

827
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,240
Don't worry.

828
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,240
This man will delay the time.

829
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,240
You,

830
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,240
take the Shen Family out now

831
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,240
and transfer to another place.

832
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,240
Yes.

833
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,240
I'm going.

834
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,240
It's the first time

835
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,240
that Mr. Cui has never tamed you.

836
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,240
He was your eldest son

837
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,240
for less than half a year

838
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,240
when you first came to the manor.

839
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,240
You were so serious

840
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,240
that you forgot about

841
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,240
your lion's head.

842
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,240
What are you talking about?

843
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,240
I'm just thinking if we've seen the wrong Mr. Cui.

844
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,240
Maybe Mr. Cui is still young, but he's determined.

845
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:54,240
You've already thought of a way to imitate him and get back to the lower realm.

846
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:00,240
You don't think you can hold me back from the old days by calculating with me?

847
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,240
Lead the way.

848
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,240
What are you doing in a hurry?

849
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,240
Old Jun, the Shen family has run away.

850
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
What?

851
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,240
The Shen family has run away.

852
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,240
I'm telling you, do you see this window?

853
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,240
It's very casual.

854
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,240
And these are the structures of the Sun family.

855
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,240
I can open it as long as I find one of the key points.

856
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,240
Really?

857
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,240
Dad, when do you have this ability?

858
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,240
Who doesn't know how to build a house in our countryside?

859
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,240
Your dad's good tradition is really not lost.

860
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,240
OK, then you go up.

861
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,240
Go up and check it.

862
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,240
I go.

863
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,240
Be careful, go.

864
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,240
Go.

865
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,240
Go.

866
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,240
Go.

867
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,240
I'm not too sure, but I'm still getting closer.

868
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,240
I want to be more persistent.

869
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,240
I don't say no.
