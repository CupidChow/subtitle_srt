I'm going to make a

I'm going to make a

74
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,040
I'm going to make a

75
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,040
I'm going to make a

76
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,040
I'm going to make a

77
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,040
I'm going to make a

78
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,040
I'm going to make a

79
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
I'm going to make a

80
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
I'm going to make a

81
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
I'm going to make a

82
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
I'm going to make a

83
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
I'm going to make a

84
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
I'm going to make a

85
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,040
I'm going to make a

86
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
I'm going to make a

87
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,040
I'm going to make a

88
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
I'm going to make a

89
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,040
I'm going to make a

90
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,040
I'm going to make a

91
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm going to

92
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,000
You can do that

93
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,640
What's up

94
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,600
Hurug

95
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,640
Rather than

96
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,040
Always

97
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,800
It's a different story

98
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,040
I had two

99
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,040
Really

100
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,460
So Miss

101
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,800
You're in big trouble

102
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,920
Really

103
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,040
You tried so many times

104
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,040
My little sister

105
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,040
Three

106
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,040
What are these

107
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,780
Casey

108
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,820
Fox

109
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,040
I've never seen such a good hair salon in my life

110
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,040
Are you crazy?

111
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,040
I'll show you the hair salon in the morning

112
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
You've never seen this

113
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,040
I'm not going

114
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,040
Come here, come here, look

115
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
I'm telling you, it's very beautiful

116
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,040
You've never seen it before

117
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,040
Come here, look, look

118
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040
Right here

119
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
So clean

120
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,040
The fingers are still fragrant

121
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
And look at the bottom of the toilet

122
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,040
It's covered with a layer of fine ink

123
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
There are too many mistakes

124
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,040
We have to summarize

125
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
All mistakes

126
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,040
Yeah

127
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
Feel it, feel it

128
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
One piece, one piece

129
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
You're drawing it now, okay?

130
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,040
I can guarantee that I won't call it a horse sitting here

131
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,040
Even a good toilet doesn't have me

132
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,040
Look at this big yard

133
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040
How long does it take to draw?

134
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,040
It's really our young master

135
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,040
Of course

136
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,040
Look, there's still water

137
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,040
This is much better than our country house

138
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,040
That's right

139
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,040
You use 100 fires to get a fire

140
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
We've put three rounds of acid in here

141
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,040
My legs are sore

142
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,040
You lack exercise

143
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,040
And the root of the chase

144
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,040
Let's give them a romantic love

145
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
This, this, this

146
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,040
I'm almost awake

147
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
Why are you pushing me?

148
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Be quiet

149
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Look

150
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,040
I just want them to see

151
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,040
I just want them to see

152
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,040
It hurts a little

153
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,040
The script you wrote for that short video

154
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,040
It's about our family going back to the ancient times

155
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
To cook for the old man, right?

156
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,040
Yeah

157
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,040
What's the name of the one you made?

158
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,040
Spring water lamb

159
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,040
Spring water lamb

160
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,040
Isn't Aunt's script a pass?

161
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,040
Ah Ji

162
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
Think about it again

163
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,040
What else did you write in that script?

164
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,040
Aunt wrote in the script

165
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,040
Our family accidentally went through the ancient times

166
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,040
Then met the cruel and ruthless great king of the devil

167
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,040
At the end of the night

168
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,040
With a bowl of perfect spring water lamb

169
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,040
And then it went back to the present

170
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
Think about it

171
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
The current plot

172
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,040
It seems to be really different from my script

173
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,040
Isn't that simple?

174
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
Let's follow Ah Ji's script

175
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
And continue acting

176
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
The full moon night

177
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,040
Make a bowl of spring water lamb for the ancestors

178
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,040
We can go back

179
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,040
But the ancestors are now

180
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,040
More and more suspicious of us

181
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,040
Thank you

182
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
The young master is here

183
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
Get up

184
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Young master

185
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
Young master

186
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,040
You see, we've been here for a long time

187
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,040
The cook in the house is slow

188
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,040
The cook in the house is slow

189
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,040
The main dish hasn't been served yet

190
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
It's already on the table

191
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
It's like this

192
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
Our husband

193
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Never likes to waste his mind on food

194
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
Oh, the table

195
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,040
It's easy to talk

196
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
Youcheng

197
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
This

198
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
Hand

199
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
Yes yes yes

200
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,040
Actually, we were the ones who disturbed the young master

201
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
Actually, it's all right

202
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,040
Follow the chief

203
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
Follow the chief

204
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,040
The uncle is really good

205
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
For example

206
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Today I didn't ask uncle and aunt for help

207
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
As a regular elder

208
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,040
I'm afraid I've been invited to ask

209
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,040
No no

210
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Please

211
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
I'm not good at etiquette

212
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Now I ask uncle and aunt for help

213
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
No no no

214
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,040
Don't don't

215
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
Young master don't

216
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,040
Marinate a meat

217
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
How can I be like a thief

218
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
Don't don't

219
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
Come again

220
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,040
Young master

221
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,040
No, this is not good

222
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
Uncle and aunt are unreasonable

223
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
Young master

224
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Young master

225
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
Good evening

226
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,040
I'll leave if there's nothing

227
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
You recognize me

228
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,040
The TV series really doesn't stand me up

229
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,040
I really believe that wearing a mask is a disguise

230
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Young master is graceful

231
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,040
I can recognize it

232
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
You are sneaky at night

233
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
What do you want to do

234
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,040
What do you mean by this

235
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
You look

236
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,040
We will not talk about these etiquettes in the future

237
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Let's eat

238
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,040
Eat

239
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Young master sit

240
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Sit sit

241
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
Young master sit

242
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,040
Come

243
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
Young master don't get used to it

244
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,040
We are from the countryside

245
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
It's not a big deal to eat

246
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
Yes yes yes

247
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
Yes

248
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,040
After the engagement with the Cui family

249
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,040
It seems that they have never met

250
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
It's too late again

251
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
I didn't say anything about the Cui family

252
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,040
Yes

253
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,040
But I heard the ancestors' voice

254
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,040
It must be that I came to Yongan when I was a kid

255
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,040
To be able to practice

256
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,040
Didn't the Cui family come to the capital later?

257
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,040
Of course less people come to meet the old people

258
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,040
Let the Shen Niazi know

259
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,040
After the Cui family entered the capital

260
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,040
What happened

261
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
And even if you take you back

262
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,040
They may not see you

263
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,040
They don't even see us

264
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,040
They have been with us for more than a decade

265
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
Our mud is getting washed

266
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
Not at all like their

267
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
So

268
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,040
I think the people over there have given up on you

269
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,040
What's the use of keeping you

270
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,040
You are too harsh

271
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,040
Pick you

272
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
Arrange to this place

273
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
There should be a reason

274
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,040
I also want to know why it is a mother and child

275
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,040
you

276
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,040
Master, have you forgotten

277
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
It's that day

278
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
The young boy entered the capital

279
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
The pioneer trip

280
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
Coincidentally, we met and sold records

281
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
We recognized it

282
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
Yes

283
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Although we haven't seen it for many years

284
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
But after all, it's my relatives

285
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,040
I see

286
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Isn't this the future boy?

287
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,040
I recognize it too. I'm so excited.

288
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,040
It's Tan'nan.

289
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,040
I'm going to the stage.

290
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,040
Enjoy yourselves.

291
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
Goodbye, young master.

292
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,040
Goodbye, young master.

293
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Dad, why don't you stand up?

294
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,040
My legs are numb. I can't move.

295
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
Thank you for your hard work.

296
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,040
I've been up all morning pretending I've never seen the world.

297
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,040
I've been wandering around.

298
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,040
In fact, I'm exploring the terrain of the Cloud Water Garden.

299
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
I'm working as a foreman.

300
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,040
Let's take the ancestors.

301
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,040
We probably can't get it back.

302
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,040
Because this legend is irreversible.

303
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,040
When we can't get it back, we can't take the ancestors.

304
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,040
If we can't take the ancestors, the ancestors can't find us.

305
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,040
Right?

306
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,040
No, I mean, it's not our fault.

307
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,040
What do you say?

308
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,040
The people behind the Shen Family have given up on them.

309
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,040
But they still take pictures of them here.

310
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,040
That means...

311
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
He can't make it.

312
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,040
Lord, why don't you just test the Shen Family's thinking?

313
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,040
Isn't the Shen Family just a water drop?

314
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,040
It's okay to scare them first.

315
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
It's not appropriate to really think.

316
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,040
This is not a place.

317
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
This is not a place.

318
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,040
He has to be careful with everything he does.

319
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
It's easy to test.

320
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,040
It's hard to finish.

321
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
I'm going to be a good friend.

322
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,040
I'm going to be a good friend.

323
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,040
I'm going to be a good friend.

324
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
I'm going to be a good friend.

325
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
I'm going to be a good friend.

326
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,040
I'm going to be a good friend.

327
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,040
I'm going to be a good friend.

328
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
I'm going to be a good friend.

329
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
I'm going to be a good friend.

330
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
I'm going to be a good friend.

331
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
I'm going to be a good friend.

332
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
I'm going to be a good friend.

333
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
I'm going to be a good friend.

334
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
I'm going to be a good friend.

335
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,040
What are you doing?

336
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,040
There's nothing there.

337
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,040
What are you going to do� thereafter?

338
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
That's what you are.

339
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,040
People cannot live together.

340
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,040
It is what you are saying.

341
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,040
Look at your head.

342
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Look at your head.

343
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,040
A good friend,

344
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,040
All of those had to be water drops.

345
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,040
Wbreatjähr?

346
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,040
Who wants to be after my friend?

347
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,040
It is not necessary to like one or the other.

348
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,040
Did I bring water to you?

349
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,040
Did you bring water?

350
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,320
The kitchen was changed

351
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,840
Your dad and I went to this neighborhood in the morning

352
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,480
There are people watching this place

353
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,480
It's not easy to get in

354
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,840
What should I do?

355
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,200
I don't want to hurt people

356
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,520
But I have to protect

357
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,760
Our cold judgment

358
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
Brother

359
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,240
Brother

360
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,280
I can't laugh at it

364
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
I can't do it.

00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
I can't do it.

366
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
I can't do it.

367
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Mom, they're playing tricks again.

368
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,200
They're cheating on you.

369
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,200
The same Shen Shaoguang who went to ask for a raise.

370
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:26,200
You see, we're looking for you again.

371
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
It's me again, mom.

372
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Ah, this really has to be you.

373
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,200
You're the smartest and the most flexible in our family.

374
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Look at your dad and your brother.

375
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Which one can count on me?

376
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,700
I...

377
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,700
What's up?

378
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
A Ji.

379
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,700
Okay.

380
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,700
You can go.

381
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,700
Yes.

382
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,700
Go.

383
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,700
Oh, no.

384
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,700
Mr.

385
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,200
I just thought of it.

386
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,700
The Shen family recognized you through your appearance.

387
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,200
That means there will be people in the court in the future.

388
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,200
You finally thought of it after a long time.

389
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,700
I'll see you in the end.

390
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,200
I found it in the document.

391
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
This is the number used by the Fire Tribe.

392
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,700
The corresponding number is

393
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,200
12346789.

394
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
It's actually a number.

395
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,700
This is a mark.

396
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,700
The corresponding mark can be opened when the number is found.

397
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,700
Nine numbers, eight blank pages.

398
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,700
A total of ten.

399
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,700
What are you doing?

400
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,700
You have the nerve to...

401
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,200
I'm looking for you, young master.

402
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,200
Ye Xiang was found.

403
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Young master.

404
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,700
What are you doing?

405
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,700
I can save you.

406
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,700
But remember what you owe me this time.

407
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,200
I'm sorry, everyone.

408
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,200
I was outside at night tonight.

409
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,700
I violated the filial piety.

410
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
I'm sorry.

411
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
My wife.

412
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,200
I think that night watchman was a man.

413
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,700
It's so dark.

414
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,200
I'm afraid you misread it.

415
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,700
That's me.

416
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,700
I'm Shao Ying's cousin.

417
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,200
I'm hungry tonight.

418
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
The time is up.

419
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,700
Black and white, round and roll.

420
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,700
Is it a bear?

421
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,200
It's our favorite Aolian.

422
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,700
Twist and twist, sweet and sour.

423
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,700
Sweet and sour, not greasy.

424
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,700
Let's soak it.

425
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,700
Delicious and fun Aolian.

426
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,700
Aolian and Aolian, wonderful and beautiful.

427
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,700
One, two, three, four, five.

428
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:16,700
Two, two, three, four, five.

429
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,700
One, two, three, four, five.

430
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,700
No one here.

431
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,700
I'm lucky.

432
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,700
Watchman is not good at work.

433
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,700
Someone is coming.

434
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,700
The portrait of the ancestor was in here.

435
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,700
No wonder it's so scary.

436
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,700
It's an ancient machine.

437
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,700
There's a machine in the back.

438
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
You covered for me just now.

439
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,700
But you're afraid of your identity being exposed.

440
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,700
You're a young man.

441
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,700
You're out in the middle of the night.

442
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,700
You're even more suspicious.

443
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,700
But we really take you as a family.

444
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,700
We promised to take you back.

445
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,700
Do you know how hard it is?

446
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Of course it's hard.

447
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,700
You scoundrels.

448
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,700
I've been completely abandoned by the people behind me.

449
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,700
You can't take me back at all.

450
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,700
What scoundrel?

451
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,700
You think we're scoundrels sent to you by others?

452
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,700
Aren't we?

453
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,700
Are you crazy?

454
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,700
Let those soldiers come back and see what we are.

455
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,700
The only way I can settle the score with my family is to have a place to live.

456
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,700
Then find a way to go back to the hometown.

457
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,700
You said you wanted to go back with us yesterday.

458
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,700
We were thinking about it.

459
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,700
It's really hard to take you there.

460
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,700
But you suspect we're scoundrels.

461
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,700
Which scoundrel would agree to take you back to the old dynasty?

462
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,700
You say.

463
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,700
Say.

464
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,700
Dad.

465
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,700
The lock is so easily opened.

466
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,700
I'm going to go back to the old dynasty.

467
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,700
I'm going to go back to the old dynasty.

468
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,700
I'm going to go back to the old dynasty.

469
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,700
I'm going to go back to the old dynasty.

470
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,700
I'm going to go back to the old dynasty.

471
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,700
I'm going to go back to the old dynasty.

472
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,700
I'm going to go back to the old dynasty.

473
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,700
I'm going to go back to the old dynasty.

474
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,700
I'm going to go back to the old dynasty.

475
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,700
I'm going to go back to the old dynasty.

476
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,700
I'm going to go back to the old dynasty.

477
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,700
I'm going to go back to the old dynasty.

478
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,700
I'm going to go back to the old dynasty.

479
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,700
I'm going to go back to the old dynasty.

480
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,700
Oh, he got back.

481
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,700
He's on that constraints lock.

482
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,700
He follows us to the Dun Ellis.

483
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,700
We have to believe.

484
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,700
This station in the past generations.

485
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,860
It's theadiol Chang Ya, LI K Galau,

486
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,860
Then I am sure I will go back home through this.

487
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,700
Young Master.

488
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,700
What are you doing?

489
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,700
You Chao.

490
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,700
Wake up.

491
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,700
You Chao.

492
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,700
Why did you do that?

493
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,700
That day, you saw the distance.

494
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,700
You took care of the Shen Family.

495
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,700
You buried everything here.

496
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,700
You told me that.

497
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,700
I mean, you buried this thing.

498
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,700
Not this family.

499
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,700
You should find a place to watch them.

500
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,700
Watch?

501
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,700
I think it's a soft message.

502
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,700
Lin Yan, do you know what we are doing tonight?

503
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,700
We made you a big table of delicious food.

504
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,700
We want to thank you.

505
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,700
For this meal, I went to the kitchen to marinate the meat last night.

506
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,700
I want to give you a surprise.

507
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,700
You are good.

508
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,700
You are so kind.

509
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,700
There is a number.

510
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,700
We used to do business and open a restaurant.

511
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,700
We don't know much.

512
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,700
But the numbers are the most familiar.

513
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,700
Look.

514
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,700
It's all the meaning of making money.

515
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,700
It's so easy for businessmen.

516
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,700
Lin Yan.

517
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,700
Mr.

518
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,700
You let him...

519
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,700
I can't run away.

520
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,700
If it wasn't for the cooperation of many parties,

521
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,700
the old case would not have been so easy.

522
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,700
The Cui family was destroyed.

523
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,700
How can we save the Shen family,

524
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,700
who had a marriage with the Cui family?

525
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,700
Do you mean

526
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,700
they just took the initiative?

527
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,700
It's a good thing.

528
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,700
There are other people who have a marriage with the husband.

529
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,700
Or

530
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,700
they are the ones who have a marriage with me.

531
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,700
But they didn't ask for a divorce.

532
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,700
Who did they choose?

533
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,700
Then they might be the secret of others.

534
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,700
No wonder.

535
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,700
This woman knows the number of the fire.

536
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,700
I don't know.

537
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,700
They might have been in the Western Regions.

538
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,700
What should we do next?

539
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,700
Should we catch them back

540
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,700
and influence them?

541
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,700
The lock on the Langhuan Pavilion is confirmed.

542
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,700
When we came through,

543
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,700
the Shen family was in the back door.

544
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,700
I hope you don't suspect us anymore.

545
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,700
I'm so sorry.

546
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,700
Then

547
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,700
let's forget about it.

548
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,700
Forget it.

549
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,700
Forget it.

550
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,700
Come on, young master.

551
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,700
Sit down.

552
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,700
Sit down.

553
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,700
It's not appropriate.

554
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,700
Sit down.

555
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,700
Come on.

556
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,700
Sit down, young master.

557
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,700
Eat, Yangyang.

558
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,700
Come on.

559
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,700
Sit down.

560
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,700
Sit down.

561
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,700
Sit down.

562
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,700
Come on.

563
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,700
I'm so hungry.

564
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,700
Tea.

565
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,700
Eat.

566
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,700
This is delicious.

567
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,700
Eat.

568
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,700
Delicious.

569
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,700
Eat more, young master.

570
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,700
It's good for your brain.

571
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,700
Grandma.

572
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,700
I didn't do my homework when I was in the past.

573
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,700
Do you think I can go back

574
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,700
without doing my homework?

575
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,700
You...

576
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,700
You don't want to do your homework,

577
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,700
do you?

578
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,700
Liu Chang.

579
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,700
Liu Chang.

580
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,700
The stars are in the sky.

581
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,700
The sun is in the sky.

582
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,700
The wolf is in the sky.

583
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,700
The wolf is in the sky.

584
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,700
The wolf is in the sky.

585
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,700
This is my grandpa's phone.

586
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,700
By the way,

587
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,700
Guangcai.

588
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,700
When you were crossing the moon that day,

589
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,700
I remember you were wearing a man's slippers.

590
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,700
You didn't cut your nails.

591
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,700
But when you were trying to cross the moon that day,

592
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,700
you didn't wear a man's slippers.

593
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,700
You still didn't cut your nails.

594
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,700
Come on.

595
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Does this have anything to do with him?

596
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,700
Your man's slippers are your toes.

597
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,700
Do you have that much energy?

598
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,700
And you still cross the moon?

599
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,700
Let me think about it.

600
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,700
I...

601
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,700
I'll find out the reason from my own body.

602
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,700
If you're touched,

603
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,700
don't do anything bad next time.

604
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,700
Sorry.

605
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,700
Where did you go tonight?

606
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,700
There are things

607
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,700
that you should know less about.

608
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,700
I understand.

609
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,700
I understand.

610
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,700
I understand.

611
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,700
Only Qingyang people

612
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,700
know how to make tofu.

613
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,700
Not necessarily.

614
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,700
The Internet people know it too.

615
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,700
He found someone selling casings

616
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,700
on March 26.

617
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,700
The handkerchief has reached the Ministry of War.

618
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,700
I...

619
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,700
He found someone

620
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,700
operating the Ministry of War.

621
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,700
That's why he sent me and my mother

622
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,700
to the old Qingyang family in May.

623
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,700
He predicted that

624
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,700
something would happen if he investigated it.

625
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,700
He thought it could protect his family.

626
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,700
Who knew that he would be the one

627
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,700
who would be responsible for everything?

628
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,700
Father

629
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,700
who died after the fight

630
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,700
anked the Powder Government

631
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,700
to negotiate battle for boxing.

632
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,700
Probably

633
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,700
for those who wounded themselves

634
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,140
This is useless even if it's a lie.

635
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,500
If you want to commit a crime, you must find more evidence.

636
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,000
Tower stone

637
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,200
I'm really wrong about today

638
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,360
Keep your走吧

639
00:27:49,340 --> 00:28:06,660
Before getting acquainted with her that perfect

640
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,500
You'reenne Here's the man

641
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,500
I'm sorry.

642
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,500
I've been angry

643
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,500
since you did this.

644
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
What about you?

645
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,500
What about you?

646
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
Do you trust Shen Family?

647
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,500
I don't think he's back.

648
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,500
What's going on?

649
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,500
Are we back?

650
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,500
I don't know.

651
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,500
Qi,

652
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
what are you doing?

653
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
What are you doing?

654
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,500
You bitch!

655
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,500
Don't be afraid.

656
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Don't be afraid, Yang Yang.

657
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,500
Sleep.

658
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Lady Shen,

659
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
please.

660
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,500
What?

661
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,500
Where's the letter you sent to An Ran?

662
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,500
Father ordered that

663
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,500
An Ran wouldn't obey.

664
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,500
I think the letter has arrived.

665
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,500
Your Highness,

666
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,500
Your Highness,

667
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,500
Prince Zhao

668
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,500
wrote this from Su Shui City.

669
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,500
Didn't he say

670
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,500
that after you entered the capital,

671
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,500
the saint would read it

672
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,500
and the letter should be reduced

673
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,500
to a small amount?

674
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,500
I'm afraid

675
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,500
there's something important.

676
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,500
Prince Zhao

677
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,500
asked me to approach

678
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,500
the Princess of Fu Hui

679
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,500
and find out what happened in the court.

680
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,500
Fu Hui?

681
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,500
I heard about it.

682
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,500
Princess Fu Hui?

683
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,500
The one

684
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,500
who was in a coma

685
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,500
for more than ten years

686
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,500
and had a hobby...

687
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,500
Last night,

688
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,500
your family

689
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,500
sneaked into my room

690
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,500
to kill someone.

691
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
No.

692
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
It's not like that.

693
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Young Master, you're mistaken.

694
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,500
Misunderstanding?

695
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,500
We sneaked into

696
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,500
Young Master's room...

697
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
to pray for Young Master.

698
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,500
Pray?

699
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,500
My grandfather told us

700
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,500
that a door

701
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,500
can be used to wash the incense,

702
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,500
make a grand offering,

703
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,500
and sprinkle flowers

704
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,500
to people who are

705
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,500
very kind to them.

706
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,500
After three prayers,

707
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,500
we can pray for them.

708
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,500
We're living in Young Master's house

709
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,500
and we're so sorry

710
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,500
that we couldn't go.

711
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
So we held this court meeting.

712
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,500
Please bless Young Master

713
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,500
with a long life

714
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
and a long life.

715
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,500
Actually,

716
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,500
you're not

717
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
the one who had a marriage contract,

718
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,500
right?

719
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,500
If one day

720
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,500
we put poison in our food...

721
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,500
You're right.

722
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,500
They're stupid.

723
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,500
They wouldn't choose

724
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,500
to be our spies.

725
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,500
Besides,

726
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
I'm the only one who hurt them.

727
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,500
They haven't

728
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,500
let me down at all.

729
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,500
Then...

730
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,500
Do I have to keep an eye on them?

731
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
No.

732
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,500
Their rice tofu

733
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,500
is very good.

734
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,500
You can use the kitchen

735
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,500
as they want.

736
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,500
You can go too.

737
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,500
Wow, it smells so good.

738
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,500
The little lamb soup

739
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
with fat and lean meat

740
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,500
is stewed over low heat

741
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
for an hour.

742
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,500
It's soft and fragrant.

743
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,500
It's definitely

744
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,500
a perfect

745
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
boiled lamb.

746
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,500
It's a perfect boiled lamb.

747
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,500
I'm sorry

748
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,500
for not helping you.

749
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,500
I wanted to ask for

750
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,500
a favor.

751
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,500
But you

752
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,500
wanted to turn me down

753
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,500
and leave me alone.

754
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,500
We're not worthy of each other.

755
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500
We'll leave together.

756
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,500
Meng...

757
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
I...

758
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,500
I didn't mean it.

759
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,500
You...

760
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,500
Don't cry.

761
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,500
It seems that

762
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,500
the scenes in the play

763
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,500
are the same

764
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
in ancient times.

765
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
If Young Master

766
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,500
wants me to leave,

767
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,500
I'll definitely

768
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
leave.

769
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,500
I'll definitely

770
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
leave with my family.

771
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,500
I just want you to say something.

772
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,500
I didn't mean it.

773
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,500
It's just that

774
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,500
I don't remember

775
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,500
how you and the Shen Family are.

776
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,500
There are many things

777
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,500
I want to confirm with you.

778
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,500
I understand.

779
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,500
Young Master has been through hardships

780
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,500
and can't trust others.

781
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,500
It doesn't matter.

782
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,500
If you have any questions,

783
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,500
just ask me.

784
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,500
I'll see you in person.

785
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,500
Young Master will definitely

786
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,500
know that we're not human.

787
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,500
Meng Long is you,

788
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
Qing Xi is you,

789
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,500
Wu Li is sighing,

790
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
the moon is shining on you,

791
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,500
Yu Yan is playing with the embroidered cloth.

792
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,500
Wang Mo is singing.

793
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,500
Wu Li is cold in front of the eyes,

794
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,500
but he is cold in front of the eyes.

795
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,500
Lian Bing is feeling cold,

796
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,500
he is breaking my heart.

797
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,500
You are laughing.

798
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,500
The rain is falling,

799
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,500
the wind is swaying,

800
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,500
the clouds are in a whirlwind.

801
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,500
Listen,

802
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,500
if you want to understand each other,

803
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,500
be sincere or just recall.

804
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,500
Meng Long is you,

805
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,500
Qing Xi is you,

806
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,500
Wu Li is sighing,

807
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,500
the moon is shining on you,

808
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,500
Yu Yan is playing with the embroidered cloth.

809
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:10,500
Can you walk forward and look at each other?

810
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,500
Wu Li is cold in front of the eyes,

811
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,500
but he is cold in front of the eyes.

812
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,500
Lian Bing is feeling cold,

813
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,500
he is breaking my heart.

814
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,500
You are laughing.

815
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,500
You are the logic.

816
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,500
I need to put you in my life.

817
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,500
I can't help but love you.

818
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,500
I can't help but love you.

819
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,500
How can I give up?

820
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,500
When I run to you,

821
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,500
you are heartbroken.

822
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
I am addicted to you.

823
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
I am still him.

824
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,500
My heart is moving.

825
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,500
The wind blows the closest meaning.

826
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500
The hidden feelings that are too humble to be shown.
