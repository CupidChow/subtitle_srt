1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,020
Would I really want to try at this point?

2
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,160
Episode 14

3
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,020
So many talents.

4
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,020
This young master must like this young lady very much.

5
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,020
That's right.

6
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,020
Congratulations, young master!

7
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,020
Congratulations, young master!

8
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,020
Congratulations, young master!

9
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,020
It's quite impressive.

10
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,020
It's really impressive.

11
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,020
Congratulations, young master!

12
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,020
Congratulations!

13
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,020
Congratulations, young master!

14
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,020
Congratulations, young master!

15
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,020
Congratulations, young master!

16
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,020
Congratulations, young master!

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,020
Congratulations, young master!

18
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,020
Congratulations, young master!

19
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,020
Wait, young master.

20
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,020
If you want to marry my sister, you have to go through this first.

21
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,020
Our master is a poet, a poet, a poet.

22
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,020
He's very good at everything.

23
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,020
Please come out.

24
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,020
You go, go.

25
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,020
Put the horse here.

26
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,020
Ask.

27
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,020
There are three hundred and fifty-five and ninety-four animals

28
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,020
in the same cage.

29
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,020
May I ask,

30
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,020
how many animals are there in the same cage?

31
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,020
No, how can there be a cage and a tree?

32
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,020
You're making fun of us.

33
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,020
You're making fun of us, aren't you?

34
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,020
We are businessmen.

35
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,020
If you want to enter our house, you have to go through the tree.

36
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,020
Right?

37
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,020
Twenty-three chickens, ten, twelve animals.

38
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,020
The cat is a little more clever than its grandson.

39
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,020
It's not a child.

40
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,020
Is that right?

41
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,020
Is that right?

42
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,020
Is that right?

43
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,020
That's right!

44
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,020
Come on!

45
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,020
What is the shape of the candle flame

46
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,020
that forms a candle on the wall on the other side

47
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,020
after it passes through a small hole?

48
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,020
The shape of the candle flame is like a mirror.

49
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,020
Really?

50
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,020
I don't know.

51
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,020
Master Zhao, you're so good!

52
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,020
You're the best!

53
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,020
No, no, no.

54
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,020
They're facing each other.

55
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,020
They don't look back, don't look at the mirror.

56
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,020
Can they see each other?

57
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,020
Yes, because they face each other.

58
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,020
Face each other.

59
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Face each other.

60
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,020
Face each other.

61
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,020
Face each other.

62
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,020
Face each other.

63
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,020
Master Zhao is so good at everything.

64
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,020
Come on!

65
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,020
I ate hot pot at the crossroads.

66
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,020
I accidentally burnt my stomach.

67
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,020
I was going to throw it away,

68
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,020
but why didn't I?

69
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,020
I'm afraid this answer is going to offend Xiong Chang.

70
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,020
Because you can't do it yourself.

71
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,020
You can't do it yourself.

72
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,020
You can't do it yourself.

73
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,020
You can't do it yourself.

74
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,020
Shen Changdong, did he tell you to die?

75
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,020
Let's go.

76
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,020
Again.

77
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,020
The bride wants you to marry a what?

78
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,020
May I ask what this what is?

79
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,020
Marry him.

80
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,020
Marry him.

81
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,020
I'm afraid you can't do it yourself.

82
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,020
I don't believe it.

83
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,020
Again.

84
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,020
You can't do it yourself.

85
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,020
How is it?

86
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,020
Look.

87
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,020
Is it right?

88
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,020
Brother.

89
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,020
Look.

90
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,020
Brother.

91
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,020
Those questions are all out.

92
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,020
Now, father forced him to recite the eight hundred miles of north and south slope.

93
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,020
You can't be soft-hearted.

94
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,020
Let them read for a while.

95
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,020
We can't be very easy to bully.

96
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,020
No, no.

97
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,020
I want to hear him recite the eight hundred miles of north and south slope.

98
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,020
I know you want to.

99
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,020
But I don't want to.

100
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,020
I want to hear you read it.

101
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,020
I want to hear you read it.

102
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,020
I want to hear you read it.

103
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,020
I want to hear you read it.

104
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,020
I want to hear you read it.

105
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,020
I know you want to.

106
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,020
But you have to be steady.

107
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,020
Sit down.

108
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,020
Wait a while.

109
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,020
Aunt.

110
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,020
Uncle Guo is very good at reading.

111
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,020
He knew you would want to see his jokes.

112
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,020
So he asked me to secretly bring you a letter.

113
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,020
This must be the makeup artist written by Shao Ying.

114
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,020
They all write some fancy words to urge the bride to go out.

115
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,020
You can't be fooled.

116
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,020
It's just a poem.

117
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,020
I won't be fooled.

118
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,020
What is this?

119
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,020
A gas mask.

120
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,020
A gas mask?

121
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,020
This is not a gift from the shop.

122
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,020
It's a gift from the shop.

123
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,020
This is called a fake one.

124
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,020
Greetings, Your Highness.

125
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,020
This way, please.

126
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,020
Come, come, come.

127
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,020
Your Highness, please sit here.

128
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,020
Your Highness, please sit.

129
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,020
Come, come, come.

130
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,020
You two.

131
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,020
Come, come, come.

132
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,020
Please sit.

133
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,020
What's wrong, Cao Shao?

134
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,020
I've never seen this wedding poem.

135
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,020
And it has a demand on the tone.

136
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,020
How about I read it?

137
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,020
You two listen to it.

138
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,020
Okay.

139
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,020
You, you, you.

140
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,020
Dear guests,

141
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,020
dear friends,

142
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,020
everyone...

143
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,020
You're good.

144
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,020
Professional.

145
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,020
That's great.

146
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,020
You're not like the one who just trained last night.

147
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,020
That's right.

148
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,020
You're like a host who's been doing this for more than ten years.

149
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,020
Professional.

150
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,020
Host?

151
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,020
This meeting came from the temple.

152
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,020
No, no.

153
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,020
Host and abbot should be related.

154
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,020
No, no.

155
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,020
But I'm not of the same rank.

156
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,020
How dare I fight?

157
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,020
No, no.

158
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,020
Cao Shao, listen to me.

159
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,020
Listen to me.

160
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,020
This has nothing to do with the meeting.

161
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,020
Don't worry.

162
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,020
I can give you a little advice.

163
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,020
Please.

164
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,020
For this wedding,

165
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,020
can we laugh a little?

166
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,020
Look.

167
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:37,560
Like a

168
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,020
Dear guests,

169
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,020
dear friends,

170
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,020
I've found the feeling.

171
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,020
You've found the feeling.

172
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,020
Let's practice more.

173
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,020
Let's practice more.

174
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,020
This is good.

175
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,020
Come, sit.

176
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,020
Wenqiang,

177
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,020
do you think I should do this

178
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,020
or this?

179
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,020
What? Are you nervous?

180
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,020
I'm not nervous.

181
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,020
Just sit comfortably.

182
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,020
You think I'm like this?

183
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,020
Isn't this pretty good?

184
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,020
I'll find another one.

185
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,020
I'll find another one.

186
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,020
Wenqiang,

187
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,020
it's the royal tutor.

188
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,020
Yes.

189
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,020
How can you let him sit there?

190
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,020
Yes, the royal tutor.

191
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,020
Royal tutor.

192
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,020
I'm so embarrassed.

193
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,020
How can you sit here?

194
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,020
I'm so busy.

195
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,020
You should sit there.

196
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,020
Yes, you should sit there.

197
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,020
Where?

198
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,020
There.

199
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,020
How can I sit there?

200
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,020
That's the elder.

201
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,020
You two are the

202
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,020
elders of the bride and groom.

203
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,020
How can I sit there?

204
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,020
You're the elder.

205
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,020
Yes, you're the elder.

206
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,020
I'm now

207
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,020
the royal tutor.

208
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,020
I'm the best in the court.

209
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,020
Yes.

210
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,020
I'm not suitable to sit there.

211
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,020
You're not suitable.

212
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,020
You're not suitable.

213
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,020
You're not suitable.

214
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,020
You're not suitable.

215
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,020
You're not suitable.

216
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,020
You're not suitable.

217
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,020
You two go and take care of the other guests.

218
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,020
Okay?

219
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,020
I'll sit here.

220
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,020
The wine is very good.

221
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,020
How can I sit here?

222
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,020
Okay.

223
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,020
Go, go, go.

224
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,020
You sit first.

225
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,020
Have some tea.

226
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,020
Okay.

227
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,020
Please have tea.

228
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,980
Put your이

229
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,800
down.

230
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,660
Your knee suddenly schedules call.

231
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,660
Don't cry.

232
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,660
Don't cry.

233
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,660
My juice is wet.

234
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,660
Use this.

235
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,940
There's a county in this place.

236
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,340
The Yunshui Courtyard is so spacious.

237
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,540
Besides, I've always treated that place

238
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,700
as my own old house.

239
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,900
I've already lived there.

240
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,220
Mr. Shen, how much is this from the money?

241
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,980
You mean this?

242
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,620
Let me tell you.

243
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,140
If a man can spend money for you,

244
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,460
it doesn't mean he loves you.

245
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,100
But if a man can't spend money for you,

246
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,820
he'll definitely treat you like an idiot.

247
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,460
I...

248
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,660
My sister is testing young master.

249
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,580
You said you wanted to go to my sister's place.

250
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,900
Look at this young man.

251
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,060
Look at his behavior.

252
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,820
Look at you.

253
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,620
Listen, if you do this,

254
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,500
you'll marry my sister.

255
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,300
Who will you marry?

256
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,220
Your Gouqiang.

257
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,780
Mr. Shen, I think you're also Gouqiang.

258
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,620
Gouqiang?

259
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,500
What's wrong with me?

260
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,180
It's good that you don't know money.

261
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,580
I heard that

262
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,300
the Jingzhao Mansion is willing to help the Cui family to solve the case.

263
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,660
I told them everything I know.

264
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,620
Who would have thought that he's Cui Cui?

265
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,180
Actually, I've been following Cui Cui.

266
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,020
He liked to do handwork when he was a child.

267
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,140
He knew that he had made a bet.

268
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,660
He asked if it was useful to wash clothes.

269
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,660
Can he make his own clothes?

270
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,180
Such a annoying child.

271
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,660
I forgot to ask.

272
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,180
Who is your wife?

273
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,060
Jingwen Minghuan.

274
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,500
Chengcheng, it's enough.

275
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,460
No need, thank you.

276
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,380
Dear guests,

277
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,740
dear friends,

278
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,500
today is a happy day.

279
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,380
Let's gather here

280
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:13,100
to witness the union of Cui Shaoyin and Mrs. Shen.

281
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,300
Now, let's welcome the two new guests

282
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,740
with the most enthusiastic applause.

283
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,260
Good.

284
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,940
Dipgasping

285
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,700
The water has a law, the trees have roots,

286
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,340
My son and daughter always remember from their parents.

287
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,780
الممت Terrorists.

288
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,660
committed the rebellion.

289
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,300
May the modern age.

290
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,020
save us.

291
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,780
You two are the only clans.

292
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,860
Say you love him with all your heart and not fear him.

293
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,980
I can slowly set myself free.

294
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,140
Everything that I want is nothing anymore

295
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,420
Let love beingως anything

296
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,820
And at night, my heart stains with tears as the strong wind Nag assistant

297
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:23,700
To Visualize

298
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,820
Li Cheng!

299
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
I'm sorry.

300
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
This is called a sense of relax.

301
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
What? You have a problem with it?

302
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,820
How dare I?

303
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
What are you looking at?

304
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,820
I'm sorry.

305
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,820
The Princess Royal gave it to me.

306
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,820
Do you want to learn it first?

307
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,820
No.

308
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
You're really...

309
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,820
I'm sorry.

310
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
Actually,

311
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
it was because of my own reason

312
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
that we suddenly got married.

313
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
We haven't been together for a long time.

314
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,820
How about

315
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,820
tonight?

316
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
Are you looking for an excuse?

317
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
I should give you some time

318
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
to learn it.

319
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,820
I'm sorry.

320
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,820
The Princess Royal

321
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,820
Madam, let me do it.

322
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
Madam!

323
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
You're really good.

324
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,820
Come.

325
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,820
Congratulations to Young Master.

326
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,820
You're now married and you can go back to your home town.

327
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,820
Congratulations to Young Master!

328
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,820
I'd like to thank you all

329
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
for your hard work.

330
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
You've made it to the top of the ranking.

331
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
You've made it to the top of the ranking.

332
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
Thank you, Young Master!

333
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
Sit down.

334
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,820
This is our new dish,

335
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,820
the crab.

336
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
Thank you, Young Master!

337
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,820
The name of the dish

338
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,820
is made of ten flavors.

339
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
The traditional one is

340
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,820
smoked, steamed, fried,

341
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,820
fried, marinated, fried, and cooked.

342
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,820
The one with the cheese

343
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,820
and this one

344
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,820
is made by my grandfather.

345
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,820
But it's only been a few days.

346
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,820
Please try it.

347
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,820
Please.

348
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
Please.

349
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,820
It's good.

350
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,820
It's good.

351
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,820
But I just...

352
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,820
Sister-in-law.

353
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,820
What did you mean by

354
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,820
only a few days?

355
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,820
My parents had a fight

356
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,820
and they got better.

357
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,820
My father said he would take my mother

358
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,820
to the tea house in Jiangnan.

359
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,820
That's right.

360
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,820
It's been a long time since we met.

361
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,820
Yes.

362
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,820
Where is he?

363
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,820
He and Liu Sanlang

364
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,820
went to open the branch of our family.

365
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,820
What else?

366
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,820
We're here!

367
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,820
We're here!

368
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
Madam,

369
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,820
try it.

370
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,820
Look at him.

371
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,820
Let's eat.

372
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,820
Come and have a look.

373
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,820
Next,

374
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,820
our restaurant,

375
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,820
Shen Family,

376
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,820
has a special food for children.

377
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,820
I hope you can try it.

378
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,820
Today, Wu Wa

379
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,820
is having a meal at the restaurant.

380
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,820
The food is cold.

381
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,820
I'm so happy for you.

382
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,820
You've found a way to eat.

383
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,820
I can finally eat hot food.

384
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,820
Yes, you made a great dish.

385
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,820
It's very delicious.

386
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,820
And it's cute.

387
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,820
My son likes it.

388
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,820
It's all because of you.

389
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,820
I'm flattered.

390
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,820
How can you say that?

391
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,820
You're so kind.

392
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,820
Yangyang often told my wife

393
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,820
that I'm the most reliable father.

394
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,820
Yes, I know.

395
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,820
Yangyang, did you really say that?

396
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,820
I really don't know.

397
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,820
Everyone,

398
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,820
I can't stand other people's praise.

399
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,820
But I've always been

400
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,820
a father who Yangyang can trust.

401
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,820
So let's get back to the point.

402
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,820
Next,

403
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,820
I'll show you the rules.

404
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,820
Don't worry.

405
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,820
We'll give you three pieces of food.

406
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,820
I hope you can...

407
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,820
Don't worry.

408
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,820
Everyone has one.

409
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,820
The winner of this exam

410
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,820
is

411
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,820
Shen Yangyang.

412
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,820
Thank you.

413
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,820
Thank you.

414
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,820
Shen Yangyang.

415
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,820
You used to be so good at

416
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,820
the four books and the five scriptures.

417
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,820
But today you're so good at them.

418
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,820
You can even do the three-parts.

419
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,820
How did you do that?

420
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,820
It's not that hard.

421
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,820
I just need to do the four books.

422
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,820
I always like to say something.

423
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,820
I'm right, but I'm not creative enough.

424
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,820
I can't judge.

425
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,820
We should learn the rules by ourselves.

426
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,820
We should never judge by ourselves.

427
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,820
Shen Yangyang, you...

428
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,820
I think

429
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,820
Yangyang is right.

430
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,820
Thank you.

431
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,820
Congratulations, Mr. Pei.

432
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,820
You're a loyal minister.

433
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,820
You've done a lot of good work.

434
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,820
Now you're finally back to your normal self.

435
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,820
You've found a job.

436
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,820
I think I can take your mother to Yongan.

437
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,820
The city has been arranged.

438
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,820
Mother will be here soon.

439
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,820
Thank you for your concern.

440
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,820
Today you're willing to

441
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,820
call me Mr. Pei.

442
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,820
Actually, I don't understand

443
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,820
what you mean.

444
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,820
We Pei clan are Wang clan.

445
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,820
I'm the 47th in the clan.

446
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,820
I'm not even

447
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,820
close to the enemy.

448
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,820
I'm also the 12th in the clan.

449
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,820
I'm not even close to the enemy.

450
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,820
My family members are all old

451
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,820
and I'm late to the capital.

452
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,820
I'm old

453
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,820
and I'm late to the capital.

454
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,820
I've never been

455
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,820
married to anyone

456
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,820
because I'm from the Wang clan

457
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,820
but I'm from the Han clan.

458
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,820
How could I be so embarrassed to involve

459
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,820
a good wife?

460
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,820
Father passed away long ago.

461
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,820
Mother took the responsibility.

462
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,820
I'll live with her in the future.

463
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,820
But I'm the one who's born and raised by my mother.

464
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,820
I'm not my future wife.

465
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,820
How could I be so humble?

466
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,820
How can I bear

467
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,820
two women and a child

468
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,820
in my humble family?

469
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,820
If you marry me,

470
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,820
everything will be solved.

471
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,820
Why?

472
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,820
You're noble and noble.

473
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,820
I think you're a god.

474
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,820
Why do you have to

475
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,820
go down the mountain

476
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,820
and drag me into the mud?

477
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,820
You're a noble and noble woman.

478
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,820
You're very kind.

479
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,820
But if you carry others,

480
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,820
it will be too hard

481
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,820
and unbearable.

482
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,820
But I can afford it.

483
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,820
But I can't afford it.

484
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,820
I'm not

485
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,820
willing to do it.

486
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,820
All along,

487
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,820
I've been living on my own.

488
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,820
But I'm really

489
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,820
suitable to be a judge.

490
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,820
I think

491
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,820
I can do more for the

492
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,820
royal court and

493
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,820
the country.

494
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,820
But if I'm the prince consort

495
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,820
and the royal court's guest,

496
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,820
I can't be a good judge.

497
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,820
I'm a noble woman.

498
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,820
I have no right

499
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,820
to be a judge.

500
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,820
I'm afraid

501
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,820
that you're too kind.

502
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,820
If so,

503
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,820
I have one last question.

504
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,820
I've loved you.

505
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,820
That day,

506
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,820
you asked me

507
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,820
if I was sincere.

508
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,820
I was

509
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,820
a liar.

510
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,820
Actually,

511
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,820
I'm not just a liar.

512
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,820
I'm a man

513
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,820
who loves his mother.

514
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,820
I'm a man

515
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,820
who loves his mother.

516
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,820
What are you thinking about?

517
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,820
I just want to ask you

518
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,820
how we can get along

519
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,820
when we meet again.

520
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,820
What?

521
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,820
Your Highness, you're the prince consort.

522
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,820
I'm

523
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,820
a man who's a man.

524
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,820
I'm a man who's a man.

525
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,820
You...

526
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,820
Lin Yan,

527
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,820
you're a sinner.

528
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,820
I miss you so much.

529
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,820
You're a sinner.

530
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,820
Shao Yin,

531
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,820
please listen to the question.

532
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,820
Come on.

533
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,820
What's this?

534
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,820
This is called

535
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,820
ice-shelled mooncake.

536
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,820
That's right.

537
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,820
I remember everything you said.

538
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,820
In your place, mooncake is called mooncake.

539
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,820
Cucumber is called cucumber.

540
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,820
Pomegranate is called eggplant.

541
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,820
Grandpa is called dad. Mom is called mom.

542
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,820
You call brother Shen brother.

543
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,820
What do you call me?

544
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,820
You call

545
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,820
wife.

546
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,820
You sound like

547
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,820
someone from our place.

548
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,820
Thank you.

549
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,820
Dad and mom just came back from Jiangnan.

550
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,820
I want them to rest.

551
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,820
Brother is going to the branch.

552
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,820
Yangyang is preparing for the exam.

553
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,820
Yu San and Yuan are too tired during the day.

554
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,820
I'm sorry to bother you.

555
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,820
Mid-autumn festival is our celebration.

556
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,820
Of course.

557
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,820
The circle is open.

558
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,820
Last year,

559
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,820
you made me a flower cake.

560
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,820
I helped you to tie the scarf. Your ears are red.

561
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,820
You didn't

562
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,820
have feelings for me, did you?

563
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,820
Me?

564
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,820
For you?

565
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,820
No, no, no.

566
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,820
Say it again if you can.

567
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,820
Not feelings.

568
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,820
What?

569
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,820
It's true feelings.

570
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,820
So fierce.

571
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,820
What fierce?

572
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,820
I'm praising you.

573
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,820
You're so good.

574
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,820
I'm sorry.

575
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,820
I'm sorry.

576
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,820
I'm sorry.

577
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,820
I'm sorry.

578
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,820
I'm sorry.

579
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,820
I'm sorry.

580
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,820
I'm sorry.

581
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,820
I'm sorry.

582
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,820
I'm sorry.

583
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,820
I'm sorry.

584
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,820
I'm sorry.

585
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,820
I'm sorry.

586
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,820
I'm sorry.

587
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,820
I'm sorry.

588
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,820
I'm sorry.

589
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,820
Cheers!

590
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,820
Cheers!

591
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,820
Cheers!

592
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,100
Come on, let's eat this.

593
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,700
That's the best.

594
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,100
It's so delicious.

595
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,700
It's so delicious.

596
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,140
Let me see.

597
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,260
Do you understand?

598
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,620
I don't believe that shoe.

599
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,380
Let's eat one more.

600
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,500
Come on.

601
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,420
Come on, try it.

602
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,380
Is it good?

603
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,300
Yes.

604
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,780
Are you happy with the music?

605
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,340
Yes.

606
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,540
We'll go to Shanghai next month.

607
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,380
Anyway, I can watch you and A Ji.

608
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,940
You don't know how much I care about you.

609
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,140
You're so old.

610
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,980
Where are we going next month?

611
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,580
I knew you wanted to go.

612
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,180
You said you didn't want to go.

613
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,780
You Fang.

614
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,580
If you don't go back on the last day,

615
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,220
your father won't scold you.

616
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,460
You're having a banquet.

617
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,540
I can't miss it.

618
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,540
Is this vegetable ball made by Jing Wen?

619
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,340
Yes.

620
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,060
It's good.

621
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,980
Your father didn't give you a wedding.

622
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,220
My husband didn't.

623
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,660
I'm a god of Yongan.

624
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,060
He won't force me.

625
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,780
Okay.

626
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,540
The band is coming.

627
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,260
Each layer has a different taste.

628
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,380
You can choose.

629
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,500
Band.

630
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,620
The band is coming.

631
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,740
Each one is made by my wife and me.

632
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,820
Come on.

633
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,220
Thank you, young master.

634
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,140
Come on.

635
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,140
Come on.

636
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,820
One for each.

637
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,820
Thank you.

638
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,820
Sit down and eat.

639
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,980
Come on.

640
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,220
Yuan.

641
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,860
They're coming.

642
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,860
Brothers.

643
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,940
I've talked to the palace.

644
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,300
They're in Ju Xianxia.

645
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,540
The reception is very busy.

646
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,540
It's not a good time.

647
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,580
This is the band

648
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,660
my wife prepared for you.

649
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,660
Please have a look.

650
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,300
Thank you, young master.

651
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,300
Thank you.

652
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,100
Everyone.

653
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:07,500
I hope you can be as happy as this year.

654
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,500
Great.

655
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,660
Thank you.

656
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,660
Dad, the meat you made.

657
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,660
Of course.

658
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,660
I don't know why.

659
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,660
I suddenly want to cook it again.

660
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,660
This is absolutely delicious.

661
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,660
You must try it.

662
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,660
I must have improved my cooking skills.

663
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,660
Baby, try it.

664
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,660
Try it.

665
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,660
Baby, try it.

666
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,660
It's good.

667
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,660
It's good.

668
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,660
It's good.

669
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,660
It's good.

670
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,660
It's good.

671
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,660
It's good.

672
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,660
It's good.

673
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,660
It's good.

674
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,660
It's good.

675
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,660
It's good.

676
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,660
It's good.

677
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,660
It's good.

678
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,660
Baby, what do you mean?

679
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,660
Don't be so mean to the children.

680
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,660
It's okay.

681
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,660
You all try it.

682
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,660
Let them try it.

683
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,660
Everyone, try it.

684
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,660
Everyone, eat.

685
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,660
I'll try it.

686
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,660
I'll try it.

687
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,660
Everyone, try it.

688
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,660
Come on.

689
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,660
It's very delicious.

690
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,660
You all try it.

691
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,660
I've eaten a lot.

692
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,660
It's good.

693
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,660
Look, right?

694
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,660
It's soft.

695
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,660
Gosh, it's rolling.

696
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,660
Gosh, it's rolling.

697
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,660
It's rolling.

698
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
I don't really eat it.

699
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,660
Goodness, it's rolling.

700
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,660
It's rolling.

701
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,660

Gosh.

706

Gosh.

707

It's rolling.

708
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,660
It's rolling.

709
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,660
It's rolling.

710
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:17,660
.
