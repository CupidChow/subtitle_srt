00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 10=

3
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,860
(Shen's Diner)
Drumsticks and chicken cutlets!

4
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,630
Are they really so delicious?

5
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,130
You can go in and try them.

6
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,620
Go in and taste them.

7
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,000
Dad, Mom, the dishes are ready.

8
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,940
Hurry up.

9
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,410
Coming right away.

10
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,970
Hurry up.

11
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,240
Careful.

12
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,180
Alright.

13
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,730
Swift Threads is coming.

14
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,900
(Table 3)

15
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,620
14 qian.

16
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,830
Who in ancient times

17
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,100
could make Liangpi?

18
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,020
Who in ancient times

19
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,220
could make instant noodles?

20
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,660
Who in ancient times

21
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,810
could fry

22
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,420
chicken cutlets bigger than one's face?

23
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,700
Only I, Shen Jianshe.

24
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,540
I'm uniquely talented.

25
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,060
Enough.

26
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,560
If we were in a time-travel novel,

27
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,580
you would be nothing.

28
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,540
The male protagonists

29
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,620
are all better than you.

30
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,620
The people in this era

31
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,860
just haven't eaten these things.

32
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,130
You don't have any real skills.

33
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,400
Stop boasting.

34
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,700
You can't say that.

35
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,980
You can't always put me down.

36
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,500
You should be nicer to me.

37
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,300
I'm a genius chef now.

38
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,140
Without me,

39
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,540
could this diner
have been so successful?

40
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,260
Shen Jianshe,

41
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,300
once you open a diner,

42
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,150
how come you claim

43
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,500
all the credit for yourself?

44
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,420
Your contribution is nothing, okay?

45
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,420
Your daughter took care

46
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,660
of the decoration and work-shirts.

47
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,380
She taught you
how to make instant noodles

48
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,580
through Laomian's methods.

49
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,820
You're the talented one?

50
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,300
How can you be so full of yourself?

51
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,380
Yes, yes.

52
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,500
However good my daughter is,

53
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,560
she is still my daughter.

54
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,360
There's a matter of genetics here.

55
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,580
Dad, Mom.

56
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,440
My genes are good.

57
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,920
The diner is full. We need to hurry.

58
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,880
Really?

59
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,900
It's full again?

60
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,860
It's full?

61
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,340
Hurry up.

62
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,610
Try some of this.

63
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,460
Golden Crisp,

64
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,820
with its thin and crispy texture,

65
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,760
paired with this sauce,

66
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,040
tastes even sweeter.

67
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,060
Fragrant Skin is also very refreshing.

68
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,020
It's really delicious.

69
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,060
You eat so much,

70
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,020
yet you don't gain any weight.

71
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,140
What's wrong?

72
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,640
Your family is in the fabric business,

73
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,420
yet you don't want to spare

74
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,880
an extra bolt of cloth for yourself?

75
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,260
What are you talking about?

76
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,820
I just didn't save the fabric

77
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,720
for you last time.

78
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,580
Are you still holding a grudge?

79
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,180
You may look plump,

80
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,750
but you're too full.

81
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,620
You...

82
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,460
I remember

83
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,020
you once made the bed

84
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,340
you were selling collapse.

85
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,960
What are you talking about?

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,860
What?

87
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,660
Let's go out if you dare.

88
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,040
Don't fight.

89
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,980
- Let's go.
- Come out.

90
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,940
Both of you, let go.

91
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,900
Come out. Let's go.

92
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,500
Stop arguing, stop arguing.

93
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,060
Everyone, everyone.

94
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,500
Look, look.

95
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,460
Let go.

96
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,180
Manager Zhao, Manager Liu,

97
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,980
you've both gained some weight.

98
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,500
It fits the fashion of our dynasty.

99
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,460
How cute you look.

100
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,460
I'm like Manager Zhang and Lady Xu,

101
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,080
who eat and eat but never gain weight.

102
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,600
It's really worrying us.

103
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,780
Stop arguing.

104
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,480
It happens that I've been meaning

105
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,120
to talk to both of you.

106
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,900
The seats you were just sitting on

107
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,780
are called chairs,

108
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,380
much more comfortable than before.

109
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,060
You two are well-traveled.

110
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,740
You can tell they're good stuff, right?

111
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,860
I have the blueprints here.

112
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,660
If you want to get into this business,

113
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,820
I can teach you.

114
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,020
When you sell them to others,

115
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,460
just give me 20% of the profit.

116
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,100
So...

117
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,660
Well.

118
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,820
But these chairs

119
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,220
need cushions on top.

120
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,700
You'll also have to need fabric

121
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,540
from Manager Zhang and Lady Xu.

122
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,660
We're all friends here.

123
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,420
We should make money together.

124
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,540
What's the use of quarreling?

125
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,940
Lady Shen makes sense.

126
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,820
Manager Zhang,

127
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,980
I was wrong before.

128
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,060
Please forgive me.

129
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,340
Lady Shen,

130
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,460
I'll cover the meal

131
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,300
for both of them.

132
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,140
How about that?

133
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,860
- Sure.
- Okay.

134
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,100
Then...

135
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,420
Well.

136
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,860
Auntie, you're so amazing.

137
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,660
I was so scared just now.

138
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,580
(Handsome Shen)

139
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,460
Handsome,

140
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,060
see you again tomorrow.

141
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,180
Take care.

142
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,340
Handsome, Handsome.

143
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,340
Handsome.

144
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,060
You must be

145
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,460
Widow Li from Liuyun Alley.

146
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,700
Are you also here today

147
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,140
to consult about romantic matters?

148
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,100
Yes, yes.

149
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,260
Handsome,

150
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,980
what are these round things

151
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,820
on your face?

152
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,340
They look so intriguing.

153
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,380
In my hometown,

154
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,460
they're called sunglasses.

155
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,020
Don't they make me

156
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,460
look even more handsome?

157
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,580
Sunglasses?

158
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,780
Well.

159
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,380
Look carefully.

160
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,380
You truly are inventive,

161
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,100
Handsome.

162
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,340
Here's the thing.

163
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,580
I've been thinking of remarrying,

164
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,140
but I have some concerns.

165
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,260
What concerns?

166
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,220
I think

167
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,860
you should remarry.

168
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,860
I've been married three times,

169
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,100
each time outliving my husband.

170
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,940
So what?

171
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,260
That's quite a skill of yours.

172
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,580
The neighbors

173
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,380
all say I'm unlucky.

174
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,180
Butcher Zhou has proposed to me,

175
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,340
but I'm afraid I'll harm him, too.

176
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,540
Why care

177
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,580
about the neighbors?

178
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,380
Do they raise Butcher Zhou

179
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,620
or you?

180
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,460
No.

181
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,540
So, why should you mind them?

182
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,180
You only live once.

183
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,820
You just need to open up to yourself.

184
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,380
Besides,

185
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,340
it's not you who's dying.

186
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,100
Why be afraid?

187
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,660
Go ahead and remarry.

188
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,100
I'll take your advice.

189
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,460
Thank you, Handsome.

190
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,540
Handsome, Handsome.

191
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,160
Handsome, Handsome.

192
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,300
One by one, okay?

193
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,800
Alright.

194
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,110
There are so many guests,

195
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,360
and he's still chatting there.

196
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,220
Auntie, should I call Dad

197
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,300
to come and help?

198
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,980
Never mind.

199
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,140
I've never seen your dad

200
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,460
- so successful.
- Is it done?

201
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,300
Who knows how long it'll last?

202
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,260
Let him be.

203
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,340
Luckily, we have Deyuan now.

204
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,080
Or you'd have to help Grandpa

205
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,700
and Grandma with cooking and serving,

206
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,020
and deal with guests' quarrels.

207
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,950
You'd be busy as a bee.

208
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,580
The sun hat is too big.

209
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,300
I'll have to ask my mother to adjust it.

210
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,940
Milady,

211
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,940
this hairpin is so beautiful.

212
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,580
It cost ten qian.

213
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,660
You're so good to me.

214
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,100
We've been open for over ten days,

215
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,180
and it's been so tiring.

216
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,820
It's just a hairpin.

217
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,320
What matters most is that you like it.

218
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,380
Ever since my parents passed away,

219
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,580
I've come to Yong'an.

220
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,780
After all these years,

221
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,020
this is my first time
visiting West Market.

222
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,980
Milady,

223
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,780
besides my mother,

224
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,740
you're the first person
who's been so kind to me.

225
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,740
I'll definitely repay you.

226
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,290
Your happiness

227
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,060
is the best repayment for me.

228
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,220
I'll take it.

229
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,180
Let me.

230
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,320
You admire your hairpin,

231
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,280
and I'll carry it.

232
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,620
Then help me with the hat.

233
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,580
I'll take it.

234
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,940
Milady,

235
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,260
up ahead is Yunlai Tavern.

236
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,700
I'm a bit scared.

237
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,580
Didn't you just call Feng Li by his name

238
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,800
and say you'd sue him to death?

239
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,240
Why are you scared now?

240
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,540
I was desperate back then,

241
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,740
and I don't know

242
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,620
how I dared to call his name.

243
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,940
You must always be so brave.

244
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,340
What can he do to you?

245
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,580
Let's go.

246
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,980
(Yunlai Tavern)
Look.

247
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,700
All these new dishes.

248
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,040
(Fragrant Skin)
Look.

249
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,320
(Brocade-Wrapped Turtle)
The name is quite interesting.

250
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,880
These dishes look just like those
from Shen's Diner.

251
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,140
They do look similar.

252
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,380
(Swift Threads, Golden Crisp)

253
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,220
Golden Crisp?

254
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,060
Swift Threads?

255
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,940
Even Carefree Drink is here.

256
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,050
This...

257
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:46,900
Everyone,

258
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,540
welcome.

259
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,220
Welcome to Yunlai Tavern.

260
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,940
Our dishes here

261
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,700
are incomparable to those

262
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,460
from smaller establishments.

263
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,300
Take this Swift Threads,

264
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,100
for example.

265
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,260
While others use

266
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,220
only mutton bones

267
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,740
for the broth,

268
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,980
we add chicken

269
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,100
and fish bones,

270
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,620
simmering

271
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,500
for a whole day.

272
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,260
It even includes
some fresh meat and leafy greens.

273
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,020
And the price

274
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,380
is just half of what others charge.

275
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,420
What?

276
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,500
Just half?

277
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,140
I must give it a try.

278
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,300
Yes, yes.

279
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,140
Welcome, welcome.

280
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,300
Please, come in.

281
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,300
Inside, please.

282
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,300
Welcome.

283
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,580
- Please.
- Inside, please.

284
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,300
Welcome, welcome.

285
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,260
Inside, please.

286
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,340
Lady Shen.

287
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,780
What?

288
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,420
Do you still have the mood

289
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,780
to protect this little maid?

290
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,460
If you ask me,

291
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,860
you should hurry back to your diner

292
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,220
and see how many guests

293
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,300
are left.

294
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,100
Come on, inside, please.

295
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,180
Welcome, welcome.

296
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,540
Welcome.

297
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,740
Inside, please.

298
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,140
Please, please.

299
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,460
(Shen's Diner)

300
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,420
Let's have some drinks at my place.

301
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,650
- Sure, let's go.
- Let's go.

302
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,220
(Welcome)

303
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,220
I know, I know.

304
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,840
I've found out.

305
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,860
What have you found out?

306
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,340
I know why no guests are coming here.

307
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:21,740
Yunlai Tavern

308
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,380
has copied all our dishes

309
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,740
and is selling them at half price.

310
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,220
How shameless.

311
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,180
Look at them.

312
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,980
Folks, let's have a meeting.

313
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,220
Let me say something.

314
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,740
Do you know what moment it is now?

315
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,420
It's a moment of life and death.

316
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,620
It's the darkest hour.

317
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,580
It's...

318
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,280
Where's Jicai?

319
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,220
Where has Jicai gone?

320
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,420
Auntie and Deyuan went out shopping

321
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,060
and haven't come back yet.

322
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,420
This girl.

323
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,580
She doesn't show up

324
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,940
at such a serious family meeting.

325
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,660
It doesn't matter. Let me continue.

326
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,940
Since we've decided

327
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,040
to stay and run the diner,

328
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,060
we must fight

329
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,140
for our pride.

330
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,420
This isn't the first time
Yunlai Tavern has done this.

331
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,580
They copied

332
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,640
my Jianbing Guozi before.

333
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,980
Now, they've reached out to me again.

334
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,980
Faced with such malicious competition,

335
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,700
such an unprecedented,

336
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,740
cruel business war,

337
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,900
we must win this battle.

338
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,860
We must win.

339
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,620
My blood is boiling.

340
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,380
For so many years,

341
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,860
I've developed so many dishes,

342
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,940
and they've easily plagiarized them.

343
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,900
We definitely can't

344
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,020
tolerate this.

345
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,660
What have you developed?

346
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,380
They're some ordinary modern dishes.

347
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,780
It's normal for them to replicate.

348
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,740
Replicate...

349
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,100
Don't speak without raising your hands

350
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,900
during the meeting.

351
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,580
Mom, don't be angry.

352
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,140
- Don't stoop to his level.
- Grandma.

353
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,780
Dad, I just thought of something.

354
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,660
Say it.

355
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,700
You, sit down.

356
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,780
Since Yunlai Tavern

357
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,940
can copy our dishes,

358
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,580
we can copy back, right?

359
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,140
An eye for an eye.

360
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,780
That makes sense.

361
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,460
I've already replicated

362
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,340
four famous dishes from Yunlai Tavern:

363
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,100
Fish Fermented in Milk,

364
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,660
Chopstick-tip Spring,

365
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,020
Changshan Congee,

366
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,380
and Brocade-Wrapped Big Turtle.

367
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,260
Please taste them

368
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,740
and give valuable feedback.

369
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,980
Respecting the elderly and caring
for the young is our traditional virtue.

370
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,300
Let's have Yangyang go first.

371
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,400
- Yangyang.
- Respecting

372
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,400
the elderly comes first.

373
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,700
Caring for the young comes after.

374
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,700
Grandma should go first.

375
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,460
I had too much for breakfast,

376
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,860
and I'm not hungry now.

377
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,260
But I remember

378
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,700
the four dishes from Yunlai

379
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,780
didn't look like this.

380
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,740
Son,

381
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,220
you came up with this idea.

382
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,180
You should taste it.

383
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,460
- I...
- Wait.

384
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,420
Wait a minute.

385
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,580
What do you mean?

386
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,700
Do your dad a favor.

387
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,860
Taste it.

388
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,980
Gongcai,

389
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,140
pick anything you like.

390
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,980
- Eat.
- Fine, I'll taste it.

391
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,460
I'll try this one.

392
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,700
I'll have this.

393
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,740
Take a big bite.

394
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,780
Dad,

395
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,620
are you going to lose a tooth?

396
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,780
Alright, don't force it.

397
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,220
It really is a bit hard on the teeth.

398
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,820
Well, Dad, I'll try this congee.

399
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,860
Look.

400
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,820
It's good...

401
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,460
I'm sorry, Dad.

402
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,580
I really couldn't help it.

403
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,580
Your cooking is so consistent.

404
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,960
Unless you've practiced many times,

405
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,680
every time you make a new dish,

406
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,100
the taste is really unbearable.

407
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,260
At least show some respect for me, okay?

408
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,740
Don't forget

409
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,900
how you grew up.

410
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,780
If it weren't for me cooking for you...

411
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,900
We spent a whole string of coins

412
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,500
on these ingredients.

413
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,820
How expensive!

414
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,540
Look, it's all wasted.

415
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,540
You haven't even tasted it.

416
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,660
How can you say these dishes

417
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,620
are wasted?

418
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,500
Are you

419
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,700
stereotypical

420
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,660
in your impression

421
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,380
of me?

422
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,700
Enough.

423
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,540
Let's think

424
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,560
of other ways

425
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,460
to deal with Yunlai Tavern.

426
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,740
Come out and help!

427
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,100
We're back.

428
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,540
- Auntie.
- Jicai's back.

429
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,660
Auntie's finally back.

430
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,120
- Come on.
- Dad, the tasting today

431
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,520
just ends here.

432
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,500
(Shen's Diner)

433
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,780
We're back.

434
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,020
Jicai, where have you been?

435
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,460
It took you quite a while.

436
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,620
Jicai,

437
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,700
what's in this burlap sack?

438
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,460
What a big bag.

439
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,860
- Why bring back a big iron pot?
- What?

440
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,820
This...

441
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,420
It is the big weapon

442
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,500
to beat Yunlai Tavern.

443
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,540
Auntie,

444
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,180
you were gone for so long

445
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,300
just to buy pork and a pot?

446
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,940
After Deyuan and I finished shopping,

447
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,120
we passed by Yunlai's entrance

448
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,040
and found out they copied our dishes.

449
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,300
So, I dragged Deyuan
to order half a sow.

450
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,540
Pork isn't popular here,

451
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,820
and good pork is hard to find.

452
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,240
We had to go out of city to get it.

453
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,540
Lady Shen said we needed an iron pot.

454
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,860
The blacksmith said

455
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,380
the furnace wasn't hot enough,

456
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,000
and he couldn't make
the right curvature.

457
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,020
Luckily, Blacksmith Wang
from West Market

458
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,060
was unable to bear Lady's coaxing

459
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,660
and managed to make it.

460
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,820
I see.

461
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,540
I was wondering
why it took you two so long

462
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,700
just to buy groceries.

463
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,420
Wait, wait.

464
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,420
I still don't get it.

465
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,100
How did the pork and iron pot

466
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,260
become the big weapon to beat

467
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,740
Yunlai Tavern?

468
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,700
Yes.

469
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,500
Yunlai copied our dishes,

470
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
used better ingredients,

471
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,800
but set a lower price.

472
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,980
They're trying to squeeze us

473
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,660
out of business with low prices.

474
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,300
It's definitely a loss for them,

475
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,580
but they can afford it.

476
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,420
Yangyang, I still don't understand

477
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,420
what you're saying.

478
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,220
You have to believe
in your learning ability.

479
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,440
You'll catch up eventually.

480
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,400
It's okay, Deyuan.

481
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,860
You'll learn from me more,

482
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,860
and you'll understand.

483
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,300
Alright, stop bothering her.

484
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,420
Jicai, keep going.

485
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,260
I still don't get it.

486
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,660
If we compete in the same way,

487
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,700
we can't win.

488
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,780
But as I mentioned before,

489
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,700
we can make affordable gourmet.

490
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,500
We'll offer good value for money

491
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,100
and constantly innovate.

492
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,380
Pork is cheap in our dynasty.

493
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,780
If we use pork to create new dishes,

494
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,700
we can keep the costs extremely low.

495
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,700
But many people don't eat pork.

496
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,220
They think it has a strong odor.

497
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,660
Yes, they don't eat pork here.

498
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,540
Deyuan, you like Lard Rice, right?

499
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,940
I didn't have much money.

500
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,060
I wasn't too picky

501
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,570
or concerned. But others...

502
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,410
But our business

503
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,180
is for the common folk.

504
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,500
If we make the pork delicious

505
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,140
and offer it at a low price

506
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,500
to fill one's stomach,

507
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,620
who would refuse?

508
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,980
Wait.

509
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,620
I think I get it now.

510
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,820
You mean...

511
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,140
To make pork delicious,

512
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,460
we first need to remove
the strong smell from it.

513
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,700
This iron pot

514
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,580
is for that, right?

515
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,660
First, blanch the pork,

516
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,620
and then stir-fry it
in the iron pot with spices.

517
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,260
It should work.

518
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,300
That actually makes sense.

519
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,100
Our original signature dishes

520
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,860
were easy to copy, right?

521
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,500
But with the special treatment
using the iron pot

522
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,660
and so many ways to cook pork,

523
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,540
they probably

524
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,260
can't copy it anymore.

525
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,780
That's right.

526
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,220
Good.

527
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,340
Very good.

528
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,420
Iron Pot Pork.

529
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,660
In our dynasty,

530
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,900
who else can do it?

531
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,940
Who else?

532
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,460
Who else can do it?

533
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,380
No one else.

534
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,340
Right?

535
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,340
If we really

536
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,140
promote this pork dish,

537
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,600
our diner

538
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,660
will be truly remarkable.

539
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,220
We'll make a name for ourselves

540
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,340
and stand alone in our dynasty.

541
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,060
(Today's new dish: Agate Meat)
Come and have a look.

542
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,460
Shen's Diner has a new dish.

543
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,100
(Shen's Diner)

544
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,220
Passers-by,

545
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,740
don't miss out.

546
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,940
We're introducing a new dish today:

547
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,180
Agate Meat.

548
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,900
For all the guests who visit today,

549
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,700
we'll give a free taste.

550
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,460
It's free!

551
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,900
It smells quite good.

552
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,180
Very good.

553
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,140
It smells good.

554
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,940
- Never seen this before.
- It smells good.

555
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,980
So good.

556
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,900
Agate Meat

557
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,260
looks like pork.

558
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,940
It is pork.

559
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,860
How do you eat pork?

560
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,180
- Can you eat pork?
- Yeah.

561
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,340
Pork is so smelly.

562
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,300
How can you eat it?

563
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,660
- Exactly.
- Everyone,

564
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,650
Agate Meat

565
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,090
is carefully marinated,

566
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,310
then stewed in rich broth,

567
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,120
- and stir-fried to reduce the sauce.
- Yes.

568
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,300
It has completely removed the smell.

569
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,390
It's good value for money,

570
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,520
and you can eat it at ease.

571
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,480
Stir-frying?

572
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,860
What is stir-frying?

573
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,620
Stir-frying is

574
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,100
a special cooking skill

575
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,180
unique to our diner.

576
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,140
Yes, yes.

577
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,180
It smells so good.

578
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,700
She's eating it.

579
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,580
She's really eating it.

580
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,620
Try it.

581
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,500
There really isn't that smell?

582
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,460
No smell at all, very delicious.

583
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,060
No smell at all.

584
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,180
- It's good.
- Come on, sir.

585
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,260
Try some.

586
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,460
Have a taste.

587
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,740
Come on, try it.

588
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,540
- I won't eat it.
- Try it.

589
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,700
- Let's go.
- It's good.

590
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,080
How can you know if you don't try?

591
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,000
Try it.

592
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,300
Sir.

593
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,400
- Have some.
- Come on.

594
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,460
You'll definitely like it.

595
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,140
Everyone, try it.

596
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,340
Marbled with fat and lean.

597
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,940
If he won't eat it, I will.

598
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,580
What a pity not to taste.

599
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,620
Such delicious food.

600
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,220
It seems Shen

601
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,740
has lost her mind,

602
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,820
coming up with such a silly idea.

603
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,900
Pork has such a strong smell.

604
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,820
It can't be considered decent.

605
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,260
Yet the Shen family

606
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,660
has put all their hopes on pork.

607
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,700
How foolish

608
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,740
that is.

609
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,180
Yes, yes.

610
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,220
It seems soon

611
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,460
Shen's Diner will have to close.

612
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,660
You'll finally

613
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,060
get your revenge.

614
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,820
It smells so good.

615
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,620
We've only been open for a short time.

616
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,820
Another day without any business.

617
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,080
You have no idea

618
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:15,760
how mean

619
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,580
the neighbors' words are.

620
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,040
They say Yunlai

621
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,220
has taken our business,

622
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,700
and we've all gone mad,

623
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,540
not even sparing the sows.

624
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,580
The disdain for pork in our dynasty

625
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,820
comes from the top.

626
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,780
The nobles think sows eat leftovers

627
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,740
and consider it cheap,

628
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,820
so they refuse to eat it.

629
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,900
Ordinary people follow suit.

630
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,700
But actually, they just don't know how

631
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,180
to remove the smell from pork,

632
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,380
so pork can't become popular.

633
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,020
To break this notion,

634
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,900
it should also start from the top.

635
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,780
I really think

636
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,220
I need a translator.

637
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,160
What does "from the top"

638
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,420
even mean?

639
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,380
Deyuan,

640
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,700
they'll handle these things.

641
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,660
We just need to pretend to understand.

642
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,100
Just eat.

643
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,020
Actually, I think

644
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,070
"from the top" is harder.

645
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,340
If ordinary people don't eat it,

646
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,080
how can you get
the upper class to eat it?

647
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,980
I don't have a way,

648
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,940
but you do, Gongcai.

649
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,260
Me?

650
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,100
Gongcai,

651
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,180
aren't you already an opinion leader?

652
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,460
(Shen's Diner)

653
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,700
Mr. Shen.

654
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,240
Mr. Shen.

655
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,420
I never expected

656
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,700
that Mr. Shen serving dishes
could be so dashing.

657
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,900
Yes.

658
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,260
Mr. Shen is so talented

659
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,340
and knowledgeable.

660
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,380
I didn't expect
that he also has studied diet.

661
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,700
Yes.

662
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,460
Mr. Shen, any new theories recently?

663
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,900
Tell us now.

664
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,860
- Yes.
- Tell us.

665
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,700
You flatter me.

666
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,540
You're really flattering me.

667
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,620
You flatter me.

668
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,460
Ladies,

669
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,940
actually, today,

670
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,180
I invited you all here

671
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,020
to taste

672
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,380
my latest creation,

673
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,380
Agate Meat.

674
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,740
Agate?

675
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,020
Mr. Shen, this dish

676
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,380
is made from pork, right?

677
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,180
How can we eat this?

678
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,500
Pork...

679
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,700
Sows grow up eating leftovers.

680
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,180
Pork is very dirty.

681
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,300
I don't eat pork.

682
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,420
Neither do I.

683
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,520
(Wealth may vary among people,
but souls are equal.)

684
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,540
Ladies,

685
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,100
I once said

686
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,940
at Princess Fuhui's poetry gathering

687
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,400
that while wealth

688
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,820
may differ,

689
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,140
souls are equal,

690
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,420
with no distinction

691
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,600
in status.

692
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,080
If this is true for humans,

693
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,400
why not for animals

694
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,940
and livestock?

695
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,900
Why is it acceptable

696
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,860
to eat mutton

697
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,300
but not pork?

698
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,100
Mutton is from herbivores,

699
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,140
clean in taste,

700
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,980
while pork has a strong,
unpleasant odor.

701
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,980
- Indeed.
- Exactly.

702
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,740
This is not fit for human consumption.

703
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,180
In fact,

704
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,740
one should not just listen to others.

705
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,140
One must try things for oneself to know

706
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,460
what the pork

707
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,420
from our diner

708
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,300
tastes like.

709
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,260
It smells good.

710
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,700
It's good?

711
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,500
It actually smells good.

712
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,060
What do you think?

713
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,420
Is it good?

714
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,780
Yes.

715
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,460
Everyone says

716
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,900
pork has a strong odor.

717
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,100
This

718
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,380
is prejudice.

719
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,700
We must not be biased

720
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,780
in our dealings.

721
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,660
Ladies, if you understand
the concept of equality,

722
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,220
it shows that you have not only beauty,

723
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,340
but also a heart of sincerity

724
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,250
and fairness,

725
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,700
like pearls.

726
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,980
So, why not give pork

727
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,300
a chance?

728
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,700
Prejudice is most undesirable.

729
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,560
For example,

730
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,020
if you judge

731
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,180
a person

732
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,020
by their appearance,

733
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,140
that is

734
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,460
too hasty.

735
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,380
Mr. Shen makes sense.

736
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,380
Just as Mr. Shen's appearance,

737
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,320
one would never imagine

738
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,960
that he is such a talented

739
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,420
and benevolent person.

740
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,180
I am willing to trust him.

741
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,620
She's truly eating it.

742
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,020
What do you think?

743
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,700
The pork is so tender and juicy.

744
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,300
As expected of Mr. Shen.

745
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,260
- He can turn pork
- She ate it.

746
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,220
into such a delightful flavor.

747
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,300
Really?

748
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,300
- I'll try it.
- Let me try it.

749
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,600
- Please.
- I'll give it a try.

750
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,540
It's really delicious.

751
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,140
I've fallen in love with pork.

752
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,820
Delicious.

753
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,820
- Even the nobles
- Is it really so good?

754
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,740
praise Shen's pork.

755
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,020
Perhaps there is

756
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,700
something extraordinary about it.

757
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,380
It makes me want to taste it, too.

758
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,460
Agate Meat

759
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,510
has a bright red color

760
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,700
and rich flavor.

761
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,300
Good for you, Mr. Shen.

762
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,730
You've even made

763
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,060
pork so delicious.

766

and has surpassed mutton in taste.

767
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,940
You flatter me.

768
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,460
Your fan is also quite stylish.

769
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,780
I have only seen round fans,

770
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,100
never such a folding fan.

771
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,060
Indeed.

772
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,380
Ladies,

773
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,660
anything can be successful

774
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,580
if done

775
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,140

848
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,980
to be honest,

849
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,620
I don't really care

850
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,500
about this title.

00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,940
Okay, Dad.

00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,940

besides money?

864
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,220
- Well.
- Always money.

865
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,980
Is money that important?

866
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,300

are all here.

Dad, listen.

876
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,940
Don't make me

877
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,380
do this kind of thing again.

878
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,500

What if they see me?

882
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,130
It'd be so bad for my image.

883
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,150
Come on.

884
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,740

And you feel wronged

888
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,260
working for me?

889
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,020
No, it's not that.

890
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,420
Gongcai, didn't you use

891
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,420
to look down on me?

892
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,260
When I replicated the dishes

893
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,260
from Yunlai Tavern,

894
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,540
the look on your face

895
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,900
when you bit into that quail.

896
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,500
- You were losing your teeth?
- No.

897
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,660
You even spat out the congee.

898
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,300
Right?

899
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,260
How about now?

900
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,580
Do you admire me now?

901
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,500
- How about now?
- Yes.

902
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,780
Dad, but seriously,

903
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,900
that was all in the past.

904
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,620
You've practiced this dish
in modern times,

905
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,460
so it's perfect now, right?

906
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,420
- Gongcai.
- Well.

907
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,460
Listen to me.

908
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,860
Don't blame me

909
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,340
for not teaching you well.

910
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,860
There is no such thing

911
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,940
as a genius in this world.

912
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,780
Only hard work.

913
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,820
I practiced this pork dish

914
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,540
500 times.

915
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,860
Aged by time,

916
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,780
weathered by trials,

917
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,020
I finally made it a classic.

918
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,020
It finally became popular in Yong'an.

919
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,140
Right?

920
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,340
Of course, it also

921
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,340
made me

922
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,420

923
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,540
Dad,

924
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,620
are you

925
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,750
saying

926
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,170
you don't even listen

927
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,340
to what Mom says now?

928
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,060
Are your mom's words

929
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,580
even useful?

930
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,420
When have I ever listened?

931
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,300
Just your mom?

932
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,060
In the whole of Yong'an,

933
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,580
who can control me?

934
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,980
Let alone your mom.

935
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,100
Who?

936
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,700
Who can control me?

937
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,580
The Best Chef in Juxian?

938
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,300
You're so full of yourself, huh?

939
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,700
I feel like

940
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,420
Dad has changed.

941
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,980
He's become a bit...

942
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,340
Pretentious.

943
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,100
Especially pretentious.

944
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,540
What? I...

945
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,380
Shen Jianshe.

946
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,460
I've noticed

947
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,420
ever since our diner opened,

948
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,340
you've changed so much

949
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,760
that I hardly recognize you anymore.

950
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,740
Is that so?

951
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,580
I think it's necessary for me

952
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,340
to get to know you all over again.

953
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,260
I am Shen Jianshe.

954
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,460
Best Chef

955
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,420
in Juxian.

956
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,460
Are you crazy,

957
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,340
Shen Jianshe?

958
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,180
Best Chef in Juxian?

959
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,780
Do you really think you're a celebrity?

960
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,900
Listen, that's just a title.

961
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,860
Do you know that?

962
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,020
Ma'am,

963
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,020
you can pinch Shen Jianshe's waist,

964
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,980
but not the waist

965
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,140
of the Best Chef.

966
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,180
Best Chef in Juxian, huh?

967
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,260
- Pick it up.
- I won't.

968
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,220
Shen Jianshe!

969
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,580
Clean the table.

970
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,180
I love cleaning tables.

971
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,580
What's wrong with you?

972
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,580
I can clean that table, too.

973
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,380
Lady Shen, why deliver meals

974
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,420
at this hour?

975
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,380
I know the Vice Prefect

976
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,900
doesn't eat at night,

977
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,420
but he's been so busy lately

978
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,660
that I haven't seen him.

979
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,940
There's a dish

980
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,260
I really want him to try.

981
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,580
Liu Chang,

982
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,140
let Lady Shen in.

983
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,340
Vice Prefect,

984
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,860
this is a new dish we've developed.

985
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,900
It's a bit special,

986
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,900
so we didn't dare to send it
to your office,

987
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,940
but we still wanted you to try it.

988
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,380
Alright.

989
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,740
You want me to eat this?

990
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,100
(Pork trotters are common,)

991
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,220
(but not every pork trotter can make)

992
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,340
(the Vice Prefect of Yong'an
lose his composure.)

993
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,060
(If...)

994
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,700
Why?

995
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,340
You're not disappointed

996
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,780
that I don't look ravenous,

997
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,940
are you?

998
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,700
No, no.

999
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,660
How could I be?

1000
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,260
You have no prejudice against pork.

1001
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,300
You just ate it like that.

1002
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,620
Even with such a difficult dish,

1003
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,900
you can handle it so well.

1004
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,900
You're really a good person.

1005
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,540
Whoever gets to marry you

1006
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,860
will be truly blessed.

1007
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,420
(Letter of Engagement Dissolution)
We shall forget everything.

1008
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,760
Never again shall it be mentioned.

1009
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,020
Should anyone bring it up again,

1010
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,980
it shall be considered

1011
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,020
a violation of human ethics,

1012
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,100
a moral collapse,

1013
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,940
and will be condemned
by all future generations

1014
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,140
of the Shen family.

1015
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,820
It's okay, it's okay.

1016
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,780
I was just blind.

1017
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,020
I didn't see anything.

1018
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,380
You think I'm a good man,

1019
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,300
yet avoid me like the plague?

1020
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,740
What?

1021
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,740
Nothing.

1022
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,500
Why start making pork dishes?

1023
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,980
Pork is cheap.

1024
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,940
We can't compete with Yunlai Tavern's

1025
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,300
expensive ingredients.

1026
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,780
I think

1027
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,820
I get

1028
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,140
what you're saying.

1029
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,020
You finally get it.

1030
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,020
By selling pork,

1031
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,140
the common people can afford

1032
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,860
good meat dishes at a low cost.

1033
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,660
That's quite a meritorious deed.

1034
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,660
That's what I mean.

1035
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,180
I have some serious business here.

1036
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,620
The competition between you and Yunlai

1037
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,420
is not just between you two.

1038
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,960
Someone has already noticed,

1039
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,100
and they're exaggerating it,

1040
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,620
saying that selling pork

1041
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:50,020
might shake the foundation.

1042
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,780
If we allow nobles to eat lowly food,

1043
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,400
the commoners

1044
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,860
might dare to overstep their bounds.

1045
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,460
What nonsense.

1046
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,940
Eating pork

1047
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,420
shouldn't be taken so seriously.

1048
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,900
Nonsense?

1049
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,540
Yes.

1050
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,420
I think it's nonsense, too.

1051
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,860
Actually, in the court and the Palace,

1052
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,660
there are quite a few people
who are trading

1053
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,180
under the names of their relatives.

1054
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,340
It seems that the profits
of Yunlai Tavern

1055
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,700
are not just going
into their owner's pockets.

1056
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,700
Do you want us to win,

1057
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,540
or them to win?

1058
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,620
I bet on you winning.
