1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Brother Yu, you're a monster

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,540
You have to help me

3
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,660
You are king of the earth

4
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,100
Youort Dragon

5
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:59,300
I'm

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,920
Time and Qu 我 teaching you the novo world will never have to face any difficulty.

7
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,720
That's good!

8
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,920
Good!

9
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,920
Great!

10
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,920
Grandpa!

11
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,920
Come on, come on!

12
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,920
It's okay.

13
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,920
I know that it's not that difficult to get a birth certificate.

14
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,920
But grandpa, you're my heart's birth certificate.

15
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,920
We're your heart's birth certificate.

16
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,920
Really? I'm your heart's birth certificate?

17
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,920
You're my heart's birth certificate, right?

18
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
Yes, you're the smartest.

19
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,920
Let's clean up and go to the clinic.

20
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,920
Let's not go to the clinic.

21
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,920
We have to spend money to get to the clinic.

22
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
I said, it's okay.

23
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
I'm going.

24
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,920
Be good.

25
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
Okay.

26
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,920
Be good.

27
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
I'm going.

28
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,920
What a mess!

29
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
Li Angwei, who was not really angry,

30
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
is back to the palace to work.

31
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
Don't wait for me to see the birth certificate.

32
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
Stop!

33
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
Li Angwei,

34
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,920
why are you here?

35
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,920
What do you want?

36
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
I want to see the birth certificate.

37
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,920
What?

38
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
You want to see me?

39
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
You want to avoid me?

40
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,920
Then you don't have to run away.

41
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,920
I command you to run away.

42
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
You bastard!

43
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
I don't know

44
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
what I like about you.

45
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,920
I don't have anything

46
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,920
that you should look up to.

47
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,920
Now you understand

48
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
and you don't look up to me.

49
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,920
Good.

50
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,920
You two

51
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,920
are a perfect match.

52
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Angwei,

53
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
give you some food.

54
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,920
Okay.

55
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Angwei wants to make me and Young Master Lin a couple.

56
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,920
He even wants to leave us to eat.

57
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
He's so greedy.

58
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,920
Shen Shaoguang,

59
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,920
you're walking so slowly.

60
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,920
You're not going to eat.

61
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,920
You're going to eat.

62
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Shen Shaoguang,

63
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
why are you walking so slowly?

64
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,920
You're a traitor.

65
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
I should have this opinion in my life.

66
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,920
Why don't you say anything?

67
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,920
Li Angwei,

68
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
how can you be so stupid?

69
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,920
You just showed it.

70
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Miss,

71
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,920
how's your grandpa's hand?

72
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,920
It's fine.

73
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,920
I've gone to the doctor.

74
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
That's good.

75
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Liu San,

76
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
why don't you ask your grandfather

77
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,920
to come and propose to you?

78
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,920
Hurry up.

79
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
Who's going to open my mouth?

80
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
How did this old man

81
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,920
become the Prime Minister?

82
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,920
The world is a huge

83
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,920
mess.

84
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,920
Angwei.

85
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,920
You...

86
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,920
Dad!

87
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,920
Yangyang.

88
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,920
Yangyang.

89
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,920
I miss you so much.

90
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Yangyang.

91
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,920
It hurts!

92
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,920
It hurts!

93
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,920
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,920
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,920
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,920
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,920
It hurts!

100
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
If you don't come back, I'll leave you!

101
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,920
Yangyang, I'm sorry.

102
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,920
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,920
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,920
Don't cry.

105
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,920
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
Mom.

107
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Dad.

108
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
Miss, why are you like this?

109
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
I...

110
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,920
I don't know how I got back.

111
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Do you know how I spent these days with your mom?

112
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Dad.

113
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,920
You bastard!

114
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,920
I...

115
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
Enough!

116
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
Dad, don't come back so late.

117
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
Don't come back so late.

118
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Be careful.

119
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Miss, thank you.

120
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Do you know how worried I am about you?

122
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,920
Do you know how worried I am about you?

123
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,920
I know.

124
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,920
I'm back.

125
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,920
Okay, okay.

126
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,920
It's okay. I'm back.

127
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,920
I'm leaving.

128
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
Who is it?

129
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
Who is it?

130
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,920
It's so late. Who is it?

131
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
I'll go and see.

132
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,920
Young Master.

133
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Aunt.

134
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,920
It's Young Master.

135
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,920
Uncle.

136
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,920
Young Master.

137
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,920
It's really you.

138
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,920
Lu Yun sent you here?

139
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
I...

140
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,920
I'm so obvious? Young Master saw it too?

141
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
What happened to you?

142
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,920
You're related to Lu Yun.

143
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,920
Tell me.

144
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,920
I...

145
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,920
That day I left home.

146
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,920
I wanted to reach the peak of my life.

147
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,920
To prove my strength.

148
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,920
So I came to a strange city.

149
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,920
Fenglin Town.

150
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920
There I met the first challenge of my life.

151
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
So, although I've been

152
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
going through all the obstacles,

153
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,920
I'm still not there yet.

154
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,920
I'm not there yet.

155
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
I'm just waiting for the chance to get there.

156
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
I'm afraid.

157
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
I'm afraid.

158
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
You're like a human.

159
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,920
You were talking nonsense.

160
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
You were lying.

161
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
You think I don't know you?

162
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
Tell me the truth.

163
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,920
I'm telling the truth.

164
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,920
I'll count to three.

165
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
I'll count to three.

166
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Wait.

167
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
I'm sorry.

168
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,920
I didn't get out of it.

169
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,920
After I lost my job,

170
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
I was wandering on the street.

171
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
I didn't have the face to come back.

172
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
I got a job.

173
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
I went to Yunlai.

174
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
They didn't recognize me.

175
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,920
I don't know why they chose me.

176
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
They asked me to come and mess up our family.

177
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,920
But I really didn't want to do anything.

178
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,920
I didn't do it.

179
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
I was hurt by my father.

180
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,920
I even wrote a letter to you.

181
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,920
But you lied.

182
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
You're a nobody.

183
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
You should go and get some food.

184
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
I'm in a hurry.

185
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,920
Dad, watch out.

186
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
Your hand is injured.

187
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,920
Have you noticed anything unusual in Yunlai?

188
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
Unusual?

189
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
He's a moron.

190
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
He wants to eat all day long.

191
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
I'm responsible for his work.

192
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,920
He's a moron.

193
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,920
Lu Yun's opening of the wine house is a lie.

194
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,920
He was helping King Zhao to transport goods.

195
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
Have you found it?

196
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
If you say so...

197
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Lu Yun does have a lot of goods every day.

198
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
And there are a lot of them.

199
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
And there are a few in each box.

200
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
They are very tight.

201
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
It's not about the ingredients.

202
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,920
If you use the ingredients, it will be ruined.

203
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,920
Oh, and there is something like a pebble in the box.

204
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
Let me show you.

205
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
Look, it's like this.

206
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Is it like this?

207
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,920
Yes, exactly the same.

208
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,920
I came here to ensure the safety of the Juxians.

209
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,920
Is the way they are in Juxians the same as Shao Yin's?

210
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,920
Shao Yin said that the way they are in Juxians is the Juxi.

211
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,920
Shao Yin was talking about the Juxi.

212
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,920
So the Juxi is the Yunlai Juxi?

213
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,920
Shao Yin was talking about King Zhao.

214
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,920
It seems that King Zhao has something to do with the old case of Shao Yin's family.

215
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,920
Is it something that King Zhao did?

216
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,920
Shao Yin, are you going to investigate the Yunlai Juxi?

217
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,920
It's not convenient to have an undercover agent like me in the county.

218
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
Good.

219
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,920
I didn't expect that I, Shen Shao Jie, was hungry for half a lifetime.

220
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,920
Now I have the opportunity to get rid of evil and return to society.

221
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
That's good, right?

222
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,920
Shao Yin, if I really help Shao Yin's family, then the future generations will remember my name.

223
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Yes, yes, Shen family.

224
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
Grandpa, you're so cool.

225
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,920
Please take me to Yunlai tomorrow.

226
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,920
I have to figure out what's in the box.

227
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,920
After the test, Shen Shao Yin will be completely out of the box.

228
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,920
That's it.

229
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,920
That's it?

230
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,920
You don't have any other tasks for me?

231
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,920
Shen Jie Lang, this is not a small matter.

232
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
These are all the prices for today.

233
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
Two years' worth.

234
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,920
You made so many bowls, and I have to wash them all by myself.

235
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,920
Wait and see.

236
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,920
Tonight, I, Shen Jie Lang, will fight with my ancestors to protect the people.

237
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
Brothers, let's get some more energy.

238
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
Okay, okay.

239
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
Come on, come on, bring the chest.

240
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
Okay.

241
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,920
What are you doing?

242
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Come on, give it to me.

243
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
Okay.

244
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,920
One more.

245
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,920
It's so tiring to wash the bowls.

246
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,920
Come out and sunbathe.

247
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,920
Brother, brother, brother.

248
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,920
You're moving, right?

249
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,920
Yes, we're moving.

250
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
Brother, you're giving me the work.

251
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,920
I'm all yours.

252
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,920
Are you serious?

253
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,920
Come on, come on, come on.

254
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,920
You little...

255
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,920
So heavy.

256
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
I...

257
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
I...

258
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,920
Shen Shao Jie.

259
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,920
Come on, come on.

260
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920
Slow down.

261
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Who? Who is Shen Shao Jie?

262
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
The one who promised to fight?

263
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,920
You're so rude.

264
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,920
I'm so rude.

265
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,920
Don't you know?

266
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
You've already shown yourself.

267
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
No, no, no.

268
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
I'm serious, I'm serious.

269
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
I'm serious.

270
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
This is even more serious.

271
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
No, no, no.

272
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
It hurts, it hurts.

273
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
It hurts.

274
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Come on.

275
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,920
Come on.

276
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,920
Shao Ying is so good.

277
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
You invited me to your room.

278
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,920
You should have prepared for this.

279
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,920
Where is Shen Shaojue?

280
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
No, no, no.

281
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920
Be careful.

282
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,920
Be careful.

283
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
Be careful.

284
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,920
Be careful.

285
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,920
No.

286
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,920
Say something.

287
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,920
It's not worth it to kill each other.

288
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,920
Right?

289
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,920
I'm scared.

290
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,920
Then let Shao Yin put down the sword.

291
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,920
And talk to him.

292
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,920
No.

293
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,920
Put down the sword.

294
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,920
Brother, put down the sword.

295
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,920
Say something.

296
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,920
It's ugly.

297
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,920
Calm down.

298
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,920
Put it down.

299
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
I'll change it.

300
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
Right.

301
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,920
Put it down.

302
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,920
Change it or not, then talk.

303
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,920
It's useless to keep it.

304
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
It's useless.

305
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
Brother, brother.

306
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,920
Move the sword away.

307
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,920
Shao Yin's life is more valuable than Shen Shaojue's.

308
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,920
Okay.

309
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,920
But you give up the sword and come here.

310
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Give up the sword?

311
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,140
You will сколько to

312
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,920
Increase , grow , and warehouse.

313
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,340
Loss of things in what you do.

314
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,340
And their own friendship.

315
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,340
Share with them.

316
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,600
Money.

317
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Featuring.

318
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Other.

319
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
What?

320
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,720
Real money.

321
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,720
Why?

322
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,800
Why did you leave here?

323
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
You're gonna be an idiot.

324
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,240
Where are you going?

325
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,720
I'll go to you!

326
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,340
You smell some good.

327
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,680
Get out of my way!

328
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,640
Where are you going?

329
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,880
Get out of my way!

330
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,640
I'm not handsome.

331
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,760
I want you to shoo me out!

332
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,940
I want to talk!

333
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,480
Get out of my way!

334
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,480
Young Master, you have something to say.

335
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,480
Young Master, here.

336
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,480
Hurry.

337
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
It's okay.

338
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,480
Hurry.

339
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,480
Run.

340
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
Young Master.

341
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
Young Master.

342
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,480
Young Master.

343
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,480
It's over.

344
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,480
It's over.

345
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,480
I think we should leave them alone.

346
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,480
There are guards everywhere.

347
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,480
Lu Yun probably won't come after us.

348
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,480
Young Master, they transferred the boxes of the incense sticks.

349
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,480
But I may not let you find them.

350
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,480
We should hurry.

351
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,480
Because the incense sticks are limited.

352
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,480
The incense sticks?

353
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,480
Yes.

354
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
I saw them moving the things.

355
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,480
I was afraid that the bad guys would transfer the evidence.

356
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,480
So I went to the kitchen and stole some spices.

357
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,480
I made them into a sachet.

358
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,480
I put the ashes in the sachet.

359
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,480
And I put water in it.

360
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,480
It's like a self-harm pot.

361
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,480
Are you serious?

362
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
Yes.

363
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,480
I don't need this kind of strength.

364
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,480
I don't need it for nothing.

365
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,480
Come on.

366
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,480
Give it to me.

367
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,480
It's a small thing.

368
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,480
Self-harm pot?

369
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,480
I mean,

370
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,480
when the ashes are added with water,

371
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,480
they can heat up.

372
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
It's like cooking those spices.

373
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
If we follow the smell,

374
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,480
we can find those things.

375
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,480
There are 108 ways to build a self-harm pot in Yongan.

376
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,480
No one is on fire at night.

377
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,480
The smell is strong after the incense sticks are cooked.

378
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
It's easy to find the way.

379
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
Yes.

380
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
Brother Shen, you're really wise.

381
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,480
I'll go find it.

382
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,480
Liu Chang, take Brother Shen back.

383
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,480
I'll go with you.

384
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
You're really...

385
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
You're so kind.

386
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
But...

387
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,480
But...

388
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,480
It's a fish.

389
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,480
Brother Shen, let's go.

390
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
It looks like a fish.

391
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,480
What's that smell?

392
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
Why is it so fragrant?

393
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,480
It's night time.

394
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
Who's cooking?

395
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,480
Yeah, I'm starving.

396
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,480
Let's go eat.

397
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,480
Let's go.

398
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,480
I'm telling you,

399
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,480
I didn't find my own power.

400
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,480
Actually,

401
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,480
I'm a person who can do anything for the heaven.

402
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,480
I'm a good person who can do everything for the heaven.

403
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
Come here!

404
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,480
Dad,

405
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,480
are you telling the truth?

406
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
Of course I'm telling the truth.

407
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
When did I lie to you?

408
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
Young Master.

409
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,480
Tang Jun.

410
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
What's wrong?

411
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,480
I'm sorry.

412
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
I'm sorry.

413
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,480
I'm sorry.

414
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
I'm sorry.

415
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,480
Young Master.

416
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
Tang Jun.

417
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,480
Young Master.

418
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,480
Are you okay?

419
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,480
I'm fine.

420
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
Did my father really help you?

421
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
Thanks to Brother Shen.

422
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
If he didn't use the spices to make the mark,

423
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,480
I wouldn't have found their private warehouse.

424
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
Really.

425
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,480
Really.

426
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
Brother,

427
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,480
you're really good.

428
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,480
You're really good, Shen Gongcai.

429
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,480
You're really good this time.

430
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,480
There's a clear mark on the ancestral tomb.

431
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,480
I told you from the beginning.

432
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,480
I told you I didn't make a contribution.

433
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,480
You don't believe me.

434
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,480
You wronged me.

435
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,480
What's wrong with you?

436
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,480
Dad, I'm sorry.

437
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,480
We shouldn't have said that.

438
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
Dad is a hero.

439
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
My dad is a great hero.

440
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,480
You're right.

441
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,480
Your dad is a hero.

442
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,480
Here comes the hero!

443
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,480
Here he comes!

444
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
Here he comes!

445
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,480
You have to cut it layer by layer.

446
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,480
Shut up.

447
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,480
Or you cut it.

448
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,480
Your hand is broken.

449
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,480
Don't worry, dad.

450
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,480
It's okay.

451
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,480
San.

452
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,480
San.

453
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
Qi.

454
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,480
You're not going to sleep

455
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
after Shen Gongcai came back?

456
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
Let me introduce you.

457
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
This is Yu San.

458
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,480
He's the new chef in our restaurant.

459
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,480
He's great.

460
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
He's the new chef in our restaurant.

461
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
He's the new chef in our restaurant.

462
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
Thank you, San.

463
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,480
San, this is our son.

464
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
He's...

465
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,480
Say it.

466
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,480
Miss.

467
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
San, you said that

468
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,480
when Shen Gongcai came back,

469
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,480
you knew my brother.

470
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,480
I'm not stupid.

471
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
It's late.

472
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
I can't sit in my yard

473
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
and do such a close thing.

474
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,480
I can't sit in my yard

475
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
and do such a close thing.

476
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,480
I can't sit in my yard

477
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,480
and do such a close thing.

478
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,480
Right?

479
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,480
You're smart.

480
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
You're smart.

481
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,480
You're smart.

482
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,480
You can see it.

483
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,480
Okay, you guys continue.

484
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480
I'm going back to rest.

485
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
Okay.

486
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,480
You rest.

487
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,480
Take care.

488
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
I tell you,

489
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,480
this man is so nice.

490
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
He's a nice man.

491
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,480
What's wrong?

492
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,480
Go on.

493
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,480
This man is not right.

494
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
What's wrong with him?

495
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,480
Lu Yun can catch Gongcai on the spot.

496
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
It's possible that

497
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,480
my brother didn't show up.

498
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,480
My brother is stupid.

499
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,480
Lu Yun's rebels are smart.

500
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,480
You're wrong.

501
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,480
What?

502
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
I mean,

503
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
there's a possibility that

504
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
there's a mole in the news.

505
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,480
Wait.

506
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,480
I remember.

507
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
When we discussed

508
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,480
the undercover plan,

509
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,480
did he hear it?

510
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
Yes.

511
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,480
The fish is fresh.

512
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,480
Madam Ah Lang has been busy for half a day.

513
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,480
Have a taste.

514
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
San,

515
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
your fish

516
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
is so delicate.

517
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
Look at the inside.

518
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
It's so smelly.

519
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,480
San,

520
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,480
what did you cook?

521
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,480
Why did you tell me to cook?

522
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,480
Take it away.

523
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,480
It's too smelly.

524
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,480
Young lady,

525
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,480
Yuan,

526
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
have you eaten the fish?

527
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
The fish is light.

528
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,480
It's not fishy.

529
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,480
It's not fishy.

530
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,480
It's not fishy.

531
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
It's not fishy.

532
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,480
Yang Yang,

533
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,480
what does this mean?

534
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,480
It means

535
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,480
if someone betrays,

536
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,480
they'll be beaten up

537
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,480
and cut off by sword.

538
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,480
I'm going.

539
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
I know you like spicy food.

540
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,480
I picked up the grass

541
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,480
from the backyard of Xin Zhang City

542
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,480
This spicy and spicy taro soup.

543
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,480
Try it.

544
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,480
It's a dessert.

545
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,480
You can make it spicy.

546
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
I can do it.

547
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,480
Yusi, you're so enthusiastic.

548
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
I'm not used to it.

549
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,480
My lady.

550
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,480
Don't you like me?

551
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Why do you think so?

552
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Lang and Miss Li are always talking in a fake way.

553
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,480
They're too tired to talk.

554
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,480
My lady, you're tired to talk.

555
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,480
We've taught her not to talk to strangers.

556
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,480
She probably has a crush on you.

557
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,480
I've been a slave for many years.

558
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,480
Only you treat me as a person.

559
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,480
You even invited me to Xiumu for the birthday party.

560
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,480
You always leave me a piece of food.

561
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,480
I'm just a slave.

562
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,480
No one else is as good to me as my mother.

563
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,480
It's the first time I hear you talk about family.

564
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,480
I didn't know where you're from.

565
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,480
I'm from a far away place.

566
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,480
Why don't you go home and have a look?

567
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,480
No need.

568
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
I have someone at home.

569
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,480
I don't want to visit.

570
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,480
Besides, I'm afraid there are not enough people in the store.

571
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,480
I'll go to work.

572
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
Try it.

573
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,480
Someone at home is not a pervert.

574
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
Yu San is a natural cook.

575
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,480
He's a good cook.

576
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,480
Yu San is a natural cook.

577
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,480
He's a good cook.

578
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,480
He's sad to see us leave him.

579
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,480
He's a bad cook.

580
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,480
How can he be a professional?

581
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,480
I judge this matter with a professional chef.

582
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,480
He's been a professional cook for many years.

583
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,480
Who would teach a pervert this?

584
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,480
What's the original saying?

585
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,480
It's not convenient to visit someone at home.

586
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
I'll tell you.

587
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,480
Judging from my professional analysis,

588
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,480
this sentence is definitely wrong.

589
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
Do you think so?

590
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,480
Yes.

591
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,480
If it's about family,

592
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,480
it's not convenient to visit.

593
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,480
Someone at home is weird.

594
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,480
It's like someone is watching over his family.

595
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,480
Is it Zhao Yang's family who forced him to be a pervert?

596
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,480
Grandma and I watched it in the drama.

597
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,480
It's all like this.

598
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
Yes.

599
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
Mrs. Shen, are you looking for me?

600
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,480
Mrs. Shen?

601
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,480
Mrs. Shen?

602
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,480
It's so dark.

603
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,480
Why don't you light the candles?

604
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,480
Happy birthday!

605
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
What's in his hand?

606
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
A knife.

607
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,480
What's in his hand?

608
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,480
A knife.

609
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,480
A knife?

610
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
Oh, no.

611
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,480
He's out of his mind.

612
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,480
He's on the verge of death.

613
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,480
Grandpa, Grandma, Dad, Aunt.

614
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,480
I'm scared.

615
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
Don't be scared.

616
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,480
Ying, close your eyes before you light the candles.

617
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
Close your eyes.

618
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
Don't be afraid.

619
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,480
Yusan, you're so thoughtful.

620
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,480
You guessed that we were going to celebrate your birthday.

621
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
And you prepared a knife to cut the cake.

622
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,480
Oh, my God.

623
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,480
Come on.

624
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,480
Come on, cut the cake.

625
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
Cut the cake.

626
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,480
Come on, cut the cake.

627
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,480
Cut the cake.

628
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
Yes, yes, yes.

629
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,480
Good.

630
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,480
Happy birthday!

631
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,480
Happy birthday!

632
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,480
Happy birthday!

633
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,480
Happy birthday!

634
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,480
Mrs. Shen, do you remember the day you entered the office and celebrated your birthday?

635
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
Isn't it today?

636
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
I saw that your parents weren't around.

637
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,480
And no one helped you.

638
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,480
So we decided to celebrate your birthday.

639
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,480
Yes, yes.

640
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:47,480
Yusan, actually, you're the same age as the Chinese and Chinese.

641
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,480
In our eyes, you're just a child.

642
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,480
A child in our family.

643
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
Yes, yes.

644
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,480
This birthday cake is a habit of our family.

645
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,480
So, Yusan, don't dislike it.

646
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,480
Yes, yes, yes.

647
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,480
Don't dislike it.

648
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,480
Actually, you've already known.

649
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
So, you've been acting so strange lately.

650
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
Right?

651
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
Don't touch me!

652
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,480
Don't touch me!

653
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,480
Don't touch me!

654
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
Don't touch me!

655
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,480
Don't touch me!

656
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
Don't touch me!

657
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,480
Don't touch me!

658
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,480
Don't touch me!

659
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
Don't touch me!

660
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,480
Don't touch me!

661
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
Don't touch me!

662
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
A'Yuan, don't run away.

663
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,480
A'Yuan is just a servant.

664
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,480
You're all masters.

665
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,480
And you're still protecting her like this.

666
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,480
A'Yuan is not a servant, she's a family member.

667
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,480
We tried our best to get her body back.

668
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,480
We just wanted her to be a real person.

669
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,480
That's just a trick you all use to get everyone's heart.

670
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,480
Someone once said she knew me.

671
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,480
But in the end, she still took my body.

672
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,480
I can't see her again.

673
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,480
Grandma!

674
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
Dad!

675
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,480
Si'er, no matter who has cheated you,

676
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,480
we are still the same.

677
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,480
If you've been cheated once, you should pay the price.

678
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,480
And don't suspect anyone you meet.

679
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
Do you understand?

680
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,480
You killed me.

681
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,480
I... I'm just a traitor.

682
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,480
You killed me.

683
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,480
You two are not going to be okay.

684
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
Yusen.

685
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
You were holding this knife just now.

686
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,480
You were holding this knife just now.

687
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,480
I saw it.

688
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,480
You didn't want to hurt us.

689
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,480
It means you have no conscience.

690
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,480
If someone is trying to threaten you,

691
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,480
you should stand with us and fight them.

692
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,480
Instead of killing your young life.

693
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,480
Is it your brother who came to the plan?

694
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,480
Is it Zhao Wang who is threatening you?

695
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,480
Yusen.

696
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
Yusen.

697
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,480
I've been to Yunlai before.

698
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,480
I know what kind of people they are.

699
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,480
It must be hard.

700
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,480
Look.

701
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,480
I'm the son of the Shen family.

702
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,480
You've never heard of my name, right?

703
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,480
This is the first chief of the Juxian family.

704
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,480
Have you heard of this name?

705
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,480
And Young Master.

706
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,480
You're the son of the Shen family.

707
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,480
Have you heard of this name?

708
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
And Young Master.

709
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
Young Master Lin.

710
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,480
He is the great master of Qingtian.

711
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,480
Have you heard of his name?

712
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
Can't he solve the problem behind you?

713
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,480
You will follow us.

714
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,480
It must be better than following them.

715
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,480
I remember you once told me that you were a slave.

716
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,480
But if you believe us,

717
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,480
we will find a way to solve this problem for you.

718
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,480
If money can solve this problem,

719
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,480
how much money will we spend?

720
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,480
If money can't solve this problem,

721
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,480
we will find a way.

722
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,480
Can you believe us?

723
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,480
Can you swear?

724
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
Yes.

725
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,480
Yes.

726
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
Yes.

727
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,480
We swear.

728
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,480
We swear.

729
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,480
I was the one who sent you to the Shen family.

730
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,480
I was afraid that if I didn't go to the house,

731
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,480
they would kill my parents.

732
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,480
I'm sorry.

733
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,480
I'm the spy of the King of Chang.

734
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,480
I don't deserve you to treat me like this.

735
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,480
I'm sorry.

736
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,480
I'm sorry.

737
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,480
My child.

738
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,480
It's okay.

739
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
It's all over.

740
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,480
It's over.

741
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,480
It's okay.

742
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,480
Why are you still standing?

743
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,480
Drink.

744
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,480
You drank the tea.

745
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,480
You can say whatever you want.

746
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,480
Lu Yun transferred all the salt and iron we need to use.

747
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,480
He went to the Shen family?

748
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,480
Yes.

749
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,480
Lin Yan didn't find anything.

750
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,480
But the line of Yunlai is not safe.

751
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,480
But instead of destroying the line of Yunlai,

752
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,480
he should kill Lin Yan.

753
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,480
It's a good thing.

754
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,480
Lin Yan can come to the Shen family for the sake of the Shen family.

755
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,480
I know the Cui family.

756
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Since you can't call the new one,

757
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,480
I'll make the decision for you.

758
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,480
Stop.

759
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,480
Why are you still so impulsive?

760
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
It's easy to do it.

761
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,480
What about the end?

762
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,480
Yong'an, Jinzhong, Sanping, Yaoyuan.

763
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,480
You can kill me if you want.

764
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,480
In the end,

765
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,480
I misjudged Lin Yan.

766
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,480
I thought he was already fond of the past.

767
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,480
As long as he can live,

768
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,480
he can have his own plan.

769
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,480
It's because you put your remorse on him

770
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,480
and insisted on keeping him.

771
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,480
That's why you became the demon today.

772
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,480
Shut up.

773
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,480
I was too worried.

774
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,480
That's why I made a mistake.

775
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,480
I was too worried.

776
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,480
That's why I made a mistake.

777
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,480
Please forgive me.

778
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,480
I'm telling you,

779
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,480
killing people is not necessary.

780
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,480
He's too close to the saint.

781
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,480
He can only fall.

782
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,480
He can only fall to a position where he can't speak.

783
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,480
Then you can take the wrong step.

784
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,480
You should be more careful.

785
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
You should think more.

786
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Yes.

787
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,480
Yes.

788
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,480
I'm afraid you didn't expect it.

789
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,480
One day,

790
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,480
the old news is about you.

791
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,480
Your Majesty,

792
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,480
the people of the West, Feng Li,

793
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,480
have reported to the young master of Jingzhao Mansion, Lin Yan,

794
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,480
and the deputy of the Ministry of Justice, Cao Rong,

795
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,480
for breaking the law and defying the judge.

796
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,480
Feng Li would rather report to the court

797
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,480
and be punished

798
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,480
than be punished.

799
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,480
What do you mean by this?

800
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
Your Majesty,

801
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,480
last year Feng Li and the deputy of the Ministry of Justice,

802
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,480
Shen Jia, were killed.

803
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
Shen Jia and I were relatives.

804
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,480
So I heard that they were killed after 6 o'clock.

805
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,480
The Ministry of Justice decided to

806
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,480
cooperate with Deputy Cao.

807
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,480
Your Majesty,

808
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,480
this case is a case of human evidence and material evidence.

809
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,480
It's a case of a complete violation of the law.

810
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,480
That's why Feng Li was punished

811
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,480
and escaped from the punishment.

812
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,480
Since Feng Li escaped back to Yongan,

813
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,480
and was in contact with the royal secretary,

814
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,480
why didn't you send the drug-release criminal to the government office

815
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,480
and let him report to the young master of Jingzhao Mansion?

816
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,480
What's your intention?

817
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,480
If it wasn't for Lin Shao Yin

818
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,480
who chose the case between the businessmen of the West,

819
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,480
how could he have escaped from the law

820
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,480
and come to your Ministry of Justice?

821
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,480
Is it because the case is just a personal case

822
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,480
that Lin Shao Yin is suspected of corruption?

823
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,480
The West is a big country.

824
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,480
How can a big crime be a small case?

825
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,480
Before that, it was all managed by the city council.

826
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,480
The West was a mess.

827
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,480
After the case was sentenced,

828
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,480
the businessmen were more regular.

829
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,480
Jingzhao Mansion has been in the business for more than a century.

830
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,480
It's a great prestige.

831
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,480
I also heard that the Shangyuan Festival is not over yet.

832
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,480
Jingzhao Mansion ordered people to play the zither everywhere.

833
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,480
They encouraged the people to play the zither.

834
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,480
The people of Jingzhao Mansion only believe in Jingzhao Mansion.

835
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,480
I'm afraid that in their eyes,

836
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,480
even the most talented people

837
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,480
can't compare to Lin Shao Yin.

838
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,480
The West is a big country.

839
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,480
How can a big crime be a small case?

840
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,480
Before that, it was all managed by the city council.

841
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,480
The West is a big country.

842
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,480
How can a big crime be a small case?

843
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,480
Before that, it was all managed by the city council.

844
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,480
The people of Jingzhao Mansion only believe in Jingzhao Mansion.

845
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,480
They encouraged the people to play the zither everywhere.

846
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,480
The people of Jingzhao Mansion only believe in Jingzhao Mansion.

847
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,480
The people of Jingzhao Mansion only believe in Jingzhao Mansion.

848
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,480
The people of Jingzhao Mansion only believe in Jingzhao Mansion.

849
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,480
The people of Jingzhao Mansion only believe in Jingzhao Mansion.

850
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,480
The people of Jingzhao Mansion only believe in Jingzhao Mansion.

851
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,480
The people of Jingzhao Mansion only believe in Jingzhao Mansion.

852
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,480
The people of Jingzhao Mansion only believe in Jingzhao Mansion.

853
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,480
The people of Jingzhao Mansion only believe in Jingzhao Mansion.

854
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,480
The End
