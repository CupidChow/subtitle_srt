00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,990
=Yummy Yummy Yummy=

2
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,940
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,310
But so many years have passed.

4
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,310
Your appearance has changed greatly.

5
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,510
How did this family

6
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,680
recognize you?

7
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,450
For the next few days,

8
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,680
keep a close eye on them.

9
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,980
I'll also find an opportunity

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,230
to probe their background.

11
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,900
To let our ancestor's guard down,

12
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,910
and then find a way home

13
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,910
from Yunshui Manor,

14
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,430
our whole family will pretend to be

15
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,190
poor relatives who have climbed up

16
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,810
to the new nobility.

17
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,790
Round 1.

18
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,190
Jicai, Jicai.

19
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,870
Jicai, come with me over there.

20
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,710
There's a restroom.

21
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,740
The privy.

22
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,120
I've never seen such a nice privy

23
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,870
in my whole life.

24
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,030
Are you crazy, Shen Gongcai?

25
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,770
You want me to go see a privy
with you now?

26
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,830
It'll surely impress you.

27
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,870
- I won't go.
- Come here.

28
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,640
Look. As I told you, it's beautiful.

29
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,280
You must've never seen anything like it.

30
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
(Privy)
Come on, look.

31
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,800
- Right here.
- So clean?

32
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,030
The toilet paper is even scented.

33
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,500
Exactly.

34
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,870
Look at the bottom of the toilet.

35
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,430
It's lined with a layer of fine powder.

36
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,900
The attention to detail here.

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,000
It won't splash.

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
Feel it, feel it.

39
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,870
Join me.

40
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,740
This is better than modern facilities.

41
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,610
I'm sure I can sit here
without getting numb

42
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,720
in my legs.

43
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,360
They've never even used a good toilet.

44
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,590
- This courtyard is huge.
- Round 2.

45
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,030
How much must this have cost?

46
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,630
As expected of the Vice Prefect.

47
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,470
Yes.

48
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,120
There's even a waterside pavilion.

49
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,530
This is much better than our house

50
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,270
in the countryside.

51
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,190
Yes, yes.

52
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,870
Great.

53
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,320
We've been pretending to be poor

54
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,530
for three rounds now.

55
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,910
My legs are sore.

56
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,560
You just need more exercise.

57
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,680
Shall we put on a show
of being a close-knit family?

58
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,310
Just like this.

59
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,360
Enough.

60
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,840
Why push me?

61
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,520
Be quiet. They are watching.

62
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,120
We want them to see.

63
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,560
We just want them to see.

64
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,520
Look at you.

65
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,400
Be gentle; it hurts.

66
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,160
Round 3.

67
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,170
Dad,

68
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,870
Auntie said this tooth powder

69
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,520
has ginger and astragalus in it.

70
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,870
It's for protecting the teeth.

71
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,150
It's true.

72
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,680
Yangyang, the bristles of the toothbrush

73
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,890
seem to be made of horsehair.

74
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,380
Didn't that performer at the inn say

75
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,010
that only instruments use horsehair?

76
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,310
It's all because we were

77
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,270
too poor before.

78
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,030
With this, I can eat
as much candy as I want.

79
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,290
I'm going to brush three times.

80
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,590
That's too unambitious.

81
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,680
At least five times.

82
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,200
Thank you.

83
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,220
The Vice Prefect is here.

84
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,640
Get up.

85
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,960
- Vice Prefect.
- Vice Prefect.

86
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,270
We've been here for a while.

87
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,240
Isn't the chef here slow?

88
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,240
The main dishes
still haven't been served.

89
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,260
They've all been served.

90
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,110
Here's the thing.

91
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,430
Our young master

92
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,070
never likes to fuss over food.

93
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,360
If you're not used to it,

94
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,440
you can

95
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,560
leave on your own.

96
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,080
- No.
- Liu Chang.

97
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,230
Be polite.

98
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,820
Yes, yes.

99
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,510
Actually, we're indeed disturbing you.

100
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,750
- It's fine.
- Yes.

101
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,800
The guest follows the host's lead.

102
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,670
The guest follows the host's lead?

103
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,560
Uncle, you're really easygoing.

104
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,560
For example,

105
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,600
I haven't greeted you today.

106
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,800
Usually, elders

107
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,920
would've sent someone to ask.

108
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,630
No, no.

109
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,510
Greet?

110
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,310
I'll make up for my lack of manners now.

111
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,070
Greetings, Uncle, Auntie.

112
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,160
I respectfully invite you

113
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,350
to have a meal.

114
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,000
- Don't.
- Don't do this.

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,840
Vice Prefect, don't.

116
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,870
Don't, don't.

117
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,630
Not again.

118
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,590
Vice Prefect,

119
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,120
you can't do this.

120
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,040
It's not appropriate.

121
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,200
Uncle, Auntie, this is inappropriate.

122
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,510
No, it's okay.

123
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,070
No, Vice Prefect.

124
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,190
We must do this;

125
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,350
otherwise,

126
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,070
we'd be losing years of life.

127
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,190
Yes, yes.

128
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,270
It's not appropriate.

129
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,000
Uncle, Auntie, what are you thinking?

130
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,310
How can you bow

131
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,070
to a junior like me?

132
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:16,800
Well...

133
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,800
Please understand.

134
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,870
My parents can't bear

135
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,510
a dignified Vice Prefect

136
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,870
bowing to them.

137
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,430
We're all commoners,

138
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,800
living here for free.

139
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,680
How could we possibly accept your bow?

140
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,910
- Yes.
- That's right.

141
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,090
If anyone should bow,

142
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,510
it should be us bowing to you.

143
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,390
Yes.

144
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,120
We're at home.

145
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,800
I'm just a junior,

146
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,790
not the Vice Prefect.

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,190
There's no need to be so formal with me.

148
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,830
Vice Prefect, that'll be great.

149
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,960
From now on,

150
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,590
let's not worry about these formalities.

151
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,830
Let's eat.

152
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,710
Eat.

153
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,600
Vice Prefect, sit.

154
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,390
Have a seat, Vice Prefect.

155
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,750
Vice Prefect, don't mind us.

156
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,190
We're used to being casual
in the countryside.

157
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,000
We're not very proper when we eat.

158
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,800
Yes, yes.

159
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
After we were engaged,

160
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,190
it seems there was no contact.

161
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,600
(Probing us again.)

162
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,950
(Grandpa didn't tell me)

163
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,190
(everything about the Cuis.)

164
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,430
(Our ancestor doesn't have
much of an accent.)

165
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,690
(He must've come to Yong'an)

166
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,250
(when he was very young.)

167
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,270
Your family later moved to the Capital.

168
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,630
Naturally,
your contact with us decreased.

169
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,510
Lady Shen, do you know

170
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,800
what happened to my family

171
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,950
after they moved to the Capital?

172
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,750
We knew we were humble

173
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,920
and not a match for your family.

174
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,600
We thought that in a few years,

175
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,040
the engagement would be called off,

176
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,430
so we didn't want to disturb.

177
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,770
Later,

178
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,120
we heard that your family had trouble,

179
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,390
but we didn't dare to ask for details.

180
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,550
If not for the current difficulties,

181
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,870
we wouldn't have come to trouble you.

182
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,350
So,

183
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,550
after my family moved here,

184
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,120
you lost contact with them,

185
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,390
and you knew nothing about them?

186
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,670
Yes, yes.

187
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,030
Now that I've changed my name,

188
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,200
how did you all

189
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,510
find me?

190
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,750
Have you forgotten?

191
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,440
That day,

192
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,740
when you took office
and inspected Juxian Alley,

193
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,870
we happened to be selling pancakes,

194
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,410
and we recognized you.

195
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Yes, yes.

196
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,620
So many years apart didn't change

197
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,420
the fact that we're in-laws.

198
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,380
I took a look and knew
you were my future son-in-law.

199
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,780
Yes, yes.

200
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,380
I also recognized you.

201
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,020
I was too excited.

202
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,260
I lost my composure.

203
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,700
I have to go to court.

204
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,180
Take your time.

205
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,280
Vice Prefect, goodbye.

206
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,220
Goodbye, Vice Prefect.

207
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,420
Dad, why haven't you stood up?

208
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,220
My legs are numb.

209
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,660
I can't move.

210
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,060
(Clear and Bright)

211
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,780
(Ancestor's Room)

212
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,140
(Mom, Dad, Yangyang)

213
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,100
Everyone, well done.

214
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,380
You got up early,

215
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,860
pretending to be inexperienced,

216
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,780
wandering around,

217
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,380
but actually surveying

218
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,560
the terrain of Yunshui Manor.

219
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,940
The covert operation was

220
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,940
very successful.

221
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,460
I really think that privy is nice.

222
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,700
We need to maintain
a style of bold analysis

223
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,220
and careful verification,

224
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,030
trying to find a way
back to the modern era

225
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,900
(Water Pavilion)
in Yunshui Manor.

226
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,740
Well said.

227
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,820
Next,

228
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,420
I'll also give a constructive speech.

229
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,820
To get to the bottom

230
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,860
of the truth,

231
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,700
we need first to review

232
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,460
what happened on the day we came here.

233
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,980
According to Jicai,

234
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,980
she was chasing a guy

235
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,500
and walked into this corridor.

236
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,920
After going through the corridor,

237
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,540
(Back Door)
she came to the back door,

238
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,420
opened the back door,

239
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,660
and came to this era.

240
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,780
If we go back the same way,

241
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,820
could we

242
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,980
go back?

243
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,300
- That makes sense.
- That makes sense.

244
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,100
Help!

245
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,700
(Langhuan Chamber, Back Door)

246
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,940
(Back Door)

247
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,580
The place we were together

248
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,460
before we came to this era was

249
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,660
the ancestral hall.

250
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,240
So, should we go back there?

251
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,740
We've been there.

252
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,260
The ancestral hall

253
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,900
(Langhuan Chamber)
is now this small study.

254
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,420
Your dad and I

255
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,980
have been around this area this morning.

256
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,060
This place

257
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,460
is well guarded.

258
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,700
It's not easy

259
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,780
to get in.

260
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,180
So, what do we do now?

261
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,140
Why is no one speaking?

262
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,580
Shen Jianshe, what's your name for?

263
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,020
It's to give a constructive speech.

264
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,940
I think

265
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,860
since the ancestral hall

266
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,940
is guarded,

267
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,820
if we all go there,

268
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,020
it's easy to be discovered.

269
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,100
If we could

270
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
send just one person,

271
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,780
the target would be smaller,

272
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,940
and we could likely break
through the blockade.

273
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,140
What do you mean?

274
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,500
Me?

275
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,100
No, no, no.

276
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,220
I can't, I can't.

277
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,380
I can't.

278
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,620
I won't go.

279
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,140
For fairness, how about we vote?

280
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,420
Let's vote.

281
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,380
- Okay.
- Okay.

282
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,460
Mom, they're playing tricks.

283
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,600
They're bribing and cheating.

284
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,580
Raise your hands to vote
for Shen Shaoguang.

285
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,420
Yangyang.

286
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,500
Look, three votes are for you.

287
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,780
It's me again?

288
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,820
Mom...

289
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,980
Jicai,

290
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,460
it has to be you.

291
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,660
In our family, you're the smartest

292
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,900
and the most quick-witted.

293
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,380
Look at your dad and your brother.

294
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,740
Who can you rely on?

295
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,180
- I...
- Right?

296
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,740
Jicai.

297
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,020
Fine.

298
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,020
Leave.

299
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,060
- Yes.
- Yes.

300
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,780
Oh, no, Young Master,

301
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,700
I just thought of something.

302
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,620
The Shens

303
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,180
recognized you by your appearance.

304
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,940
Doesn't that mean someone else

305
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,420
at the court might notice too?

306
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,100
After so long in the Capital,

307
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,460
you finally thought of that.

308
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,460
Don't worry about that.

309
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,820
Since I'm back,

310
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,840
I never intended
to hide my identity forever.

311
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,160
I found in the documents

312
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,640
that this secret code is the numbers
used by Huoxun Kingdom,

313
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,580
which correspond

314
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,580
to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

315
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,340
These are numbers?

316
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,840
These are notches.

317
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,380
If we match the correct numbers

318
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,800
to the notches, the lock will open.

319
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,100
Nine numbers.

320
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,020
Eight holes.

321
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,020
Altogether,

322
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,840
tens of millions of possibilities.

323
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,060
Tens of millions of possibilities?

324
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,460
That means it's impossible
to figure it out, right?

325
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,460
Young Master, this is too...

326
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,300
Quiet.

327
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,140
Young Master,

328
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,300
how about I do it?

329
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,460
Even if I don't eat
or drink in this life,

330
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,180
don't get married or have children,

331
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,720
I will try all these possibilities

332
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,160
to repay you.

333
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,060
Quiet.

334
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,340
I remember now.

335
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,740
Your father once taught you

336
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,900
how to open a lock by sound.

337
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,580
I can have a daughter then.

338
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,480
I think what I need to learn
is how to make a silencing potion.

339
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,100
One, two, three.

340
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,060
Four.

341
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,020
Five.

342
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,740
Two, two.

343
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,700
Three, four.

344
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,660
Five.

345
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,500
There's no one here.

346
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,980
So lucky.

347
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,020
Even the guards have left their posts?

348
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,980
Someone's coming.

349
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,100
The portrait of the ancestors

350
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,580
used to be in here.

351
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,580
(No wonder dramas
are always shot this way.)

352
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,900
(So, ancient mechanisms
are really like this.)

353
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,700
(No Visitors Allowed)

354
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,900
(Private Area, Do Not Enter)

355
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,940
(This lock is...)

356
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,500
(It's here.)

357
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,740
(Could it be that the time-space tunnel)

358
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,900
(that can send us back is inside?)

359
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,220
Eight, eight, eight.

360
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,900
Eight.

361
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,860
Eight, eight, eight.

362
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,860
Eight, eight.

363
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,980
Eight.

364
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,660
She opened the lock

365
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,300
so easily?

366
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,100
(Why haven't I gone back?)

367
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,340
(But this is exactly the lock.)

368
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,460
(It came with us.)

369
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,180
(I should be right.)

370
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,860
(This house)

371
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,700
(is the time-space tunnel connecting)

372
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,800
(the past and the future.)

373
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,340
(We can definitely go home
through here.)

374
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,220
Vice Prefect.

375
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,100
What are you doing?

376
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,820
I...

377
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,260
I accidentally got lost,

378
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,100
accidentally walked into the study,

379
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,220
accidentally came to this room,

380
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,700
accidentally opened the lock,

381
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,460
and came in.

382
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,340
Accidentally?

383
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,620
This lock has numbers
from Huoxun Kingdom.

384
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,980
Ordinary people
don't recognize them at all.

385
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,660
Yet you opened it.

386
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,140
How could you have done it accidentally?

387
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,140
I don't know the Huoxun Kingdom

388
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,140
you're talking about,

389
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,420
but I do recognize these numbers.

390
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,100
We used to be in business,

391
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,180
running a diner.

392
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,020
We don't know much,

393
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,940
but we're familiar with numbers. Look.

394
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,700
Eight, eight, eight, eight,
eight, eight, eight, eight.

395
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,780
It implies great wealth.

396
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,900
It means prosperity and making money.

397
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,460
That's too easy to guess

398
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,520
for people in business.

399
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,220
(Tai Xuan Jing)

400
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,820
Young Master,

401
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,340
she just got away...?

402
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,180
She won't.

403
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,800
Without the cooperation of many parties,

404
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,900
it would've been impossible

405
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,580
to frame my father without any flaws.

406
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,100
My family was exterminated.

407
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,580
How could the Shens,
related to us by engagement,

408
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,260
have been spared?

409
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,100
Could it be

410
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,300
that they were just impostors all along?

411
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,860
And you were engaged

412
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,100
to someone else?

413
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,420
Or perhaps

414
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,300
she's indeed my fiancée,

415
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,740
but they sought protection

416
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,420
and pledged allegiance to someone.

417
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,300
They're likely spies.

418
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,180
That would explain

419
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,780
why this woman knows

420
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,940
Huoxun Kingdom's numbers.

421
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,980
I don't even know them.

422
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,020
They might have been trained
in the Western Regions.

423
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,320
What should we do next?

424
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,580
Should we bring them back

425
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,600
and torture them for info?

426
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,020
The lock on the Langhuan Chamber door

427
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,560
is confirmed to be the same lock
as the one from the back door

428
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,600
of Yunshui Manor
when we came to this era.

429
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,100
Good.

430
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,780
That's settled then.

431
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,660
Since modern items have appeared,

432
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,460
Yunshui Manor must definitely be

433
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,340
a time-space tunnel.

434
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,180
Absolutely.

435
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,580
But now, Vice Prefect Lin

436
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,620
is already suspicious of us.

437
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,740
I think this is a bit troublesome.

438
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,460
But he's an official.

439
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,340
He probably can't

440
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,420
lay a hand on us directly.

441
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,900
We still have some time.

442
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:23,900
That makes sense.

443
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,900
Before our ancestor reacts,

444
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,900
let's make a quick getaway.

445
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,460
I think we should do this:

446
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,740
Let's recall the details

447
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,860
of that day again.

448
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,420
What else happened

449
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,660
when we went to Yunshui Manor?

450
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,380
For example, what we touched

451
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,220
and what we said.

452
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,140
We can't overlook any detail.

453
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,300
Maybe

454
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,740
if we recreate

455
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,840
the situation of that day,

456
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,420
it might work.

457
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,540
Grandma,

458
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,520
when I time-traveled,

459
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,460
I didn't do my homework.

460
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,340
Does that mean
if I never do my homework,

461
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,380
I can time-travel back?

462
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,820
You...

463
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,100
You just don't want to do your homework,

464
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,940
right?

465
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,940
Liu Chang.

466
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,420
In the spring of Tianxing Year 22,

467
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,900
I met Fifth Master Xiao.

468
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,180
He always carried
writing paper with him,

469
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,220
and I followed his example
and wrote this note.

470
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,540
This is Father's note.

471
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,140
Right, Gongcai.

472
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,300
When you time-traveled that day,

473
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,980
I remember
you were wearing thong sandals,

474
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,680
and you hadn't cut your toenails.

475
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,620
But when you tried
to time-travel that day,

476
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,980
you weren't wearing thong sandals,

477
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,700
and you still hadn't cut your toenails.

478
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,800
Come on, Dad.

479
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,340
Does that have anything to do with it?

480
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,540
Thong sandals, toenails?

481
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,060
Do they have that much energy

482
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,300
to affect time-travel?

483
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,300
I'll think about it again.

484
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,340
I'll look for reasons

485
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,420
from myself.

486
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,340
What are you doing?

487
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,220
I remember.

488
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,940
Weren't we in the ancestral hall
at that time?

489
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,700
Didn't we all worship

490
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,920
the portrait of our ancestors,

491
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,180
hoping for their blessings?

492
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,060
Yes, yes.

493
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,220
Maybe this time,

494
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,380
if we worship

495
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,780
the real person,

496
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,380
we can go back.

497
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,100
Wait.

498
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,980
I think he has a point.

499
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,220
If we can

500
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,260
worship the real person

501
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,460
and make this event

502
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,540
more grand and solemn,

503
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,020
we will definitely be able

504
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,740
to time-travel back.

505
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,860
That makes sense.

506
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,660
In Tianxing Year 23,

507
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,580
Che

508
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,620
grew a bit taller.

509
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,140
Tianxing Year 26...

510
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,320
It was the year Father was framed.

511
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,200
(How could he become
the Vice Minister of War?)

512
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,660
He discovered on March 26

513
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,460
that someone
was selling official positions,

514
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,640
and their hands had even reached
the Ministry of War.

515
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,120
Father found out that someone

516
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,220
was manipulating the appointments,

517
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,720
which is why he sent Mother and me

518
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,720
back to our hometown in Qingyang in May.

519
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,540
He sensed

520
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,380
that something would happen to him,

521
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,780
thinking that he could protect
the family this way.

522
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,620
But the mastermind behind it all

523
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,940
pinned everything on him.

524
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,740
Father

525
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,300
died in prison,

526
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,980
my family was exterminated,

527
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,220
and our property was confiscated.

528
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,660
This note is useless,

529
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,100
even if it's presented in court.

530
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,340
To overturn the case,

531
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,540
we must find more evidence.

532
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,300
(It seems we haven't gone back.)

533
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:32,860
(What's going on?)

534
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,500
(Did we go back?)

535
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,380
(I don't know.)

536
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,700
Jicai.

537
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,840
- Do you think...?
- What are you doing?

538
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,380
Don't be afraid.

539
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,540
Don't be afraid, Yangyang.

540
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,060
Lady Shen, please.

541
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,380
Vice Prefect.

542
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
What happened last night
was a misunderstanding.

543
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,220
I can explain.

544
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,060
Last night,

545
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,180
your whole family sneaked into my room,

546
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,900
intending to harm me.

547
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,860
No, absolutely not.

548
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,740
You've misunderstood.

549
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,580
Misunderstood?

550
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,580
We sneaked into your room

551
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,220
to pray for your blessings.

552
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,900
Pray?

553
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,500
Our grandfather once told us a method:

554
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,900
If we wash our hands, burn incense,

555
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,940
offer holy items,

556
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,060
scatter flower petals,

557
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,060
and bow three times to the person

558
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,140
we deeply admire,

559
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,660
we can pray for their blessings.

560
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,100
We've been living
at your house for free,

561
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,460
and we feel really bad about it,

562
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,420
so we held this ceremony

563
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,780
to pray

564
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,700
for your good fortune and long life.

565
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,100
Actually,

566
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:58,940
Lady Shen,

567
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,220
you are not the lady

568
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,540
who was engaged to me,

569
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,100
are you?

570
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,620
That secret code lock

571
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,780
can't be solved

572
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,140
just by guessing.

573
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,220
How could you know

574
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,180
what the code is?

575
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,260
Why don't you be more honest?

576
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,220
What are you really after?

577
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,380
Tell me.

578
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,940
Maybe I can help you.

579
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,500
Do you have to bully me like this?

580
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,660
I...

581
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,260
In the old days in Qingyang,

582
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,900
you used to be so upright

583
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,140
and righteous.

584
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,300
We think you'd never turn a blind eye
to friends in trouble.

585
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,220
I know it's not easy for you,

586
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,500
and we can't help you,

587
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:12,660
but we still hope for a bit of kindness.

588
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,380
Yet you want to deny my identity

589
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,420
and completely shirk responsibility.

590
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,660
We just don't deserve it.

591
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,420
We will leave on our own.

592
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,380
I...

593
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,940
I...

594
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,900
I didn't mean that.

595
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,420
You...

596
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,860
Please don't cry.

597
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,380
(It seems shedding tears on the spot)

598
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,580
(is also useful in ancient times.)

599
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,820
If you want me to leave,

600
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,380
I will definitely leave with my family.

601
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,420
Just say the word.

602
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,660
I didn't mean it that way.

603
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,060
It's just

604
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,700
that I don't quite remember how it was

605
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,100
with your family when I was a child,

606
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,220
so I need to confirm with you.

607
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,940
I understand.

608
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,140
You've been through a lot.

609
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,140
It's hard to trust others.

610
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,300
It's okay.

611
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,340
If you have any questions,

612
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,300
just ask us.

613
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,100
Time will tell.

614
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,540
You'll eventually know

615
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,620
what kind of people we are.

616
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,260
I...

617
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,140
What are you going to say?

618
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,980
You have a question so soon?

619
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,260
I was wondering

620
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,180
if you'd like

621
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,540
to have some tea.
