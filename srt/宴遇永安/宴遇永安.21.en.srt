Chapter 15

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's really big.

3
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's pretty big.

4
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's really pretty.

5
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Pretty.

6
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It is.

7
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Where is the big house?

8
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Shen Gongshan!

9
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Shen Gongshan!

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Where is the big house?

11
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No, no, no.

12
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Come here!

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You prepared a trap for me, right?

14
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He said it clearly. There is a house here.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't know what's going on.

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Do you have the right to see it?

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The window was repaired by the wind.

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Why don't you let me see it?

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You gave him the money without seeing it?

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He said that his family had eight old women and eight children.

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
His family didn't care about anything.

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The whole family only cared about him.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If they didn't take the money back that day,

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
they wouldn't have food to eat at night.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You can be fooled by this kind of fraud.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Are you stupid?

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Are you stupid?

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I tell you, you really have to learn from me.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
If you can be half as reliable as me,

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
don't compare with me.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You are not as smart as this donkey.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I am here.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I have nothing.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What is this?

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You are going to piss me off.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You hit me again.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What?

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Report! Report!

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Hurry up and catch Du Da Niang.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No, no, no.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He played with us hundreds of years ago.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Let's go.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Wait.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Wait, I'll go get the money back.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Don't report.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Go, report.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll just get the money back.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay?

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Young Master,

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
someone reported a lady named Du's maid.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
She said she was fooled by her house rent.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Maids are fooled.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
First, you have to catch her to make sure you get the money back.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But the servants came back and said

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
the one who was fooled was from the Shen Family.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
They know about the relationship between the Young Master and the family.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So they came to ask if there were any other instructions.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The Shen Family?

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I found a few maids

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
who were renting the house.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
They were unwilling to tell us where Du Da Niang was.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Fortunately, our family

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
was familiar with the Pingzhen House.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We asked them to let one of the maids

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
open the door and find out where Du Da Niang lived.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's great.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes.

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
She can run away from the monks and the temple.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
As long as we know where she lives,

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
we should be able to find her soon.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Young Master, thank you.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The servants were not fooled.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We thought they were too busy with the case.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If that's the case,

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
we can get the money back.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Don't worry.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I think we can get the money back.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We can get the money back.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
There's no need to pursue it.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You must punish the bad guys.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes, we must.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yaoyao.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We'll be back.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Mr. Cheng.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Why are you here?

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't mention it.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We were fooled by a monk.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Luckily, Mr. Liu found us a place to stay.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Here it is.

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So he brought us here.

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What's going on?

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I know you were fooled.

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The case went to the Palace of the Holy See.

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The servants were arrested.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
They were sent to the Palace of the Holy See.

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
They were caught?

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's great.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Young Master.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Why is Shen Jiaren here?

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Shen Jiaren found Du's residence.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So she brought us here.

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Young Master.

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't stand on ceremony.

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This is the servant who cheated you.

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He's been here for a long time.

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He's been looking for someone

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
who's been out of touch for a long time.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He got the person without any effort.

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Mr. Shen.

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Mom.

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Mom.

115
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This...

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Why is it so similar?

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's just that it looks like him.

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But why is it exactly the same as mom's?

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I don't know.

120
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But it's really not him. I've already confirmed it.

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So...

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You were fooled because

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
he looks like mom.

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Young Master.

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Please.

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Please punish this stupid person.

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
She's just a weak woman.

128
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
She has no other means of survival.

129
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
She's the only one who can raise the whole family.

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I believe

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
she can't be taken in.

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's why she's doing this.

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Mr. Shen, you seem to be mistaken.

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The estate business of the Du family

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
is the biggest in Quan Yongan.

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The Du family is the biggest in Quan Yongan.

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The Du family is the biggest in Quan Yongan.

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The Du family is the biggest in Quan Yongan.

139
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He bought the house back

140
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and earned a lot of money from it.

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Now,

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
there are dozens of servants in the family.

143
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's also a big house with three entrances and three exits.

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's also a big house with three entrances and three exits.

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What did I say?

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I guessed it was like this.

147
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I guessed it was a liar.

148
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I guessed it was like this a long time ago.

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
No, how much did you lie to me?

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Mr. Shen.

151
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I didn't mean to.

152
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But you looked so easy to deceive that day.

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's like I'm not lying to you.

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I feel so guilty.

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Shen.

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The past is not true.

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Although it's evil, it's not illegal.

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But this time,

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
the criminal case is under the law.

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It should be punished.

161
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay.

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Mr. Shen, this is the money you gave me that day.

163
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll pay you back.

164
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Mr. Shen, please understand me.

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Mr. Shen, please.

167
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Mr. Shen, please.

168
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Mr. Shen.

169
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Xiaomei, have you thought it over?

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Can't you think about it?

171
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You said we were together

172
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
from high school to college.

173
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You know me.

174
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm a little lazy sometimes.

175
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But I'll change. I'll definitely change.

176
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I can change.

177
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Besides, I'm not necessarily worse than that guy.

178
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Think about it.

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay.

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'll send it here.

181
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You're here.

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Wait a minute.

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Young Master,

184
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I really have to go.

185
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Today should be

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
the last time we meet.

187
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
From now on,

188
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
please take good care of Yangyang.

189
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay.

190
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Are you okay?

191
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm fine.

192
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm fine.

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

194
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I was thinking on my way here.

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I said, Brother, you're not better than me.

196
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm trying.

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I have to fight for it.

198
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I came here

199
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and I understood it all at once.

200
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's right that you don't want me.

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's normal.

202
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Are you really okay?

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm fine.

204
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You ask Brother.

205
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You want Brother to raise you and me, right?

206
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I don't care.

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I have a big house.

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You don't have to take me in.

209
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You're still the same as before.

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Okay, I'm leaving.

211
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'll get you something.

212
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'll send it to you.

213
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Then... you should go.

214
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm going.

215
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Let's go.

216
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's just that I...

217
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Shen Luo...

218
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I...

219
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I...

220
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I...

221
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Forgive him.

222
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Why can't

223
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I...

224
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I can make a mother who looks like her

225
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
go to jail.

226
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I...

227
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Since

228
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yangyang said so,

229
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
let's forget it.

230
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Right.

231
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Young Master, let's forget it.

232
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I...

233
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Father, I know

234
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
you just can't bear to

235
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
hurt someone who looks like her.

236
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I won't be angry with you.

237
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And

238
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
it's normal

239
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
that you mess things up.

240
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's okay.

241
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yangyang, do you think

242
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm embarrassing you?

243
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I mess things up

244
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
every time.

245
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You feel embarrassed, right?

246
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Father,

247
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm used to it.

248
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm a grown-up.

249
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm grown up.

250
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I know

251
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
what kind of person I am.

252
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I just want to be a kind

253
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and kind father.

254
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I know

255
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
that my father

256
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
won't be a hero.

257
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So,

258
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
you don't have to work so hard.

259
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's okay to

260
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
ignore others.

261
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I know.

262
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Father.

263
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Get up.

264
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Get up.

265
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Thank you, Young Master.

266
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Thank you.

267
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Young Master,

268
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
thank you for

269
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
helping me.

270
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You're welcome.

271
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
We wanted to move out,

272
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
but we've caused you trouble again.

273
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's late.

274
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If we can't find the new house,

275
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
we can go back to Yunshui Garden.

276
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'll send someone to pick you up.

277
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Don't worry.

278
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
We'll just go back to the shop today.

279
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yes.

280
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
We'll move out

281
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
as soon as we find the new house.

282
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
We'll move out.

283
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'll ask Cheng Hu to send you back.

284
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Don't bother.

285
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
My carriage is waiting for us.

286
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yes.

287
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Just ask Mr. Liu to send us back.

288
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
We'll go now.

289
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Thank you.

290
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Let's go.

291
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Please

292
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
send them back safely.

293
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Let's go.

294
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Young Master is so worried about a small matter.

295
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It seems that he is in love with

296
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Mrs. Shen.

297
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It seems that

298
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
you didn't act rashly

299
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
after Mrs. Shen rejected you.

300
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Otherwise,

301
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
if you offend Young Master Lin,

302
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
you'll be in trouble.

303
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I only knew that

304
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Young Master Lin and the Shen family are cousins.

305
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I've never thought about it.

306
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Now I think about it.

307
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Mrs. Shen seems to

308
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
have feelings for Young Master Lin.

309
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
No wonder.

310
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I didn't have a chance from the beginning.

311
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You can't force

312
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
a relationship between two lovers.

313
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's just

314
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
that it's the first time

315
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
that I've met a woman

316
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
who wants to ask for my hand in marriage.

317
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's a pity.

318
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
At my age,

319
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
my career is more important

320
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
than the Cheng family.

321
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But if I can't be a couple

322
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
or a friend,

323
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
it's a shame

324
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
to work together.

325
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Young Master Lin has a bright future.

326
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
He won't stop here.

327
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
If Mrs. Shen

328
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
becomes Young Master Lin's wife,

329
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
the Liu family

330
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
can be the wall

331
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
of the Shen family.

332
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's better to do it this way.

333
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I've never thought about it.

334
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm scared.

335
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's okay.

336
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Gongxuan, come out!

337
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What are you doing?

338
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What are you doing in there?

339
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What's wrong with you?

340
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Did you say something wrong?

341
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You're not reliable.

342
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
We haven't done anything yet.

343
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Kong Ji Shi Si.

344
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Kong Ji Shi Si.

345
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Enough.

346
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
If the throat is useful,

347
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
the donkey will rule the world.

348
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Kong Ji Shi Si.

349
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Kong Ji Shi Si.

350
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Kong Ji Shi Si.

351
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Son,

352
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
come out.

353
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I know you're upset.

354
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Come out. I'll talk to you.

355
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Or let your father

356
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
cook for you.

357
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Come out, Gongcai.

358
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Come out.

359
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Everyone is waiting for you.

360
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Come out.

361
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Kong Ji Shi Si.

362
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Kong Ji Shi Kong.

363
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Miss Shen, you're a man.

364
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Who are you looking at?

365
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm telling you, if you don't come out, I'll kick the door.

366
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Kong Ji Shi Si.

367
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Kong Ji Shi Kong.

368
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Come on.

369
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Give me your shoes.

370
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
This kid,

371
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
he's always around.

372
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Brother, he wasn't like this before.

373
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He was angry with

374
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
the old lady who looked like his sister-in-law.

375
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
He's not done yet.

376
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You're sorry for him.

377
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Yangyang said he was upset.

378
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You always tell me not to be impulsive.

379
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
If you say it again, you'll kick the door.

380
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's money.

381
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
We have to fix it.

382
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Come here.

383
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Kong Ji Shi Si.

384
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It seems to be really hurt.

385
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You look

386
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
heartless.

387
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Why are you so weak

388
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
all of a sudden?

389
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Kong Ji Shi Si.

390
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Kong Ji Shi Kong.

391
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Kong Ji Shi Si.

392
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Dad,

393
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm sorry.

394
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I shouldn't have said that.

395
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
If you really want to be a hero,

396
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yangyang will believe you.

397
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Although it's hard to do,

398
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yangyang will work hard.

399
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Dad,

400
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
don't be sad,

401
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
okay?

402
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Dad.

403
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yangyang, be good.

404
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Don't cry.

405
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'll come out.

406
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Dad.

407
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yangyang.

408
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
No matter what,

409
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I won't let you down.

410
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
No matter what,

411
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I won't let you down.

412
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Dad.

413
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
What you told me to investigate

414
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
is very interesting.

415
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
The person who stole the poison

416
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
in the Princess's mansion

417
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
died five years ago.

418
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Then we investigated.

419
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
There are many soldiers

420
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
who are dead.

421
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And they are like the thieves.

422
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
They can't find the grave.

423
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Maybe these people

424
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
didn't die.

425
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Maybe

426
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
someone

427
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
found these soldiers

428
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and made a fake death.

429
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
The Ministry of Revenue and Ministry of Personnel

430
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
gave these soldiers

431
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
two waves of help.

432
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What's interesting is

433
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
these two waves

434
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
are from the same school.

435
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
After talking to Zhao Xunzhi,

436
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
they all went back to their hometown.

437
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's still Zhao Xunzhi.

438
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
He made such a big noise.

439
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
If we raise these people,

440
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
it's a lot of soldiers.

441
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Who needs so many soldiers?

442
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I think

443
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
who is it?

444
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I really don't know.

445
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Zhao...

446
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'll go to His Majesty now.

447
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'll sue him.

448
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Don't worry. I won't get you involved.

449
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Uncle. Uncle.

450
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Calm down. You promised me

451
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
you wouldn't be impulsive.

452
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Okay. I'm not impulsive.

453
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Calm down.

454
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Calm down.

455
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Calm down. Don't be impulsive.

456
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But I can't stand these dirty things.

457
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I know you are strong-minded.

458
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
When you were here,

459
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
you said you wanted to fight against the enemy

460
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
when you were in the same school with me.

461
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I will definitely avenge you.

462
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Now I'm willing to do everything I can to help you.

463
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm really grateful.

464
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
But now

465
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
you can't act rashly.

466
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Otherwise, it's harder to solve

467
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
the matter by making a mess.

468
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Okay.

469
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
When your father was here,

470
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I listened to him.

471
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Now I'm listening to you.

472
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Tell me. What should we do next?

473
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Zhao Xunzhi

474
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
can do these things without thinking.

475
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
He is a very careful person.

476
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
We should find a way

477
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
to get close to him.

478
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Help me.

479
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Help me.

480
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Hello, madam.

481
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You are a guest. How can you do this?

482
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm just helping you.

483
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

484
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
No, no.

485
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You are the most important guest in our family.

486
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You can come anytime.

487
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Help me get it out.

488
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Sit with me.

489
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Okay.

490
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Here.

491
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Actually, my grandfather is very satisfied with Lin Yan.

492
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Do I understand?

493
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I don't have a good grandfather to take care of me.

494
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Only my grandfather cares about my marriage.

495
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm old now.

496
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's not right to not get married.

497
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Although Lin Yan is older,

498
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
he has a good character.

499
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
My mother loves my grandfather.

500
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
She is always loved by her uncle.

501
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I think

502
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Lin Yan and I have no love.

503
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
We will never be like my grandfather and mother.

504
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Are you surprised?

505
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I don't feel sad about my plan.

506
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You should feel the same.

507
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You should think about yourself.

508
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I'm as old as Lin Yan.

509
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I don't plan to get married in Yongan.

510
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You are 25 years old.

511
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I didn't mean that.

512
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I mean

513
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I'm surprised.

514
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You are so old.

515
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You are so old.

516
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Do your family never urge you?

517
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
They think I'm happy.

518
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
They are not afraid of rumors?

519
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Actually,

520
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
although Lin Yan is always angry,

521
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
he is kind.

522
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
He will be kind to his wife.

523
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
He is a good boy.

524
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
But he has many difficulties.

525
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
You should treat him well.

526
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
You sound strange.

527
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It's like

528
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
your mother is taking care of you.

529
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I'm sorry.

530
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You are almost finished.

531
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Are you not afraid of toothache?

532
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I am.

533
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But my aunt said

534
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I should be brave.

535
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Is that what your aunt taught you?

536
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Your father

537
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
can't take care of you

538
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
now.

539
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
He can't take care of you

540
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
either.

541
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I think Yangyang should go to school.

542
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It's not a good idea to lock him in the store.

543
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Who says not?

544
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But I can go to the library.

545
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Yangyang,

546
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
we can call your father

547
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
to teach you.

548
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's good.

549
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
At least we can save time to read.

550
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Let's ask a great teacher

551
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
to teach us.

552
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Then we can go to the library.

553
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
But I still want to go to the library.

554
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I can visit the Crown Prince.

555
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You want to visit the Crown Prince?

556
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I don't understand.

557
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
When we were young,

558
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
we didn't have a school.

559
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Now we have money.

560
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Why can't we go to a good school?

561
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
What's the big deal?

562
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Now we have money?

563
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Let's go to theati guarantee.

564
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Let's go.

565
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Easy.

566
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Easy.

567
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Boss Rui,

568
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
we want to ask

569
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
if Yangyang can go to a well.

570
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm not sure.

571
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I just want to tell you a story.

572
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Please take me to the place.

573
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Okay.

574
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Yang, look.

575
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Aunt, look.

576
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Their school uniform is so beautiful.

577
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
That is called Blue Mountain.

578
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It is worn by students at this time.

579
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It's beautiful.

580
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
This is the school's teaching room.

581
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It is where the masters live and study.

582
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Master Zhao is waiting for you inside.

583
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Please.

584
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Let's go.

585
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Let's go.

586
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Let's go.

587
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Thank you.

588
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Let's go.

589
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Master Zhao, they are here.

590
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Hello, Master.

591
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Hello, Master.

592
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You are Shen Yangyang, right?

593
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Okay.

594
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
From tomorrow, you can come to Hong'en School to study.

595
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
That's great.

596
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
That's great.

597
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
You know the rules of Hong'en School, right?

598
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yes.

599
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yes.

600
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You must dress up as a man.

601
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Okay.

602
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Okay.

603
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
You are so kind.

604
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Thank you.

605
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Thank you.

606
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Thank you.

607
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Thank you.

608
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Thank you.

609
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Thank you.

610
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Thank you.

611
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Thank you.

612
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Okay.

613
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Thank you.

614
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I can finally go to Hong'en School.

615
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Master, I don't know how you chose Yangyang.

616
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Please give me your advice.

617
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Yes.

618
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You don't know?

619
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
No.

620
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
No?

621
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Master!

622
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
You...

623
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I heard you are the best speaker in Hong'en School.

624
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Please...

625
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
No.

626
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Please let my son dress up as a man and study.

627
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
As long as you promise me, I will be your slave.

628
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Okay.

629
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Get up first.

630
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
We can talk it over.

631
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Master, if you don't promise me, I won't get up.

632
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I won't get up.

633
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I...

634
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Please.

635
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Please.

636
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Please.

637
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Please.

638
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You...

639
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Why don't you talk?

640
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Master, if you don't talk, you have to pretend you promised me.

641
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
From today on, I will be your slave.

642
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I am your...

643
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
slave.

644
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Don't worry.

645
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I will wipe your blood.

646
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Okay.

647
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Okay.

648
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Get up.

649
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
One more.

650
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Please.

651
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You are so short-tempered.

652
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You are so short-tempered.

653
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
You are so short-tempered.

654
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I don't believe I can't beat you.

655
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Master!

656
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Master!

657
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Don't be afraid.

658
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Master!

659
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
No, no, no.

660
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Don't come back.

661
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Look at my book.

662
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It's so good.

663
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Listen.

664
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
There are rules in the hall.

665
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
If you make trouble again, I will call someone.

666
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Master, master, let go of me.

667
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Let go of me.

668
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Master, master, don't be impulsive.

669
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
You will know my good later.

670
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Master Zhao is off duty.

671
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Business is good.

672
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Let go of me.

673
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Master Zhao is off duty.

674
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Business is good.

675
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Business is good.

676
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Who is it?

677
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
You...

678
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
What's wrong?

679
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
You are the one I'm afraid of.

680
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Master, master.

681
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Master, master.

682
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
You...

683
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
What are you doing?

684
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I'll carry you.

685
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Somebody.

686
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You...

687
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You scared me.

688
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Somebody.

689
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Look at this.

690
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Look at this.

691
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Somebody.

692
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Somebody.

693
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
People.

694
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Money.

695
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Do we really have to bring business?

696
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Money.

697
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
What is it?

698
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Let me see it.

699
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Money.

700
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
What is it?

701
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Money.

702
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
No.

703
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Money.

704
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Believe it or not, if money.

705
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
This is the reality.

706
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,400
You'll feel warm when you sleep.

707
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,800
It's warm now. Come on, sleep.

708
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,200
I beg you.

709
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,000
I beg you. I beg you.

710
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,600
Stop fooling around, okay?

711
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
Go back. Go back.

712
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
Go back, okay?

713
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,800
Master, master, don't beg me.

714
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,000
I beg you. I beg you.

715
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,600
Just let my daughter study in school.

716
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,600
If she doesn't study in school,

717
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,200
I'll serve you for another day.

718
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,200
I'm determined.

719
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,200
I beg you, master.

720
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,600
I beg you. I beg you.

721
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,000
I beg you.

722
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,800
Go to sleep.

723
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,000
Fine.

724
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,800
I'll do it for you.

725
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,200
Let your daughter study in school.

726
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,200
Great.

727
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,800
Master, master.

728
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
Don't go.

729
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,200
I only have one request.

730
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,000
Understand?

731
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
You can't disappear.

732
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,000
You...

733
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,400
Don't be afraid.

734
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
I'm here. I'm here.

735
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,000
Disappear. Disappear.

736
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,400
Yang Yang.

737
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,400
Dad.

738
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,800
Dad.

739
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,400
You're so great, dad.

740
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
Dad, you're so great.

741
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,800
Why do you make him so happy?

742
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,400
Dongcai.

743
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
You can help me

744
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,400
to get the chance to go to Hongwen House.

745
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Dad.

746
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Open the door, young lady.

747
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Finally.

748
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Dad.

749
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Dad.

750
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Go. Go. Go.

751
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Dad.

752
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Dad, where are you?

753
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Young lady.

754
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Brother.

755
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Dad.

756
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Where is he?

757
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I don't know.

758
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Dad.

759
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Brother.

760
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Where is he?

761
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Where is he?

762
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
You're back.

763
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
How is it?

764
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Can Yang Yang go to Hongwen House?

765
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,600
Yang Yang, you've been in the shop.

766
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,600
Did you see my brother?

767
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,600
I didn't notice him in the kitchen.

768
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,600
What's wrong?

769
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
Dad is gone.

770
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
Dad abandoned me.

771
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,600
Dad ran away too.

772
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,600
No, no.

773
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
Don't cry.

774
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,600
Dad won't run away.

775
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
He just goes out for a walk.

776
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
He's also angry.

777
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
It's okay.

778
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
Don't cry.

779
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
This kid is really...

780
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
What's this?

781
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,600
What's this?

782
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,600
It's like a punishment.

783
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Dad is dead.

784
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
Family.

785
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,600
When you saw this letter,

786
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,600
I've set foot on the path of rebirth.

787
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,600
I'm 30 years old.

788
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,600
When I become a hero,

789
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,600
I'll return to my old self.

790
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,600
At that time,

791
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,600
Yang Yang was also a student at Hongwen House.

792
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,600
We are going to meet at the top.

793
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,600
I will report to you regularly.

794
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
Don't worry.

795
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,600
What does this bastard want to do?

796
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
Dad.

797
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,600
What's this?

798
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,600
Why is there money?

799
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,600
I've been keeping the money in the box.

800
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,600
I'll leave it to Yang Yang to spend it.

801
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,600
Dad.

802
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,600
This is all the money I've been cheating on.

803
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,600
I didn't spend a penny.

804
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,600
I have to find him.

805
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,600
Come back.

806
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,600
Do you know where he went?

807
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
You go find him.

808
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,600
Besides, he's an adult.

809
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
How can he be lost?

810
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
He wants to go out.

811
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
Let him go.

812
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
He can't be kidnapped.

813
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
He's the one.

814
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,600
His brain.

815
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
His brain was kicked by the fish.

816
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Dad.

817
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,600
Yang Yang.

818
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
No.

819
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,600
Your dad's brain is great.

820
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,600
He's a good guy.

821
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,600
He's been a good boy since he was a kid.

822
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
He'll be back.

823
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,600
I'll meet you at the top.

824
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
Yes.

825
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
No.

826
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
At the top.

827
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
Really?

828
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
Yes.

829
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
Yes.

830
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
When he comes back,

831
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,600
he'll make a career for you.

832
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Yang Yang,

833
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,600
we'll learn from him.

834
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
He'll be a good boy.

835
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,600
He'll be happy when he comes back.

836
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
See you at the top.

837
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
See you at the top.

838
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Yang Yang.

839
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
Don't cry.

840
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,600
See you at the top.

841
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,600
Don't cry.

842
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,600
Don't cry.

843
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
The man didn't show up.

844
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,600
He asked the training room to invite Zhao Xun Zhi.

845
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,600
I thought he had no reason to refuse.

846
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,600
But he still refused.

847
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,600
Zhao Xun Zhi must have been suspicious.

848
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
I got the Poison of Little Wolf.

849
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,600
Lord Zhao must have stopped Zhao Xun Zhi from guarding me.

850
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,600
I can't enter the red-lake house rashly.

851
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,600
I have to think of something.

852
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,600
Yang Yang.

853
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,600
What are you doing here?

854
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Does your family know?

855
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,600
Young Master, I came here by myself.

856
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,600
I came here to give you this sugar gourd.

857
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
To me?

858
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
Thank you.

859
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Tell me why I'm giving you this sugar gourd.

860
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
Why are you giving me this sugar gourd?

861
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,600
Because I want you to go to the red-lake house rashly.

862
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,600
This is the opportunity my father has earned for me.

863
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,600
So I'm giving you this sugar gourd to ask you

864
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,600
how to make me a good student.

865
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,600
Yang Yang.

866
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,600
No.

867
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,600
Tell your family that the red-lake house rashly is a little troublesome.

868
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
You can't get involved.

869
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,600
What's troublesome?

870
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
Is it because of Lord Zhao?

871
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,600
No, how do you know?

872
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,600
Uncle Liang Zhang.

873
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,600
When you were talking outside, I must have heard you say it.

874
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,600
But this is more interesting, Young Master.

875
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,600
I want to go to the red-lake house rashly more.

876
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
I can help you get closer to Lord Zhao.

877
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,600
Yang Yang.

878
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
No.

879
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Absolutely no.

880
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,600
This is not a child playing games.

881
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Don't mess around.

882
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,600
I'm not a child.

883
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
I'm great.

884
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
Go.

885
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Go to see your aunt.

886
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
No.

887
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Absolutely no.

888
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,600
Yang Yang, don't mess around.

889
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,600
This is not a child playing games.

890
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
Aunt, why are you so unrighteous?

891
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,600
Didn't we all agree to help Shao Ying?

892
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
This has nothing to do with justice.

893
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
How is it not related?

894
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,600
If a hero is injured, will we ignore him?

895
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,600
If a beggar wants to eat at the door of the house,

896
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600
will you not give him food?

897
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,600
Even Xiaoming's wandering family has become a family.

898
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
Will you ignore Shao Ying?

899
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
Please come with me.

900
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,600
It's okay.

901
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
It's okay.

902
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
Shao Ying wants to turn the case.

903
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,600
We should help him.

904
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,600
But Yang Yang is just a child.

905
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,600
I don't know if Shao Ying said something to Yang Yang.

906
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,600
But this is too dangerous.

907
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,600
He didn't...

908
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
Wait.

909
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,600
You think I'm using Yang Yang?

910
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,600
I believe Shao Ying is not that kind of person.

911
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
But if you don't have any such thoughts,

912
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,600
how can you bring him back to tell us this?

913
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
Is this what you think of me?

914
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
No.

915
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
I...

916
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,600
Lady Shen, Yang Yang is not my child.

917
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,600
I can't speak loudly or speak softly.

918
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,600
That's why I brought him back to see you.

919
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Think about it from my point of view.

920
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,600
If he has suggested this and I hide it from you,

921
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,600
who am I?

922
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
I'm sorry.

923
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
I didn't think it through.

924
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
I'm sorry.

925
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
I didn't think it through.

926
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,600
Aunt.

927
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Aunt.

928
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,600
Shao Ying didn't ask me to do that.

929
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,600
You didn't teach me to help others.

930
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,600
I just want to ask Shao Ying

931
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,600
how to be a good student.

932
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,600
Shao Ying helped me, so I have to help him.

933
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
Aunt.

934
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,600
How can you say that about Shao Ying?

935
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,600
I...

936
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,600
I'm just worried about him.

937
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
How can I think Shao Ying is that kind of person?

938
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,600
I'm not like you.

939
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,600
You're not that kind of person.

940
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Why do you say that?

941
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
Forget it.

942
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
I know what you mean.

943
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,600
You don't have to worry about me.

944
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,600
I can't do anything to worry about you.

945
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,600
You don't have to worry about me.

946
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
Right?

947
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,600
We're family.

948
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
But Shao Ying,

949
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,600
if Zhao Fu Zi is really in trouble,

950
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,600
can we still send Yang Yang to Hongmen Temple?

951
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,600
Why can't I go?

952
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
I'm not afraid.

953
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,600
I just want to go to Hongmen Temple.

954
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,600
Hongmen Temple is so big and crowded.

955
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,600
How can he go against the law?

956
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
Besides,

957
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,600
his problems are all in the past.

958
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,600
We should be careful.

959
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,600
Ha Fu was a criminal.

960
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,600
Who would not go to Ha Fu because of a criminal?

961
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
Oh my god.

962
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,600
Why did you find Ha Fu?

963
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,600
You're right.

964
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,600
Hongmen Temple is the best school in Yongan.

965
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,600
But Zhao Xun Zhi

966
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,600
should not know that we are old.

967
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,600
So he promised to let Yang Yang study.

968
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,600
Gong Cai's performance when he met Zhao Fu Zi

969
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,600
is really hard to connect him and Shao Ying.

970
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Can I help Shao Ying?

971
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,600
Yang Yang, you can go to study.

972
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,600
You don't have to help me.

973
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
Shao Ying,

974
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
if Yang Yang can really help Shao Ying

975
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,600
get close to Zhao Fu Zi,

976
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,600
I think it's a good thing.

977
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,600
Right?

978
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,600
Our children are afraid of nothing.

979
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,600
They should be careful.

980
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,600
When Yang Yang graduates from Hongmen Temple,

981
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,600
he should write to us in his resume.

982
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
He helped Shao Ying before.

983
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
He is innocent.

984
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
You are so good.

985
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
Yes.

986
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
You are so cool.

987
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,600
Cool.

988
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,600
You are so cool.

989
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
In my heart,

990
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,600
Shao Ying is the coolest.

991
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,600
Yes.

992
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
You are the best.

993
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
I'm sorry.

994
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,600
I'm sorry.

995
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,600
I'm sorry.
