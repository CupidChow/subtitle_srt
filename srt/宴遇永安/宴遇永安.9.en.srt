The King Of Blaze

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The King Of Blaze

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I've been there.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Really?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There are so many delicious food there.

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The King Of Blaze

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Episode 16

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Sir, we'll leave first.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay, thank you.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Dad,

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I think

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
you should choose this one

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
for the table cloth.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It looks so good.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Look at this cloth.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What?

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What do you know?

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Do you have a taste?

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Let me tell you.

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is a piece of cotton.

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's suitable for making your pants.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Son, look at this one.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's low-key luxury.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Do you understand?

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay.

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What's wrong with you?

29
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This one.

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This one.

31
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What's wrong?

32
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Do you think it looks like

33
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
the cloth you used to wipe your feet?

34
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm the same.

35
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What do you know?

36
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You're absolutely...

37
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Dad.

38
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Ji.

39
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Ji.

40
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Who is this?

41
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Why are you so hurt?

42
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'll explain it to you later.

43
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Brother, take the money

44
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and pay him the road fee.

45
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Why?

46
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Take it.

47
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Honey,

48
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
are you going to drive me away?

49
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Why?

50
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm not driving you away.

51
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We can't keep you.

52
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Can you let me stay?

53
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm very...

54
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
very busy.

55
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm better than those running kids.

56
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Stop.

57
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What is she doing?

58
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't know.

59
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Who is she?

60
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Why is she taking her home?

61
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Ji.

62
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Who is this little girl?

63
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
She's pretty busy.

64
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I saw this little woman

65
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
being scolded by Manager Feng at the restaurant.

66
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I figured out a way

67
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
to save her.

68
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,240
Yuan, give it to me.

69
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,240
I've paid you back for selling the body.

70
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,520
You're free to go now.

71
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,000
Didn't you say you wanted to go back to the land?

72
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You can leave today with the money.

73
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,800
If you stay here,

74
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,400
you'll be in trouble again if you get the house.

75
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
But I don't have anyone in my family.

76
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,320
If I go back,

77
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,080
I have nowhere to go.

78
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,760
Please let me stay.

79
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,840
I work here.

80
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,760
I don't want my salary.

81
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,440
Just give me a bite of food.

82
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,960
Yuan, she doesn't want money.

83
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,200
Please let me stay.

84
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,800
Yuan, you...

85
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,760
I really don't want my salary.

86
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,320
Take it away.

87
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,200
Don't give me money.

88
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,400
Give me a bite of food.

89
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,760
Let me stay.

90
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,480
Ji.

91
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,040
Ji, come out.

92
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,880
Ji, let's go.

93
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,400
You go first.

94
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,360
Ji,

95
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,720
I think

96
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,520
it's just a matter of having a meal with more people.

97
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,440
You can let her stay.

98
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,120
She's a poor girl.

99
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,200
She's injured.

100
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,760
If you drive her away,

101
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,840
where will she go?

102
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,120
Your mom is right.

103
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,840
Young people like her

104
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,160
are hard to find now.

105
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,800
When the restaurant opens,

106
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,200
we need more people.

107
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
You saved her.

108
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,840
Let her work in the restaurant.

109
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,760
We can rest assured.

110
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,360
Yes.

111
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,520
Dad, mom,

112
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,000
when we were in the stall,

113
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,440
we were already against Yunlai.

114
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,920
If we let her stay

115
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,640
and offend Yunlai for this,

116
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,160
it will be more embarrassing.

117
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,960
Ji,

118
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,360
when you saved her,

119
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,920
you already offended Yunlai.

120
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,000
You let her go now.

121
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,280
Yunlai let us go.

122
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,360
She won't bother us anymore.

123
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,200
I know I've caused trouble.

124
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,280
It has nothing to do with me.

125
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,040
I should...

126
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,120
I shouldn't have bothered.

127
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,000
We don't blame you.

128
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,080
Your dad can't talk.

129
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,040
But he means

130
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,400
since we decided to stay and do business,

131
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
we will always encounter such troubles.

132
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,400
You see,

133
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,280
Yongan is not an illegal place.

134
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,160
It means he can blackmail us.

135
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,000
Right.

136
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,520
Ji,

137
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,800
I've made up my mind.

138
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,960
You can let her stay.

139
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,400
But if I let her stay,

140
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,760
it will be more and more troublesome.

141
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
It's not like you.

142
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,240
You're not like this

143
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,360
when we first came to the ancient time.

144
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,480
You're the most positive.

145
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,440
You can solve problems

146
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,640
as soon as you encounter them.

147
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,560
Now,

148
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,920
Yunlai is not a problem.

149
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,520
You've encountered problems yourself.

150
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,720
You're going to return the shares?

151
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,840
Right, Ji.

152
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,760
Why are you still going to return the shares?

153
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,800
I just don't want to care about it.

154
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,640
She's an ancient person to us.

155
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,960
She's a shareholder.

156
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,240
Her fate has been set.

157
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,680
It's no use for us to interfere.

158
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,080
She...

159
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,160
She's not...

160
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,360
Ji,

161
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,840
Young Master is here after dealing with Yunlai.

162
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,560
Where's Yuan?

163
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,320
The girl you brought back.

164
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,880
She was standing right there.

165
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,320
When she heard you talking behind her back,

166
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,440
she said she was grateful to you.

167
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,440
Then she left.

168
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,440
She left without saying anything?

169
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,960
Why didn't you stop her?

170
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,600
I didn't stop her.

171
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,920
I couldn't stop her.

172
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,600
Besides,

173
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,840
she's a young lady.

174
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,360
I'm a single man.

175
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,600
I'm trying to stop her.

176
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,560
Is that a joke?

177
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,840
It's not good to spread it.

178
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,560
Ji,

179
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,120
you should think about it.

180
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,920
She left.

181
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,760
Didn't I tell you

182
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
not to let her go?

183
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,280
You...

184
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
This girl...

185
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,440
How could she do that?

186
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,480
Young Master,

187
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,600
please calm down.

188
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,080
Ji is a nice person.

189
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
She's never been like this before.

190
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,560
She's just not in a good mood today.

191
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,720
She never dared to do that before.

192
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,280
Right?

193
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll talk to her.

194
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,320
What happened?

195
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,240
I...

196
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,160
Your findings are positive.

197
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,000
Right?

198
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,200
Let's wait until she comes here.

199
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,640
Or the alarm will wake her up.

200
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,680
You were too precise

201
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,000
when you saved the young lady.

202
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,480
I wasn't.

203
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,160
Give me your hand.

204
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,520
Do you also think I'm too cold?

205
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,640
You are too cold

206
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,800
to hold the stone and protect others

207
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,560
and let yourself get hurt.

208
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,960
Does it still hurt?

209
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,520
I really think

210
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,240
I can't even control myself.

211
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,160
How can I be responsible for others?

212
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,720
We don't belong here.

213
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,120
We shouldn't interfere with the affairs here.

214
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,080
Even if I do, it's useless.

215
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,080
But I...

216
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,640
Yunshui Courtyard is very spacious.

217
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,520
Only a few people can live here.

218
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,960
If anyone wants to break in,

219
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,320
my Wuwa

220
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,080
will definitely help you.

221
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,560
Lios Haben

222
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,680
It's going to rain.

223
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,600
If it rains,

224
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,120
I'm afraid it will be day.

225
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,960
I have to go find him.

226
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,880
Come on.

227
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,960
Yuan.

228
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,200
Yuan.

229
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,800
Yuan.

230
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,640
Yuan.

231
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,240
Yuan.

232
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,440
Yuan.

233
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,680
It's going to be dark soon.

234
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,920
Where can he go?

235
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,560
Don't worry.

236
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,520
He's injured.

237
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,520
He can't leave at this time.

238
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,680
Yuan.

239
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,800
Yuan.

240
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:50,960
Yuan.

241
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,680
Yuan.

242
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
I'm sorry.

243
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,880
I'm sorry.

244
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,960
It's okay.

245
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,800
Yuan.

246
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,520
Come on.

247
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,200
Come on.

248
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,720
Let A Ji have a look.

249
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,920
His wound is also healed.

250
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,440
I found him a good dress.

251
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,560
It's so beautiful.

252
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
Is it?

253
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,320
Look.

254
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,040
Take your time to talk.

255
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,360
What are you doing, my dear?

256
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,320
It smells so good.

257
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
Let me help you.

258
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,840
Aren't you A Yuan?

259
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,120
I made fish balls for you.

260
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,680
It's so delicious.

261
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,760
You're also a member of the Shen Family.

262
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,760
My dear.

263
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,520
I'll sell myself to you.

264
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,720
I'll follow you for the rest of my life.

265
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,080
When our restaurant is officially open,

266
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,840
you can earn money by working.

267
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,160
You don't need to sell your life.

268
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,840
But...

269
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,920
But I'm working here.

270
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
I don't have a life-saving tool.

271
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,160
How can you be assured?

272
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,880
We sign the labor contract

273
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,440
to sign the contract.

274
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,600
You can get the money on time.

275
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,280
I don't understand what you're saying.

276
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,400
But I think I can understand it.

277
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,880
You're right.

278
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,800
You're...

279
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,120
You're so nice to me.

280
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,000
You're so nice to me.

281
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You're so nice to me.

282
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,200
Why are you crying?

283
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,600
You're here to help.

284
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,080
We should thank you.

285
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,480
Why do you thank me?

286
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,000
All right, A Yuan.

287
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Don't cry.

288
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,560
I think you're much better now.

289
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,560
My daughter is the strongest.

290
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,920
I knew she would get over it.

291
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,000
Now it's good.

292
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,400
A Ji is in a good mood.

293
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,560
Everything is back to normal.

294
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,880
Our restaurant

295
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,080
will be A Ji's place in the end.

296
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,840
Can she still be my place

297
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,760
if I find a painter tomorrow?

298
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,600
Why are you so unruly?

299
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,280
Well...

300
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,320
All right, the dishes are ready.

301
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,200
Have a seat.

302
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,560
Sit down, A Yuan.

303
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,560
From today on,

304
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,160
A Yuan will be our member.

305
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,160
Great.

306
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
Welcome.

307
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,760
Great.

308
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,880
A Yuan and I can play together.

309
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,320
But...

310
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,760
If you guys

311
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,560
come to the restaurant,

312
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,760
you'll be in trouble.

313
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,760
I'm sorry.

314
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,760
I'm sorry.

315
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
I'm sorry.

316
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,160
What if the restaurant

317
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,560
is in trouble?

318
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
Don't worry.

319
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
I'll take care of it.

320
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,960
Thank you, Young Master.

321
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Really?

322
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,760
Since A Ji and Young Master

323
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,840
have said so,

324
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,040
I now announce

325
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,720
that A Yuan

326
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,360
will be our member.

327
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
Let's eat.

328
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
Let's eat.

329
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,120
Come on, eat.

330
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,120
Yes.

331
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,120
Come on, Yang Yang.

332
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,760
A Yuan,

333
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
I'll serve you some soup.

334
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,760
It's so delicious.

335
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
Try this.

336
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
Try it. It's delicious.

337
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Be careful not to burn yourself.

338
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
Thank you, Madam.

339
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,760
A Yuan.

340
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
Thank you, Yang Yang.

341
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
A Yuan.

342
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
Young Master, try this.

343
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,760
It's delicious.

344
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,760
But, Madam,

345
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,760
I want to eat something else.

346
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,760
Poor happiness?

347
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
What is poor happiness?

348
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
It's mixing rice with lard and soy sauce.

349
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
Soy sauce is a good match.

350
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
Lard can also be mixed with rice.

351
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,760
Mixed with rice?

352
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,760
It's mixing rice with soy sauce.

353
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,760
It's convenient and delicious.

354
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Young Master is a noble person.

355
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,760
He never starved.

356
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,760
This way of eating is to attack the hungry.

357
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
It's normal that you don't know.

358
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,760
Actually, I starved before.

359
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,760
I was on the street.

360
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,760
I didn't dare to show my face

361
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
when I was stealing the cheongsam.

362
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,760
But, how can

363
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,760
Young Master Gui Ru have such experience?

364
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,760
Are you joking?

365
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760
Yes, I'm joking.

366
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
I'm joking.

367
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,760
Actually, after meeting A Yuan,

368
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,760
I had an idea.

369
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
It turns out that Gui Xiang and I

370
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:30,300
are doing business with the

371
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,760
We can do some bad business.

372
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
Bad business?

373
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
What do you mean?

374
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
It's...

375
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,760
You mean

376
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
to make some food

377
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
that ordinary people can afford?

378
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
Gui Xiang and I

379
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,760
are both good at it.

380
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,760
But, we have more ordinary people.

381
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
We can do more

382
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
food that

383
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,760
is cheap and delicious.

384
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,760
Then, our restaurant will be more valuable.

385
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,760
I think A Ji's idea is good.

386
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,760
Cheap food that is cheap and delicious

387
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,760
is good for the people.

388
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,760
You always say some new words.

389
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,760
As your mother said,

390
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,760
a word that is cheap and delicious

391
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
is very interesting.

392
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,760
Cheap food for the people.

393
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
Whether it's business or material,

394
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,760
it's good for the people.

395
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,760
Young Master,

396
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,760
you don't know much about it.

397
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
Just like what they said,

398
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,760
I can do it, too.

399
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,760
But, I don't often say it.

400
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,760
Right?

401
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,760
But I think

402
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,760
we should change the name.

403
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,760
You can't always call it poor and happy.

404
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,760
It's good to hear that.

405
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,760
But you're always poor.

406
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Who would want to buy it?

407
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,760
Would you like to sell it?

408
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,760
Right?

409
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,760
I think

410
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,760
we should change the name.

411
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,760
Poor and happy.

412
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,760
Shen

413
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,760
dared to take Chun Yan away from me.

414
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
He's really something.

415
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,760
By the way,

416
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,760
I asked you to check

417
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
what's the relationship between him and that young master.

418
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
How did you find out?

419
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,760
I found out.

420
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
I asked my relatives

421
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,760
the guards who work in Jingzhao Prefecture.

422
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,760
They said that Lin Shaoyin and the Shen family are relatives.

423
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,760
Mrs. Shen is Lin Shaoyin's cousin.

424
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Cousin?

425
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
No wonder he's so arrogant.

426
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,760
I thought Lin Yan was serious.

427
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,760
I didn't expect he's also a coward.

428
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
Let's see.

429
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,760
Let's go.

430
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,760
Can you be more careful?

431
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
I'm done.

432
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,760
You're a family.

433
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,760
You're still doing this.

434
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,760
Sorry, young master.

435
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,760
I'm so happy eating.

436
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,760
I forgot the time.

437
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,760
It's not convenient for Xiao Jin to go back to Yunshui Courtyard.

438
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,760
I'm sorry to let you stay here for a night.

439
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,760
It's okay.

440
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,760
It's not fun.

441
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
Mrs. Shen.

442
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,760
Can you talk to me?

443
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
No problem.

444
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,760
Come on.

445
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,760
She doesn't talk.

446
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,760
The Shen family is going to open for the 14th time.

447
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,760
What's your plan for the future?

448
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,760
Of course, I'll be a strong man.

449
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,760
I'll be a real man.

450
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,760
I mean,

451
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
what about you?

452
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
Me?

453
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
To be honest,

454
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,760
we can't leave Yun An for a while.

455
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,760
I didn't have a goal before.

456
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,760
But now I feel like I've found my home.

457
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,760
I have something I want to do.

458
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,760
For example, selling cheap food.

459
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,760
How can I be a genius with a business mind like me?

460
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,760
What about business?

461
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,760
Help my father win the first place in the Spring Festival Gala next year.

462
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,760
In addition to helping your father win the first place in the Spring Festival Gala,

463
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,760
you have your own future.

464
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,760
What's your plan for your life?

465
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,760
My life?

466
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,760
I can't think that far.

467
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
I mean,

468
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,760
your life.

469
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
Your life.

470
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,760
Are you trying to cancel the engagement?

471
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,760
Really?

472
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,760
That's great.

473
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,760
You don't know how long I've been waiting for this.

474
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
You're so clumsy.

475
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,760
Are you afraid that I won't agree?

476
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,760
You don't have to make it difficult for me.

477
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,760
You should have told me earlier.

478
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
I...

479
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,760
I've been planning this every day when I woke up.

480
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,760
Luckily, you have this plan, too.

481
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,760
That's great.

482
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
Wait for me.

483
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
Why...

484
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
Why do you plan this every day?

485
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,760
Please, everyone.

486
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,760
Today, Shen Shaoguang sincerely and sincerely broke off the engagement with Lin Yan.

487
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,760
This engagement is completely invalid.

488
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,760
Shen Shaoguang's family is a good man.

489
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
Re...

490
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,760
...back?

491
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,760
I once mentioned this engagement with Lin Yan.

492
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,760
From now on, I will definitely erase all related records.

493
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,760
I will never mention it again.

494
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,760
If there is a repeat,

495
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,760
it will be...

496
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,760
...a shock to the human world.

497
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,760
Moral ethics will be lost.

498
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,760
I will be judged by my own children.

499
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
I'm sorry.

500
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Shao Ying,

501
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,760
we were the ones who made this mistake from the beginning.

502
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,760
How can we have an engagement with Shao Ying?

503
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
Yes, yes, yes.

504
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,760
Young Master, it's all our fault.

505
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,760
We should have ended this engagement long ago.

506
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
I'm sorry.

507
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,760
Young Master, you did make a mistake.

508
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,760
Please, Young Master, don't blame us for our fault.

509
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,760
What are you saying, Shao Ying?

510
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,760
We mean we were wrong.

511
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,760
Let's forget about the engagement as soon as possible.

512
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
As soon as possible.

513
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
I'm sorry.

514
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,760
How long do I have to wait?

515
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,760
He's so afraid of me.

516
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
I'm sorry.

517
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,760
I'm sorry.

518
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,760
Shao Ying?

519
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,760
No, no, I didn't mean to...

520
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,760
I...

521
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,760
Are you going to start a business?

522
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,760
The toilet is in the backyard.

523
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,760
No.

524
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,760
I'm sorry.

525
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
I'm sorry.

526
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,760
No.

527
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,760
Then...

528
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,760
I mean, there's a cat in the backyard.

529
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,760
A cat?

530
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,760
It's a jade pear.

531
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
A jade pear?

532
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,760
You call it a jade pear?

533
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,760
You call it a jade pear?

534
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,760
A jade pear?

535
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
Little cat.

536
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
Where are you going?

537
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,760
You like cats?

538
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
I wanted to keep them when I was a kid.

539
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,760
But it's not easy for my parents to keep me and Gongcai.

540
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,760
We have to open a shop at home.

541
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,760
It's not easy to have another cat.

542
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Little cat, are you passing by my house or staying here?

543
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,760
If you want to know his answer,

544
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,760
you can ask the cat.

545
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,760
The cat?

546
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,760
The cat?

547
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,760
I've finished the letter.

548
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,760
But he ate the gift you prepared.

549
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,760
He's willing to be your cat.

550
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
Yes.

551
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
It seems he really doesn't mind.

552
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
It's reasonable.

553
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
Other cats have cats.

554
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,760
So do my cats.

555
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,760
Sanhua, little cat.

556
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,760
You came to our restaurant by yourself.

557
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
Then you can't escape.

558
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,760
You can stay at home and do nothing.

559
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,760
I'll like you very much.

560
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
From now on, you don't have to go out.

561
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
You don't have to eat and eat.

562
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
This is the proof.

563
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,760
We'll see each other in heaven and earth.

564
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,760
He picked me up.

565
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,760
He picked me up.

566
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
Did you see that?

567
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,760
I'm so happy.

568
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
You...

569
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,760
You haven't given him a name yet?

570
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,760
Yes.

571
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
I'm so happy.

572
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,760
I'm so happy.

573
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
What about your son?

574
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,760
Yes.

575
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Name.

576
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,760
What name?

577
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,760
I don't know how to name.

578
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,760
You name one.

579
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
This is your son.

580
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,760
Why do you want me to name it?

581
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,760
We're both cats.

582
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
Why do I have to be alone?

583
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
I'll name it...

584
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,760
I'll name it...

585
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,760
Let's call it Xiaoming.

586
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,760
Xiaoming.

587
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,760
Xiaoming?

588
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,760
The bigger the name, the easier it is to keep.

589
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,760
Xiaoming is the name.

590
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
Yan is the name.

591
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
Xiaoming is the name.

592
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
Xiaoming is the name.

593
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,760
Xiaoming is the name.

594
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,760
Xiaoming is the name.

595
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,760
Didn't you get your name tag?

596
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,760
Change one.

597
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,760
I'll change one.

598
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,760
I don't know how to name.

599
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
Just call it Xiaoming.

600
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,760
Good.

601
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,760
Xiaoming.

602
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760
Xiaoming.

603
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,760
Xiaoming.

604
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,760
Xiaoming.

605
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,760
Xiaoming.

606
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,760
Xiaoming.

607
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
Xiaoming.

608
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,760
Xiaoming.

609
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,760
The giant elephant came to the Jiu Temple and spread his sword.

610
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,760
The new Jiu Temple is the second one.

611
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,760
The horse is too human.

612
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,760
It's removed according to the law.

613
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,760
The fourth one.

614
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,760
The giant elephant is angry with the book.

615
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,760
The Jiu Temple is not reported and not saved.

616
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,760
He is punished and punished.

617
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
Good.

618
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
He is the Jiu Temple.

619
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,760
He is not a human.

620
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,760
This young master is really here to do things.

621
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
What is this?

622
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,760
This is called being too much and being too much.

623
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,760
That's right.

624
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
Everyone, the young master did a good job.

625
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,760
This is called justice and being free.

626
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,760
What are you doing?

627
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
Why are you again?

628
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
Sorry.

629
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,760
I didn't notice.

630
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
I didn't notice.

631
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
What do these punishments count?

632
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,760
You can all be familiar with money.

633
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,760
With our original wealth,

634
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,760
it's enough to buy the lives of your family.

635
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,760
What are you talking about?

636
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,760
What?

637
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,760
I heard that you have a shop.

638
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,760
You are really going to start to tear up in our Juxian Lane.

639
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,760
Manager Feng,

640
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
your laugh is too typical.

641
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,760
The bad characters who are not very smart on stage

642
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,760
are all laughing like you.

643
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
What did you say?

644
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,760
I'm not very smart.

645
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,760
I can't understand what you're saying.

646
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
Manager Feng just asked us

647
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,760
if we were in the Juxian Lane shop.

648
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
He wanted to show us a stick.

649
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,760
I...

650
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
But you two are still not happy.

651
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,760
That's right.

652
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,760
Then everyone should be a witness.

653
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,760
If our family is dead,

654
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,760
if our family is open,

655
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,760
and if we encounter anyone who is embarrassed,

656
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,760
the first one to be invited is the one who is suspicious.

657
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,760
You are right.

658
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,760
Of course.

659
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,760
It's him.

660
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Shi Zhiguang.

661
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,760
You...

662
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,760
You guys wait for me.

663
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,760
If you, Shisi, can manage it,

664
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,760
I will write the house down.

665
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,760
You are the one who is waiting.

666
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,760
I will manage our family very well.

667
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
Very well.

668
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,760
You wait.

669
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,760
Wait.

670
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,760
You wait.

671
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
Cut the hair.

672
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,760
Cut the hair.

673
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,760
Move.

674
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
You are so annoying.

675
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,760
You are so annoying.

676
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Hurry up and move.

677
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,760
Miss, you said it well.

678
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,760
You…

679
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,760
TheIf?

680
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,760
You want me to write an If?

681
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,760
Right.

682
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
You want another of theIf?

683
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,760
You can't find him.

684
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,760
Every perfect picture is lost.

685
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,760
Who else do you want?

686
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,760
Giset theIf?

687
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,760
We all got respect from then!

688
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,760
Thanks to this,

689
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,760
the key is

690
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
Isn't this free?

691
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,760
How do you talk?

692
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,160
How do you talk to the young master?

693
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,720
Young Master, you...

694
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,120
You're not a big boy.

695
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
What's going on?

696
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,120
This is Ji's idea.

697
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,160
Ji wants you to write a poem.

698
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,160
So we can print it on this...

699
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:31,880
No.

700
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,600
So we can print it

701
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,160
on the work uniform.

702
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,720
What's going on?

703
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,120
Work uniform?

704
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,440
On the clothes.

705
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,280
On the clothes?

706
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,200
Yang Yang, you...

707
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,200
This is the lollipop I made.

708
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
I'll give it to you.

709
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,880
Lollipop.

710
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,440
It's delicious.

711
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,800
It's sweet.

712
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,800
It's sweet with lollipop.

713
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,800
Yes.

714
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
The Shen Family is back.

715
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Today, the winner is Shen Family.

716
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
Good.

717
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
Good.

718
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Good.

719
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Happy New Year.

720
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,200
The Shen Family is open for business today.

721
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Welcome to have a taste.

722
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,200
Welcome.

723
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
The winner is...

724
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Today, we'll give you a free drink.

725
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Give us a drink.

726
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Come in, please.

727
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Come in, please.

728
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,200
Welcome.

729
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,200
Come in, please.

730
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Welcome.

731
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,200
Please.

732
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,200
Please.

733
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,200
Welcome.

734
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,200
Please have a seat.

735
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,200
Have a look.

736
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,200
Please.

737
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,200
Have a look.

738
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,200
Please.

739
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
Please.

740
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,200
Please.

741
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,200
Have a look.

742
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,200
Please.

743
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,200
Please.

744
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
Have a look.

745
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
It looks good.

746
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
Try it in warships.

747
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,200
Okay.

748
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:38,200
The sun rises, the cold is fast

749
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,200
The heart wants love, happiness comes

750
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
The food is all in the fridge

751
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,200
The happiness of missing you

752
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
Walking through the mountains and rivers

753
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,200
The happiest thing is to eat this food

754
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,200
The sun rises, the glass is full, the moon is full, the sun is full

755
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,200
The sun rises, the mountains are full, the mountains are full

756
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,200
The sun rises, the smile is about to bloom in spring

757
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,200
You are here, I am here, waiting for summer to warm up

758
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,200
The sun rises, the glass is full, the moon is full, the sun is full

759
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,200
The sun rises, the lights are on, the universe is warm and wide

760
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,200
The sun rises, the clouds are full, the four seasons are long

761
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,200
The sky is bitter, the snow is white, the clouds are white

762
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,200
The life is worth waiting for you, the life is worth waiting for you

763
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,200
The sun rises, the cold is fast

764
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,200
The heart wants love, happiness comes

765
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
The food is all in the fridge

766
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
The happiness of missing you

767
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
Walking through the mountains and rivers

768
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,200
The happiest thing is to eat this food

769
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,200
The night is bright, the sand is full, the people are looking forward to it

770
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,200
The future is in the deep, the people are not ashamed of this state

771
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,200
The moon is back, the sky is bright, the south is full, the star is still there

772
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
Time flies too fast

773
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,200
Life is like this, we all have to be happy

774
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,200
The day is over, the moon is bright, the moon is full

775
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,200
The day is over, the mountains are still full, the mountains are full

776
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,200
The day is over, the smile is about to bloom in spring

777
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,200
You are here, I am here, waiting for summer to warm up

778
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,200
The day is over, the home is full of water
