1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Six months

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
One year

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Small

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Taste it again!

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's impossible.

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
How can pork taste like this?

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I've been trying for days, but I can't make it.

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You're a piece of shit!

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You can't even smell it.

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What are you doing? Are you a sheep?

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What?

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Boss!

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Boss, you're here too.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's been a long time.

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Not only did we lose to the Shen Family, but we also lost a lot.

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Now that they're together,

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
you don't have any new strategies.

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
In seven days, if the Shen Family doesn't close,

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
you'll get out of here.

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes.

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Boss.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Boss.

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes.

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Fengxia.

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Wait.

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
There's something I'm not clear about.

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I think we need to clarify it.

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm the first one in the Shen Family.

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
A while ago,

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I was busy with my personal career development.

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I neglected your feelings.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's my fault.

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But you'll always remember that I'm a good man who never forgets his roots.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I remember when I first came to Yongan,

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I was so angry that I crushed your golden sword.

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's okay.

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I bought you another one.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Do you want to try?

89
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Come on, stretch your hand out.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Stretch your hand out.

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're still holding a ring.

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
This is the middle finger.

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Middle finger.

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes.

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No, Mr. Du.

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's the size we bought for our wedding.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Enough. Stop it.

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It hurts.

99
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You didn't expect that, right?

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
How much work did we do for the past few years?

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
My fingers must be thicker than before.

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Impossible.

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It must be the ring seller.

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I got it wrong.

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'll find him tomorrow and change it for him.

106
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll find him tomorrow and change it for him.

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll find him tomorrow and change it for him.

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll find him tomorrow and change it for him.

109
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I got it wrong.

110
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'll find him tomorrow and change it for him.

111
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But it's a small matter.

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't mind it.

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What's the point?

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Your husband is now a person who can make a lot of money

115
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
with his own ability.

116
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
From now on, you just follow me and have a good life.

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't be so angry.

118
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay, first table.

119
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Go do your job.

120
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What's wrong?

121
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You're not right again.

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I didn't have money before.

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I can't buy you a gift.

124
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I can understand that you're angry.

125
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Now I have money.

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I can buy you a gift.

127
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You're still angry.

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I tell you.

129
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Next year is the chef competition.

130
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I want to take the first place in this competition.

131
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm the first chef in Yongan.

132
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That's amazing.

133
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes, you're not the same as before.

134
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You said you used to be the latest.

135
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You know how to do some work for me and prepare some dishes.

136
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Now you only brag.

137
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
First dish first dish.

138
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't you feel ashamed?

139
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Didn't I help you?

140
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I can't get over it.

141
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm busy with my own career development.

142
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Besides, my current social status.

143
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Can you be as influential as before?

144
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm the only one in this restaurant.

145
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
If there's no me in this restaurant,

146
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll be the only one in this restaurant.

147
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What social status do you have?

148
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
No.

149
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What social influence do you have?

150
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You can say that you're the only one in this restaurant.

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Shen Jianshe, I really doubt you.

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Is your nature like this?

153
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Or you didn't show your stage before?

154
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's because I didn't show my stage.

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If I had shown my stage, I would have done it earlier.

156
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You, I'll make you live now.

157
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll make you live now.

158
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Why do you still kick people?

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Go cook.

160
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What's going on?

161
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Sir, why did you fall?

162
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Are you okay?

163
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Sir, what's wrong with you?

164
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What's going on?

165
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Sir, are you okay?

166
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Sir, get up.

167
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Get up.

168
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Slowly.

169
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Slowly.

170
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Sir.

171
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Are you having a stomachache?

172
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Are you okay?

173
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Sir.

174
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Sir.

175
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Sir.

176
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Are you okay?

177
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Are you okay?

178
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Sir, what's wrong with you?

179
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Brother, don't go to the bus.

180
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Brother, please send someone.

181
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay.

182
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Get up.

183
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Qi, I think...

184
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Sit down.

185
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The food is toxic.

186
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Your food is not clean.

187
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I want to report.

188
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Sir, this way please.

189
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
After the Qixi Society,

190
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
all the branches have given the first princess a bow and arrow.

191
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But she didn't see it.

192
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Only received the post of the husband.

193
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But now I feel that

194
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
this thing is strange.

195
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We want to ask from the first princess.

196
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Maybe the first princess

197
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
has something to know from the Jinzhao family.

198
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Please watch the game.

199
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I thought you would be with me for a long time.

200
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Then I received the question.

201
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The first princess is smart.

202
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Why do I have to go around the bend?

203
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
For ten years, Jinzhao has been changing sixteen people.

204
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The drunk is only two years old.

205
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I naturally want to ask the first princess for some reason.

206
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's not something that only happened in the past ten years.

207
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
All equal.

208
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Who doesn't want it?

209
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But the jade coffin case 17 years ago,

210
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Jinzhao has been trying to lure you.

211
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Didn't get any benefits.

212
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And even put on the whole family's life.

213
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
This matter has been settled.

214
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But the real beneficiary has left.

215
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Now,

217
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I think it's better to drink with the court.

218
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I heard from the crown prince that

219
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
the jade coffin case has a different feeling.

220
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You're wrong.

221
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I also have the time to ask these.

222
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But don't worry.

223
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Even if there is any conflict,

224
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm also standing by your side.

225
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Someone is protecting you.

226
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You don't have to be afraid of anything.

227
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Thank you for your kindness.

228
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Kindness?

229
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Anran uses the word kindness.

230
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's wonderful.

231
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You people are so kind.

232
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Your Highness.

233
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You're cuter than the old people in the court.

234
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Anran.

235
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I think I'm very close to you.

236
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
In the future, the royal family,

237
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Anran should come often.

238
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Your Highness.

239
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Anran can also bring her friends.

240
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Your Highness.

241
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Your Highness.

242
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Your Highness.

243
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Someone from the Jinzhao family said that they have an urgent matter to ask you.

244
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What's the matter?

245
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Your Highness.

246
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Young Master.

247
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The Shen family's 14th child is poisoned.

248
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The number of people is quite high.

249
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You hurt my brother.

250
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Today, I will teach you to close this shop.

251
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Get out of the way.

252
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Don't come here.

253
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Listen to me.

254
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Before this matter is clear,

255
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Don't be impulsive.

256
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Don't do anything.

257
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
My brother is still on the step.

258
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Life and death are not guaranteed.

259
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Tell me not to do anything.

260
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Brothers.

261
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Smash this shop.

262
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Smash it.

263
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Smash it.

264
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Come here.

265
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Come here.

266
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Smash it.

267
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Smash it.

268
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What's the matter?

269
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What's the matter?

270
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Come here.

271
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Come here.

272
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I told you not to be impulsive.

273
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The case is not over yet.

274
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
If anyone dares to move,

275
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You will be punished.

276
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Did you hear that?

277
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Who is coming?

278
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Go to jail.

279
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Jinzhao family.

280
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You have to do something for us.

281
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The people of Jinzhao family are here.

282
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Good.

283
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The Shen family's 14th child is poisoned.

284
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Should we take him to jail?

285
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yes.

286
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Take him to jail.

287
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You have no evidence.

288
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You are talking nonsense.

289
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I heard it a long time ago.

290
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I heard that.

291
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The Shen family and Lin Shaoyin are relatives, right?

292
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
No wonder your black shop will keep opening.

293
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Your shop owner has not been demoted.

294
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It turns out that Lin Shaoyin is covering them.

295
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes.

296
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Covering them.

297
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I want to ask you why you are in jail.

298
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You don't want to find out the truth.

299
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You keep calling us to close the door.

300
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm afraid someone is behind you.

301
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yes.

302
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Someone is behind you.

303
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
My brother was poisoned by your family.

304
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You are talking nonsense.

305
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He is talking nonsense.

306
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I will fight with you.

307
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I will fight with you.

308
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Grandpa.

309
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Why are you still here?

310
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Come on.

311
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Come on.

312
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Come on.

313
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Grandpa.

314
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Are you all right?

315
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You saw it.

316
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
They want to kill me.

317
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Are you all right?

318
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
They want to kill me.

319
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm about to die.

320
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Look at me.

321
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The flesh on my teeth was bitten by you.

322
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
They have killed so many people.

323
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
They have killed so many people.

324
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
They want to kill me.

325
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Grandpa, it's too serious.

326
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's too serious.

327
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Look, you were bitten by someone.

328
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Look, you were bitten by someone.

329
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
They want to kill me.

330
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What are you doing?

331
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What are you doing?

332
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Smash this room.

333
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Smash it.

334
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Come on.

335
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Come on.

336
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Stop them.

337
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Come on.

338
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Keep going.

339
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Keep going.

340
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I saw it.

341
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Stop.

342
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
They want to kill me.

343
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Young Master is coming.

344
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Young Master is coming.

345
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Hurry up.

346
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
He must be standing in our way.

347
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
He must be standing in our way.

348
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What's his name?

349
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Zhongli is coming.

350
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What's his name?

351
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What's his name?

352
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Get up.

353
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's okay.

354
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Don't think you have relatives in the official position.

355
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You just want to overthrow the black and white.

356
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You saw it.

357
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
This is called deceiving people.

358
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Don't talk nonsense.

359
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Who can help my brother?

360
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Don't be so rude.

361
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You want to believe the government?

362
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yes.

363
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
If Lin Shao Ying comes to the official position,

364
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
he won't protect them.

365
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Right.

366
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But if they are relatives,

367
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Lin Shao Ying should avoid the suspicion and back him up.

368
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Lin Shao Ying.

369
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Young Master.

370
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You should avoid the suspicion.

371
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes, Young Master.

372
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You should avoid the suspicion.

373
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You can't participate.

374
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Lock up the Fourteenth.

375
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Young Master, why are you holding our restaurant?

376
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Young Master.

377
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
No.

378
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Young Master, why are you holding our restaurant?

379
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Young Master.

380
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Young Master.

381
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Bear with it.

382
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
This old bastard.

383
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
He bites here.

384
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
This is where you usually pinch me.

385
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's the holy place.

386
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's the protection area.

387
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Why does he bite?

388
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Why are you still so arrogant?

389
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's not the time.

390
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Why are you still so arrogant?

391
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay.

392
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Okay.

393
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Come on, put it in.

394
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Okay.

395
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I said, the ancestors.

396
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Why did they give up so quickly before?

397
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
They were afraid that we would be implicated.

398
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
They wanted to get rid of the relationship as soon as possible.

399
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'll say something unpleasant.

400
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
At his age,

401
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
at his age,

402
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
in this kind of dynasty,

403
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
he is definitely a super young man.

404
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
We have a marriage contract.

405
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
This is all on his side.

406
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
He doesn't know what to do.

407
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
He...

408
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Enough.

409
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Enough.

410
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
How many times have we said not to mention the marriage contract?

411
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Just turn it over.

412
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Why are you still mentioning it?

413
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Wife, I'll say a few words.

414
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
If I'm wrong, you can criticize me.

415
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I think Gongtai is right this time.

416
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Isn't it?

417
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
This matter is not clear yet.

418
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
He locked up the restaurant for me.

419
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
As an ancestor,

420
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
he didn't care about his own life

421
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
for his own sake.

422
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
He just stayed at home.

423
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's not appropriate.

424
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Does the ancestor really ignore us?

425
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
He didn't ask clearly.

426
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
He just didn't let us put such a big seal.

427
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Why doesn't he care?

428
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
He is the ambassador of justice.

429
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
How fast he cares.

430
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Okay, then the help is affection.

431
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's not necessary to help.

432
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Isn't there enough help for us?

433
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
We still live in their house now.

434
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Then we can't lock up the restaurant.

435
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Didn't we say that we have to rely on ourselves to build a family in Yongan?

436
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
We can't just talk about the ancestors.

437
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I think you are right.

438
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
We rely on the mountains and the islands.

439
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
We rely on our ancestors.

440
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
We can't rely on our luck every time.

441
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
This time, we have to rely on ourselves to pass this test.

442
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Wife, you are right.

443
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
We have to rely on ourselves.

444
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I also found one thing.

445
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's...

446
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Look.

447
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
The first person to report the case.

448
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And also said that we are relatives with our ancestors.

449
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
We are the same person.

450
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That is, Yao Wang's big bad.

451
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I think he is looking for this person with a purpose.

452
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
He must be the one who did it.

453
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
They are indeed the most powerful.

454
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
If we can't get the pork, they will start to make a fuss.

455
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Besides,

456
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
we have to take the initiative to attack the defense of the Shen family.

457
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
My brother has been in the hospital for a whole night.

458
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You must save him.

459
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What's going on?

460
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Why does the Shen family pretend to be the poison?

461
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The doctor is in the hospital.

462
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It seems to be very serious.

463
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Wife, what's going on with your big bad?

464
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Don't mention it.

465
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
We are different from the old Jiu Si.

466
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
We eat the food we give to the guests.

467
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So our big bad is poisoned.

468
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Poisoned?

469
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Your big bad really eats his own food.

470
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Poisoned.

471
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's scary.

472
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But after eating, it's thick and greasy.

473
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's greasy and greasy.

474
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Then I fainted.

475
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Here.

476
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Pull me in.

477
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Be sure to pull it tight.

478
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Hurry up, there are people over there.

479
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Don't pull me in.

480
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Let me go.

481
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Don't think too much.

482
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Don't be impulsive.

483
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What can't you think of?

484
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
If our father asks you,

485
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
how can I let my son eat it?

486
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Our big bad is almost dead.

487
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'll kill you.

488
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Don't think too much.

489
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I want to live.

490
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Shen Yan.

491
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm innocent.

492
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm innocent.

493
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Please help me.

494
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm really innocent.

495
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
My family members.

496
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
My family members are poisoned.

497
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
My big bad is poisoned.

498
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
My grandfather was killed.

499
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
My family members.

500
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You have seen innocent people.

501
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You have seen more innocent people than me.

502
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm really innocent.

503
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
My family members.

504
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Please help me.

505
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm innocent.

506
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I said my brother was poisoned.

507
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
If he can't blow the wind, how can he see you?

508
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Mrs. Shen.

509
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
People are saying that Shen Dalang is poisoned.

510
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Let's go in and see.

511
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
We will find out the truth.

512
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'll give you a clear picture.

513
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Please make yourself comfortable.

514
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
My grandfather was poisoned.

515
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We finally saved him.

516
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You want him to blow the wind.

517
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
He's going to die.

518
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Who is dead?

519
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Who is dying?

520
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Let's go in and see.

521
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'll find out the person who poisoned you.

522
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Just one look.

523
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You will find out the truth.

524
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You don't have to come.

525
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You're making it hard for me.

526
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Leave it to me.

527
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Young master.

528
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Please go down.

529
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Okay.

530
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Shen is not poisoned.

531
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Young master.

532
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You didn't tell us the truth.

533
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Now you're here to test us.

534
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Even if you want to kill your family.

535
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You're too anxious.

536
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Young master, you're too bad.

537
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I don't want to talk to you.

538
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Please go back.

539
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
No, Shaogua.

540
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Mrs. Shen.

541
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Mrs. Shen.

542
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I sealed the door for ten times.

543
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So the person who poisoned me can wake up.

544
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I've found the clue.

545
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
How's the situation?

546
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
There are many people who are sick.

547
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Some people say they see a little man jumping.

548
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It looks like a gentleman is poisoned.

549
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I asked the merchants who sell your gentlemen.

550
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
They said that the manager of Yunlai nine times.

551
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
He talked to him many times.

552
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The people who do business in the west market are the ones who do business in the rules.

553
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
There won't be any problem.

554
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Most of them are the managers of Yunlai.

555
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
He asked which are the goods for us.

556
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
He secretly changed the poisonous clothes.

557
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I also guessed so.

558
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But there is no evidence yet.

559
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Young master.

560
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
We wronged you before.

561
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
We thought you only cared about your business.

562
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You don't care about us.

563
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm sorry.

564
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Come on.

565
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Hurry up.

566
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I apologize to the master who did good for the family.

567
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm sorry.

568
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
No.

569
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
We wronged you.

570
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
We wronged you.

571
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
No.

572
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I should have explained it clearly at the beginning.

573
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's my fault.

574
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
No.

575
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
How can you be a mistake?

576
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's my fault.

577
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I was too impulsive and scolded you behind your back.

578
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I deserve to die.

579
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Brother Shen scolded me behind my back.

580
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I...

581
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Did he scold you?

582
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Sit down.

583
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What should we do next?

584
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Yes.

585
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
The ancients are superstitious.

586
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
We should...

587
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
No.

588
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
The ancients are superstitious.

589
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Right?

590
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Look.

591
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I pretended to be dead and killed him.

592
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You were pretending to be ghosts and scared the master.

593
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You were talking nonsense.

594
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
When did the ancients say that the people of Yongan are superstitious?

595
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Maybe it's true.

596
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Don't you think Mr. Feng likes to believe in those mysterious things?

597
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
There are indeed many mysterious things in the wine.

598
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And I always see Mr. Feng with a information cup.

599
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,280
Then we should

600
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,440
buy other items from other walks of life.

601
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,440
Let me see.

602
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,760
If he's saying that you're a gentleman's ghost,

603
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,920
it doesn't mean you're not a man.

604
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,000
KILLER

605
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,320
Mansion,

606
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,880
go to go and cook

607
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,560
.

608
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,960
Glup,

609
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,960
with rice.

610
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,280
Gouge,

611
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,120
thank you for being so good at least this is

612
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,960
said about

613
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
You really are a good girl.

614
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,960
Is it okay?

615
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,960
Be careful.

616
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,960
Don't worry.

617
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,960
A Yuan and I have practiced in the Cloud Water House several times.

618
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
We'll be able to win if we get married.

619
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
Be careful.

620
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,960
Aunt, fighting!

621
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
I'm hungry.

622
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,960
Someone is coming.

623
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,960
Help!

624
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,960
Are you okay?

625
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
Thank you, Young Master.

626
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,960
So there really is a love dream in this world.

627
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,960
Young Master, how did you fly just now?

628
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,960
Can you take me to fly too?

629
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,960
Why do you have to fly?

630
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,960
We haven't done anything serious yet.

631
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,960
Then, fighting!

632
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,960
You have to be careful.

633
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
We haven't done anything serious yet.

634
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
Don't hurt yourself.

635
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,960
Wait.

636
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,960
Be careful.

637
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,960
Be careful.

638
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,960
Who is it?

639
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,960
Who is there?

640
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,960
Who is there?

641
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,960
Why did you poison me?

642
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,960
Why did you poison me?

643
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,960
Who is there?

644
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,960
Who is there?

645
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Who did this to you?

646
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,960
Who did this to you?

647
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,960
You did this to me.

648
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,960
Otherwise, we would have died together.

649
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,960
It wasn't me.

650
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,960
It was Manager Feng who did this.

651
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,960
I didn't want to kill anyone.

652
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,960
Su Jing.

653
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,960
You are a man of your word.

654
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,960
You are allowed to break the law.

655
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,960
You will be in the government for three years.

656
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,960
You will be punished for your crime.

657
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,960
The Shen Family has found out that

658
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,960
the Shen Family was framed.

659
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,960
They didn't mean to poison you.

660
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
You will be released in a few days.

661
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,960
Thank you, Chief Cao.

662
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,960
Dismiss.

663
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,960
This time, it's Chief Cao from the Ministry of Justice.

664
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,960
He was on a case in the capital.

665
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,960
He is a criminal.

666
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,960
He will not keep the Shen Family.

667
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,960
I said the Shen Family is innocent.

668
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,960
Now, I beg you forget to challenge me.

669
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,960
I and you,

670
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
we committed these crimes for su foam.

671
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,960
Thank you, Master.

672
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,960
Master.

673
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
Why should we thank someone

674
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,960
for giving us incense?

675
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,960
This is our custom.

676
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,960
You really helped us.

677
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,960
Our gratitude is beyond several words.

678
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,460
Hey.

679
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,720
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

680
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,840
Master is here.

681
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,440
Please be my disciple.

682
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,520
I want to learn from master.

683
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,480
What are you doing?

684
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,360
Get up. Get up.

685
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,360
What are you doing?

686
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,160
I saw it in the drama with grandma.

687
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,640
That's how you read books.

688
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,760
Master is here.

689
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,040
Please be my disciple.

690
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,440
If master doesn't take me as his disciple,

691
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,360
I'll keep kneeling.

692
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,160
I won't get up.

693
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,320
I want...

694
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,720
I want to kneel on the ground.

695
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,680
Yangyang.

696
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,640
What? What's going on?

697
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,520
Yangyang.

698
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,280
Get up. Get up.

699
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,080
You...

700
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,240
How can you be the disciple of Master?

701
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,680
If you want to be his disciple,

702
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,160
what kind of person are you?

703
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,280
Am I right?

704
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,280
You're a fool.

705
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,880
You're right.

706
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,640
Master is Yangyang's master.

707
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,440
He loves only half of her.

708
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,600
I'm master of his disciple.

709
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
If you say so,

710
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,240
you'll have to give me the title of Master.

711
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,040
Enough. Stop talking nonsense.

712
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,280
If you keep talking nonsense, the food will get cold.

713
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,640
Let's cook for the pigs.

714
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,440
Master, sit down.

715
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,840
Yes. Let's eat.

716
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,680
Come on.

717
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,760
Master, have some rice.

718
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,120
Okay.

719
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,440
Have some meat.

720
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:02,920
Master.

721
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,680
Add some to Master.

722
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,680
Have some lamb chops.

723
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,480
I cooked it.

724
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,400
Thank you.

725
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:07,960
Here.

726
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,400
I'll add some to you.

727
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,280
I want to learn how to cook.

728
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,160
Yangyang, have some food first.

729
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,400
I'll teach you after you finish.

730
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,560
Okay.

731
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,880
Master, this one is very delicious.

732
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,720
Brother Shen, that's enough.

733
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,560
This one.

734
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,360
Have some vegetables, Yangyang.

735
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,120
I made it.

736
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,640
Okay.

737
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,840
Here.

738
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,640
Eat.

739
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,920
Master, hurry up.

740
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,800
Master, I want to listen to the song.

741
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,920
I want to fly to the pavilion.

742
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,040
Come on.

743
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,680
Come on.

744
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,840
Master, help me.

745
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,360
Master.

746
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,920
Master, help me.

747
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
Master, help me.

748
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,440
Master.

749
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,080
Master.

750
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,480
Master, help me.

751
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,000
Master.

752
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,160
Yangyang, what did you call me?

753
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,080
Master?

754
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,480
Master is a word of appreciation in our hometown.

755
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,400
When someone is scared or excited,

756
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
he calls you master.

757
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,400
You're really a talkative person.

758
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,360
Aren't you going to learn how to do the Qinggong?

759
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,600
Why are you scared again?

760
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,240
I forgot.

761
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,720
I'm afraid of my grandpa.

762
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,160
Yangyang, you won't be afraid if you try it a few more times.

763
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,120
Do you want to try it again?

764
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,400
No, I don't want to.

765
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,560
I'm going to wash the dishes.

766
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,000
You're so timid.

767
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,160
You're going to wash the dishes?

768
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,160
He's so tall.

769
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,400
He can only wash the dishes early.

770
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,120
But, Master,

771
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,280
what did you feel when you used the Qinggong?

772
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,840
What did you feel when you used the Qinggong?

773
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,320
Young lady.

774
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,280
Young lady.

775
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,600
You scared me!

776
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,040
How could it be?

777
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,640
I thought you were curious about the Qinggong.

778
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,160
I'm not.

779
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,280
All right.

780
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,480
After all, I misunderstood you for the sake of the master.

781
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,200
You don't care about us.

782
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,320
I'm sorry.

783
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,800
How could it be because of this?

784
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,920
Then why?

785
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,160
Forget it.

786
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,760
I'm being petty.

787
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,560
Please don't mind me.

788
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,200
How could you be petty?

789
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,760
You're the young master of Jingzhao.

790
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,280
How could you be petty?

791
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,000
So, the Yongan in Xiaojin is so beautiful.

792
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,240
It's not inferior to the old one.

793
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,920
You always mention your old home.

794
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,200
It seems that you prefer the old one

795
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,600
more than the Yongan.

796
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,520
I'm not.

797
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,360
I'm not.

798
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,240
I'm not.

799
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,160
I'm not.

800
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,800
You prefer the old one more?

801
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,200
It's good to have our own.

802
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,240
But we have equal people and convenient life.

803
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,040
And we don't have Xiaojin.

804
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,480
We have more freedom.

805
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,120
We have our own thoughts about wedding and funeral.

806
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,440
It's better.

807
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,600
You once said that

808
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,640
your old home is not in Qingyang.

809
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,040
You met my parents

810
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,360
after you went to Qingyang.

811
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,160
So, where is your old home?

812
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,400
Why do you know it so well?

813
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,160
It's called Wei Lai Xiang.

814
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,040
It's a remote place.

815
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,760
You may not know it.

816
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,160
Wei Lai Xiang?

817
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,760
A place that hasn't been to before?

818
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,960
You're good at reading and writing.

819
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,360
You must know it well.

820
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,680
Shao Ying, you're so good at scolding people.

821
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,240
I can't understand it

822
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,800
if I haven't read two books.

823
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,680
But I'm not a bookworm.

824
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,840
It just takes more than a thousand years

825
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,800
to see the equal future of everyone.

826
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,880
Indeed.

827
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,640
If you want to be equal,

828
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,560
you must have wealth.

829
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,400
You can't afford it now.

830
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,680
But if you have a wide field of land,

831
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,560
and you make people aware of your family,

832
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,520
and you don't have to guard the road at night,

833
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,400
you may get closer to the future you said.

834
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,280
Shao Ying, you know this.

835
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,720
The economy is the foundation for the building of the upper level.

836
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,240
I've never heard that before.

837
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,880
The economy is the foundation for the building of the upper level.

838
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,840
It's really interesting.

839
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,160
You can understand it?

840
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,920
Shao Ying, you're really good at it.

841
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,280
I've never thought that

842
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,680
someone in this era could understand it.

843
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,280
My father was promoted to the governor of Jingzhao

844
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,160
and the whole family was in the capital.

845
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,120
A few years later, he was arrested

846
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,720
and imprisoned.

847
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,200
Liu Chang and I escaped for the rest of our lives.

848
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,560
But my parents and family...

849
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,560
Although the Cui Sheng family didn't get married officially,

850
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,600
it must have been a big burden on you.

851
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,960
In the old days,

852
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,480
you were the only one who could take care of the family.

853
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,840
You were the only one who could take care of the family.

854
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,600
It must have been a big burden on you

855
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
in the old days.

856
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,000
So you don't want to tell me the real story of that year

857
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,960
and even say the words of the future.

858
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,080
I can understand it.

859
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,080
It's okay.

860
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,200
It's all in the past.

861
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,480
Now it's us who are causing trouble for Shao Ying.

862
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,480
Shao Ying has gone through so much trouble.

863
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,320
I will definitely work hard in the future.

864
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,840
I was really not very sensible

865
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,400
in the past.

866
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,400
You were just a friend.

867
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,560
Yes, I was.

868
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,120
You were just a friend.

869
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,040
Didn't Shao Ying say that

870
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,280
he wouldn't make friends?

871
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,920
People change.

872
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,560
Then we are friends.

873
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,600
In the future,

874
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,800
you have to shake hands with your friends.

875
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,920
Shake hands?

876
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,560
It's so beautiful.

877
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,640
Although I still miss my hometown,

878
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,680
but after experiencing all these things recently,

879
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,960
I seem to like it here more and more.

880
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,760
There is no small town on the mountain.

881
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,760
The city will be more beautiful when the lights are on.

882
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,760
I will take you to see it then.

883
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,760
Really?

884
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Thank you, Shao Ying.

885
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,000
I will definitely come back.

886
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Thank you, Young Master. You are so nice.

887
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I will definitely come back.

888
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

889
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I will definitely come back.

890
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

891
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I will definitely come back.

892
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

893
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I will definitely come back.

894
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

895
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

896
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

897
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

898
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

899
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

900
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

901
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

902
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

903
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

904
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

905
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

906
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

907
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

908
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

909
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

910
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

911
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Thank you, Shao Ying.

912
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
The rain falls in the rain.

913
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
The wind blows.

914
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
The clouds are in the forest.

915
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Listen.

916
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Once you understand, you will know.

917
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
True love or just a memory.

918
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You are the dragon in the dream.

919
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
You are the star in the sky.

920
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I can't sigh.

921
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I see you under the moon.

922
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I can't help but feel sad when I talk to you.

923
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I can't help but feel sad when I talk to you.

924
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I thought the coldness in my eyes

925
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
made me red.

926
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Even the ice in my heart

927
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
is a heart that is not hot.

928
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
You are the sound of laughter.

929
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
You are the logic.

930
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I need to put you in my life.

931
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I can't help but feel sad when I talk to you.

932
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I can't help but feel sad when I talk to you.

933
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
When I run to you, I'm confused.

934
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'm addicted to you.

935
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm still her family.

936
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
When my heart beats, the wind blows.

937
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
The latest shadow.

938
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
The hidden you that I used to be shy.

939
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I've been missing you all my life.

940
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Love is a holiday.

941
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm going to wander around.

942
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I'll come back to you.

943
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm going to get close to you.

944
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I'm going to be more and more.

945
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Only we are not easy.

946
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Maybe we are too much.

947
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm willing to love forever.

948
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Will you not believe us?

949
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I've been missing you all my life.

950
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Love is a holiday.

951
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I'm going to wander around.

952
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I'll come back to you.

953
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I'm going to get close to you.

954
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I'm going to be more and more.

955
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Only we are not easy.
