1
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:01,990
=Yummy Yummy Yummy=

2
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,900
=Episode 6=

3
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,060
I disagree.

4
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,280
You absolutely mustn't take this job.

5
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,900
Our family just needs to earn
some money selling at the stall.

6
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,560
Hosting this kind of noble banquet...

7
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,200
One wrong move and it
could cost us our heads.

8
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,620
Jicai,

9
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,040
your mom is right.

10
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,890
Even if we pull off
this banquet successfully,

11
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,580
it'd be

12
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,040
too conspicuous.

13
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,860
Our return date is approaching soon.

14
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,340
Play it safe. Be prudent.

15
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,640
- Yeah.
- Right. Makes sense.

16
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,260
Let's drop it then.

17
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,200
Meeting adjourned.

18
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,800
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

19
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,960
Oh, right,

20
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,220
the ancestor said

21
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,760
the reward for hosting the banquet

22
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,840
is a gold brick.

23
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,780
Now that you mention it,

24
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,020
this thing...

25
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,160
I remember that,

26
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,880
as the saying goes,

27
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,080
"Great wealth comes from great risks."

28
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,920
- Yes.
- Right.

29
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,700
It's not like we can't try this.

30
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,560
Your mom is right again!

31
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,300
Think about it. Back in modern times,

32
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,280
- how many big banquets did we host?
- Exactly.

33
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,180
Did anything go wrong?

34
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,260
No!

35
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,740
So what could possibly go wrong

36
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,860
with an ancient banquet?

37
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,800
Right.

38
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,420
Did we host banquets in modern times?

39
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,680
Of course we did.

40
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,740
That one.

41
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,680
Then...

42
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,940
I remember.

43
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,640
You mean that Gongcai got married

44
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,100
in that little restaurant

45
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,380
on our first floor.

46
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,740
Why... bring up
that embarrassing history again?

47
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,680
Dad,

48
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,980
was your and Mom's wedding

49
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,460
in a little restaurant?

50
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,440
Yeah.

51
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,340
My good friend told me

52
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,100
their parents' weddings were all

53
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,580
in beautiful, luxurious,

54
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,700
big hotels.

55
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,340
Theirs was all show and no substance.

56
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,500
- Exactly.
- Besides,

57
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,280
you don't understand
adult matters, Yangyang.

58
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,160
You don't get it.

59
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,620
So, everyone's thought it through?

60
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,740
Since it's over,

61
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,660
no time like the present.
Let's start preparing.

62
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,260
Good. It's settled then.

63
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,300
(On the Qixi Festival,
people need to make flower cakes.)

64
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,030
(Since we want something fresh,)

65
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,020
(let's use cheese to make cheese buns.)

66
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,500
Shen Gongcai is really something.

67
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,020
No sign of him all day.

68
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,860
Who wrote this?

69
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,540
Worse than me.

70
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,420
Shen Gongcai!

71
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,220
Shen Gongcai.

72
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,900
Get up!

73
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,820
Stop playing dead!

74
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,860
What?

75
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,100
I've been busy till now!

76
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,420
Mom and Dad took Yangyang out

77
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,460
shopping all day,

78
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,180
and you're lying here?

79
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,460
- Get up!
- Head...

80
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,620
Head hurts...

81
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,420
- Get up!
- Heart... heart hurts.

82
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,300
Really.

83
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,020
I want to throw up.

84
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,940
Feel awful.

85
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,100
Really awful.

86
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,860
Might as well be lazy to death!

87
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,180
Wasting food, too.

88
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,460
I really feel awful.

89
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,780
Want me to work?

90
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,220
Not a chance.

91
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,900
Shen Gongcai

92
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,220
doesn't sprout crops when farming.

93
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,540
Lazy to death, I say!

94
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,180
Shen Gongcai,

95
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,140
you finally decided...

96
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,540
Vice Prefect?

97
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,420
In your eyes,

98
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,320
how thick-skulled must Shen be?

99
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,220
I wouldn't actually hit him.

100
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,940
I couldn't let you do this kind of work.

101
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,500
You are...

102
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,100
You are the Vice Prefect.

103
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,000
After all, these are

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,860
preparations for Her Highness.

105
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,850
I also gave my guarantee.

106
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,620
I need to handle it personally
to feel assured.

107
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,220
What?

108
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,580
Why are you laughing?

109
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,060
Is... is there something on my face?

110
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,540
No... Don't...

111
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,420
I'm laughing
because you're really a good person.

112
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,260
You clearly just want to help.

113
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,340
Afraid I'd feel burdened,
so you make up an excuse.

114
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,100
You're overthinking it.

115
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,180
Wait...

116
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,700
Vice Prefect, that robe
must be expensive, right?

117
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,900
Don't get it dirty.

118
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,540
The robe doesn't matter.

119
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,740
But what about you?

120
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,580
Stop fidgeting.

121
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,900
You can't tie it.

122
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,780
My mother made these herself.

123
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,730
They're called sleeve covers.

124
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,780
She made this apron

125
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,940
I'm wearing, too.

126
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,260
She's very skillful.

127
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,100
Alright.

128
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,300
You...

129
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,300
It's fine.

130
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,740
You're a natural hero,

131
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,780
a man of valor.

132
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,340
How could a mere maiden's pink color

133
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,860
diminish that?

134
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,940
Here, try this Qixi flower cake

135
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,500
before it even reaches

136
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,900
Her Highness's table.

137
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,820
Good for you.

138
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,220
It seems my luck is good.

139
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,860
Here.

140
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,340
Delicious.

141
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,220
This time for Qixi,

142
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,740
most would prepare fruits.

143
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,680
There are also pastries.

144
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,200
But since it's for begging for skill,

145
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,420
beautifully crafted pastries
are more suitable

146
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,100
than melons, pears,
peaches, or other fruits.

147
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,140
So I made this Qixi flower cake.

148
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,540
Is such care

149
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,020
because of the Qixi Festival?

150
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,900
It's for the Princess.

151
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,160
Sounded like there would be a benefit.

152
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,860
I don't like the Qixi Festival.

153
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,980
The cowherd lusted
after the weaver girl.

154
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,500
He hid her clothes,

155
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,430
and under the guise of love,

156
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,450
he tricked her into staying there
to bear children.

157
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,380
What love legend?

158
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,420
Right from the start,

159
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,300
he gave the weaver girl
no freedom of choice.

160
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,220
You make a valid point.

161
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,420
However,

162
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,740
most who wrote the stories were men.

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,260
Whether intentionally glossing over

164
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,460
or unintentionally doing so,

165
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,100
most wouldn't consider what you said.

166
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,500
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

167
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,900
I think the flavor is quite good.

168
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,820
And it's cheap, too.

169
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,980
Listen,

170
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,520
the very first person to write
the story of cowherd and weaver girl

171
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,490
definitely wasn't a girl.

172
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,780
Otherwise, how could
the weaver girl fall in love

173
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,240
with the cowherd
after he stole her clothes

174
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,100
and bound her to the mortal world?

175
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,620
Just think about it,
she must have been forced.

176
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,980
But the cowherd did it

177
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,180
because he liked her.

178
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,740
But the prerequisite
for liking is respect.

179
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,900
He should at least respect

180
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,420
others' freedom to not like him.

181
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,260
(+5 moves)

182
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,420
Dead again.

183
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,940
Why is this level so hard?

184
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,140
You're just watching a show.

185
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,180
How annoying.

186
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,940
What does it matter
what the show's like?

187
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,300
Eat it.

188
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,220
Truly worthy of being

189
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,160
the youngest Vice Prefect
of Capital Prefecture in history.

190
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,860
Perspective.

191
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,980
What does it mean?

192
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,220
It means you're magnanimous

193
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,820
and broad-minded.

194
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,610
Unlike some people who,
even after passing the exam,

195
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,720
their essential nature isn't good.

196
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,100
Must be our family genes are good.

197
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,340
What?

198
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,700
Passing the exam?

199
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,220
Genes? What do these mean?

200
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,260
These are some words I made up.

201
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,500
Passing the exam...

202
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,260
It means "rely on".

203
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,620
Some people are good at weaving tales.

204
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,690
They rely on it to make a living.

205
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,220
Genes...

206
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,620
Basically, because our family is good,

207
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,620
and you're part of our family,

208
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,820
so you're good, too.

209
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,480
Liar.

210
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,980
I think you're the one

211
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,340
who is spouting utter nonsense.

212
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,700
I can't pass.

213
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,820
Truly can't pass.

214
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,940
(Princess Fuhui's Mansion)

215
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,100
Twelfth Master, did you get lice on you?

216
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,100
This robe you lent me

217
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,700
is too elegant.

218
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,700
It highlights

219
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,860
the grace of me,
a descendant of the Pei clan.

220
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,540
If my clansmen saw me,

221
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,140
they probably wouldn't recognize me.

222
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,900
Mr. Zhou, you have such fine taste.

223
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,500
Clothes make the man.

224
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,300
You do look

225
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,300
somewhat respectable now.

226
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,620
Right?

227
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,900
Is that a compliment?

228
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,300
Third Master.

229
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,980
I have fine wine,

230
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,460
with which to feast
and delight my honored guests.

231
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,980
I have fine wine,

232
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,380
with which to gladden
the hearts of my honored guests.

233
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,980
At today's poetry gathering,

234
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,020
I fear only that I'm a mere commoner.

235
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,020
(Liu Feng, Young Master of Guixiang Tavern)
I never thought

236
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,060
a mere merchant like myself

237
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,300
would be here.

238
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,700
You jest.

239
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:29,900
You are Liu Feng,

240
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,980
the Third Master Liu.

241
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,820
Your Guixiang Tavern

242
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,980
prides itself on elegance.

243
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,350
Only those capable
of producing timeless masterpieces

244
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,260
may inscribe poems
on your tavern's wall.

245
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,140
You were personally invited
by the Princess.

246
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,340
If you hadn't come,

247
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,860
it would have diminished
the banquet significantly.

248
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,900
Yes. Third Master, please.

249
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,820
After you.

250
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,340
So this is the "floating cups along
the winding stream" from the books.

251
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,260
So beautiful.

252
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,980
Lady Shen, please wait.

253
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,660
Could I trouble you to brew
a bowl of tea for me?

254
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,500
Vice Prefect, I...
I'm not very good at brewing tea.

255
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,900
I know.

256
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,820
Sit.

257
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,140
Twelfth Master,

258
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,560
nowadays people stress meter and rhyme.

259
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,460
The Yuefu poems, free and unrestrained,

260
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,220
have a unique charm.

261
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,140
What do you think?

262
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,140
You like Yuefu poems?

263
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,780
So, inside, Anran,

264
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,730
you dislike constraints?

265
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,700
Are you free-spirited and unrestrained?

266
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,300
But I believe

267
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,300
the Book of Poetry is best.

268
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,500
Yes.

269
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,180
With Taoyao and Guanju poems among them,

270
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,480
you would find it hard
not to like them, I think.

271
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,980
Anran, you jest.

272
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,060
A message from Her Highness:

273
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,620
The Shen family has worked hard
organizing the banquet.

274
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,500
If they enjoy listening
to poetry and discourse,

275
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,980
they are invited to stay for the feast.

276
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
Thank you, Your Highness.

277
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,340
Thank you, Lady.

278
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,060
(Pavilion of Jade
in the Fairy Mountains)

279
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,980
Thank you for your trouble.

280
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,780
Her Highness

281
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,740
invites all the guests to enter

282
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,780
and sample the delicacies.

283
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,500
Wait...

284
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,860
Didn't expect Her Highness
to be so humane.

285
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,140
She's inviting us, too?

286
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,820
Look at the word you used.

287
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,660
So uncultured.

288
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,900
Fengxia,

289
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,180
she is so human.

290
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,860
Might as well go take a look.

291
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,420
What kind of talk is that again?

292
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,780
Since the Princess has invited us,

293
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,500
we can't be disrespectful
and refuse her face.

294
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,260
That's right.

295
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,980
I'm definitely confident in Jicai.

296
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,980
But you two...

297
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,700
I have absolutely no problem.

298
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,140
But you must remember

299
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,660
that this is the Princess's mansion.

300
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,660
Rules are strict.

301
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,820
And the guests today

302
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,580
- are all people of status.
- Right.

303
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,900
Must be low-key and careful.

304
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,540
Must be low-key and careful!

305
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,380
Did you hear?

306
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,620
I'll definitely be fine, too.

307
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,260
Especially you, Shen Gongcai!

308
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,980
Later, you must keep
that mouth shut tight.

309
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,720
Otherwise, they'll
chop your head off first.

310
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,340
Chop your head off first!

311
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,700
Enough! You shut up, too.

312
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,580
Fine.

313
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,780
Quick! Get ready.

314
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,820
Let's hurry over.

315
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,060
Let's go.

316
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,240
- Be cautious and careful.
- Hurry.

317
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,600
- Third Master, please.
- After you.

318
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,500
So beautiful.

319
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,900
Her Highness hasn't chosen
Guixiang Tavern

320
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,740
to host the poetry gathering this year.

321
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,500
She said there had been too many times,

322
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,860
and she wanted a change.

323
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,900
Mr. Liu,

324
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,820
what do you think
of the newly hired chef?

325
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,820
It's unique.

326
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,740
This pastry has a taste
of Western Region grape wine.

327
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,420
This one has peppercorn flavor.

328
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,110
I never imagined

329
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,020
these could be used in pastries.

330
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,500
Bet you didn't expect that.

331
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,320
I'm telling you,

332
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,860
only I could come up with

333
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,700
this idea.

334
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,900
So this was made by you people?

335
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,100
May I ask, from where did Her Highness

336
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,220
invite you all?

337
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,860
Well...

338
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:24,780
Mr. Liu,

339
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,500
someone recommended that our family

340
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,020
host this banquet.

341
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,900
Yes.

342
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,120
It was Vice Prefect Lin, right?

343
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,380
I heard he recommended

344
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,240
the Shen family
from the stall on Juxian Alley.

345
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,420
Her Highness was also very satisfied.

346
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,980
Really?

347
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,180
Even... even the Princess is satisfied?

348
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,260
Yes.

349
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,740
I've also tasted your family's

350
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,060
Jianbing Guozi, Lamb Skewers,

351
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,540
and drinks.

352
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,660
Quite ingenious.

353
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,900
I've also wanted

354
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,700
to consult with you
on the art of cuisine.

355
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,420
Too polite.

356
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,900
"Consult" is too much.

357
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,260
Let's exchange...

358
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,420
exchange ideas.

359
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,300
Shen Jianshe.

360
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,660
Shen Jianshe!

361
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,860
We're all brothers here.

362
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,780
It's fine.

363
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:05,900
Here. Drink!

364
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,580
I've long heard of your literary fame.

365
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,420
Vice Prefect, I wanted to invite you
to dine at my home.

366
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,660
Might you honor us?

367
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,060
What kind of poetry do you like?

368
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,320
Would you attend the poetry gathering
hosted by the Wangs and Xies?

369
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,620
Do you enjoy playing polo?

370
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,100
Not fond of horseback polo?

371
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,100
What about cuju?

372
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,320
Next time, let's play together.

373
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,240
Vice Prefect, I'm of the Lu clan,
one of the seven famous families.

374
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,420
I especially request your presence

375
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,520
to discuss philosophy at my home.

376
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,420
Thank you.

377
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,100
Drink!

378
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,620
Drink.

379
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,700
A mere merchant

380
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,700
actually managed
to cling to the Vice Prefect?

381
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,500
Mr. Shen,

382
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,660
why are you pouring the wine
into that bottle?

383
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,460
Ah, you wouldn't understand.

384
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,220
This is called awakening the wine.

385
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,620
You must awaken

386
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,140
the grape wine.

387
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,300
It means you have to wake the wine up.

388
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:18,940
Understand?

389
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,860
Is this awakening it?

390
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,600
Listen,

391
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,020
- Dad!
- if you don't believe me, taste it.

392
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,340
The flavor of awakened wine

393
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,500
is completely different.

394
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,340
Try it.

395
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,260
How is it?

396
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,060
The astringency is less.

397
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,180
The aftertaste is richer.

398
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,140
See?

399
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,770
I told you...

400
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,220
- Shen Jianshe!
- The grape wine...

401
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,490
Look at your dad!
Everything I told him before was wasted.

402
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,880
It's mainly about grapes...

403
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,780
Shen!

404
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,820
There are red grapes

405
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,220
and white grapes.

406
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,900
The skins of grape wine...

407
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,340
You vile merchant's wife.

408
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,880
How dare you sully me with your sleeve?

409
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,820
I...

410
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,700
What's wrong with you?

411
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,580
How...?

412
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,940
Mere merchants! Street rats!

413
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,740
How dare you set foot
in this grand hall!

414
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,260
Putting on airs.

415
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,300
Pretending to be cultured!

416
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,700
What did you say?

417
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,700
You make a fair point.

418
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,380
We common folk

419
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,860
wouldn't dare sit

420
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,180
without Her Highness' permission.

421
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,660
We've displeased you.

422
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,900
But is this public outburst

423
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,820
dissatisfaction with Her Highness?

424
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,400
You worthless wench.

425
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,480
Stop stirring trouble here!

426
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,420
- I...
- You stop!

427
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,300
What are you doing?

428
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,860
- What?
- Stop!

429
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,720
Vice Prefect Lin, you arrive in time.

430
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,180
Look at these merchants!

431
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,860
What insolence.

432
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,780
Are you unharmed?

433
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,300
Her Highness will arrive shortly.

434
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,020
Mr. Lu,

435
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,870
do you truly wish
to continue this disturbance?

436
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,340
Mr. Lu is intoxicated.

437
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,060
He'll take his leave immediately.

438
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,340
Esteemed guests,

439
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,820
let us pretend nothing occurred.

440
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,140
So that was it.

441
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,700
Apologies

442
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,780
for disturbing...

443
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,390
You've done nothing wrong.

444
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,920
One who repays injustice with integrity

445
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,780
owes no apology to others.

446
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,390
- It's nothing.
- Thank you, Vice Prefect.

447
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,320
Thank you, Vice Prefect.

448
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,180
Everyone, please sit.

449
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,820
Sit. Fengxia, sit quickly.

450
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,830
- Sit.
- Are you alright?

451
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,380
- Are you alright, Jicai?
- Sit.

452
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,400
- It's fine.
- Sit here.

453
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,940
What a commotion this caused.

454
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,580
Please.

455
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,420
Why must he look down on others?

456
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,420
Merchants conduct themselves honorably.

457
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,420
If people wish to eat,

458
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,860
we bring goods to sell.

459
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,260
This trade is perfectly fair.

460
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,940
Must people be ranked high and low?

461
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,780
Enough.

462
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,300
It's often said that merchants, artisans,
and itinerants occupy low status

463
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,420
and bear vulgar reputations.

464
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,380
How could they stand
shoulder-to-shoulder with gentlemen

465
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,620
or share a table as equals?

466
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,300
Excuse me, are you speaking to me?

467
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,060
I... I don't quite understand.

468
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,260
I was just talking nonsense earlier.

469
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,180
Nonsense.

470
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,700
Previously,

471
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,260
our Guixiang Tavern always handled this.

472
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,220
This time, Her Highness invited you.

473
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,540
I was puzzled.

474
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,550
Guixiang Tavern?

475
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,980
But after tasting your family's fare,

476
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,380
I'm thoroughly convinced.

477
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,380
Hearing Shen's views

478
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,940
further reveals an insightful man.

479
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,660
That phrase earlier,

480
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,220
"This trade is perfectly fair.

481
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,740
Must people be ranked high and low?",

482
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,500
is simple,

483
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,460
yet profound.

484
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,780
Profound?

485
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,660
Me?

486
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,900
Profound?

487
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,620
Give me a break.

488
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,420
(Oh my.)

489
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,100
(High-stakes commerce)

490
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,100
(often relies on simple flattery.)

491
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,500
No, I just mean

492
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,980
everything should be fair.

493
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,340
Take our family's pancake stall...

494
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,740
Many have eaten there!

495
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,900
Officials have eaten,

496
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,980
and laborers have eaten.

497
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,060
Food doesn't discriminate by status.

498
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,020
Must people be divided into ranks?

499
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,140
I respect you; you should respect me.

500
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,300
That's all there is to it.

501
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,220
Gongcai!

502
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,820
What a line, "I respect you;

503
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,100
you should respect me."

504
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,500
But if that were truly so,

505
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,100
wouldn't the world be equal,

506
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,220
with no injustice?

507
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,260
How absurd!

508
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,380
If all people regarded
each other as equals,

509
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,540
wouldn't chaos ensue?

510
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,540
Father commands, son obeys.

511
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,460
Husband leads, wife follows.

512
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,660
Men are strong, women are weak.

513
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,900
Thus it has always been,

514
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,180
forming propriety.

515
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,700
Sir,

516
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,420
you're unwed and childless, aren't you?

517
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,580
Indeed unmarried.

518
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:41,660
Then I advise you,

519
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,380
never speak

520
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,780
like that again.

521
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,100
Truly, you'll become undesirable.

522
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,500
Look at me,

523
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,100
I'm not chauvinistic at all,

524
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,460
yet my wife left me.

525
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,980
Dare you promote such notions?

526
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,700
I tell you, finding a match
will be harder.

527
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,260
Even your children would resent you!

528
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,100
Shen,

529
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,860
what is "chauvinistic"?

530
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,500
How to explain...?

531
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,940
Male chauvinism means

532
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,180
believing that as a man,

533
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,140
you should dominate.

534
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,300
Like what this gentleman just said,

535
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,700
"father commands son,

536
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,660
wife follows husband".

537
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,740
That whole philosophy

538
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,060
is male chauvinism.

539
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,780
In truth, when two people live together,

540
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,100
the most important things
are equal communication

541
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,020
and mutual tolerance.

542
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,500
I only realized this

543
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,500
afterward.

544
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,660
A husband

545
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,420
must respect his wife.

546
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,380
Ask what she truly desires.

547
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,820
Treat her well in the way
she finds meaningful,

548
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,500
not by imposing your own way.

549
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,580
Otherwise,

550
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,500
she will surely leave you.

551
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,620
Truly unexpected.

552
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,340
- Indeed.
- Excellently spoken!

553
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,100
What a devoted man!

554
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,460
Who'd have thought

555
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,580
one cast aside would still
reflect on himself?

556
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,620
Exactly!

557
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,020
Mr. Shen, you speak so rightly!

558
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,260
You strike straight to my heart!

559
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,300
What? I...

560
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,980
Mr. Shen, you're absolutely correct!

561
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,260
Truly! Mr. Shen,

562
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,580
you're absolutely correct!

563
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,940
No, no! I...

564
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,480
Choosing a husband should be like this!

565
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,140
Excellently said,

566
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,060
Mr. Shen!

567
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,500
Her Highness arrives!

568
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,740
Greetings, Her Highness.

569
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,420
Mr. Shen, you possess

570
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,820
unique perspectives.

571
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,380
Each word is like a pearl of wisdom.

572
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,900
Quite intriguing.

573
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,940
(Princess Fuhui)

574
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,900
What a pity. His features are coarse.

575
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,130
Otherwise, appointing him

576
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,740
as my close advisor

577
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,860
would hold distinct appeal.

578
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,100
Your Highness, you're right.

579
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,260
My elder brother is unworthy

580
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,780
to serve as your advisor.

581
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,180
Yes.

582
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,020
Well...

583
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,900
Yong'an women

584
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,260
are heavenly perfection.

585
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,140
I fear that

586
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,420
I'm unworthy of even one.

587
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,100
Speaking thus

588
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,020
only reveals your virtue further.

589
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,420
Mr. Shen,

590
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,570
share more

591
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,820
of your unique insights.

592
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,660
I shall have them recorded

593
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,220
for other gentlemen to learn eloquence.

594
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,740
No more.

595
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,580
I dare not...

596
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,500
I dare not.

597
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,880
Continue.

598
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,380
Does my presence

599
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,020
stifle the gathering?

600
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,980
Continue.

601
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,020
Thank you, Your Highness.

602
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,900
Continue.

603
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,020
Continue...

604
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,420
Am I truly ugly?

605
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,900
This exceeds
the agreed amount by fivefold.

606
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,540
You hosted the banquet superbly.

607
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,420
It's deserved.

608
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,320
Her Highness also bestowed
several bolts of silk fabric

609
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,860
for Liu Chang to bring back for you.

610
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,100
Thank you, Vice Prefect.

611
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,700
Lady Shen,

612
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,660
Her Highness summons you.

613
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,100
Greetings, Her Highness.

614
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,220
Please rise.

615
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,740
Your family's cuisine

616
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,740
pleases my palate exceedingly.

617
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,100
I summoned you to ask:

618
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,740
would you consider becoming chefs
in my residence?

619
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,140
No need to alter your commoner status.

620
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,740
Should you wish to leave,

621
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,180
simply inform me.

622
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,300
Your Highness honors us greatly.

623
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,220
But my family is rustic folk,

624
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,260
accustomed to freedom.

625
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,740
Moreover, we won't
remain long in Yong'an.

626
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,100
We fear failing to properly serve you.

627
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,700
You're leaving?

628
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,060
How regrettable.

629
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,740
With your culinary skills,

630
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,640
even without joining my household,

631
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:31,080
opening any eatery in Yong'an

632
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,580
would promise great success.

633
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,940
Your Highness flatters us.

634
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,500
My family behaved improperly
at the gathering today.

635
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,180
Yet Your Highness not only overlooked it

636
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,100
but rewarded us.

637
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,940
I feel undeserving.

638
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,700
At the Qixi Poetry Gathering,

639
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,900
worthies debate principles.

640
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,240
Moreover,

641
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,580
your brother spoke
with undeniable reason.

642
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,900
If anyone was discourteous,

643
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,820
it was Mr. Lu.

644
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,970
You executed the service admirably.

645
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,500
A few extra bolts of silk are no cause

646
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,860
for feeling undeserving.

647
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,330
Vice Prefect,

648
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,820
I inquired of Her Highness.

649
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,210
She bestowed only several bolts of silk.

650
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,540
The remainder must be

651
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,700
from your own funds?

652
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,180
We can't accept this money.

653
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,420
Commissioning you for the gathering

654
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:27,970
was also in my self-interest.

655
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,860
Her Highness appreciates fine cuisine.

656
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,220
You excel at cooking,

657
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,500
and you're my recommendation.

658
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,980
Pleasing her naturally

659
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,220
gains me favor.

660
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,900
Lady Shen, as a businesswoman,

661
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,060
you understand

662
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,140
this connection is

663
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,380
worth more than gold bricks.

664
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,540
Well then, many thanks, Vice Prefect.

665
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,260
For future such matters,

666
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,220
seek me again.

667
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,730
You've received
a significant portion of my assets.

668
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,940
For the foreseeable future,

669
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,540
I couldn't possibly afford
your services again.

670
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,780
Truthfully,
I'm deeply grateful to you today.

671
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,700
Without your intervention,

672
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,380
we mere merchants

673
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,060
offending nobility
at the Princess's banquet

674
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,700
would have spelled disaster.

675
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,580
Then why did you dare speak up?

676
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,820
What else could I do?

677
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,720
I couldn't let anyone

678
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,020
bully my family.

679
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,620
Indeed.

680
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,740
The fault lay entirely with others.

681
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,420
Your rebuttal was justified.

682
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,900
Vice Prefect, might you have time free
in the coming days?

683
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,740
Why?

684
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,580
We wish to invite you to dine.

685
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,260
Agreed.

686
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,180
It's settled then!

687
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,730
I shouldn't

688
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,780
disturb you further.

689
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,700
Was that...

690
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,330
all your salary
since entering service?

691
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,740
Given away just like that?

692
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,420
Though we've returned to the Capital

693
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,500
and His Majesty raised your salary,

694
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,890
you have only received two months' pay.

695
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,060
That much gold

696
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,190
could sustain their family back

697
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,860
in their hometown for a lifetime.

698
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,340
Young Master,

699
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,140
when will you be so generous to me?

700
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,060
Very well.

701
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,380
Retire immediately.

702
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,300
I'll prepare your pension funds at once.

703
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,400
How's that?

704
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,500
No need.

705
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,380
I'll just faithfully serve you,

706
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,500
drawing my monthly pay.

707
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,580
However,

708
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,860
now that Lady Shen faces

709
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,420
no further worries.

710
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,940
Young Master, you can propose

711
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,540
dissolving the engagement, right?
