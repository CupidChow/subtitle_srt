1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
There are many Mye people that took advice from other women...

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And left their mark on this nation!

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I will establish a militaryary of the classic disherursal movement!

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,480
Finish him and take his clothes.

31
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:41,520
Her body isã‚‚

32
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,680
Don't wash his body.

33
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,720
Put a full- dubbing on it.

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,600
I noticed it.

35
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,180
E...

36
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,640
This has been the whole day.

37
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,640
He opened his shop on the sixth day of the year.

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,640
He even offered us some food.

39
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,640
He even made some spring rolls.

40
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,640
The spring rolls are made from warm soup.

41
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,640
They are ready to be picked in mid-February.

42
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,640
Spring has just begun.

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,640
It's the only way to get spring water from the royal family.

44
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,640
They can plant some trees.

45
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,640
They can make the customers

46
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,640
eat on the roof of the house.

47
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,640
They are quite capable.

48
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,640
They are not growing spring water.

49
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
They are planting the ground.

50
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,640
They are using oil paper and bamboo.

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
They are using a fan to control the temperature.

52
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,640
They are planting the ground.

53
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,640
They even gave the tree to the farmers in the suburbs.

54
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,640
They are trying to persuade them

55
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,640
to give up the rent of the Shen family.

56
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,640
They are even willing to give them some money.

57
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,640
We are here to congratulate you.

58
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,640
Why are you so down-to-earth?

59
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,640
I am sorry.

60
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,640
Why are you so nervous?

61
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,640
People come and go.

62
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,640
If you are being treated like a slave

63
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
I will kill you.

64
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,640
I understand.

65
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
Welcome.

66
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,640
Lady.

67
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,640
I have prepared some gifts for you.

68
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,640
I am here to congratulate you.

69
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,640
So this is the dead man.

70
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,640
I am sorry for being so rude.

71
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
You are the owner of the restaurant.

72
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Lu Yun, Mr. Lu.

73
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,640
Please come in and have a seat.

74
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
I am very busy.

75
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
I will come again when I am not busy.

76
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
Welcome.

77
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,640
You are the one who is not busy.

78
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,640
I am always being looked down upon.

79
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,640
What is wrong with them?

80
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,640
They are always trying to avoid me.

81
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
Welcome.

82
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,640
It turns out that we can eat at any time.

83
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
The Shen family has no more money.

84
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
Let's go.

85
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,640
How about the owner asking the noble lady?

86
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
How to stop them?

87
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,640
The house of the noble lady has been cleaned up.

88
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,640
The Shen family has her as a friend.

89
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,640
But she is a good partner.

90
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,640
She has a dream.

91
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Her dream is to marry her granddaughter.

92
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,640
Lin Yan will lose her cousin sooner or later.

93
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,640
Sir, it is like this.

94
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,640
Sir.

95
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,640
I am really sorry.

96
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
It is okay.

97
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,640
The lady is very sick.

98
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
You should be careful.

99
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,640
How do you know my name?

100
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,640
I am Liu Chang.

101
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
I am from the Jinzhao family.

102
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,640
I am here to ask about the current situation.

103
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,640
The Jinzhao family is in trouble.

104
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,640
I have a lot to say about the house of the noble lady.

105
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Our house is very good.

106
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
Come in and have some tea.

107
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Thank you.

108
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,640
Please.

109
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
You two sit down.

110
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,640
I will go and make tea.

111
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,640
Shi'an's tea is very good.

112
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,640
It is rich in flavor and is very refreshing.

113
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,640
It is very delicious.

114
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,640
Sit down.

115
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
She is so secretive.

116
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
I didn't expect that.

117
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,640
I just came to ask about it.

118
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
I didn't see her.

119
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,640
You two should ask about the house of the noble lady.

120
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
By the way,

121
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,640
our house is a very good person.

122
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,640
It is the only one in the world.

123
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,640
It is gentle, gentle and polite.

124
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,640
The hobby is to serve the people.

125
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,640
Thank you.

126
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,640
You don't have to trouble yourself.

127
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,640
You didn't prepare this for us.

128
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
I am sorry.

129
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,640
I am easily sick and easily hungry.

130
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
You two eat too.

131
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
Thank you.

132
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,640
I don't need it.

133
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
Try it.

134
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,640
It is local specialty.

135
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
How is it?

136
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,640
This is a spring roll.

137
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,640
Shi'an and Qingyang's spring rolls are good.

138
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,640
A while ago,

139
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,640
someone came from Yongan to pick them.

140
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
These spring rolls

141
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,640
were picked by a lady named Shen.

142
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,640
That lady was badly injured.

143
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,640
I thought something happened to her.

144
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,640
But she fell down because of the spring rolls.

145
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,640
She is so greedy.

146
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,640
She did this for a bite of food.

147
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,640
I am sorry.

148
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,640
You like this too?

149
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,640
I thought only Qingyangers liked it.

150
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,640
Qingyangers?

151
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Is this lady from Qingyang?

152
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,640
I made a bet with Qingyang when I was a child.

153
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,640
But that time, something happened to my family.

154
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,640
My whole family was gone.

155
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,640
I was afraid of being involved in the case.

156
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,640
So I didn't go back.

157
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
I didn't expect that

158
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
in September last year,

159
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,640
someone went to Qingyang's relative's house

160
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
to ask about the past.

161
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
I said this

162
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,640
because you two are from Jingzhao's family.

163
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,640
If that family had a grudge,

164
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,640
could you help them?

165
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,640
We will not stand by and watch.

166
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
But please tell me

167
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
what the person who came last year

168
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
asked in September last year.

169
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
Ask...

170
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
I don't want to say.

171
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
But you...

172
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,640
The court is complicated.

173
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,640
I don't know which side you are on.

174
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,640
How can you say that?

175
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
In that case,

176
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,640
thank you for the spring rolls and tea.

177
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
Goodbye.

178
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
Sir.

179
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,640
Wait.

180
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,640
I just said that

181
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
to make you two worried.

182
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,640
Once you are anxious,

183
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
you will show your true character.

184
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,640
If you two dare to threaten me,

185
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,640
I will really say nothing.

186
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,640
You are alone.

187
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
You are really brave.

188
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,640
I am the husband of my wife.

189
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,640
In Shi'an County,

190
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,640
I have nothing to fear.

191
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,640
The wife?

192
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,640
But you...

193
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
Your house...

194
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
Our family is a little simple.

195
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
That's because my husband

196
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,640
is a good man.

197
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,640
He earned a good reputation.

198
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,640
You two just asked about the house,

199
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,640
but you don't know your wife's identity.

200
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640
I think you really want to ask

201
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
about the old story.

202
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,640
Yes.

203
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
I am Lin Yan.

204
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,640
I am the young master of the Jingzhao family.

205
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
I have been in the Qingyang Cui family for a long time.

206
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
I see.

207
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,640
I and my husband both think

208
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,640
that Jing Zhao Yin would not commit a crime.

209
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,640
In September,

210
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,640
a man found my third uncle

211
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,640
and asked about the marriage between the Zheng family and the Cui family.

212
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,640
The third uncle was vigilant.

213
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,640
He was so nervous

214
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,640
when he saw that he is no longer a husband's wife.

215
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,280
and asked my husband to find out who that man was.

216
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,280
As a result,

217
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,440
he was the fourth son of King of Zhao,

218
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,640
Li Ang.

219
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,440
If I remember correctly,

220
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,480
the case of the corruption of the Dowager's Order last year

221
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,640
was caused by Lin Shaoyin.

222
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,600
Yes.

223
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Actually, my husband has been watching this case.

224
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,640
The Dowager's Order was related to the Noble Consort of Dou.

225
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,040
All the money he had stolen

226
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,640
was left to the Dou family.

227
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,360
It seems that King of Zhao and the Noble Consort of Dou are not on good terms,

228
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,200
but he has been in contact with the Dou family in private.

229
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,040
King of Zhao and the Noble Consort of Dou have not been in contact,

230
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,320
but they are concerned about the old case of the Cui family.

231
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,240
Then these two cases

232
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,280
may be the same.

233
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,760
Lin Shaoyin,

234
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,160
Uncle Cui is a righteous man.

235
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,640
He will never be a courtier.

236
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,320
Please investigate the old case thoroughly.

237
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,960
Mr. Long,

238
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,640
we are passing by the shop of the Shen family.

239
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,840
Do you...

240
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,880
Do you want to go?

241
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,800
No.

242
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
I will go to the Zhao family.

243
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,440
Enjoy your drinks.

244
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,880
Shaoyin.

245
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,520
Stop.

246
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,120
A Yan.

247
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,080
Uncle.

248
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Wait.

249
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,120
Wait.

250
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,760
Shaoyin,

251
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,640
the shop of the Shen family

252
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,240
has just launched a new spring roll.

253
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,240
I was going to send it to you.

254
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
But I ran into it.

255
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
You can try it when you get home.

256
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,440
A Yan,

257
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,720
bring me a spring roll.

258
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,600
Hurry up.

259
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,120
Shaoyin is here.

260
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,960
No need.

261
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,640
Liu Cheng.

262
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,440
Stop.

263
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
Sorry.

264
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,440
Stop.

265
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
Shaoyin,

266
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,520
we made delicious food

267
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,440
and we want to share it with our families.

268
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,040
Why don't you try it?

269
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,080
Yes, let's try it.

270
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,080
Coming.

271
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
Shaoyin.

272
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,760
Shaoyin.

273
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,760
Shaoyin.

274
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Shaoyin.

275
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Shaoyin.

276
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
Shaoyin.

277
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
Well,

278
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
have you got the box?

279
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Yes.

280
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
Of course.

281
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,880
Young Master, please take it.

282
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:51,120
But he is too happy

283
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
Young master, we are at the gate.

284
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,120
How about going in and have a seat?

285
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,120
Yes, it's so rare to meet you.

286
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,120
And everyone in the family is worried about you.

287
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,120
I don't know if you are doing well these days.

288
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,120
I'm fine.

289
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
In the family?

290
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
Let's go.

291
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,120
The Shen family is really cruel.

292
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,120
You are a liar, but you are so mean.

293
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
Why do you have to be nice to people?

294
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,120
You can't be angry if you make people angry.

295
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,120
If you are not angry, you can't do it.

296
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,120
There are some things that can't be done, but they can't be done.

297
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,120
Young master, the dream is coming.

298
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,120
Welcome.

299
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,120
Welcome.

300
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
You are really good at making up for it.

301
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,120
Meng, please.

302
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,120
Don't panic. It's not a big deal.

303
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,120
I want to be with you.

304
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,120
I must be joking.

305
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
It's not a joke.

306
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:51,120
You know, my granddaughter Jingwen is picky and has ideas.

307
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,120
But when I come home, every time I talk about you, I can't stop.

308
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,120
I have only met you twice.

309
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,120
How can you do this?

310
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,120
Only met twice?

311
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,120
You can't forget it?

312
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,120
Young master, it's time to get married.

313
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
No, no, no.

314
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,120
A woman from the Jialin can't marry a woman from the Jialin.

315
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,120
I am a woman who can't marry a woman from the Jialin.

316
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,120
I really don't deserve a woman from the Shen family.

317
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,120
I don't like to be affectionate.

318
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,120
I only have one favor to ask of you.

319
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,120
It's not difficult.

320
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
It's not difficult.

321
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,120
Young master.

322
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,120
Young master.

323
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,120
Good morning, young master.

324
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,120
Lady Shen.

325
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,120
I heard from my grandfather that you didn't go back.

326
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,120
No, I didn't mean that.

327
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
It's...

328
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
Young master, don't blame me.

329
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,120
I know.

330
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:19,120
If you agree to marry, you shouldn't have no answer to be so cold.

331
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
My grandfather has always been like this.

332
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,120
He loved me and wanted me as he wanted.

333
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,120
But he always forgot to ask me what my wish was.

334
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
Young master.

335
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,120
No wonder.

336
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:56,120
My grandfather said that the young master's concern was that the official from the Jialin couldn't marry the woman from the Jialin.

337
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,120
So this lady Shen is the woman from the Jialin?

338
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,120
Actually, I've thought about it before.

339
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,120
It's not difficult to ask for the saint's grace.

340
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,120
I understand your concern.

341
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
I'm sorry.

342
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:20,120
But in my opinion, you don't want to waste your time on me.

343
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,120
I do hope you can accept the marriage.

344
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,120
With your appearance and talent, you won't be too sad in the future.

345
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,120
But it's just a choice, not a wish.

346
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,120
If I really think so, I'd rather not be pushed around and have to deal with the marriage.

347
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
I understand.

348
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,120
I'll leave you now.

349
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,120
I've already said that I won't force you.

350
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
I'll do what I said.

351
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,120
You can rest assured.

352
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,120
I just don't know if you can do me a favor.

353
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,120
Please go ahead.

354
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,120
It's mainly my grandfather who has been very anxious to help me lately.

355
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
It's really hard for people to pretend.

356
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,120
If you can get over this battle and then return to him,

357
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,120
Then I can take advantage of these days to manage this matter properly.

358
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,120
So I'll have to trouble you again during this time.

359
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,120
It's okay.

360
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,120
I'm sorry.

361
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
I'm sorry.

362
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,120
I'm sorry.

363
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
Ji.

364
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,120
Fengxia.

365
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
Fengxia.

366
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,120
Yang Yang is missing.

367
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
I've searched everywhere but I didn't see her.

368
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,120
How could she be missing?

369
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
I don't know.

370
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
Wasn't she still in the room doing homework?

371
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,120
I went to see her but she wasn't in the room doing homework.

372
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,120
Hong Wen Guan.

373
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
Hurry up.

374
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,120
The parents and the children in Hong Wen Guan aren't here.

375
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,120
What should we do?

376
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,120
Let's report it first.

377
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120
Yes, report it.

378
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
Report it.

379
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,120
I told you to go.

380
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,120
Let's go together.

381
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
Or I'll pretend to be a fool.

382
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
Let's go.

383
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
You go and see her.

384
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
Okay.

385
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
Mr. Liu.

386
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
Mr. Liu.

387
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,120
Mr. Liu.

388
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
I want to ask you something.

389
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
Something bad happened to Shi Wan Huo Ji.

390
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
What happened?

391
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,120
Our Yang Yang is missing.

392
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
Mr. Liu.

393
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,120
We're sorry for your Young Master.

394
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,120
But please help us find Yang Yang.

395
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,120
Don't worry.

396
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,120
The Goddess is inside.

397
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,120
She came to ask you about the homework this morning.

398
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,120
She said she didn't know you were inside.

399
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,120
I was afraid you were worried.

400
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,120
So I went to tell you.

401
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,120
I met you here.

402
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,120
You scared me.

403
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
That's great.

404
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
Chi.

405
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
Chi.

406
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
It's written in the book of the Four Seasons.

407
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,120
It's a good omen.

408
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
It's a good omen.

409
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,120
It's a good omen.

410
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,120
It's a good omen.

411
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
You even read Chinese books.

412
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,120
You know this one?

413
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,120
Yes.

414
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,120
Tell me.

415
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
It means

416
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,120
you're good or not,

417
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,120
everyone is good.

418
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,120
It's good.

419
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
The Western Regions are free and peaceful.

420
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,120
This sentence is in the book of the Four Seasons.

421
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,120
It's a good omen.

422
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,120
It's a good omen.

423
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,120
It's a good omen.

424
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
It's a good omen.

425
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,120
It's a good omen.

426
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,120
This sentence

427
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,120
is very useful in the foreign affairs.

428
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,120
The country is bound to be a great power.

429
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,120
But we should also be happy in the world.

430
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
It's very valuable.

431
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,120
It's also very similar to business.

432
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,120
Aunt said something similar.

433
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,120
The interests of both sides are different.

434
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,120
We should talk as much as possible.

435
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,120
We should think about the problem from the other party's point of view.

436
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
Follow his speed.

437
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,120
Solve his concerns.

438
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,120
Then we can achieve our own hope.

439
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,120
Peaceful?

440
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
Aunt!

441
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
Grandpa!

442
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,120
Grandma!

443
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
Did I answer well?

444
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
Am I good?

445
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
Yes.

446
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
What's more,

447
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,120
you didn't even say hello to your family.

448
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
And you ran out.

449
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
Yes.

450
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
If you keep doing this,

451
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
I'll hit you in the ass.

452
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,120
Yes.

453
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,120
My father and I have made a promise.

454
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,120
We'll meet at the top.

455
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,120
So I have to study hard.

456
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,120
But some questions are not clear to the teacher.

457
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,120
So I came to ask you.

458
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,120
I'm sorry.

459
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,120
Uncle Liu Shang.

460
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,120
Yes?

461
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,120
Young Master Nie has never been to our store.

462
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,120
He's acting strange today.

463
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,120
Did he have a fight with my family?

464
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,120
Don't worry about it.

465
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,120
It has nothing to do with you.

466
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,120
We've met again today.

467
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,120
Did you make up with him?

468
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,120
You're so silly.

469
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
You're so stupid.

470
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,120
Young Master.

471
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
Yangyang is young.

472
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,120
So I didn't tell him about some things.

473
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,120
I didn't expect him to come and bother you.

474
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,120
I'm so sorry.

475
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,120
Yangyang is fine.

476
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,120
But I'm busy with work lately.

477
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,120
I can't deal with my lover.

478
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,120
Please take care of yourself.

479
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,120
We've caused too much trouble.

480
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,120
It's all because of Shao Ying.

481
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,120
I lied to her.

482
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
I'm so sorry.

483
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,120
Don't mention the past.

484
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,120
We're sorry.

485
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
It's our duty to forgive you.

486
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,120
But if we don't apologize,

487
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,120
we owe you more.

488
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,120
Yes.

489
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,120
Don't worry.

490
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,120
We won't do it again.

491
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
Okay.

492
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,120
I'll accept it.

493
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,120
I have work to do.

494
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
I'll go.

495
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
Young Master.

496
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,120
My father said he won't do it again.

497
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,120
But he promised not to do it again.

498
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,120
I hope everything will be fine.

499
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,120
If you need any help,

500
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,120
please tell us.

501
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
We'll be at your service.

502
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
I'll go.

503
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,120
Xia, you always say I don't help you with the cooking.

504
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
From now on,

505
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,120
I'll do the cooking.

506
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,120
You don't have to do it.

507
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
Thank you.

508
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,120
Listen to me.

509
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,120
You don't have to do it.

510
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,120
Recently,

511
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,120
we've been quite normal.

512
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,120
We're quite loving.

513
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,120
But I know that

514
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,120
we're still in a awkward position.

515
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,120
You don't wear the ring I bought you.

516
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,120
Why?

517
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,120
I don't want to.

518
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,120
I'm not in the mood.

519
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,120
If you're not in the mood, then don't wear it.

520
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,120
When are you in a good mood?

521
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
Here.

522
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,120
Look.

523
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,120
Let me tell you.

524
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,120
I haven't cut the radish for a long time.

525
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,120
I don't have any skills.

526
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
See?

527
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,120
This is called keeping the knife alive.

528
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,120
I can cut it like this.

529
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,120
It's broken.

530
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,120
It's broken.

531
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,120
If you cut the meat,

532
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,120
your weight can be reduced.

533
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,120
Xia,

534
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,120
I bled a lot.

535
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
I bled too much.

536
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
I can see your eyes.

537
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
Xia,

538
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,120
help me.

539
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,120
Why are you so cold?

540
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,120
I'm bleeding.

541
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,120
What's the big deal?

542
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,120
I cut the vegetables every day.

543
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,120
Do I have less hands?

544
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,120
I don't bleed more than you do.

545
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,120
I've told you once.

546
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,120
I...

547
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
Put your hands in your mouth.

548
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
You're not good at it.

549
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,120
You're not good at it.

550
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
What's wrong with you?

551
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,120
You can't get better, can you?

552
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,120
Are you going to live like this forever?

553
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
This jewelry

554
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,120
is the most important thing for Mr. Yu.

555
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
Mr. Yu is going to be a singer.

556
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,120
That's right.

557
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,120
Let's go and have a look.

558
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,120
Let's go.

559
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,120
Let's go.

560
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,120
Let's go.

561
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,120
Why are you looking at me?

562
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,120
You look at me and I say it.

563
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,120
You don't look at me and I have to say it.

564
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,120
Right?

565
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,120
Am I not good enough to you?

566
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,120
What else do you want me to do?

567
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,120
I bought you so many things.

568
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
Why are you not happy?

569
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,120
What should I do to make you happy?

570
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
You don't say it, do you?

571
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,120
If you don't say it, it means you're losing, Feng Xiang.

572
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,120
You're losing.

573
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,120
You're losing.

574
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,120
There are no customers in the store.

575
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,120
What are you two busy with?

576
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,120
We're packing spring rolls.

577
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,120
A customer came to buy spring rolls.

578
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,120
But he said he was too busy to wait.

579
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,120
So we packed it and sent it to him.

580
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,120
Good, Yu'er.

581
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,120
You learned fast enough.

582
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,120
He learned how to pack this word.

583
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,120
This should be a box.

584
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,120
A Yuan told me there was a gold paper.

585
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,120
But it's too expensive.

586
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
I checked it and it's made of wax.

587
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
We can do it ourselves.

588
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,120
Save money and prevent water and oil.

589
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,120
Ji, are you going to deliver food?

590
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,120
What do you think?

591
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,120
You're the most clever.

592
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,120
Look, those who work hard and have no time to eat.

593
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,120
They can pack the box and take it away.

594
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,120
I heard that many people have learned from our family.

595
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,120
They also sell lunch and dinner.

596
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,120
And the price has also dropped.

597
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,120
Look, locals can eat three meals a day.

598
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,120
It's good for your health.

599
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,120
Right?

600
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
You like watching those travel novels.

601
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
Isn't it all like this?

602
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,120
The protagonist can promote life a lot with a small action.

603
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,120
Do you feel a little bit sad?

604
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,120
Yes, I feel so good.

605
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:52,120
My wife, why do you have so many new ideas?

606
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,120
And so many new words.

607
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
Although I don't understand it.

608
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,120
But I think I can understand it.

609
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,120
But I don't think you're one of them.

610
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,120
I'm from the future.

611
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,120
You're kidding me again.

612
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,120
You don't believe me.

613
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,120
Okay, let's go.

614
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,120
Let's go.

615
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,120
Wait a minute.

616
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,120
Come on, auntie, let me see.

617
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,120
Lift your hands.

618
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,120
Look, the sauce is all over your body.

619
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,120
You're talking about others.

620
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,120
Look, your clothes are all over the place.

621
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,120
Look at you two.

622
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,120
Okay, I'll deliver it.

623
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,120
Okay, I'll deliver it.

624
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,120
If others see this.

625
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,120
They'll think our store is not clean.

626
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,120
Okay, I'll go.

627
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,120
Where is this delivered?

628
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,120
The bar next to Ruyuexuan.

629
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,120
The flower group is in the opposite direction.

630
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,120
The bar next to Ruyuexuan.

631
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,120
Okay, I got it.

632
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,120
What?

633
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,120
You're here.

634
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
What are you doing?

635
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,120
Who are you?

636
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,120
Why are you running away?

637
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,120
No, no, no.

638
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,120
I'm a family man.

639
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,120
You're a little bit of a family man.

640
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,120
If you want to sprinkle flowers.

641
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,120
You can't just ask for a guest.

642
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,120
I'm a family man.

643
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,120
Help me.

644
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,120
Help me.

645
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,120
Beauty.

646
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,120
Where is the flower group?

647
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,120
Someone ordered a special spring roll.

648
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,120
Okay, come with me.

649
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,120
Okay, okay.

650
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,120
This one?

651
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,120
Thank you.

652
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,120
Something happened.

653
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,120
I'll tell you.

654
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,120
Help me.

655
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,120
Help me.

656
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,120
You.

657
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,120
You.

658
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,120
Feng Xiao!

659
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,120
I didn't do anything!

660
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,120
I don't know them.

661
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,120
I'm sitting here.

662
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,120
I didn't even drink.

663
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,120
You don't believe me?

664
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,120
Shen Qiansheng.

665
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,120
You're out.

666
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,120
No.

667
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,120
I'm sorry.

668
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,120
What's the point of drinking with him?

669
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,120
Come on, beauty.

670
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,120
Pour the wine.

671
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,120
Feng...Feng Xiao.

672
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,120
Your temper.

673
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,120
Don't drink anymore.

674
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,120
Beauty.

675
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,120
Please take a glass of wine.

676
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,120
Beauty.

677
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,120
Please bring a paper brush.

678
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,120
Then you can go out.

679
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,120
I'm alone in the dark.

680
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:28,120
I can't see the fire.

681
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:32,120
The road ahead is dark.

682
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,120
The light and dark are interlaced.

683
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,120
I'm lost in my thoughts.

684
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,120
I'm lost in my thoughts.

685
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,120
I'm lost in my thoughts.

686
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,120
I'm lost in my thoughts.

687
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,120
I'm lost in my thoughts.

688
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,120
I'm lost in my thoughts.

689
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,120
I'm lost in my thoughts.

690
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,120
If I didn't feel sad when I was young,

691
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:58,120
How could I know it's hard to predict?

692
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:02,120
If I had known it was you and me,

693
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,120
I would have let go of you.

694
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,120
But I only know that I'm not good at it.

695
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:14,120
Who knows where to go and where to go?

696
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:18,120
I looked back at the world.

697
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:22,120
Is it still there?

698
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,120
I'm alone in the dark.

699
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:36,120
I can't see the fire.

700
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,120
The road ahead is dark.

701
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:44,120
The light and dark are interlaced.

702
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,120
I'm lost in my thoughts.

703
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,120
I'm lost in my thoughts.

704
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,120
I'm lost in my thoughts.

705
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,120
I'm lost in my thoughts.

706
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,120
I'm lost in my thoughts.

707
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,120
If I didn't feel sad when I was young,

708
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:08,120
How could I know it's hard to predict?

709
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,120
If I had known it was you and me,
