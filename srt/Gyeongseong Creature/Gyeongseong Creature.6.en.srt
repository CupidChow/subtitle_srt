GYEONGSEONG CREATURE

2
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,704
Tae-sang, don't trust anyone.

3
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,622
WINTER, 1925

4
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,625
There is no one in this world
who can protect you.

5
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,460
You have to fend for yourself.

6
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,545
All right?

7
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,922
Mother, are you going somewhere?

8
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:14,884
Get inside!

9
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,344
Hurry!

10
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,764
Don't you ever come out!

11
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:23,184
Whatever happens, whatever you may hear,
you must not come out.

12
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,396
Hide until daybreak
and don't make a sound, all right?

13
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,897
Mother!

14
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,234
You must stay alive. You must!

15
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:37,740
Promise me that you'll stay alive
no matter what happens, okay?

16
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,330
Get in!

17
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,262
Sim Sun-deok. Where's Kim Si-yeong?

18
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,307
What are you talking about?

19
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,600
We know everything!

20
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,936
You're the contact for Kim Si-yeong
of the Heroic Corps.

21
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:11,608
I have no clue
as to what you're talking about.

22
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,837
<i>You must stay alive.</i>

23
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,922
<i>You must!</i>

24
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:39,344
<i>Promise me that you'll stay alive</i>
<i>no matter what happens.</i>

25
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,809
I intend to take this seriously too,

26
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,937
so I can survive.

27
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,149
I don't daydream
about something like independence.

28
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,110
All I want, in these turbulent times,

29
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,154
is to strive as stubbornly as I can

30
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,741
to stay alive and safe day after day.

31
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:10,333
<i>I thought I had kept my promise</i>
<i>to my mother pretty well.</i>

32
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,334
Cheers!

33
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,794
Cheers!

34
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:16,506
<i>But then, my life started</i>
<i>to turn into a mess.</i>

35
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,675
"Until the cherry blossoms fall."

36
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,179
<i>It was from that moment.</i>

37
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,098
<i>No.</i>

38
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,849
<i>Was it then?</i>

39
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,936
Will you go and help the prisoners?

40
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,940
I don't want
any more innocent people to die.

41
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:38,486
<i>I should've thought it over</i>
<i>before making such a promise.</i>

42
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,918
What? Where did everybody go?

43
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,398
Don't move!

44
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,567
Or we'll shoot!

45
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,279
Run!

46
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,124
Hey! Get up, Hui-do!

47
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,421
Go back to where you were.

48
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,173
Or else we'll kill you all!

49
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,343
You son of a bitch.

50
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,511
I said go back to your cells!

51
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,764
Go ahead and shoot me, you fucker!

52
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,848
Hui-do, no!

53
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,394
What difference would it make
if I die here or out there?

54
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,605
I'll escape even if it kills me.

55
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,981
Just try and stop me.

56
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,859
Shoot, you fucking sons of bitches!

57
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:29,972
This way.

58
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,392
There's a dented metal door down the way.

59
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,935
Let's hide in there for now.

60
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,562
Move. Come on!

61
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,738
Hurry!

62
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,282
Get going!

63
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,329
Stop!

64
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,154
<i>That's where it all began.</i>

65
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,038
Once this thing enters the human body,

66
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,500
it takes over the brain.

67
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:43,546
After gaining complete control
of the brain's synapses…

68
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,508
it begins to cause mutations.

69
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,677
I asked you where my mother is.

70
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:51,971
Answer me.

71
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,556
Now.

72
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,766
Ultimately, all life seeks

73
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,853
to evolve into its strongest form.

74
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:05,443
Humans, in particular,
desire to become apex predators.

75
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,074
And this tiny organism in this cup

76
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,368
has made that possible.

77
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,665
Run.

78
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,835
Run!

79
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,398
<i>For the time being,</i>
<i>it will not cease to hunt.</i>

80
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,906
Hui-do!

81
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:58,412
<i>Its sole instinct right now is to survive</i>
<i>and to have no mercy on the way.</i>

82
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:10,967
No! Don't!

83
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,470
Hey…

84
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,041
Help me…

85
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,425
Damn it!

86
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:50,983
Shit, come on!

87
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,424
Please save me.

88
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,513
Come this way.

89
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:29,081
<i>The human race will soon be greeted</i>
<i>with a new world.</i>

90
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,584
And that world

91
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,129
was brought to us by Seishin.

92
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,758
Your mother.

EPISODE 6
CHAOS

95
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,666
WOMEN DISAPPEARING IN GYEONGSEONG

96
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,460
An interesting tip-off.

97
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,504
So, what you're saying is,

98
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,966
Ongseong Hospital is linked
to the missing women, and you'd like us

99
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:23,719
to investigate it?

100
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,305
This is a violent crime.

101
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,683
If the police bureau doesn't step up,
who will?

102
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,353
Aren't the police responsible
for Gyeongseong's safety?

103
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,065
Ongseong Hospital
is under military jurisdiction.

104
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,275
We can't just butt our heads in.

105
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,195
You know better.

106
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,535
Tae-sang, that boy,
seems to have found Myeong-ja in there.

107
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:53,290
He has dragged my son in with him,
and they've gotten themselves in trouble.

108
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,172
So,

109
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,758
what do you want?

110
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:07,012
I just want my son back safe and sound.

111
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,181
That is all.

112
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,837
But do you think we can really trust him?

113
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,382
Have you ever seen me
trust anyone that easily?

114
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:47,052
In fact, I don't even trust myself.

115
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,348
But you trust
the Golden Treasure members, right?

116
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,809
We've been to hell and back together,

117
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,769
through thick and thin like a family!

118
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,646
Have you ever had

119
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,733
your nails plucked out?

120
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,111
Have you ever been burned

121
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,114
or gone through electric torture?

122
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:11,911
I may like to gamble,
but I haven't lived life on the edge.

123
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,580
Do you know what happens

124
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,084
when water mixed with chili powder
is poured down your nose

125
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,170
while hanging upside down?

126
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,589
I don't really care to know, actually.

127
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,466
Persist to that point,

128
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,762
and a person can no longer remain human.

129
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,015
If they tell you to bark, you bark,

130
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,477
and if they tell you to crawl, you crawl.

131
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,730
Family, comrades, or whatnot,

132
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,485
none of them will matter anymore.

133
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,280
Hey, you're scaring me!

134
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,324
What's wrong with you today?

135
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,576
What's with the random torture talk?

136
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,916
If you're ever in such a situation,

137
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,211
don't try to hold back and ruin your life.

138
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,505
Just tell them everything you know.

139
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:09,677
I won't ever resent you for betraying me
in a situation like that.

140
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:11,887
Keep that in mind.

141
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,811
We're running late. Let's head back now.

142
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,105
Not like it's ever to happen,

143
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,233
but even if I find myself
in that situation,

144
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,528
I won't be betraying anyone.

145
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,572
<i>You </i>keep that in mind, Mrs. Nawol.

146
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,959
How long were you in there?

147
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:12,549
My mother is in there too.

148
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,302
Have you seen her?

149
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,973
Her name is Sim Sun-deok.

150
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,354
Do you know her?

151
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,071
No.

152
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,032
You haven't heard her name either?

153
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:39,993
I haven't.

154
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:49,711
It's cold.

155
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,843
You should drink this and hurry home.

156
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,160
Why didn't you keep your word?

157
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:08,207
I insisted you wait there for my return,
so why didn't you?

158
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,002
<i>He's not coming back.</i>

159
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:15,380
Jang Tae-sang is nothing
but a lowborn bastard.

160
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,550
A no-good filthy rogue
who only cares about money and himself!

161
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:20,969
"No-good filthy rogue"?

162
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,555
It's true that you've been one
your entire life.

163
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,806
You turned a blind eye

164
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,143
when Joseon fell to ruin
and your people suffered.

165
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,481
Comrade Kwon asked you to join our group,
but you always refused.

166
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,316
Am I wrong?

167
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,236
Let me ask you something.

168
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,698
Am I a bad person
if I don't align myself with your cause?

169
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,660
You're a fence-sitter
with no clear allegiance.

170
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,162
How can we trust you?

171
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,458
Have you always made the right choice
with that clear allegiance of yours?

172
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,751
All I ever wanted

173
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,754
was to escape from this hell--

174
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,006
Then you should have waited!

175
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,342
You didn't know the way out.
You had no plan.

176
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,303
Did you think getting out of your cell
was all there was to it?

177
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,473
What will you do about those
who died for nothing in that mess?

178
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,225
Their sacrifices were inevitable!

179
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,727
How was it inevitable?
You didn't even try!

180
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,355
You even had the key,

181
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,857
but you got scared
and ran off like a coward!

182
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,442
What are you doing? Let go of me!

183
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,821
Stop justifying
and rationalizing your faults,

184
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,573
your mistakes,
and your incompetence like that!

185
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,785
You didn't even have the courage to die,

186
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:30,122
so don't you dare take
the sacrifices of others for granted!

187
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,214
I heard you were a man of conviction.

188
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,468
Jun-taek must have been sorely mistaken.

189
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:22,257
Now, let's list the names of the members
of the Patriotic Society, shall we?

190
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,723
Start with the organization chart.

191
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,111
Master Jang.

192
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,158
You're alive.

193
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,042
Are you all right?

194
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,336
Are you injured?

195
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,254
It's nothing serious.

196
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,008
But Chae-ok…

197
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,637
I don't see her here.

198
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,063
Say it isn't true.

199
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,608
It can't be.

200
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,985
How is that even possible?

201
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,407
How can a human turn into such a creature?

202
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,159
Not just a creature.
It's an evolved being!

203
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:35,789
It's become more powerful and beautiful
than the weak humans!

204
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:37,958
How about it?

205
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,670
Don't you want to try it for yourself?

206
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,215
What?

207
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,299
Who knows?

208
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,303
If you mutate like your mother did,

209
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,558
perhaps she'll recognize her baby girl.

210
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,393
You crazy bastard!

211
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,522
Answer me.

212
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,274
Answer me now!

213
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:08,864
That creature,

214
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,617
tell me how it can be stopped.

215
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,911
You can't stop it.

216
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,080
Because…

217
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,960
I don't want it to stop!

218
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:30,802
I see.

219
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,724
So my wife was here.

220
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,143
She left a message on the wall,

221
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,979
but what happened to her afterward
isn't clear.

222
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,856
We don't know if she's still in here.

223
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,609
And Chae-ok went to find that out?

224
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,364
I'm sorry I couldn't stay with her

225
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,116
until the end.

226
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,702
Don't be.

227
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:00,415
I know you are doing your part,
Master Jang.

228
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,043
I've always known.

229
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,213
Even though you may not act like it
on the outside,

230
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,508
I knew you would make
the right decision in the end.

231
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,847
You saved all these people, Master Jang.

232
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,108
We still have a long way to go.

233
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,070
They all need to be moved
to somewhere safe.

234
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:32,697
Could you take care of them, sir?

235
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,503
There is an emergency exit this way.

236
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,338
Follow the stairs to the second floor.

237
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:51,633
At the end of the eastern hallway,
there should be an empty ward.

238
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,469
Tuberculosis recently spread there,

239
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,971
so it's currently vacant.

240
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,015
You should be able to hide
for a few hours.

241
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,934
Is that information reliable?

242
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:04,646
I paid a high price for it,
so it should be.

243
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,481
Then what about you?

244
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:14,364
I'll find Ms. Yoon,
and we'll meet you there together.

245
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,080
Please do.

246
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,129
Everyone.

247
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,798
I know you're all exhausted,
but we shouldn't stay here.

248
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,467
We'll get moving,
so prepare yourselves and follow me.

249
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,432
Let's go.

250
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:48,982
Wait.

251
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,571
Master Jang asked me to give you this.

252
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,285
I trust you to cover the rear.

253
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,607
Did you call for me, Director?

254
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,691
Idiot.

255
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,693
Stupid idiot!

256
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:34,861
You son of a bitch!

257
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,406
Why the hell are all these doors open?

258
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,200
Why are the cells empty?

259
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:42,285
Why?

260
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:43,953
Why?!

261
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,541
Please give me some time.
I'll find out what happened and--

262
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,793
So, you don't know?

263
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,921
You're the one in charge here, idiot!

264
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:54,964
You fool!

265
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,466
Stupid shit!

266
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,885
Forgive me, sir!

267
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,847
Sir, we have a problem!

268
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:12,941
What is it?

269
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:21,449
Corpses infected with anthrax
have been found in the Level 2-1 area.

270
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,702
What?

271
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,218
And the specimen?

272
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:43,722
It had already gone by the time
the disease control platoon got there.

273
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,895
Tell me more in detail.

274
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:59,988
Including the sentry who discovered it,
all 13 corpses were infected with anthrax.

275
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,615
Nine of them
were Joseon prisoners who escaped.

276
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,992
Where are the rest?

277
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:09,456
The dead be damned.
Where are the Josenjings who are alive?

278
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,876
Oh, my apologies, sir.
We haven't found them yet.

279
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,800
Sir, a message has arrived
from the main gates.

280
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,218
What is it now?

281
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,678
Commissioner Ishikawa is here.

282
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,849
He's requesting cooperation
in investigating the missing women cases.

283
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,184
What?

284
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,896
Did you hear that, Soma?

285
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,440
Even Ishikawa has noticed
that something is off.

286
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,442
Forgive me, sir!

287
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,572
Sort this out immediately.

288
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,615
Yes, sir!

289
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:52,582
If even a single Josenjing
escapes the hospital,

290
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:56,085
you and your family
will be imprisoned in their place.

291
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:03,092
I'll personally cut out their intestines
while they are still alive.

292
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,094
Understood?

293
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,183
Do you understand, you goddamn moron?

294
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,060
Yes, sir!

295
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,522
Worthless prick.

296
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,372
Walk faster.

297
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,708
You and I are going to find that creature.

298
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:39,796
If we do, then what?

299
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,382
I'm going to stop it at all costs.

300
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:43,800
I told you it's impossible.

301
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,135
Then think of a way.

302
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,387
You created it.

303
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:48,847
Colonel Kato.

304
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:54,686
What is it?

305
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,105
We're currently pursuing the specimen,

306
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:01,484
but I'm afraid we'll have to release
the rest of the nitrogen gas in Level Two

307
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,361
in order to drag the creature out.

308
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:07,282
What if you fail to capture it
even after you do so?

309
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:10,577
That's why I'm here
to ask for your permission.

310
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:14,038
If we fail to sedate the creature…

311
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,546
You'll shoot it dead?

312
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,133
We can't afford to lose any more men.

313
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,970
Please give me your permission
to kill it, sir!

314
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:36,227
There's only one way to kill Seishin.

315
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,187
What is it, sir?

316
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,189
You burn it.

317
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,861
But do you really think

318
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,196
you can do it?

319
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,032
Sir?

320
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,576
It's your mother, after all.

321
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,455
Can you actually kill it?

322
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,207
Shit!

323
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:04,297
Her appearance may have changed,
but it's still your mother.

324
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,800
Do you really think you can kill it?
Do you?

325
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,577
A message from Mr. Shiro, ma'am.

326
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:08,736
THE MISSION TO RESCUE AKIKO HAS BEGUN

327
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,173
It's been a while, Director Ichiro.

328
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,842
What brings you to our hospital?

329
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:59,263
We got a tip that your hospital
was involved in the missing women cases.

330
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,475
As you know,
the hospital is currently shut down.

331
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:05,812
No outsiders are allowed to enter,
without exception.

332
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,438
And the reason being?

333
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,899
There is an unknown infectious disease.

334
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:13,236
It's highly contagious,
so I hope you understand.

335
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,738
You say it's highly contagious,

336
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:20,076
yet I don't see any protective clothing
or equipment on you.

337
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,371
We should also be safe, then.
Don't you think?

338
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,167
This hospital
is under military jurisdiction.

339
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:32,255
The police bureau has no authority
to investigate or control this place.

340
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,965
Civilians have disappeared,

341
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,592
which means the police
may intervene and investigate.

342
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:43,224
Don't make me lose face
in front of my subordinates.

343
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,727
I'm afraid we must investigate,
even as a mere formality.

344
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,321
Please excuse us for the time being.

345
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,624
- Move the girl somewhere else.
- Yes, sir.

346
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,409
Put your hands up.

347
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,078
Who are you?

348
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,747
How did you get in here?

349
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,543
I'm looking for someone.

350
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,047
Where's the woman?

351
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,925
Where's the girl that was here?

352
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,461
Get inside. Now!

353
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:25,344
Sorry to disappoint you,
but I don't have time for that.

354
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,345
Get in there now!

355
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,432
I told you.

356
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,060
I don't have time to waste here with you.

357
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:10,723
It's no use.

358
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,227
Don't waste your energy.

359
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,313
What the hell do you want?

360
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,441
Soon

361
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:24,362
your dearly missed Seishin will show up.

362
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,951
It's been ten years, you said?

363
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,790
I'm not sure
if your mother will recognize you.

364
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,002
Current status?

365
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,547
We've cornered it to ride in the elevator.

366
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,254
Hey.

367
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:06,839
Hey!

368
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,892
It was the woman. She took my clothes.

369
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:21,353
She took my clothes,
and Mr. Soma beat me--

370
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,316
So, where is the woman now?

371
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,346
Sergeant.

372
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,348
What will happen to that woman?

373
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,519
Will she die at the hands of the creature?

374
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:44,937
Shut up, Josenjing.

375
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,398
This is no place for you to talk.

376
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,650
I'm sorry, sir.

377
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,023
Kill her.

378
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:18,030
Go on and kill her, Seishin!

379
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,367
Devour your daughter!

380
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,377
Go on!

381
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,420
Mother!

382
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:10,958
Mom?

383
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,718
Is it you, Mother?

384
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,059
Is it really you?

385
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,025
Mother…

386
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:57,796
<i>Mother!</i>

387
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,405
Seize it!

388
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,115
Seize it!

389
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,156
Mother…

390
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,329
Release the nitrogen gas.

391
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,873
Release the nitrogen!

392
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,896
- Fire!
- Fire!

393
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,637
Halt!

394
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:23,770
Where's the girl?

395
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,732
Where's the girl? Find her!

396
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,904
No! Let me go!

397
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,865
- Let go!
- What's wrong with you?

398
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,450
- Mom!
- Where are you going?

399
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:39,786
Pull yourself together!

400
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:43,540
Where do you think you're going?
To your own death?

401
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,630
That was my mother.

402
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,012
What?

403
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:06,855
Those bastards turned my mother
into that creature.

404
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,779
Please help me.

405
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:16,323
Help me.

406
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,078
Help me!

407
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,624
Unbelievable.

408
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:12,337
It withstood
all the nitrogen gas we shot at it.

409
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,259
Could it be that the maternal instinct…

410
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,263
conquered the Najin in the end?

411
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,890
What should we do about the girl?

412
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:29,729
Don't let her live.

413
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,691
Yes, sir!

414
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,241
All of you, follow me.

415
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,785
The hunt begins now!

416
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,036
Yes, sir!

417
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:00,886
Search thoroughly!

418
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,043
Try it.

419
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:35,212
It should make you feel better.

420
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,495
I won't ask if you're okay.

421
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:13,708
Because I know you aren't.

422
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:19,256
But still…

423
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,218
I hope you'll feel better.

424
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:30,725
The last words my mother spoke to me were,

425
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,688
"You must stay alive."

426
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,859
She told me to survive,
no matter what happens.

427
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:44,948
I was nine years old then.

428
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,828
I was too young to fully comprehend

429
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:54,958
what it meant to survive
without my mother.

430
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,719
For now, let's get out of here alive.

431
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:11,057
Then let's take our time
and come up with a plan.

432
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,733
Do you have more?

433
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:19,876
Yes, sir.

434
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:19,602
What are you doing?

435
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,399
You can't park your vehicle here.

436
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:26,776
I'm waiting for Commissioner Ishikawa.

437
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:29,446
Plus, my back is aching. Hold on.

438
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,742
I had a sudden craving as well.

439
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:35,785
You can't drink here.

440
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,705
Come now! Don't be so hard on yourself.

441
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:42,417
What do you say?
How about a drink together?

442
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,587
It's a chilly night,

443
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,715
but with a sip of this,
you'll feel nice and warm.

444
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,467
- Not allowed.
- What?

445
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:51,801
Hold on.

446
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,807
Not even champagne?

447
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,309
Cham…

448
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:00,560
Just a second.

449
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:06,107
Now, come this way. Come on!

450
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:16,868
How was Level Three?

451
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,077
All clear, sir.

452
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,288
- And Level Two?
- Nothing, sir.

453
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:23,458
It seems that she may have
already escaped.

454
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:29,172
Starting from now,
search the entire military ward.

455
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:32,342
The underground lab, the first floor,
and even the admission ward.

456
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,426
Yes, sir!

457
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,011
Sergeant Haneda!

458
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:38,973
You should see this.

459
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:43,353
Help us.

460
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,939
Damn it to hell.

461
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,331
Have you searched that side?

462
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:04,999
Currently underway, sir.

463
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,168
Start searching from the ward at the end.

464
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:10,171
But that's where
tuberculosis spread recently.

465
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,297
Silence!

466
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,799
Those are your given orders!

467
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:14,217
Yes, sir.

468
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,166
Father!

469
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,213
Chae-ok.

470
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,096
Chae-ok.

471
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,071
Are you okay?

472
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,293
Myeong-ja?

473
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:38,760
Let us escape with you, Master Jang.
I'd like to leave too.

474
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:10,249
The time allocated to us is ten minutes.

475
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:19,133
We start moving at six o'clock sharp.

476
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:39,195
Everyone must get in the truck
within those ten minutes.

477
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:43,866
What if we fail to get everyone
on board in time?

478
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:45,785
What happens then?

479
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:50,456
The truck will leave on time regardless.

480
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:02,468
Block all entryways to the military ward.

481
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,304
Seal off the building. Move out!

482
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,389
Yes, sir!

483
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,352
Are you all ready?

484
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:25,742
Then,

485
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:27,744
let's begin.
