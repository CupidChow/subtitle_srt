Any casualties?

3
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,541
We lost three soldiers and four members
of the disease control platoon.

4
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,626
One major was heavily injured.

5
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,295
Most of the Joseon test subjects are dead.

<i>How beautiful was it?</i>

7
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,214
How did it move?

8
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,217
Just how fast was it?

9
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,431
Tell me.

10
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,933
Tell me how perfect it was.

12
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,493
Excuse me, Major.

13
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,121
I haven't seen the floating spores
in a while now.

14
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,926
Help!

15
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,971
Somebody help me!

16
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,644
Lights!

17
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,229
Quickly! Now!

18
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,356
Aim!

19
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,496
Do you see anything?

20
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,373
No, sir. I can't make anything out!

21
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,476
Help me.

22
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,065
Please, somebody help.

23
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,613
Help me!

24
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,657
I don't want to die.

25
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,910
Please… Please help me.

26
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,662
Shut the door.

27
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,590
Shut the door. Now!

28
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,032
Don't stop!

29
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,034
Shut it now.

30
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,705
I said, shut the door.

31
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,498
Hurry up!

32
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,061
Help me, please!

33
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,114
Please! Help me, sir!

34
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,452
Shut the door. Do it now.

35
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,205
I don't want to die. Please help me!

36
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,540
Help me, Major Endo!

37
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,836
- Let go.
- No!

38
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,004
No, I won't!

39
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,547
- The door won't close!
- No!

40
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,174
It won't close because of you!

41
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,936
Let go!

42
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,188
Major Endo!

43
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,189
Asshole!

44
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,836
Answer me.

45
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,589
Was our experiment

46
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:51,882
a success?

47
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,511
Please…

48
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,724
destroy it.

49
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,271
What you have created…

50
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,191
is a calamity.

51
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,654
Before it's too late,

52
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,157
please destroy

53
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,993
that creature.

54
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:34,050
A calamity, you say?

55
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,263
I see.

58
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,210
The tea is very fragrant.

59
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,047
All thanks to you, Mr. Jang.

60
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,677
My tea ceremonies have become
twice as enjoyable

61
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,596
thanks to the elegant cups
you procured for me.

62
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,851
Your pronunciation of the Joseon tongue
has become much more natural.

63
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:11,230
Also thanks to you and the great teacher
you introduced me to.

64
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,746
Oh, I heard that Ongseong Hospital
has shut down.

65
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,081
Have you heard anything?

66
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,668
Well,

67
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,880
I did hear in passing

68
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:39,550
that an unknown infection
has spread in there.

69
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:44,430
The thing is, I've since lost contact
with a friend who was admitted there.

70
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:49,518
If you know anyone inside,
I was hoping you could ask them

71
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,022
about what it's like inside
and when it might open again.

72
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,151
Is this because of the girl
named Myeong-ja?

73
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:04,492
If so, it would be best
not to look for her.

74
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:19,548
There is a Joseon saying that goes,
"A drowning man will grasp at straws."

75
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:25,179
It means that a desperate man will cling
to anything, no matter how trivial.

76
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:31,018
I'm that drowning man, Lady Maeda.

77
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:35,898
You're more than capable of brushing off
my husband's threats, aren't you?

78
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,902
If they were mere threats,
I would've done so.

79
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,113
But I think he's serious this time.

80
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:45,699
So?

81
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,744
I intend to take this seriously too,

82
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,997
so I can survive.

83
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,752
You can't enter
Ongseong Hospital right now,

84
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,631
but even if you do,
you won't find what you're looking for.

85
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:05,469
So, you should look for another way,
Mr. Jang.

86
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,265
I'm advising you as a friend.

87
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,277
I need the blueprints for the hospital.

88
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,487
You have pull
with the Governor-General's Office.

89
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,739
Please bring me the most detailed prints.

90
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:29,410
What's the point of getting the blueprints
if we have no way in?

91
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,453
The hospital is shut down.

92
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:35,207
All outsiders and even the suppliers
have been denied entry.

93
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,459
There is no way of slipping in.

94
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,004
Bring them to me before the day is over.

95
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,672
They say it's an infection.

96
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:45,342
God knows what disease it might be.
We might all kick the bucket.

97
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,761
I'll go in alone, then. Okay?

98
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,722
What if it's a lie?

99
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,516
What if that sleuth girl lied
to save herself?

100
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,810
It's possible, isn't it?

101
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,314
The hospital's closed. There's no way out.
And the infection is spreading.

102
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:02,526
She could be lying about finding Myeong-ja
to save her own skin!

103
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,909
- Do you really think so?
- Think about it.

104
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,829
How can she be in a hospital reserved
for high-ranking Japanese officials?

105
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,664
There's no way she's there!

106
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,584
I'll bet my entire fortune of 380 won.

107
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,837
How can you be so consistently unlucky?

108
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,796
What?

109
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,425
Every card you draw is crap.
Every bet you make ends in a loss.

110
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,762
Every time you gamble,
you get your pockets totally cleaned out.

111
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,722
Hey, when has that ever happened to me?

112
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,099
Myeong-ja is definitely in there.

113
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,602
I just had it confirmed by Lady Maeda.

114
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,812
Ishikawa's wife?

115
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,107
Did that woman tell you
that Myeong-ja is in there?

116
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,818
Did she?

117
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,820
That broad said that? For real?

118
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,240
I'll be getting inside Ongseong Hospital
by 10:00 p.m. tonight.

119
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,992
Please prepare accordingly.

120
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,261
WE FOUND MYEONG-JA

121
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:18,435
Send a signal by 10:00 p.m.
to the east wing of Ongseong Hospital.

122
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,356
Any recognizable signal will do,
such as smoke or a flame.

123
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,608
You won't find what you're looking for.

124
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,110
Please find a way

125
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,737
to get them out.

126
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,281
You should look for another way,
Mr. Jang.

127
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,732
So, what has Jang Tae-sang been up to?

128
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:08,360
Well, he's been busy all morning
moving about the town.

129
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,319
But…

130
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,780
<i>But what?</i>

131
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,533
<i>His route has been a bit strange.</i>

132
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,621
<i>Mahjong?</i>

133
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:21,749
I win!

134
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,833
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

135
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,420
<i>He played mahjong for an hour</i>
<i>at the general store of Wang the Chinese.</i>

FIREWORKS

137
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,768
The next round is double.

138
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,395
Will you accept?

139
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,022
Sure!

140
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,067
<i>And then?</i>

141
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:53,739
<i>He rode a rickshaw around the streets</i>
<i>of Bonjeong for 30 minutes.</i>

142
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,493
- He just rode around the streets?
- Yes, sir.

143
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,745
Then lastly, he visited…

144
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,126
A tailor shop?

145
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,588
Yes, sir. He seemed to be getting
a new suit tailored.

146
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:12,925
I'd like a suit in the bold style
that's popular these days.

147
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,219
Yes, sir.

148
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,108
This American-made pure wool
just came in from Tokyo last month.

149
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,904
I think you'd prefer
the second option of fabric far more, sir.

150
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,163
It was sent over from the Moonlight Bar
just last night.

151
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,344
I'm here for afternoon cleaning.

152
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:00,764
Go in.

153
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,307
Yes, sir.

154
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,027
CLEANING SUPPLIES

155
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,756
Have you delivered the note?

156
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,800
I passed it on to someone we can trust.

157
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,344
By now, it should be
at the House of Golden Treasure.

158
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,221
By the way,

159
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,266
are you certain that Myeong-ja is in here?

160
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,851
It seems so.

161
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,269
Actually, last night…

162
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,898
Don't shoot him.

163
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,442
He's on our side.

164
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,195
- What?
- But that's a Japanese soldier.

165
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,654
No, I'm not!

166
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,364
I'm from Joseon.

167
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,993
I really am from Joseon.

168
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,846
Now, let's take a look here.

169
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,895
It's in good condition.

170
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,314
But it's rather old.

171
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,734
It was my family's source of income
for the past ten years.

172
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,987
I sent my eldest
to medical school with it.

173
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,448
The most I can give you is 90 won.

174
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,575
Will you still pawn it?

175
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,744
I don't need the money.

176
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:46,745
Instead,

177
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,290
could you please find my son?

178
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,795
I heard he was evacuated from Bongrim
after getting wounded in the battle.

179
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,256
But I've lost contact with him.

180
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,510
I was drafted while attending
Gyeongseong Medical School.

181
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,597
In Bongrim, China,
I got injured during battle

182
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,517
and was sent here, Ongseong Hospital.

183
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,812
After recovery, I was assigned
to the disease control platoon.

184
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,397
Disease control?

185
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,192
It seems that this hospital also has
a human experiment lab underground.

186
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,905
I saw countless Joseon people
lose their lives…

187
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,118
with my own eyes last night.

188
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,247
What happened last night…

189
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,543
was due to anthrax.

190
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,340
I witnessed something like this
in Bongrim.

191
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:45,470
An entire village
was stamped out by anthrax.

192
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,894
It was so horrific
that I still remember it to this day.

193
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,150
Those damn bastards!

194
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:07,659
Did you happen to see a young man
in his early 20s among the dead?

195
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,621
He is medium-height and has a black spot
next to his right ear.

196
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,834
I'm sorry.

197
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,754
I couldn't examine all the bodies.

198
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:25,177
Many Joseon people are still being kept
in the underground prison.

199
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,305
That's where I saw Myeong-ja as well.

200
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,400
Don't move
until we finish sterilizing the area.

201
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,446
It's dangerous,
so please stay where you are.

202
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,283
You could die
just by touching the anthrax.

203
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,495
So don't move and stay in that corner
until everything is sterilized.

204
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,038
All right?

205
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,708
You have to help me.

206
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,880
Please find Commissioner Ishikawa
at the Police Bureau.

207
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,548
Tell him I'm here.

208
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:07,969
Myeong-ja of Spring Moon Hall…
No, tell him Akiko is imprisoned here.

209
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,139
I'm sure he will reward you handsomely.

210
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,724
Please.

211
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:19,106
Please tell Ishikawa.
Tell him that I'm here, will you?

212
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,651
Shut it!

213
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,736
Keep quiet. Stay back!

214
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,419
<i>But there was nothing I could do for her.</i>

215
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,422
<i>Because I was in the same boat as them.</i>

216
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,939
What are you doing?

217
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,281
Get it together, Josenjing!

218
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,000
Don't spill your filthy vomit!

219
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,219
You Josenjing!

220
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,276
Filthy Josenjing!

221
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,870
<i>There was only one way to escape</i>

222
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,122
<i>this living hell.</i>

223
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,590
Mother.

224
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,762
Please forgive me!

225
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,126
Don't waste your life.

226
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,303
The time will come when your death counts.

227
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,224
You can die then.

228
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,929
Who is she?

229
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,181
Well,

230
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,977
I don't know
who the woman in the drawing is.

231
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,772
But I do know who drew this.

232
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,275
He's Japanese.

233
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,820
He calls himself a painter.

234
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:55,864
His name was

235
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,533
Sachimoto, I believe.

236
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,306
What are all these?

237
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,433
What have you drawn?

238
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,526
Tell me more.

239
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,570
Who does he work for? Where does he live?

240
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,948
Do you like Chinese food?

241
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,284
At 8:00 p.m. tonight. Sahaeru restaurant.

242
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,081
I'm afraid I have no luxury
to enjoy Chinese food at the moment.

243
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,500
I'm talking about Sachimoto, not you.

244
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:34,587
We arranged to meet at Sahaeru tonight.

245
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,882
- Tonight?
- At 8:00 p.m.

246
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,467
Don't be late.

247
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,770
You must be running
an interesting experiment.

248
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,399
I heard you lost
an entire disease control platoon,

249
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:58,278
along with stacks of Joseon test subjects.

250
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,825
I only wish that your experiment
will have strategic value for us.

251
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,870
What do you mean?

252
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:10,582
Tokyo has been burned to ashes
from the recent air strikes.

253
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,209
We are in dire need

254
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:18,631
of a powerful weapon that could
turn the tides of the war in our favor.

255
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:24,888
How about we make use
of that creature down below?

256
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,392
It's too early to reach any conclusion.

257
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,938
Its intelligence, its cognitive abilities,

258
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,816
and whether it could be tamed or not

259
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,944
haven't been confirmed yet.

260
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:45,450
Every living thing in this world
can eventually be tamed,

261
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,120
just as we have tamed Joseon.

262
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,959
I've only gone down
to the second basement.

263
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,461
This is the underground prison.
And Myeong-ja…

264
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,379
PRISON

265
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,713
…was here.

266
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:43,550
How many guards?

267
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:47,345
A pair of guards are stationed
every ten meters.

268
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,013
They are all armed.

269
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,933
Getting her out is going to be
as difficult as getting in.

270
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,059
But…

271
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,940
if you get her out,
is there a way to escape the hospital?

272
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:07,115
Let's wait in our positions
until we get a signal from outside.

273
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,325
You should head back to your platoon.

274
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:13,329
No, I'll never return to that place again.

275
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:16,875
If they search the ward looking for you,
it will cause us more trouble.

276
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,377
They might even find out about these two.

277
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,630
Then the entire operation would be over.

278
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,303
We should all be able to escape.

279
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,098
I'm sure of it.

280
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,477
I'll see you later, then.

281
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,314
Please…

282
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,901
don't forget about me.

283
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,176
Do you recognize it?

284
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,512
- The layout of this floor.
- Yes.

285
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,599
It's like the underground laboratory
back in Manchuria.

286
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,516
LABORATORY

287
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,435
It's worth trying, don't you think?

288
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,106
You remember what happened in Manchuria.

289
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,028
What went on
in that underground laboratory.

290
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,407
What horrors the people went through.

291
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:34,160
- Chae-ok.
- If the same thing is happening here…

292
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,540
shouldn't we try
to do something this time?

293
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,755
Let's wait at least
until the signal arrives.

294
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,908
It's already been 30 minutes.

295
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,827
Who are you waiting for anyway?

296
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,578
A woman.

297
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,414
A wooman?

298
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,165
Not "wooman." A woman.

299
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:22,750
There she is!

300
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,931
Good work. Get yourself something to eat.

301
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:57,994
Oh, excuse…

302
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,413
Look who it is.

303
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,041
Jang Ttai-sang of Golden Treasure.

304
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:11,716
Could you let me through?
I have urgent business to attend to.

305
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,302
Welcome. This way, please.

306
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:32,445
I think we have
some unfinished business to settle first.

307
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,823
Okay. I get it.

308
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,661
If that's what you want,
come to my shop tomorrow morning.

309
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,413
Sound good?

310
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,095
- Sir…
- Yeah.

311
00:34:57,178 --> 00:35:00,014
You must be hungry.
Here, it's Joseon <i>hotteok.</i>

312
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,099
Try it.

313
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,183
Yes, sir.

314
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,729
So good!

315
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:11,067
These Josenjing folks
really know their way around food, huh?

316
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,529
Sir…

317
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,572
Do you think he'll be okay?

318
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,038
Mori.

319
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,959
Our job is to observe, not intervene.

320
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,586
We observe, report,

321
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,047
and receive orders.

322
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,466
That's all there is to it.

323
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,011
- Yes, sir.
- Go on, try a bite.

324
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,525
Hang on. Wait.

325
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,693
Just a second.

326
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,361
We can resolve this with money.

327
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,240
No need to bring swords
into this fight, right?

328
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:02,660
Settle down, guys.
How much money do you want?

329
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,163
Golden Treasure.

330
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,539
Golden Treasure!

331
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,500
What about it?

332
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:13,337
Give us the House of Golden Treasure.
Then I'll spare your life.

333
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,887
Let's not kid around.

334
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,222
I told you, I'm quite busy right now.

335
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:26,309
I'm supposed to meet someone at 8:00 p.m.
A very important person!

336
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:29,395
Would you look at the time?
Look, it's almost time!

337
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:30,313
I'll be off.

338
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:36,694
Hey, you should think carefully
about who means more to you.

339
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:40,698
Many apologies,
but you're just not my type.

340
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,784
Please don't force me
to think so dearly of you!

341
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,579
- Hey, Jang Ttai-sang.
- Tae-sang!

342
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,498
It's Tae-sang, not Ttai-sang!

343
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,792
Say my name again.

344
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,214
Do you wish to die?

345
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,218
Of course not.

346
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,970
I might be a luckless guy,

347
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,182
but I never wish to get killed
by a bunch of scum.

348
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,600
Jackass!

349
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:47,783
You there!

350
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,537
What's going on?

351
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,414
Look here.

352
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,168
I'm Jang Tae-sang
of the House of Golden Treasure.

353
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:03,090
These thugs are attacking me
for no apparent reason.

354
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,092
Help me, Officer.

355
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:09,263
We're just teaching
this stubborn Josenjing a lesson.

356
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,641
You can just go on your way, sir.

357
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:16,645
Look, they are all brandishing swords!

358
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,231
My life is in danger!

359
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,653
I don't want you causing a scene,
so go easy on him.

360
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,155
Yes, sir.

361
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,239
Officer.

362
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,283
Officer!

363
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:31,952
See that?

364
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:35,081
This is the Joseon you're living in.

365
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:38,709
And you're nothing but trash
with a lot of money.

366
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,338
Filthy and pathetic

367
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:47,343
Josenjing

368
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,637
trash.

369
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,436
Boss!

370
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:01,982
You're right.

371
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,194
This is the Joseon I'm living in.

372
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,240
So give it a rest.

373
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,535
I'm already pissed off as it is.

374
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,801
Look!

375
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,595
Josenjings never die!

376
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,809
He's one tough nut.

377
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,049
This won't do, Father.

378
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,386
If we wait here any longer,
we will be wasting the whole night.

379
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,763
I'll go out and look around the ward.

380
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,943
<i>If this place has the same layout,</i>

381
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,779
there should be a vent
that leads into the underground lab.

382
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,824
- And the vent would be…
- Connected to the rooftop.

383
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,604
Chae-ok.

384
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:07,483
Should things get out of hand,
you must return without hesitation.

385
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,400
Do you understand?

386
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,486
I'll be back.

387
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,538
Hurry! Get a move on!

388
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,181
The blueprints?

389
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,018
I got them as I was told to.

390
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,270
But is this the right thing to do?

391
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:29,023
We are basically pushing him
right into his grave.

392
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,108
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

393
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,943
Master Jang calls the shots.

394
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,658
Is Tae-sang upstairs?

395
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,036
No, he's out. What's the matter?

396
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:45,289
An urgent matter has come up.
Where is he right now?

397
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,624
I'm not sure.

398
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,671
- Tae-sang!
- Sir!

399
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:53,589
Master Jang!

400
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:14,068
Please wait here for a moment.
I'll go after him.

401
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,027
Sure.

402
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,366
You're getting into sword fights now?

403
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,076
For heaven's sake!

404
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:08,330
What kind of rotten pricks
would be foolish enough to mess with you?

405
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,999
Wait here.
I'm going to report this to the police.

406
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,836
We'll go to the hospital first.
Get the car ready.

407
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,504
Right, the hospital. Okay.

408
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:19,049
Did you get the blueprints
for Ongseong Hospital?

409
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,051
Of course I did!

410
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,469
They are downstairs…

411
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,096
Forget about the blueprints.

412
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,306
Let's wrap the wound up
and go to the hospital.

413
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,142
Yeah, the hospital first.

414
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:31,478
I'm fine. Show me the blueprints, Mr. Gu.

415
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:36,150
Disinfectants and antibiotics
aren't going to heal this wound.

416
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:43,657
We don't have much time left
until 10:00 p.m.

417
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,033
Sir.

418
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,785
The blueprints now, Mr. Gu!

419
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,078
Tae-sang, please!

420
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:57,254
What could possibly be more important
than your own life?

421
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:01,467
Is Myeong-ja worth
getting stabbed over like this?

422
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,011
Is she really?

423
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,138
- Mrs. Nawol.
- I don't want to hear it.

424
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,933
Shut your mouth and go to the hospital.
Is that clear?

425
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,521
Right.

426
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:18,233
You're right, Mrs. Nawol.
Myeong-ja means nothing to me.

427
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,028
But…

428
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:26,116
those bastards are using her
as a ridiculous excuse to take my stuff.

429
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:32,039
They're claiming what's mine as theirs
without a speck of shame!

430
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,625
They even took our country.

431
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,919
They can take anything.

432
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:38,796
I suppose so.

433
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:41,673
But…

434
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,677
I'm going to hold out to the end.

435
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:52,309
They can beat me up and knock me around,
but I'll fight like hell for what's mine!

436
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,565
If I run away because they threaten me
and let them take what is mine,

437
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,694
they will never get to learn
a proper lesson.

438
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:03,737
Am I wrong?

439
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,155
You…

440
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,158
You were stabbed.

441
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:13,163
You're seriously wounded, okay?

442
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,625
This kind of wound doesn't hurt me.

443
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,879
What hurts me is not a sword.

444
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,509
It's my broken pride.

445
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,206
You're Yeong-chun.

446
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,877
I apologize for visiting at this hour,

447
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,214
but there is someone
who wishes to see Master Jang.

448
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,086
Wang. Open the door!

449
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,671
It's Gu from Golden Treasure!

450
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,299
Wang!

451
00:48:55,933 --> 00:49:01,355
LABORATORY

452
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,875
Mr. Sachimoto.

453
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,754
I've been out to buy some new supplies.

454
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,840
There are a lot of items.
Could you let us pass?

455
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,096
I'll send him out
as soon as I unload them.

456
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:40,806
I can't allow that.

457
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:43,225
No outsiders are allowed
to enter the hospital.

458
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:52,609
Then go ahead
and report directly to Director Ichiro.

459
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,444
Pardon?

460
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:58,240
The director ordered me to bring these in,
so there's no choice.

461
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:04,079
You better tell the director yourself
that you can't allow us in.

462
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:37,237
Are you here to save us?

463
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:39,531
What?

464
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:42,868
I saw you coming down from the vent.

465
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,371
Please save us.

466
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:49,332
Help us get out of here, please!

467
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:38,840
Hurry up!

468
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,053
Damn it!

469
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,257
Come on out.

470
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:47,886
Oh gosh.

471
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,099
I nearly suffocated in there.

472
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,608
This way.

473
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:18,541
CLOSED

474
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,352
What's going on?

475
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,938
Are you sure this is the meeting place?

476
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:07,567
This is the only cleaning supplies room
on the first floor I know of.

477
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:11,362
The signal…

478
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,410
I think our timing was off
because the signal was delayed.

479
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,888
The night breeze of Joseon
is so refreshing.

480
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,183
Let's drink here.

481
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:41,851
Yes, sir.

482
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,569
I found whiskey in the storage room.

483
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,656
So I snuck it out.

484
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,544
Hey. Be quiet.

485
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,276
Don't shoot.

486
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:21,159
Don't shoot.

487
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,536
Who are you?

488
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,225
- Fireworks.
- What is that?

489
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:45,702
Chae-ok!

490
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:46,679
Forgive me.

491
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:49,932
I'm late.

492
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,534
What a sight.

493
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:29,597
They succeeded.

494
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,350
I'm not so sure.

495
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:35,853
I hope they did.

496
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,613
No, I'm not sure what's going on.

497
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:48,324
Yes, of course.
Fireworks are banned in Gyeongseong.

498
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:52,995
Yes, sir! I'll find the culprits
and report them to you immediately.

499
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:54,539
Yes, sir!

500
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,752
I'm heading over to the bureau. Get ready.

501
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:00,670
Yes, sir.

502
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,728
How beautiful.

503
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,399
Have you found Myeong-ja?

504
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,943
Where is she? Did you get her out?

505
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,613
You can come out now.

506
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:54,765
Careful.

507
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:57,852
There we go.

508
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,071
Wait.

509
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:11,324
Where's Myeong-ja?

510
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,576
Get these kids out of here first.

511
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:16,245
What are you talking about?
Who are these kids?

512
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,080
If you take the kids out of here,

513
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:20,041
I'll go and find Myeong-ja.

514
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,394
You have something to show me?

515
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:42,271
Yes.

516
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:54,200
Move.

517
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:55,993
Get in there now!

518
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,481
What is this place?

519
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:47,211
I'm going to make that creature
recognize me.

520
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,423
Every time I ring the bell,

521
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:53,050
it will remember
and know that I'm feeding it.

522
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:57,888
It will know who its master is
and whom it must obey.

523
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:00,182
That's how I'll tame it.
