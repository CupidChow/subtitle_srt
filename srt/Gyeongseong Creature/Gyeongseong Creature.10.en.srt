GYEONGSEONG CREATURE

00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:03,706
<i>Ordinary life…</i>

3
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,128
<i>was all I ever dreamed of.</i>

4
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,216
<i>Gathering with my family for dinner</i>

5
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,886
<i>and sharing the day's stories.</i>

6
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,808
<i>Dreaming of the future</i>

7
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,769
<i>with the person I love.</i>

8
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,021
<i>Just like that.</i>

9
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,825
<i>I just wanted to live…</i>

10
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,787
<i>the ordinary life…</i>

11
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,249
<i>that everyone else has.</i>

12
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,306
<i>What a futile dream you had.</i>

13
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:11,357
In this world you live in,
the more you dream of such things,

14
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,776
the more painful life becomes.

15
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,198
Why are you keeping me here?

16
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:25,163
I was curious
as to what kind of person you were.

17
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,667
Seeing you like this,

18
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,296
I can tell you have Seishin's eyes.

19
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:36,966
Do you know my mother?

20
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,054
There's a time in life when we realize

21
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,225
that we are linked together
by chains of fate far more powerful

22
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,602
and mysterious than we'd expect.

23
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:54,442
For you, Ms. Yoon Chae-ok, Seishin, and I,

24
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,862
it seems that is the case.

25
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,744
He says he knows
where Yoon Chae-ok was taken.

26
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,455
Excuse me.

27
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,124
Do you really believe
what that kid is saying?

28
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,459
Can we believe him?

29
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,794
I'm sure of it.

30
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,964
I just saw her with my own eyes.

31
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,424
You bit the hand that fed you!

32
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,219
How could you do this
to Master Jang, you ingrate?

33
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,429
He's already heard those words from me.

34
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,765
When you were starving to death,

35
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,393
who took you in and made you
into a decent human being?

36
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,144
I already said that too.

37
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,897
I was told that Master Jang
wouldn't be harmed

38
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,650
and that he would be safe
if I reported the woman.

39
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:39,153
Lady Maeda said
this was all for Master Jang's sake.

40
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,701
My goodness, you thickheaded buffoon.
You actually believed that?

41
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:59,215
Where is it?
Where is Yoon Chae-ok being held?

42
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,099
Is the prey ready?

43
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,685
Lady Maeda sent us a Josenjing woman.

44
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,694
What are you doing?

45
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,112
Hold onto it for me.

46
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,531
If I don't make it back…

47
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,741
Master Jang.

48
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,870
…then sell this shop.

49
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,041
Please, Mrs. Nawol.

50
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,089
The short wicks go off after five minutes,

51
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,092
and the long ones after eight minutes.

52
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,805
Each explosive has a blast radius
of about five to six meters.

53
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,767
It probably won't knock down the building,
but it will deal a serious blow.

54
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,359
Look, Master Jang.

55
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,527
Master?

56
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,281
I wish you success.

57
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,367
Come back safely.

58
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,670
<i>Will you be okay on your own?</i>

59
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,340
I have already been inside once,
so I know my way around.

60
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:08,052
It's quicker and easier to move alone,
and getting caught is less likely.

61
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,555
Tae-sang--

62
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,806
Stay safe.

63
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:17,812
When this is all over,
let's have a drink at the Moonlight Bar.

64
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:21,566
Sounds good.

65
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,028
Let's go.

66
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,965
It seems
that I have underestimated Lady Maeda.

67
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:50,178
I didn't expect her
to have you brought here so quickly.

68
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,806
In a moment,

69
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,810
your father will be here as well.

70
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,897
It will be an interesting experiment.

71
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,191
I wonder,

72
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,277
between you and your father,

73
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:12,408
whose head will your mother devour first?

74
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,231
Hey!

75
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,524
Stop!

76
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,133
How is it…

77
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,927
How is it that

78
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,847
you people never get scared?

79
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,184
You know you can't win.

80
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:25,356
So, how can you still look at me
with those eyes?

81
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,192
I have a question for you too.

82
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,906
How are you all so unabashedly proud?

83
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,786
You violated my mother.

84
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,833
You trampled on my family's happiness.

85
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,422
Even after killing
so many innocent people…

86
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,928
how can you be so shameless?

87
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,396
My glorious results and achievements

88
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:10,985
are too great for the likes of you
to dare discuss, Josenjing.

89
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,535
Achievements?

90
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,081
Is that right?

91
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,836
Do you think justifying
and glorifying what you do…

92
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,300
will really erase your crimes?

93
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,095
You can pretend all you want,

94
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:43,225
but do you think you can hide
your people's inferiority complex?

95
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,073
Colonel Kato?

96
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:02,703
Colonel Kato!

97
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,497
What?!

98
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,877
Mother…

99
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,190
That's right.

100
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,735
Don't move!

101
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,780
Or your daughter will get hurt, Seishin.

102
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,504
Fire.

103
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,339
Fire!

104
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,887
No, stop!

105
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,138
No!

106
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:10,080
GYEONGSEONG CREATURE
BETWEEN THE END AND ANOTHER BEGINNING

107
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,750
EPISODE 10

108
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,507
You're returning to Tokyo next month?

109
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,886
I'm so jealous.

110
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,474
So, will your anatomy book
be published in Tokyo?

111
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,477
Probably.

112
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,355
Will you become famous, then?

113
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,820
She's beautiful.

114
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,823
Who is she? Your Joseon-born lover?

115
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,201
It's Seishin. Don't you remember?

116
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,412
Wait, <i>that </i>Seishin?

117
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,042
She had such a pretty face.

118
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,461
No wonder her husband
couldn't forget about her.

119
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,298
Husband?

120
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,134
Yes. Haven't you heard?

121
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,639
Apparently, Seishin's husband
came looking for her.

122
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,432
He requested to meet his wife.

123
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,213
MILITARY USE
GASOLINE

124
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:07,907
Master Jang!

125
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:09,658
Mr. Yoon?

126
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,084
Bring all the nitrogen gas we have!
Release it all.

127
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,420
Don't let the creature
come up to Level Two!

128
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,546
Yes, sir!

129
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,092
Wait!

130
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,102
It's here. Stop it!

131
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,313
You five!

132
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,399
Grab her and follow me.

133
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,699
So, my daughter

134
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,870
has been captured
and brought back in here?

135
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,254
I'm sorry.

136
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,174
I should've taken better care of her.

137
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,850
Here.

138
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,356
A ship bound for Shanghai will be leaving
from Incheon in the morning.

139
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,402
Chae-ok is currently wanted
for shooting Director Ichiro.

140
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,113
You must get on that ship
right after you escape.

141
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,116
Master Jang…

142
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,202
Leave the rest to me
and take Chae-ok with you.

143
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,080
That way, she'll agree to get on the ship.

144
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,617
No!

145
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,911
Shut the door quickly!

146
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,121
Move! Now!

147
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,205
Mother!

148
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,137
Hurry!

149
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,565
The specimen is currently
blocked off at Level 2-2.

150
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,067
And Colonel Kato?

151
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,111
Coming up the eastern emergency exit
with the Josenjing hostage.

152
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,405
Stop the specimen
at Level Two by all means.

153
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,700
It must not come up any further.
Understood?

154
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,618
Yes, sir!

155
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,329
Damn it.

156
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,214
Did you hear that? That was about Chae-ok.

157
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,217
The eastern emergency exit
is near the central elevator.

158
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,053
It's not far from here.
Let's head that way first.

159
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,932
What are you doing?

160
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,976
I'll take care of the rest.

161
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,855
Please take Chae-ok out with you.

162
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,566
No, this is my duty.

163
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,194
- Master Jang.
- Listen.

164
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,781
I have never once dumped
my responsibilities on someone else.

165
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:39,535
Moreover, this isn't something
I can leave in someone else's hands.

166
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,121
For Chae-ok's sake, I can't do that.
Don't you get it?

167
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,705
For Chae-ok's sake,

168
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,709
it's only right that you go to her.

169
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:49,878
Don't you get it?

170
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,050
Master Jang.

171
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,513
I'm someone who lives in the past.

172
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:05,477
But you and Chae-ok,
you two will live for the future.

173
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,566
Besides, it's my wife who is down there.

174
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,945
How could I let someone else

175
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,532
see to the last moments of my beloved?

176
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,834
Please take…

177
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,422
good care of Chae-ok.

178
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,095
Please be safe.

179
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,312
Colonel Kato!

180
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,272
How's the situation?

181
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,900
We're forming a defense line
to stop it from ascending,

182
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:56,403
but it would be best to shut down
the underground laboratory, just in case.

183
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,991
I must retrieve
some things from my office.

184
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,075
In ten minutes,

185
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,162
we're shutting this place down.

186
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,666
- Take the girl up with you.
- Yes, sir.

187
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:15,923
Damn it!

188
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,384
MILITARY USE
GASOLINE

189
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,632
Stay still,

190
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,384
or we will shoot you!

191
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,497
No!

192
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,594
Help me…

193
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,597
My stomach

194
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,683
hurts so much.

195
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,228
Please help me.

196
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,690
My stomach,

197
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,902
it hurts so much…

198
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,280
Save me…

199
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,241
Help me…

200
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,705
My stomach, it hurts so much…

201
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:28,990
This way.

202
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:42,337
<i>I have heard no news</i>

203
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,507
<i>Of the boat that left</i>

204
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:51,430
<i>On the day of </i>Chilseok

205
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,599
<i>Over there</i>

206
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,188
<i>Across the sea</i>

207
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,152
<i>The boat returns</i>

208
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:16,288
<i>And the song of the boatsman</i>

209
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:22,711
<i>Draws nearer and nearer</i>

210
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,635
<i>But you, my love</i>

211
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:34,931
<i>I've not heard from you</i>

212
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,520
<i>Ever since you left</i>

213
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:20,769
Honey.

214
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,981
Seong-sim!

215
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,575
It's time…

216
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,038
for us to leave here together.

217
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,694
Let's go.

218
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,535
The way out is this way, not that way.

219
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,663
My father and mother are still down there.

220
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,420
It was his last request!

221
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,925
I promised to get you out of here safely.

222
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:21,890
I made that promise to your father.

223
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,479
You met my father?

224
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:29,898
He said

225
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,443
he wanted to be with your mother.

226
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:29,058
There was a large explosion
at Ongseong Hospital just now.

227
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:38,485
Hey! I heard there was a loud explosion
over at Ongseong Hospital!

228
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,820
Loud enough to shake the buildings!

229
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,073
It's caused a hell of a ruckus.
The fire brigade is on its way!

230
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,074
Let's go!

231
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,690
- Put 'em out!
- Hurry!

232
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:19,859
Put the fire out!

233
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,945
Before it spreads all over!

234
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,614
Water! Bring more water!

235
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,116
- Bring more!
- Put it out now!

236
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,626
The specimen is nowhere to be seen, sir.

237
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,753
It wasn't found in Area One either.

238
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:42,590
Any chance it perished in the fire
or was crushed under the rubble?

239
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,510
Then there should be traces of it,
but there's nothing.

240
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,929
What? Where could it have gone?

241
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,364
The entrance to the yard is open,
thanks to the firefighters.

242
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:52,827
You'll be able to make your escape
amid the chaos.

243
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,957
We'll go on our own from here.

244
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,001
But--

245
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,463
You helped us escape the ward,
and we're more than grateful.

246
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,925
But I can't let you risk your life.

247
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,683
I sincerely apologize.

248
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:23,858
For the things that happened to you
and your mother…

249
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,820
I'd like to apologize.

250
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:32,116
I've been making excuses,
telling myself that

251
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,620
I have no choice given the time I live in.

252
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,747
But the truth is…

253
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:40,708
I was just…

254
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,129
one of the bystanders.

255
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,549
Please…

256
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,930
take care of yourself, Mr. Sachimoto.

257
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,646
Your papers.

258
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,231
Mr. Wang sent me.

259
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,567
It's a message from Master Jang.

260
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:31,105
Beom-o, go and bring Mr. Park over.

261
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,648
We need to use his rickshaw.

262
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,902
Mrs. Nawol, I'll do it.
A car is faster than a rickshaw.

263
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,029
And have the whole police bureau
take notice?

264
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,989
They won't. I'll be careful!

265
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,617
Forget it. Safety comes first.

266
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,204
Then I'll deliver it.

267
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,790
Well, a bicycle is faster than a rickshaw.

268
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,877
And the police won't care about me.

269
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,299
Please…

270
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,720
give me one chance to redeem myself.

271
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,305
Please?

272
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:26,911
Follow him.

273
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:34,877
Thanks.

274
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,964
Go to Mrs. Nawol in the morning,
and she'll pay you.

275
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,549
Take care, Master Jang.

276
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,438
HEINOUS MURDERER

277
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,961
I arranged our ride to Incheon. Let's go.

278
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,307
Ms. Yoon.

279
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,312
Let's end it here.

280
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,944
I'll go alone from here.

281
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,447
What do you mean?

282
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,033
I'm the one who killed Director Ichiro.

283
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,411
I'm the one they're looking for.

284
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:54,081
I may have to live
the rest of my life on the run

285
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,376
without knowing
when I'll be captured and killed.

286
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,129
That's why I want you
to get on the ship with me.

287
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,381
I don't wish to drag you…

288
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,845
into my life of worries.

289
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,150
Do you…

290
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,239
not like me?

291
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,327
You know that's not what I mean.

292
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,914
Then it's all settled.

293
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,043
I'm going with you.

294
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,294
Master Jang.

295
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:41,879
I…

296
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,760
have already died once.

297
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,098
The reason I'm standing here

298
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,643
is because your father granted me

299
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,896
a bonus life, if you will…

300
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,775
to protect you.

301
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,278
To stay by your side.

302
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,950
They won't give up looking for me.

303
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,077
And I will never give you up.

304
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,166
I can't live without you.

305
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,044
You already know that.

306
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:04,879
No way.

307
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:59,201
We cannot delay any longer.
Let's get going so we don't miss the ship.

308
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:08,919
Wait.

309
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,723
- Beom-o, you came.
- Yes.

310
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:24,977
I'm a bit late because I had to lose
a tail along the way.

311
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:23,619
Well done, Shiro.

312
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:26,413
No.

313
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,875
Master, it's not what it looks like.
It really isn't. I swear!

314
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,377
Please believe me!

315
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,967
All right. Hide over there.

316
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:47,935
In any case,

317
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,188
I have to give it to you, Mr. Jang.

318
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:56,568
Once you set your eyes on something,
you acquire it by any means necessary.

319
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:02,700
But burning the hospital to the ground
like that was a bit too much.

320
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:07,246
Nothing compared to the things
you people did inside those walls.

321
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:10,499
So, what are you going to do now?

322
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:17,339
Will you really give everything up
for that seditious Joseon woman?

323
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,633
I believe I gave my answer.

324
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:38,110
There was a time
when I considered you a friend.

325
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:42,114
I suppose I'm losing a friend today.

326
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,163
Come to think of it,
I lost another friend of mine

327
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:52,458
just like this in the past.

328
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,920
At that time…

329
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,592
it was because of that girl's mother.

330
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,355
Now,

331
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:20,277
I ask you both to die here.

332
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:25,699
Goodbye.

333
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,114
Kill them!

334
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:39,536
Let's go.

335
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:38,637
Hang on.

336
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,476
Get up.

337
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:55,946
Get up.

338
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,305
Mother…

339
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,020
Stop this now.

340
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,904
I know you're in pain too.

341
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,209
This man…

342
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:59,593
This is the man I love.

343
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,264
So…

344
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:07,726
let's…

345
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,439
stop this now.

346
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,324
Let's end it here.

347
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:33,710
Ms. Yoon.

348
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,171
Ms. Yoon.

349
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:41,593
Ms. Yoon!

350
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:45,805
You'll be all right. Hang in there!

351
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:50,644
We promised to be together.

352
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,482
Try getting up.

353
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:58,276
Ms. Yoon, please get up.

354
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,662
The cherry blossoms…

355
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,834
have all fallen.

356
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,619
<i>Stay with me.</i>

357
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:53,790
Stay…

358
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:57,627
right by my side.

359
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,390
This can't be.

360
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,392
No…

361
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,146
No!

362
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,148
No!

363
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,279
No!

364
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,077
No…

365
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,004
No…

366
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,600
Please, no…

367
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:52,826
Colonel Kato!

368
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:54,411
Sir!

369
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,514
Colonel!

370
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,114
Colonel.

371
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:37,203
Keep it down.

372
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,107
How amazing!

373
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:41,226
My friend asked me
to give this to you, ma'am.

374
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:45,813
Your friend?

375
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:50,026
Jang Tae-sang
of the House of Golden Treasure.

376
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,891
FAREWELL

377
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:57,218
FROM JANG TAE-SANG
OF HOUSE OF GOLDEN TREASURE

378
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:01,848
FROM AKIKO
COURTESAN OF SPRING MOON HALL

379
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,434
FROM PRIVATE CHOI YEONG-GWAN
OF DISEASE CONTROL PLATOON

380
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,146
FROM YOON JUNG-WON
SLEUTH

381
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:11,232
FROM YOON CHAE-OK
SLEUTH

382
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,363
FROM CHOI SEONG-SIM

383
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:38,718
FAREWELL

384
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,743
"Justice prevails. You reap what you sow."

385
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,371
That's how it goes, you know.

386
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:15,088
You've been a big help.

387
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:19,342
If you hadn't come that day
and convinced Comrade Lee In-hyeok,

388
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:21,594
this rebellion wouldn't have happened.

389
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:25,556
Ultimately, you are the true patriot.

390
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,159
Thanks for the drink.

391
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,078
I'll see you again.

392
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:50,081
Comrade Jang!

393
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:56,003
What a huge achievement.

394
01:01:56,504 --> 01:02:01,592
You really are a true hero and fighter
for our nation. Isn't that right?

395
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:03,386
- Hear, hear.
- That's right.

396
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:10,685
Are you in urgent need of money?

397
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:12,437
Pardon?

398
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,773
If you have anything useful,
bring it over.

399
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,859
I'll pay you handsomely.

400
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,157
By the way, I'm not Comrade Jang.

401
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:27,493
I'm Master Jang Tae-sang
of the House of Golden Treasure.

402
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:28,870
Well, then.

403
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:41,549
<i>Here's the truth, Tae-sang.</i>

404
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:44,218
When I was locked up
in the underground lab,

405
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,388
I gave your name up.

406
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:52,518
I ratted out my friend and my comrades

407
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:56,022
and begged for my life.

408
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:06,365
When this is all over,
let's have a drink at the Moonlight Bar.

409
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,380
Silk! Come take a look at our silk!

410
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:34,393
They are silk!

411
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:41,442
Ask them to bring some green onion.

412
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,403
Yes, please slice some of this meat.

413
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:47,740
Hey, excuse me. I'd like one <i>gukbap</i>!

414
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,131
Let's go inside. The night is cold.

415
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:47,967
<i>Spring went past unusually quickly</i>
<i>in Gyeongseong that year.</i>

416
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,201
<i>And in August of the same year,</i>

417
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:01,540
<i>we finally recovered</i>
<i>those that were taken from us.</i>

418
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:09,632
<i>As she once said,</i>

419
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,385
<i>the cherry blossoms</i>

420
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:15,429
<i>had already begun to fall.</i>

421
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,164
<i>Hurray for the independence of Korea!</i>

422
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:45,501
<i>Hurray for the independence of Korea!</i>

423
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:48,587
<i>Hurray for the independence of Korea!</i>

424
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:51,173
<i>Hurray for the independence of Korea!</i>

425
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:05,563
Lady Maeda.

426
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:15,531
As of today, Ongseong Hospital
is closing its doors.

427
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:25,332
Most of the doctors and nurses
will be returning to Japan.

428
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,629
You must also…

429
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:36,635
make a decision now.

430
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:38,971
Will you return to Kyoto,

431
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:40,306
or

432
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:45,603
will you continue
to explore new possibilities?

433
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:44,620
<i>As for me,</i>

434
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:48,624
<i>I'm still waiting</i>
<i>for the things I have dreamed of.</i>

435
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:21,157
Chae-ok.

436
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:09,181
IN REMEMBRANCE OF OUR COLLEAGUES
KIM HYEON-JUNG AND SEO JI-HUN

437
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:16,397
JUNE 25TH
4:20 A.M.

438
01:11:20,484 --> 01:11:21,443
SILENT PROTEST

439
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:28,242
DREAMS COME TRUE

440
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:03,027
Ho-jae, we're ready. Let's go!
