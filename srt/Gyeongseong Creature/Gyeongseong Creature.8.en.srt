00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,153
I have arranged it
with Director Ichiro of Ongseong Hospital.

<i>The child in your womb</i>

00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,165
<i>not only to Mr. Ishikawa, but also to me.</i>

5
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:47,750
<i>That being said…</i>

6
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,256
please take exceptional care of yourself,

7
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,383
Miss Akiko.

8
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,132
The spores stopped floating around
an hour ago.

9
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,010
Has it awakened?

10
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,430
Yes, but it's not moving.

11
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,934
Perhaps we used too much nitrogen gas?

12
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,941
What's on your mind?

13
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,567
Seishin.

14
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,581
Lieutenant Colonel Kato, we have a guest.

15
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,669
This is Lady Maeda.
She is the wife of Commissioner Ishikawa

16
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:58,006
and the daughter
of Lieutenant General Maeda of the Army.

17
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,926
Outsiders are not allowed down here.

18
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,222
She's also the most generous sponsor
of our hospital, Colonel.

19
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,777
Is that it?

20
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,198
I'd advise you not to get too close.

21
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,040
Seishin.

22
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,841
So you were still alive.

23
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,220
Teacher Seishin.

EPISODE 8
AWAKENING

26
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,156
<i>He must have gone through an ordeal.</i>

27
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,495
<i>He hasn't been able to sleep a wink</i>
<i>or swallow a bite of food.</i>

28
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,623
What about Tae-sang?

29
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,542
He didn't make it back.

30
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:01,212
And the merchants in Bonjeong
have all been arrested.

31
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,218
Yes, hello.

32
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,636
Yes.

33
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,346
Yes.

34
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,808
- Yes, sir.
- Quiet!

35
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,351
Sit down!

36
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,484
Mr. Gu, what's going on?

37
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,112
Why haven't we heard from Master Jang yet?

38
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,366
Is he… not coming to save us?

39
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,120
Is that it?

40
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,289
Damn it!

Tae-sang.

44
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,421
What are you up to?

45
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,716
Hurry back home, will you?

46
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:41,687
Is he dead?

47
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,526
He's breathing, just about.

48
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,861
Take him so he can get treated.

49
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,280
- Hurry.
- Yes, sir!

50
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,081
Kill him…

51
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,047
Find…

52
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,051
the bastard

53
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,930
and kill him!

54
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,468
All of you, stop and stand back!

55
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,364
As you were.

56
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,798
Sir! I have something to report.

57
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,803
Is it urgent?

58
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,305
First Sergeant Haneda
was found next to the body dump.

59
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,890
He has a serious gunshot wound.

60
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,521
My apologies, Lady Maeda.
Would you wait inside for just a moment?

61
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,309
Mr. Jang!

62
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,689
What are you… doing here?

63
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,150
I came in to do a job

64
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,361
but missed my chance to leave.

65
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,573
So I need you

66
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,659
to help me, Lady Maeda.

67
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,544
Are you saying that a Josenjing
is still hiding in here?

68
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,504
Yes, sir. It seems so.

69
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,797
Director Ichiro!

70
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,760
The Josenjing seems to be in this wing.

71
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,929
This soldier just found blood
near the supply room.

72
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,316
Lady Maeda, I'm afraid

73
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,860
now is not a good time…

74
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,037
It's an emergency! Emergency!

75
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,997
Lady Maeda is in danger!

76
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,959
Find Lady Maeda immediately! Now!

77
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,858
Lady Maeda.

78
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,541
No questions. Just drive.

79
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,774
Go.

80
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,412
Thank you.

81
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,053
What should I do, ma'am? Shall I stop?

82
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,119
To Bonjeong.

PAWNSHOP
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

84
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,149
Were you at Golden Treasure again?

85
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,823
Waiting for me?

86
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,201
It's been four days.

87
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,121
The fact that he hasn't reached out

88
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,957
means it's unlikely for him to return.

89
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,586
Besides, our job was to find Myeong-ja.

90
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,757
Since we've done our part,
it is time for us to head back home.

91
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,470
Get ready to leave early tomorrow morning.

92
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,889
I should have stayed in his place.

93
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,685
It was his choice.

94
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,938
All he had to do was save Myeong-ja, but…

95
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,775
because of us…

96
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,905
I should've stayed
and found a way to rescue Mother.

97
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,910
I should've at least gotten revenge
on those who did that to her.

98
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,666
Then he wouldn't have been left alone.

99
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,670
And I wouldn't be wracked with guilt.

100
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,049
What do you mean by that?

101
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,432
I met Mother.

102
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,770
She's still there…

103
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,524
at Ongseong Hospital.

104
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,750
It's been in that state
ever since Lady Maeda's visit.

105
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,128
It seems to be enraged by something.

106
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,924
It's looking for its young.

107
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,343
Sir?

108
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,969
It's not enraged,

109
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,097
but agitated.

110
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,762
I'll ask again.

111
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,806
Where are the Josenjings
you helped escape?

112
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,810
I don't know.

113
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,897
Where is Jang Tae-sang right now?

114
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,611
I wish I knew.

115
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,158
You don't seem to understand.

116
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,577
Should we start over?

117
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,998
Over…

118
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,002
Start… over…

119
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,511
<i>Have you ever had</i>

120
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,639
<i>your nails plucked out?</i>

121
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,853
<i>Have you ever been burned…</i>

122
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,112
<i>or gone through electric torture?</i>

123
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,660
<i>Do you know what happens</i>

124
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,163
<i>when water mixed with chili powder</i>
<i>is poured down your nose</i>

125
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,416
<i>while hanging upside down?</i>

126
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,128
<i>Persist to that point,</i>

127
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,548
<i>and a person can no longer remain human.</i>

128
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,051
<i>If you're ever in such a situation,</i>

129
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,471
<i>don't try to hold back and ruin your life.</i>

130
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,390
<i>Just tell them everything you know.</i>

131
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:53,770
I won't ever resent you for betraying me
in a situation like that.

132
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,772
Keep that in mind.

133
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,985
Let me ask you again.

134
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,779
What is the true purpose of your pawnshop?

135
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,281
Are you rebels?

136
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,326
Or do you secretly fund
the independence army?

137
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,038
Answer me!

138
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:15,334
Where is Jang Tae-sang?

139
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,931
Goddamn it…

140
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,042
You are awake.

141
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,129
Lady Maeda.

142
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,942
Your fever has gone down, thankfully.

143
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,694
Your wounds are also healing well.

144
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,786
How long have I been here?

145
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,331
As of today, it's been four days.

146
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:45,424
You caused quite a stir
at Ongseong Hospital.

147
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,304
Though you didn't need to risk your life
over someone else's trouble.

148
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,557
It's not like you.

149
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:00,689
It just

150
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,275
made me a bit angry.

151
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,572
It's not my fault that this country
has come to this.

152
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:14,703
It's not my fault those people
were kept in there and suffering, but…

153
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:19,374
But?

154
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,418
But…

155
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,547
once I saw it with my own eyes,

156
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,049
it made me angry.

157
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,802
It pissed me off.

158
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:35,765
Could you not stand the injustice
as a fellow Joseon person?

159
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,395
No, I couldn't stand it

160
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,148
as a fellow human being.

161
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:49,696
Do you think all human lives are equal?

162
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,159
Do you somehow think they're not?

163
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,666
Do you still

164
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,378
consider us friends?

165
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,357
A serial murder case?

166
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,944
Yes, 11 deaths around Cheonggyecheon
over the past four days.

167
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,154
We've requested the military ward
for autopsies.

168
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:34,449
An unusually large number of corpses
were in a very strange state.

169
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,743
Strange? In what way?

170
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,288
They were missing their brains, sir.

171
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,783
He's from the military ward.

172
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,009
This is the House of Golden Treasure!

173
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,802
No.

174
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,388
We haven't put the store up for sale.

175
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,058
What are you talking about?

176
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:44,936
Dead…

177
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,522
What do you mean? Who's dead?

178
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,276
Just who do you think you are?

179
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,237
You watch your mouth
and the crap that comes out of it!

180
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,949
That's right, you heard me! Oh, pipe down!

181
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,995
Shut your trap,
or I will sew it shut for you.

182
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,500
Like they know it all.

183
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:11,004
How dare they say shit like he's dead
as if they have a say in it?

184
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,476
You've got to be freaking kidding me.

185
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,776
House of Golden Treasure.

186
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:38,907
I believe my employee
has already answered that question.

187
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,117
Me?

188
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,204
I'm the master of this shop,

189
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,165
Jang Tae-sang.

190
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,253
Yes.

191
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,756
I'm still alive and well.

192
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:03,431
More people have been eyeing up
my treasured shop lately, haven't they?

193
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,310
Tae-sang, you…

194
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,396
Look what you've done.

195
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,108
You didn't have to close up shop.
I was only gone for a few days.

196
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,610
No wonder they got the wrong idea.

197
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:17,862
Are…

198
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,116
Are you all right?

199
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,660
Of course I am.

200
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,208
You're not hurt?

201
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,793
Of course not!

202
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,628
Fool!

203
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,840
If you're okay,
then what took you so long?

204
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,884
Did you enjoy giving this old woman
a heart attack?

205
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,303
You heartless boy!

206
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,930
Hey, I'm sorry.

207
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,390
I had my reasons!

208
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:48,768
So calm down, Mrs. Nawol.

209
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,151
I said I was sorry.

210
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,946
Enough of this.

211
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,118
You should go and fetch Mr. Gu now.

212
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,709
Where is he?

213
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:57,670
Get up.

214
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,345
No! I won't go!

215
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:07,847
Get out!

216
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,878
Wait here.

217
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,464
Stop right there!

218
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,925
Where do you think you're going?

219
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,138
Is that Jang from Golden Treasure?

220
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,771
I'm here to see Commissioner Ishikawa.

221
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:00,066
Hey, you! Are you ignoring me?

222
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,319
Go tell him I'm here.

223
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,988
You insolent bastard!

224
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,117
Swinging a fist at someone

225
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,161
who's come to have a conversation
is what thugs do.

226
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:20,628
If you're a police officer,
why don't you act like one?

227
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,604
You caused a bigger scene than I expected.

228
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,733
Only because you told me to do
whatever it took.

229
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,068
So,

230
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:48,573
what did you do with the Joseon people
you helped escape?

231
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,536
Which Joseon people are you referring to?

232
00:31:55,705 --> 00:32:00,501
Like I said, I'm here as a representative
of the Bonjeong Merchants Association.

233
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,838
I'm asking you to release
the wrongfully imprisoned merchants.

234
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,010
No less than ten violations
were committed that night.

235
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,846
Loud singing, jazz-playing,

236
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,892
violation of public order
and security regulations, et cetera.

237
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,061
Let's settle this with a fine.

238
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,438
Do you think money
will fix this situation?

239
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,066
It's the cleanest and easiest way,
isn't it?

240
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,861
And if I refuse?

241
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:31,366
Then all businesses in Bonjeong
will close up starting today.

242
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,537
You know that the fundraising party
for the war effort will be held

243
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,705
in two days.

244
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:42,251
All deliveries of food and drinks
to the party will be stopped.

245
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,965
Plus, all the officials and their wives
who have put in orders for their garments

246
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,342
will not be able to receive them in time.

247
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,013
When that happens,
the authorities will begin to investigate.

248
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,392
That would put you in a tight spot,
would it not?

249
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,727
Is that a threat?

250
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,232
When there comes a time
for the weak to be strong,

251
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,734
we do something called "unite."

252
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:11,656
We are simply doing what we can do
in light of the situation.

253
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,367
Know your limits.

254
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,538
Don't risk your life
for matters that don't concern you.

255
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:28,297
I learned an important lesson
from my visit to Ongseong Hospital.

256
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,634
When you need to risk your life,

257
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,511
you go all in.

258
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,098
If you hesitate to do so,

259
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,767
you'll end up dead.

260
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:46,232
I know the prime suspects
in this incident.

261
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,528
Jang Tae-sang
of the House of Golden Treasure,

262
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:53,156
Yoon Chae-ok the sleuth, and…

263
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,618
a Joseon courtesan named Akiko.

264
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,836
Miss Akiko?

265
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:08,921
Are you okay?

266
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:20,892
Do you have reasons to believe
that they are suspects?

267
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,728
The suspects I've just mentioned

268
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:27,565
all entered Ongseong Hospital
and then escaped.

269
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,611
What exactly happened at the hospital?

270
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:34,280
I'm not inclined
to divulge that information.

271
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,532
It's a military secret.

272
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,083
Akiko.

273
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,254
Aki…

274
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,452
What in the hell…

275
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,711
What went on in there?

276
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,093
What exactly is happening
inside Ongseong Hospital?!

277
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:42,890
As you know,

278
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,935
the price for my information
is quite steep.

279
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,105
And confidentiality
about Ongseong Hospital

280
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:52,233
is considered to be
of the highest level, you know.

281
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:57,196
I can only hand over such information
when enough trust has been built.

282
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,990
Are you trying to strike a deal?

283
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,533
Mr. Ishikawa!

284
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:03,494
I'm trying to talk about mutual trust.

285
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,956
I have already kept my promise

286
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,167
and returned Akiko to you.

287
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,296
Now it's your turn.

288
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,049
Release my people.

289
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:32,815
Get out!

290
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,067
You're all released!

291
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,986
Released! We're free!

292
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,482
Master Jang…

293
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,403
You're alive?

294
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,117
Can you stand up?

295
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,288
What took you so long?

296
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,176
Let's get out of here first.

297
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,597
Come on.

298
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:56,190
Bonjeong!

299
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,609
Do you all want to die?

300
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,736
Be quiet!

301
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:19,922
Bonjeong.

302
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,228
- Mori.
- Yes!

303
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,314
Commissioner, sir.

304
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,607
Keep Jang under close observation
from now on.

305
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,444
Pardon? Again, sir?

306
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,489
Understood, sir.

307
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,707
MILITARY WARD, UNDERGROUND LAB
HUMAN EXPERIMENTS, LADY MAEDA

308
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:02,256
LADY MAEDA

309
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,858
Don't worry too much. He'll be all right.

310
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:26,322
I owe Mr. Gu too great a debt.

311
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,406
Hardly.

312
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,327
I can't even count
all the times you saved his life.

313
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,038
He just repaid you for one of them.

314
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,214
The aftermath of torture…

315
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,592
lasts a while, huh?

316
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,472
You should go now.

317
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,685
No, I'll stay here.

318
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,146
There is someone else waiting for you.

319
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,443
She came by every single day

320
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,155
to check whether you had returned safely.

321
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,117
Leave Mr. Gu to me.

322
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,536
Go pay her a visit.

323
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,201
Aren't you having dinner?

324
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,369
I'm not hungry.

325
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,788
You go and eat.

326
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,124
Should I grab some dumplings for you?

327
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,171
I'll be right back.

328
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,855
Who are you?

329
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,415
You're still as aggressive as ever.

330
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,133
Now that you've seen my face,

331
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,219
will you let me go?

332
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,352
Master Jang…

333
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,761
I felt the same way.

334
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,182
I also…

335
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,478
missed you a lot.

336
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,136
Did you have something to say?

337
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,471
Tell me.

338
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,643
How much do you know
about the underground laboratory

339
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,145
in Ongseong Hospital?

340
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:17,321
Are you even remotely aware
of what exactly is going on there?

341
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,615
There is nothing I don't know about.

342
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,579
What have you done to Akiko?

343
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,920
I asked you what you did to her!

344
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,923
You seem to be mistaken.

345
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:40,511
You have no right to ask me such things.

346
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,056
And I have no obligation to answer you.

347
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:45,724
What's that now?

348
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:51,271
From the beginning, our relationship
was formed for mutual benefit.

349
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,402
I needed a husband
so I could come to Joseon.

350
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:04,159
And you needed my good name and lineage
to move up and succeed.

351
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:09,456
You suddenly assuming
the role of my husband like this

352
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,711
puts me in an awkward position,
Mr. Ishikawa.

353
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,382
You shouldn't have touched Akiko.

354
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:24,471
And you had no need
to send Mr. Jang in there.

355
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,641
We agreed not to interfere
in each other's personal lives.

356
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,394
You're the one who broke the agreement
in the first place!

357
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,355
I respect what you do for a pastime.

358
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,692
But having a child

359
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,070
is a completely different story.

360
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:03,886
A Joseon woman named Yoon Chae-ok.

361
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:07,765
Apparently, she's young and pretty.

362
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,435
How unfortunate for you.

363
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,647
All that effort nursing him back to health

364
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,374
Here are your dumplings.

365
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,054
Let's get going.

366
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,727
What a fool!

367
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:01,980
Stop.

368
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,242
Go… go away!

369
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,286
Get away from me!

370
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,754
Myeong-ja?

371
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:25,856
So, these are the Najin?

372
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,107
Correct.

373
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:31,611
They were found inside the glaciers
of Muryong Snow Mountain,

374
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,530
where the Na people live.

375
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:37,701
And you're saying
that this enters the human brain

376
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:40,871
to create creatures like Seishin?

377
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:42,706
No.

378
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:48,462
With Najin alone,
it only turns them into predators.

379
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,799
<i>While retaining the appearance of a human,</i>

380
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:56,094
<i>they will hold only the survival</i>
<i>and hunting instincts</i>,

381
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,723
<i>and prey primarily on human brains.</i>

382
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:38,637
<i>Highly aggressive and more violent</i>
<i>than most predatory animals,</i>

383
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,973
<i>they can move quickly</i>
<i>and heal wounds almost immediately.</i>

384
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:52,651
Then why does Seishin
appear the way she does?

385
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:56,947
Because she was injected with a serum
that contained anthrax.

386
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:27,853
Once injected with this serum
during their predatory stage,

387
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:30,230
they will move on to Seishin's phase.

388
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,733
Do they have any weaknesses?

389
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,744
They hate sunlight and fire,

390
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,706
and they are weak against nitrogen.

391
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,980
Get a hold of yourself.

392
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:13,773
Why are you doing this?

393
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,026
Myeong-ja!

394
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,826
<i>How horrid.</i>

395
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:30,248
<i>To remember what it was like</i>
<i>to be human, even in that state…</i>

396
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:32,959
Ongseong Hospital.

397
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,546
They must've experimented on her.

398
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:03,448
A flare was fired from Jongno, sir!

399
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,593
Over there! Get her!

400
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,353
Stop!

401
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,969
Don't lose her. Get her!

402
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:06,970
Yes, sir!

403
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:35,248
It was not able to remember at first,
not until it met its daughter.

404
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:38,960
Daughter?

405
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,590
Seishin has… a daughter?

406
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:49,220
She snuck in here, looking for her mother
who had gone missing ten years ago.

407
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,891
When it recognized its daughter, it…

408
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,519
flipped a switch, I think.

409
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:59,439
And her daughter's name is…

410
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,107
Yoon Chae-ok.

411
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,486
She works as a sleuth.

412
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:08,323
<i>Did you know</i>

413
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,492
that Jang Tae-sang found himself a woman?

414
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:14,579
A Joseon woman named Yoon Chae-ok.

415
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,960
- Find her!
- Yes, sir!

416
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,212
- This way too!
- Yes, sir!

417
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,838
- Hurry up!
- This way!

418
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:25,256
- Move!
- Find her!

419
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,040
That way! Get her!

420
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:13,304
Are you all right?

421
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:15,390
If she's caught, she might get killed.

422
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,185
No, she will go through much worse.

423
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:21,521
Like my mother did.

424
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:25,483
Go after her!

425
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,073
Run!

426
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,617
Catch her!

427
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:53,219
Go.

428
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,479
Don't kill me…

429
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,772
Please don't kill me!

430
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,034
Hold it!

431
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,411
That way!

432
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,257
Find her!

433
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,425
Don't lose her!

434
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,843
Stop right there!

435
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,648
Please don't kill me!

436
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,651
Please don't kill me…

437
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,778
Don't kill me!
