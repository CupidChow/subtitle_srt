00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,233
Mother…

3
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,323
Mother?

4
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:53,882
Master Jang!

5
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:06,769
What's wrong?

6
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,272
Are you badly hurt?

7
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,525
Help me.

8
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,853
Master Jang…

9
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,257
<i>Ms. Yoon Chae-ok.</i>

10
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,537
Master Jang.

EPISODE 7
CHASE

13
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,899
16 HOURS EARLIER

14
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,777
The time allocated to us is ten minutes.

15
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,949
<i>We start moving at six o'clock sharp.</i>

16
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,621
Block all entryways to the military ward.

17
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,706
Yes, sir!

18
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,717
Everyone must get in the truck
within those ten minutes.

19
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,970
What if we fail
to get everyone on board in time?

20
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,638
What happens then?

21
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,392
The truck will leave on time regardless.

22
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,691
Are you all ready?

23
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,628
Then,

24
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,214
let's begin.

25
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,570
Careful.

26
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,458
Let's have the women go first.

27
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,590
Climb up.

28
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:07,802
Hold on to it.

29
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,430
Hold on tight.

30
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:13,891
You can do this.

31
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,160
Slowly.

32
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,339
They have stolen our uniforms
in an attempt to escape.

33
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,926
Search and find anyone
who looks suspicious or unfamiliar.

34
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,344
Yes, sir!

35
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,017
What about this area?

36
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,936
Has it already been searched?

37
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,607
No, three soldiers went in to search
a short while ago.

38
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,988
Then why don't I see any lights?

39
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,915
You need to hurry!

40
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,627
If you don't move fast,
we might all die here.

41
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,753
Go on!

42
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,590
Slowly.

43
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,674
Grab it.

44
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,429
Slowly.

45
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,571
Why aren't you getting in line?

46
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,449
I'm standing guard.

47
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,076
Women go first, remember?

48
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,994
I thought I made myself clear.

49
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,789
I take care of my own business.

50
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:04,001
Yes, you made yourself very clear,
but you need to listen to me right now.

51
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,002
Get in line.

52
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,133
Do you have feelings for me?

53
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,897
Why would you ask such a random thing?

54
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,067
In the middle of this?

55
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,151
If you don't,

56
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,113
I refuse any unnecessary concerns
you have for me.

57
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,499
Careful!

58
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,711
Be careful!

59
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,921
Shit!

60
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,518
You have to move your truck quickly!

61
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,103
- Right now!
- Okay!

62
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,289
We have to move. Now!

63
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,090
Hurry!

64
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,635
- Let's move!
- Go on, hurry!

65
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,095
Just a bit more.

66
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,684
There you go. Slowly.

67
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,281
They're on the second floor.
Move your asses!

68
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,124
Faster now!

69
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,209
Yes, sir!

70
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,434
What do we do now?

71
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,937
They're onto us because of me!

72
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,522
Don't blame yourself.

73
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,357
It's not your fault.

74
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,735
They're going to swarm this place
any minute now.

75
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,487
We're all going to die.

76
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,947
No one's going to die.

77
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,660
We'll all be getting out of here,
so pull it together and hang in there.

78
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,629
You should head down.

79
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,464
I'll hold them off on my own.

80
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,467
Are you trying to be the hero?

81
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,052
I'm just trying to buy some time.

82
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,098
No. Let's deal with them quickly
and go down together.

83
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,976
Aren't we on the same side?

84
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,228
Why do you argue with everything I say?

85
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,564
We can be on the same side
and still disagree.

86
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,818
If we can't share
different opinions freely,

87
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,320
we'll no longer be on the same side.

88
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,698
Wouldn't you agree?

89
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,138
I'll help too.

90
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,435
Let's save our bullets
and fire only when we have a clear shot.

91
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,217
Do not spare a single one of them!

92
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,343
Yes, sir!

93
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,594
Attack!

94
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,885
What exactly is going on
in this hospital right now?

95
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,724
Are you sure it has nothing to do
with the serial disappearance?

96
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,395
Do you really wish to know
the truth about this hospital?

97
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,817
If so, you'll have to get permission
from the Governor-General first,

98
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:24,947
or you can return home
and ask Lady Maeda yourself.

99
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,993
What do you mean by that?

100
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:34,415
I mean that no outsiders
should be allowed to find out

101
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,709
what goes on in here.

102
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,838
And not a single Josenjing
that has set foot in this place

103
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:44,091
gets to walk out of here alive.

104
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,345
That is all I can tell you.

105
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,601
Even if that person
is someone I've been searching for?

106
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,273
There will be no exceptions.

107
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,244
Hold your fire!

108
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,085
Move forward.

109
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,151
Persistent bastards!

110
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:49,949
Are you hurt?

111
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,578
It's just a graze.

112
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,288
Are you all right?

113
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,540
I'm fine.

114
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,378
What about you?

115
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,263
Can you get up?

116
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,515
Try to stand up.

117
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,063
You said you wanted to meet your mother.

118
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,023
So let's get out of here.

119
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,734
Stay with me, please!

120
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,047
Please remember me.

121
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,472
My name is…

122
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,435
Choi Yeong-gwan.

123
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,355
And my address…

124
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,775
It's 9 Sangwangsimni-jeong…

125
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,580
Tell my mother…

126
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,792
that I miss her.

127
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,796
Please.

128
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,510
Let's escape together.

129
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,972
We can do it.

130
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,350
We promised to leave together, remember?

131
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,937
So, please… Please!

132
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,647
Please!

133
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,419
Don't blame yourself.

134
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,547
It's not your fault.

135
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,842
He didn't deserve this.

136
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,557
Neither did my mother.

137
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,025
Nor did all those people
who were kept in that underground prison.

138
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,655
But why…

139
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,242
Just why…

140
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,837
Come on. We should go.

141
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,132
Let's say we make it out alive.

142
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,138
Is there such a thing as hope
waiting for us?

143
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,639
Well…

144
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,268
I don't know about hope,

145
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:09,273
but I don't plan on going down
without a fight.

146
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,528
You see,

147
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,990
I'm going to survive as long as I can.

148
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:20,951
I'm going to live

149
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,540
to give them
an endless, irritating headache,

150
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,960
to make their lives uncomfortable…

151
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,797
and to be a living reminder

152
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,092
of the things they did to us.

153
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,429
I will never

154
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,183
make it easy for them to kill me.

155
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,234
Everyone made it down.
You should get moving as well.

156
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,240
Let's retreat and get out of here.

157
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,214
There is no more time to delay!

158
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,426
March in at once
and kill every Josenjing inside!

159
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,136
- Yes, sir!
- Wait.

160
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,440
Here. Step up.

161
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,087
I'll see you at the bottom.

162
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,623
Would you like to go first?

163
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,462
What's the matter?

164
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,343
I'm afraid one of us has to stay behind.

165
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,972
<i>What do you mean?</i>

166
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:51,310
The director wants all the Josenjings
to be captured alive.

167
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,978
Captured alive?

168
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,440
We've already lost six of our men!

169
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,608
An order is an order,
First Sergeant Haneda!

170
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,281
Kill them all. We spare none!

171
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,741
Capture them alive!

172
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:57,876
What was that?

173
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,921
What just happened?
What about Master Jang?

174
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,672
He's not coming down.

175
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,010
<i>One of us has to stay behind?</i>

176
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,638
Until the truck leaves
Ongseong Hospital safely,

177
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,391
someone has to stay behind
and divert their attention.

178
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,059
Are you…

179
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,853
Once you get down,
leave this place at once.

180
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:23,068
I don't know how long I can hold them off,
but I'll try my best to buy you time.

181
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,325
We aren't leaving him behind.

182
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:31,827
It's his decision!

183
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,828
Move.

184
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,081
You're wasting time. Get in the truck!

185
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,249
I said move!

186
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,417
Look at those people!

187
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,795
Are you trying to get them killed?

188
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,184
Chae-ok.

189
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,830
<i>Mr. Gu.</i>

190
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:22,127
No matter what happens,
you must leave on time.

191
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,256
Even if some haven't gotten on the truck,

192
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,383
and even if that's Master Jang,

193
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,011
you must not delay.

194
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:32,971
Do you understand?

195
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,475
God damn it!

196
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:42,958
I'll take full responsibility.
Get in there now and kill them all!

197
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,834
Listen, Sergeant Haneda--

198
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,421
I'll report to Director Ichiro myself.

199
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,512
What are you waiting for? Move now!

200
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,513
Yes, sir!

201
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,717
Damn it!

202
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,495
Yes, sir.

203
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,214
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

204
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,469
Search every corner!

205
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,263
Find whatever you can!

206
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,398
He went that way!

207
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,111
He seems to be heading to Area N
on the west side, sir.

208
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,039
I'm certain of its authenticity.

209
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:59,667
This porcelain was crafted
in the late 18th century

210
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,921
during the reign
of King Jeongjo of Joseon.

211
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,014
Yes.

212
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,602
Are you sure?

213
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,441
All right, then. I will.

214
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,741
They're taking quite a while, sir.

215
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,043
Sir!

216
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,516
Young Master!

217
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,226
Sir!

218
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:01,896
I'm sorry!

219
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,399
- Don't kill me!
- Sir…

220
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,859
Please have mercy. Please don't kill me!

221
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:07,944
It's all right now.

222
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,404
Please forgive me.

223
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,530
You're safe now.

224
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,740
I beg you. Please spare me.

225
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,994
Have mercy on me. Please don't kill me.

226
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,329
Please have mercy…

227
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,831
Don't kill me!

228
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,545
Let's go.

229
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,625
Mr. Ishikawa?

230
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,131
Mr. Ishikawa!

231
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,826
Thank you, Mr. Ishikawa.

232
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,120
I knew you would come to save me.

233
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,164
Are you hurt?

234
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,795
Our child is fine too.

235
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,505
First,

236
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,590
you should bathe.

237
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,183
Please forgive me, sir!

238
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:07,814
But when I got here,
the woman was already gone!

239
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,608
She was already gone?

240
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,528
Then why are you locked in there?

241
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,530
I'm terribly sorry, sir!

242
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,118
Sir, Mr. Soma is behind this.

243
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,744
What?

244
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,252
That's right, sir!

245
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,379
I'm certain it was Mr. Soma.

246
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,714
Mr. Soma?

247
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,050
Mr. Soma!

248
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,970
Help me, Mr. Soma!

249
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:47,687
Mr. Soma!

250
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,900
Soma, that prick.

251
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,404
Wait.

252
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,780
What is it?

253
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,658
Did you drink…

254
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,579
the water in this cup?

255
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,582
No. I didn't drink it, sir.

256
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,333
I was tied up all this time.

257
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,418
Then

258
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:12,879
who drank it?

259
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,046
Well,

260
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,841
I'm not certain of that.

261
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,968
Lieutenant Colonel Kato.

262
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,013
I don't think you understand
the gravity of the situation.

263
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:29,604
It doesn't matter
who drank the water in this cup.

264
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,356
All the test subjects
in our underground prison are gone.

265
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:37,028
They're all gone, including the girl
who Lady Maeda entrusted to us!

266
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:38,613
Do you understand?

267
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,664
Go and look
for that son of a bitch Soma right now!

268
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,584
Return to the barracks and stand by.

269
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,668
Yes, sir!

270
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,423
- You.
- Yes, sir!

271
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,218
Who else did you say
had entered this room?

272
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,136
Well…

273
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,473
Take off your clothes.

274
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,942
It was those four people, sir.

275
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,238
I see.

276
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,657
All right. You may go.

277
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,045
Could this mean

278
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,507
that one of those four…

279
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,636
drank from this cup?

280
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,848
At long last,

281
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,767
I got you!

282
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,524
I don't think
they're going to let us go easily.

283
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,923
Out of the way!

284
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,984
- Don't lose them!
- Yes, sir!

285
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,836
Attention, everyone!
Take as much as you want!

286
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:07,631
Master Jang of Golden Treasure
is treating everyone in Bonjeong!

287
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,135
Come, people.

288
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,429
- Is it free?
- Just for tonight.

289
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,930
Have as much as you want.

290
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:16,724
Everyone, this way!

291
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:17,725
Over here!

292
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,519
Beer is on the house today!
Have as much as you want!

293
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,688
Drink up. Come this way!

294
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,287
Damn it!

295
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,082
Back up quickly.

296
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,584
We'll take the side road.

297
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:44,502
Hurry!

298
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,556
Move! Get out of the way!

299
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,934
Goodness! My apologies, Officer!

300
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,146
Step on it! Come on!

301
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,568
We have to catch them
before they leave Bonjeong.

302
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,736
- Go!
- Yes, sir!

303
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,486
Get out.

304
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,571
What?

305
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,740
I… I don't understand…

306
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:57,950
Get out!

307
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,953
Oh my, I didn't know
you spoke the Joseon tongue.

308
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,997
Sure, of course.

309
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,215
Who's in the truck?

310
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,467
What on Earth are you talking about?

311
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:17,720
No one's in it.

312
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,515
After I dropped off Myeong-ja,
no one else got in.

313
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,600
I'm telling the truth!

314
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,268
Is that right?

315
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,612
Officer! What is the meaning of this?

316
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,704
How did this happen?!

317
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,081
Where did they all go?

318
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,669
Where are all the Josenjings
you smuggled out of Ongseong Hospital?

319
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,218
I already told you.

320
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,847
No one but Myeong-ja got in the truck.

321
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,809
Akiko was the only one
Mr. Ishikawa wanted.

322
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,063
We returned Myeong-ja to him as promised.

323
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,690
That is all. Happy now?

324
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,583
Get changed!

325
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,712
Drink all you want!

326
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,677
Goodness! My apologies, Officer!

327
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:07,830
Easy now.

328
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,511
We have to catch them
before they leave Bonjeong.

329
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:23,637
- Go!
- Yes, sir!

330
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,827
You have all come a long way.

331
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,164
I'm afraid we don't have time
for introductions.

332
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,665
Hurry along for now.

333
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,126
Let's hurry. Go.

334
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,591
Let's go. Come on.

335
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,428
Are you

336
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,723
from the House of Golden Treasure?

337
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,144
Unfortunately,

338
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,230
Master Jang did not make it out with us.

339
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,360
I wish you a safe trip.

340
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,321
Let me ask one thing.

341
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,033
Was all of this

342
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,953
part of his plan from the start?

343
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,457
You must not know it yet,

344
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,169
but you must go through Master Jang
if you want anything in Bonjeong.

345
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:40,172
Be it money, property, people,
or someone's life,

346
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,091
Master Jang has a hand in everything.

347
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,805
That is what he really does
as the owner of Golden Treasure.

348
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,191
Arrest this man!

349
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,782
Search the streets of Bonjeong.

350
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,910
Arrest anyone
who seems even remotely suspicious!

351
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,328
Get to work!

352
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,412
Yes, sir!

353
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,347
Clean everything up!

354
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,630
<i>Until the cherry blossoms fall.</i>

355
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,809
Could he still be alive?

356
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,774
Master Ishikawa has just sent a message.

357
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:31,778
He will not be returning home tonight.

358
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,214
My apologies, Lady Maeda.

359
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,841
I am deeply ashamed.

360
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:40,430
I have already given you
enough chances, Director.

361
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,726
You asked for a hospital,
so I built one for you.

362
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:49,231
You wanted to experiment,
so I spared no expense in my support.

363
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,652
Ma'am, I will rectify this situation
no matter what it takes.

364
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:54,986
And by what means?

365
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:59,199
How do you plan on recapturing
the test subjects that escaped?

366
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,828
What about Akiko,
who has dropped out of sight?

367
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,832
How do you intend to find them all?

368
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,210
I'll come up with a plan right away.

369
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:13,797
If you could give me some time,
I'll take responsibility--

370
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,006
Please step down.

371
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:25,058
That is the one and only way you can
take responsibility for this incident.

372
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:36,111
We have had success
in a significant experiment recently.

373
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:49,040
We have created an organism
that is on another level.

374
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:54,045
It will not only change the medical world,
but perhaps also human history itself.

375
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:57,757
I assure you,
you won't be disappointed this time.

376
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,594
Please give me another chance,

377
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:02,470
Lady Maeda.

378
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,811
Yes, that's right.

379
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:56,149
It's the Josenjing woman
you asked me to take special care of

380
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,443
all those years ago.

381
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:31,309
The specimen has been sedated
and locked in a cage for now.

382
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,478
Should we keep releasing the nitrogen?

383
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:37,440
Colonel Kato?

384
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,277
Who could it be?

385
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,196
The one that drank from the cup.

386
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,136
Hurry! Get in!

387
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,444
<i>I wonder,</i>

388
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:09,199
<i>who's the one that swallowed the Najin?</i>
