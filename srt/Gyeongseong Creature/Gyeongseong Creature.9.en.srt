00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,955
<i>We have conducted</i>
<i>extensive research and experimentation</i>

3
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,250
<i>on the limitations of the human body.</i>

4
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,981
<i>We discovered the existence of the Najin</i>
<i>during one of those experiments.</i>

5
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,953
So, it was all a coincidence?

6
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:29,292
It's like the Penicillium
that appeared in a petri dish.

7
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:34,339
Much like how that chance discovery
of mold changed the course

8
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,466
of the history of human diseases…

9
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:43,848
the discovery of the Najin will lead
humanity to the next level of evolution.

10
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,808
Are you referring to the healing ability?

11
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:47,852
Perhaps.

12
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,065
But we believe
it holds potential for more.

13
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,734
I see.

14
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,154
Thank you for the explanation.

15
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:07,288
Director Ichiro
will be returning to Japan soon.

16
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,127
You can take his place
in charge of Ongseong Hospital

17
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,714
and complete your ongoing experiments.

18
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,678
I will support you
by whatever means necessary.

19
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:30,270
I cannot guarantee how long it will take
or how much money will be needed.

20
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,231
Nothing is certain as of now.

21
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,899
That doesn't matter.

22
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:39,362
Seishin is what I want, after all.

23
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,449
Your job is to make her
obey me completely.

24
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,411
That's all you need to do.

25
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,425
Mr. Ishikawa.

26
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,600
So, it was you all along?

27
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,441
Have you been
wandering around in that state

28
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,652
killing people for the past three days?

29
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,072
Mr. Ishikawa.

30
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,995
What in the world happened to you, Akiko?

31
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,999
Help me, Mr. Ishikawa.

32
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,512
Go back to Ongseong Hospital.

33
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,266
You have murdered more than ten people.

34
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,145
You will be executed anyway, Akiko.

35
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,695
What about the baby?

36
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,323
Our baby--

37
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,449
Look at yourself!

38
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,663
How can you still expect me
to acknowledge that baby as my own?

39
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,252
Don't make things
any more difficult for me, Akiko.

40
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,555
Get in there yourself.

41
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,102
This is the last act of kindness
I can offer you.

42
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,566
Stop stalling and get in.

43
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,320
Now!

44
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,205
What are you doing?

45
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,600
Commissioner!

46
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,018
Commissioner Ishikawa!

47
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,604
Get him to the car!

48
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,399
Commissioner! Stay with me!

00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,156
Father.

52
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,294
I'm coming in.

53
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,494
<i>Chae-ok.</i>

54
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,457
<i>I'm heading over to where your mother is.</i>

55
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,502
Hey! Who goes there?

56
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,004
Stop!

57
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,882
Stop or we'll shoot!

58
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,347
I am here to find my wife.

59
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,934
Go and tell the person named Kato

60
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,565
that the Seishin you are experimenting on
in the underground laboratory

61
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,443
is my wife.

62
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,116
<i>I am going to fulfill</i>
<i>my last duty as her husband.</i>

63
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,869
<i>So, Chae-ok,</i>

64
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,289
<i>go on with your life.</i>

65
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,667
<i>Please</i>

66
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,003
<i>cherish your life dearly.</i>

67
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,780
Colonel Kato, we brought the man.

68
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,674
You're Seishin's husband?

69
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,759
I am.

70
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,514
Let me meet my wife.

71
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,513
It's been ten years, correct?

72
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,434
How does it feel

73
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,895
to see your wife again

74
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,732
for the first time in ten years?

75
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,359
You evil bastards.

76
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,613
How…

77
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,449
How could you…

78
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,453
You sons of bitches!

79
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,497
Fucking bastards!

80
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,081
Let go of me! Let go!

81
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,209
Sons of bitches!

82
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:17,463
You bastards,
how could you do something like this?

83
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,048
How could you?!

84
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,551
We managed to calm it with food,

85
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,096
but what should we do now?
It's becoming violent again, sir.

86
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:09,932
I guess

87
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:16,313
there really is no other way
than to find its child.

88
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,416
<i>What do we do?</i>

89
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,002
We can't turn a blind eye.

90
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:42,965
Yet even if we were to help her,
there's not much we can do.

91
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,475
We'll have to think of a way.

92
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,520
You can't go back to Ongseong Hospital.

93
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,315
Don't even think about it, okay?

94
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,739
Look here!

95
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,075
Why in the world
would you do such evil things?

96
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,121
A hospital is where you treat people,
not do such damned things!

97
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,332
Well,

98
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,921
I'm not really aware
of what goes on in there.

99
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,090
Now you know!
So try coming up with a plan!

100
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,676
As a so-called officer
of the police bureau,

101
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,971
you just discovered an illegal act!
Are you just going to sit there?

102
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:36,268
I just follow orders,
so even if I were to do something,

103
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,688
I wouldn't have any powers.

104
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,607
So you're powerless!

105
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,235
Does that give you an excuse
to go along with every wrong thing?

106
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,403
Excuse me--

107
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,781
You people might run things around here,

108
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,992
but there are things you should
and shouldn't do as human beings!

109
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,329
If you don't know where to draw the line,
can you call yourself human?

110
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:58,666
How are you any different from an animal?

111
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,127
You're right.

112
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,467
Let's keep the shop closed
until this situation is resolved.

113
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,722
It would also be safer
if we moved Mr. Gu somewhere else.

114
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,641
What is your plan?

115
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:20,521
When a problem arises,
you must nip it in the bud.

116
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,815
Master!

117
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:26,735
I saw exactly what's going on
in Ongseong Hospital.

118
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:33,367
What's happening in there is something
that shouldn't happen to any human being.

119
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,288
But I bet they will deny it
in front of the world

120
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:44,128
and say that they did no such thing,
that such things never even existed.

121
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,967
Myeong-ja killed so many people, but look,

122
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,012
not one paper covered the murders.

123
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,473
This is how they operate.

124
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,394
They cover things up
as if they never happened at all.

125
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,437
But sir--

126
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,064
As you said,
there are clear rights and wrongs.

127
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:09,194
If we turn a blind eye
because it doesn't seem to concern us now,

128
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:14,074
then the same thing
will eventually happen to all of us.

129
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,122
Tell us.

130
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,209
What can we do to help?

131
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:32,217
I'm afraid there isn't much
that we can do.

132
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,679
The wounds on his face
and carotid arteries are too wide and deep

133
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,015
for us to stop the bleeding.

134
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,685
- We will do our best.
- Stop the bleeding!

135
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,813
- But if the bleeding continues…
- More gauze! Now!

136
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,108
I'm terribly sorry to say this,

137
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,820
but he may not survive the night,
Lady Maeda.

138
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,450
Oh, well, that is unfortunate.

139
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,285
Pardon?

140
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,953
Anyways,

141
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,290
take good care of my husband, please.

142
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,333
Good night.

143
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,062
Found it.

144
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,247
Lady Maeda, a message from Mr. Shiro.

145
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,214
What were you doing?

146
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,508
You know,

147
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,677
just watching.

148
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,447
The world seems so peaceful
from up here, doesn't it?

149
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,699
There's no pain,

150
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,035
no death…

151
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,372
and no unjustness.

152
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,917
It's all so quiet.

153
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,300
It's hard to see through the darkness now,

154
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,136
but I'm sure that everyone

155
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,557
is holding their breath,
waiting for the night to pass.

156
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,939
What about Myeong-ja?

157
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,066
What happened to her?

158
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,444
It seems she was taken back
to Ongseong Hospital.

159
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,782
And Ishikawa seems to have been
seriously injured in the ordeal.

160
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,919
So Father and Myeong-ja
are both back in that hospital.

161
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,759
Could it be that…

162
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,307
we'll never be able to stop
what they are doing?

163
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,944
Will you come with me?

164
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,946
I have something to show you.

165
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,551
What is all this?

166
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,303
This is my collection.

167
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,515
Some things were pawned
and never reclaimed,

168
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,476
and others I bought from time to time.

169
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,478
That's the nature of a pawnshop.

170
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,982
Every item that comes in
has its own story.

171
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,236
Yes.

172
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,991
That gramophone belonged to Wang Su-bok,
the courtesan from Pyeongyang.

173
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,661
And…

174
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,081
that coat hanging over there,

175
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,918
Mr. Yun Dong-ju pawned it so he could buy
his fellow students some food,

176
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,714
but he didn't make it back to reclaim it.

177
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,010
And this is Na Hye-seok's work.

178
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,931
She is a genius who had her work
shown at the Joseon Art Exhibition.

179
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:34,519
I suppose living as an artist
is not all smooth sailing.

180
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:38,231
Mrs. Nawol chided me for paying too much
for a painting of little value,

181
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,692
but I like her drawings.

182
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,697
I have a few more of her pieces, actually.

183
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,665
Could you

184
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,794
give me your hand?

185
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:24,361
I bought this silver bracelet
from an American missionary.

186
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,365
Embedded in the middle
is a thing called an opal.

187
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:32,661
I heard it is considered
a lucky stone in Europe.

188
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:36,832
There.

189
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,711
You will only experience good luck
from now on.

190
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,767
I have many more interesting items.

191
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,438
We can look through them later,
whenever we have time.

192
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,439
Let's

193
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,442
make a promise to each other.

194
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:12,534
If either of us ends up dying
before the other…

195
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,165
whoever remains has to remember…

196
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,127
the other person.

197
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,380
What do you think?

198
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,475
I don't feel that sad about dying…

199
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:45,275
but if no one in this world remembers
even a trace of my existence…

200
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,781
that would make me feel…

201
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,660
a little lonesome.

202
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,254
I'm sorry, but it won't come to that.

203
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,134
Because the two of us

204
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,931
will be together,
even through the good times.

205
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,688
Do you really think…

206
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,278
those good times will come to us?

207
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,618
They will.

208
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,080
I will make sure…

209
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,376
that they come to us.

210
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,420
So--

211
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,274
Stay with me.

212
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,278
Stay…

213
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:14,906
right by my side.

214
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,656
Be safe.

215
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,700
Take care of yourself.

216
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,807
Keep watch over the shop.

217
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,892
Don't forget to lock the doors.

218
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,603
I will. Goodbye.

219
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:41,529
Tae-sang!

220
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,036
You're safe.

221
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,413
Thank goodness.

222
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,748
What a relief.

223
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,358
My sincere condolences.

224
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,408
I'm afraid I have no choice, Mr. Ishikawa.

225
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,578
I must do this to keep my position here.

226
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:15,498
Please direct your resentment
toward Lady Maeda.

227
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,459
This is all according to her will.

228
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,211
No…

229
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:22,964
No…

230
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,887
Help me…

231
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:53,912
I would like my husband's death
to be more honorable.

232
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,874
A commissioner of the Government-General

233
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,210
murdered by a Joseon-born courtesan.

234
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:05,256
Imagine how shameful that would be
for the police bureau as well.

235
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,008
Yes, ma'am.

236
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,682
COMMISSIONER ISHIKAWA DIES
WHILE ARRESTING JOSEON-BORN SERIAL KILLER

237
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,018
Ishikawa died early this morning.

238
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,855
A Joseon person
becomes the offender once again.

239
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,567
It's always the same pattern, isn't it?

240
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,030
They hide, fabricate, and distort
the facts to cover up their wrongdoings.

241
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:34,702
And if that doesn't work, they will turn
their swords to the Joseon people again.

242
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,080
Think about the Kantō earthquake.

243
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,749
What would they have done without us?

244
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,585
They blame us whenever something happens.

245
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,589
They will choose
one of two methods, as always.

246
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,384
Either take it out
on the innocent citizens…

247
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,428
Or take it out on us.

248
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,892
Why us? What crime have we committed?

249
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,186
The crime of knowing too much, I suppose.

250
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:05,400
About the underground lab in the hospital,
what occurred there, and even Myeong-ja.

251
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,947
So, what's your plan?

252
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,118
Tell me.

253
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,248
I know you called me here at this hour
because you have a plan in mind.

254
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,088
I now have someone I'd like to protect.

255
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:29,590
That's why…

256
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,597
I'm thinking of putting my neck
on the line as well.

257
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,813
<i>Do you know what I really fear?</i>

258
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,610
<i>Having a dream</i>

259
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,114
<i>in this hopeless world.</i>

260
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,745
Director Ichiro, have a safe trip back.

261
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:09,797
Comrade Kwon.

262
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:32,028
<i>I fear that my resolve will grow weak</i>
<i>because of that vain hope,</i>

263
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,074
<i>that I might hesitate and falter</i>
<i>to do what must be done.</i>

264
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,911
<i>That is what I fear.</i>

265
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,499
<i>And so I bid you goodbye.</i>

266
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,509
<i>Thank you.</i>

267
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,012
<i>Thank you, Master Jang.</i>

268
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,476
<i>I'll always remember you.</i>

269
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,478
Wait, hold on!

270
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,772
So long.

271
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,024
Stop!

272
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,488
<i>You know what?</i>

273
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,367
<i>What I fear the most</i>

274
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:24,372
<i>is losing those I do not wish to lose.</i>

275
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,334
<i>Director Ichiro has been shot!</i>

276
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,169
<i>Get her!</i>

277
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,482
What did you just say?

278
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,526
With the dynamite you have,

279
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,071
how many bombs can you make?

280
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,697
Why do you ask?

281
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,200
Do you wish to join the rebellion?

282
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,745
Unfortunately, the Bumingwan event
won't be happening.

283
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,456
What?

284
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:34,377
It appears Ishikawa's funeral ceremony
will be hosted by the Government-General.

285
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:37,380
The Bumingwan event
has been delayed indefinitely.

286
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,548
Is this confirmed?

287
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,301
We've heard nothing of this
from our sources yet.

288
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,012
This intel came from within,
so I'm sure of it.

289
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,808
I will vouch for its accuracy
and trustworthiness.

290
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,979
In any case,
why did you ask about the bombs?

291
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,647
The rebellion is all but lost now.

292
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,276
I was hoping to use those bombs first.

293
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,405
So you're not here to give us a hand,
but to take the bombs for yourself.

294
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:05,324
Forget it. I've heard quite enough.

295
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,243
Please leave.

296
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:11,122
How do you plan on using the bombs?

297
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,249
- Comrade Lee.
- Ongseong Hospital.

298
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,462
My plan…

299
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,717
is to wipe it off the map.

300
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,516
Colonel Kato!

301
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,643
Sir!

302
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,794
We have a problem, Master Jang.

303
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,298
It's about that sleuth, Yoon Chae-ok.

304
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,468
She's caused some trouble.

305
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,779
What happened? Where is the specimen?

306
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,030
We can't see it.

307
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:12,118
We've been watching for almost an hour,
but there has been no movement.

308
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:26,882
And the elevator?

309
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,092
It's been shut down.

310
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,011
It's the only way
to get to the upper floors,

311
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,973
which means the specimen
should still be down there.

312
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,647
What do you mean by that?

313
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,482
Chae-ok has disappeared? Where to?

314
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,110
We don't know either.

315
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,780
After that woman shot Director Ichiro,

316
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,700
the officers nearby
chased after her immediately,

317
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,827
but then she vanished.

318
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,872
Officers from Jongno Station
and the police bureau

319
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,583
are searching for her
from Bonjeong to Jongno,

320
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,043
but she's nowhere to be found.

321
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:08,299
They have just ordered
a search of your shop as well.

322
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:11,927
- Find her!
- Yes, sir!

323
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,596
Hurry! Search the place!

324
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:14,847
Yes, sir!

325
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,601
What are you doing?

326
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,327
<i>The situation is</i>

327
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,163
turning from bad to worse.

328
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,124
This could be the last time I can give you

329
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,920
information like this, Mr. Jang.

330
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,508
Thank you.

331
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,427
What you just told me was very helpful.

332
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:54,845
You should go.

333
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,808
It'd be best to keep your distance
from me for a while.

334
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,310
Do you understand?

335
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,070
Be careful, Mr. Jang!

336
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,738
There is an invisible hand

337
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,866
that controls everything.

338
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,587
How could you let this happen
as the police chief?

339
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:33,133
A shooting in broad daylight
in front of Lady Maeda's house

340
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,468
while she's in mourning?

341
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:38,639
My sincerest apologies!
We should have been more vigilant.

342
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:42,393
This is not only
an act of provocation toward us all,

343
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,186
but a clear act of terrorism.

344
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:48,899
You must find out who's behind it at once!

345
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:54,947
Take this opportunity to wipe out
all seditious Joseon-borns in Gyeongseong.

346
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,617
Anyone who is a nuisance
should be dealt with!

347
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,077
- That's right!
- Yes!

348
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,580
- We can't let this go on.
- Let's dispose of them!

349
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,334
Hello?

350
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:09,461
Shiro?

351
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,551
What is going on?

352
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:20,264
You promised you would leave
the House of Golden Treasure alone!

353
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,602
You said I just needed to tell you
where the sleuth woman was.

354
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:28,105
But officers just came
and turned this place upside down!

355
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:31,442
No, I can't do this anymore.

356
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:35,321
I quit. Just give me my money.

357
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:41,035
You promised to put me
on a ship bound for Tokyo.

358
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,454
This is not the time.

359
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,788
We'll talk later.

360
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,334
Hello?

361
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:04,516
Mr. Gu…

362
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,649
Is it still not moving?

363
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:13,984
No, sir.

364
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:16,779
Throw it some prey.

365
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,156
We're out of test subjects, sir.

366
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,534
We still have one left.

367
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,840
Hey. Come out.

368
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,266
Hey!

369
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:48,102
Hey!

370
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:50,938
Help me out.

371
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,596
Yukiko Maeda?

372
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:07,097
Dear me.

373
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,018
You already know who I am,

374
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,396
Ms. Yoon Chae-ok.

375
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,448
This is strange.

376
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:29,036
The Japanese officers
have suddenly quieted down.

377
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,547
Papers! Get your papers.

378
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,841
Papers!

379
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,886
Get your papers!

380
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,471
Papers!

381
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,057
And the Jongno Police Station?

382
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:54,520
They don't seem to have found
the whereabouts of Yoon Chae-ok either.

383
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:00,400
Then why have they gone so quiet?

384
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:05,113
Normally, they would have turned
Bonjeong and Jongno upside down by now.

385
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:08,408
Whatever it is, I find it quite different
from how it used to be.

386
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,453
They're also keeping quiet
about Ichiro's death.

387
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:15,457
Master.

388
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,125
Mrs. Nawol. How did it go?

389
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,877
It went well.

390
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:29,221
But I think you need to head downstairs.

391
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,973
You have a visitor.

392
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,004
Well then,

393
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,256
I'll leave you two alone.

394
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,527
What brings her here?

395
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,695
I'm not sure.

396
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,782
They're just sitting there
without much to say.

397
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:36,538
Wait, I don't see Beom-o.
Where could he have gone?

398
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,123
Forget about him.

399
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,293
He's not coming back.

400
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,096
That woman, Mrs. Nawol,

401
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:55,974
is she trustworthy?

402
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,604
She's been like family
since I was a child.

403
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,400
Just because they're like family
doesn't mean you can trust them.

404
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:10,697
You shouldn't trust people so easily.

405
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,368
They don't betray you
because they are evil.

406
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:17,329
They betray you because they are weak.

407
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:22,584
And most human beings are weak.

408
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,968
What is the reason for this visit?

409
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:34,096
So, don't bother waiting.

410
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:39,726
Ms. Yoon Chae-ok will not be coming back.

411
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,313
What do you mean?

412
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,648
I just told you.

413
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,694
Betrayal is caused not by evil,
but by weakness.

414
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,782
That woman wasn't strong enough

415
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,410
to stay by your side.

416
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,745
Do you know where she is?

417
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,999
Where is she?

418
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,460
Lady Maeda!

419
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,337
She is dead.

420
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,801
And guess what.

421
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:18,265
I liked you much better
before you went to Ongseong Hospital.

422
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:22,436
You clearly differentiated
what would bring you profit versus loss.

423
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,187
Simple-minded.

424
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:26,857
Hence, powerful.

425
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:31,528
Please

426
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,239
return to your former self.

427
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:38,660
Forget about Ishikawa, Akiko,
and Ongseong Hospital.

428
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,246
Even Yoon Chae-ok.

429
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,832
Forget all about that woman.

430
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,252
Just live your life like before,

431
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,881
as if nothing had ever happened.

432
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:56,136
Do that, and you
and the House of Golden Treasure

433
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,056
will be safe.

434
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,853
<i>Be careful, Mr. Jang!</i>

435
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:06,480
There is an invisible hand

436
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,775
that controls everything.

437
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,154
How did you find out?

438
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,617
I pulled every string

439
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:23,497
in Bonjeong and Jongno,
but couldn't even find a trace of her,

440
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,581
so how…

441
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:30,212
how is it that you know about her death?

442
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,674
If it wasn't for me,

443
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,095
you would have been arrested already.

444
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:43,058
The fact that you were close
with the woman who shot Director Ichiro

445
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,062
is enough to classify you as seditious.

446
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,314
So,

447
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,776
don't do anything dangerous anymore,

448
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,444
Mr. Jang.

449
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,363
Where is Yoon Chae-ok?

450
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,907
I told you. She is dead.

451
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,826
Then let me see her body.

452
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,035
Stop…

453
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,705
disappointing me.

454
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,709
I don't want us to become enemies.

455
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,002
Yoon Chae-ok!

456
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,673
Where is she?

457
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:22,097
You will never see her again.

458
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,841
I don't care what you've done.
I will find her.

459
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:02,971
Whether she's dead or not,
I will find her, no matter what!

460
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:11,813
Are you saying you plan to go against me?

461
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:15,400
How can someone like me
possibly be a match for you?

462
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:20,405
You're a Japanese citizen with power
from a mighty family--

463
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,073
If you know that, stay quiet.

464
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,160
You'll be safe that way.

465
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,328
Even so!

466
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,373
This is about Yoon Chae-ok.

467
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,878
I may run a petty pawnshop,

468
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,631
I may have lived a life without pride

469
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:41,343
doing all sorts of crap so I could get by,
but for once in my life,

470
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,597
I wanted to protect her,
even if I had to give up all that I have.

471
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,848
So?

472
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,102
Just how will you go against me?

473
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:52,979
With what?

474
00:53:54,898 --> 00:54:00,237
Not those pieces of trash
by your side, I hope.

475
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,323
Watch your mouth. They are my people!

476
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:08,078
Do you even know
how those people betrayed you?

477
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,623
That woman, Mrs. Nawol,
whom you consider family.

478
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:15,001
She ratted out your mother
a long time ago.

479
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:19,756
<i>My mother is in there too.</i>

480
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,591
Have you seen her?

481
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,262
Her name is Sim Sun-deok.

482
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,224
Do you know her?

483
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:30,850
No.

484
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,103
You haven't heard her name either?

485
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:35,438
I haven't.

486
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:48,201
SIM SUN-DEOK

487
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,462
That man, Gu Gap-pyeong,

488
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:03,675
recently betrayed you
in the police bureau's torture chamber.

489
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:06,177
I will…

490
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,267
tell you everything now.

491
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,561
Everything…

492
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:20,734
And that kid, Beom-o?

493
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:24,487
To find his mother who left him
and ran away to Japan when he was a kid,

494
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,698
he betrayed you.

495
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,868
He sold you out
for a cheap passage ticket,

496
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:33,580
even when you've treated him like family.

497
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,958
And your so-called friend?

498
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:42,380
<i>It took him only a few hours to confess</i>
<i>that you and your friends were key rebels.</i>

499
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:48,636
That's what humans do
when they are pathetically weak.

500
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:53,975
So desperate to save their own skin
that they forget the favors they received.

501
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,602
They have no morals.

502
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:57,937
And yet,

503
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,524
what did you say you'd do
with those pieces of trash?

504
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,402
You'd go against me?

505
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:09,741
When I'm the one working tirelessly
for you, even at this very moment?

506
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,036
You say you'll betray me?

507
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,998
Is that what you're saying, Mr. Jang?

508
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:29,803
Fine.

509
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,640
You may be right.

510
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:37,644
But

511
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:39,813
did you know?

512
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,149
None of those people

513
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,945
would have gone through those things

514
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:49,781
had the world been different.

515
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,203
If the world had been different,

516
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:58,748
they wouldn't have ended up in jail

517
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:02,335
and beaten to near death
so as to betray their friends.

518
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:07,382
They wouldn't have gotten burned
or had their nails plucked out.

519
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:12,137
And they wouldn't have had to give in,
give up the names of their friends,

520
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:15,723
and live the rest of their lives
wracked with guilt.

521
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:18,393
But despite all that,

522
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:22,105
they're fighting tooth and nail
and living with the pain

523
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:27,819
because they need to survive,
no matter how humiliating and shameful!

524
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,364
We have to survive,

525
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:35,493
or no one will remember
what we went through.

526
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:41,875
So don't you dare
call them pieces of trash.

527
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:45,545
Not a single one of them

528
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:51,301
deserves to be called such
by the likes of you.

529
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:05,773
So…

530
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:08,943
that's your choice.

531
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,322
Exactly.

532
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,201
This is my choice.

533
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,122
This is it for us.

534
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,667
Lady Maeda.

535
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:52,779
Let's go inside.

536
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:55,698
The night

537
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,451
is still cold.

538
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:32,777
Master!

539
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,154
Master!

540
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:36,990
Master.

541
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,076
What did I…

542
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,914
What did I just say out there?

543
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,377
You were being yourself.

544
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,090
You said everything there is to be said.

545
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,093
Just wait.

546
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,514
I will find the clues…

547
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,102
to Yoon Chae-ok's whereabouts…

548
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,150
before I die.

549
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,163
Tae-sang.

550
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,709
When did you find out?

551
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:32,962
That I…

552
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,133
gave up…

553
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:41,471
your mother's name?

554
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:44,724
It was…

555
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:52,065
a little after Mother passed away.

556
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:57,987
And you…

557
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:01,658
still

558
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,494
took me in?

559
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,335
Because I didn't think it was your fault.

560
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,017
Don't worry too much.

561
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,480
You know Mr. Gu.

562
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:35,316
Once he sets his mind on something,

563
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,362
he always comes back with a hint.

564
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,157
Let's wait.

565
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,621
What if it's true?

566
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:54,961
What if she really is dead?

567
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:23,197
Is the prey ready?

568
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,783
Lady Maeda sent us a Josenjing woman.
