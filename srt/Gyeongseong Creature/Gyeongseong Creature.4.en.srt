<i>Mother once told me…</i>

3
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:18,972
<i>"You can make so many different shapes</i>
<i>with just one string."</i>

4
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,560
<i>"So imagine how many shapes could be made</i>

5
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,938
<i>when two people meet."</i>

6
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,609
<i>"Those unpredictable bonds of fate</i>

7
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,529
<i>shape the mold of a new life</i>

8
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,031
<i>and steer its direction."</i>

9
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,661
<i>"For one seemingly coincidental encounter,</i>

10
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:48,126
<i>days, eras, and space</i>

11
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:53,131
<i>all start moving</i>
<i>in one specific direction," she said.</i>

12
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:09,314
<i>An attraction that seems vague</i>
<i>yet so very clear and palpable.</i>

13
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,198
<i>It defies calculation.</i>

14
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,911
<i>An incalculable force</i>
<i>that sweeps you off your feet.</i>

15
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:45,475
<i>It draws to an endless pull</i>
<i>until two finally meet as one.</i>

16
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,982
<i>She told me that is the power of fate.</i>

17
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,386
Forgive me.

18
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,639
I'm late.

IMPRINTING

21
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,618
Where were the fireworks set off from?

22
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,955
From the east of Namsan,
near Ongseong Hospital, sir.

23
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,294
- Ongseong Hospital?
- Yes, sir.

24
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,051
They have to be around here somewhere!

25
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,387
Find the culprits
who set off the fireworks!

26
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,305
Yes, sir!

27
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,355
Over here, sir!

28
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,065
There!

29
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,608
Move!

30
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,416
Where is Jang Tae-sang now?

31
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,043
I apologize, sir.

32
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,670
I thought I was right on his tail, but…

33
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,672
Where did you lose him?

34
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,009
On the way
to the third district of Bonjeong.

35
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,639
No, it's on me.

36
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,183
No, I'm paying!

37
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,893
Where are we--

38
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,979
- Hey.
- What the hell?

39
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:55,980
Hey, you!

40
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,774
Relax.

41
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,360
I want an apology for that!

42
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,779
Hey, let's just go for another round.

43
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:22,256
Are the length of the sleeves and pants
to your liking?

44
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,675
They fit perfectly.

45
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,387
It looks good on me, this bold style.

46
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,808
Are you hurt, sir?

47
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:37,939
The rickshaw?

48
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,982
It's waiting out the back.

49
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,576
Can you make room in your rickshaw
to fit a person inside?

50
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,286
When do you need it by?

51
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,706
Meet me behind Mr. Heo's tailor shop
at 9:00 p.m. tonight.

52
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,377
Will this do?

53
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,176
I'll make sure to return the rickshaw
as soon as I'm done.

54
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:10,930
Just a moment, sir.

55
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,939
Take care of yourself, Master Jang.

56
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,570
Could it be

57
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,158
that Jang Tae-sang
went inside Ongseong Hospital?

58
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,165
<i>That's right.</i>

59
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,416
<i>I, Jang Tae-sang,</i>

60
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,669
<i>decided to break into Ongseong Hospital</i>

61
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:45,798
<i>to protect my shop and my people</i>
<i>despite being injured.</i>

62
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,497
I heard you're getting someone out
of Ongseong Hospital.

63
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,626
I want to help.

64
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,295
You could get really badly hurt.

65
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,130
Please let me help.

66
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:27,882
I'm coming with you.

67
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,177
We're not going out for a walk.

68
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,972
I was told that one of my comrades
was arrested and taken to the hospital.

69
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,684
I won't get in your way
of finding Myeong-ja.

70
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,936
Just drop me off inside.

71
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,193
Myeong-ja is the only person
I can bring out of there.

72
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:51,447
You'll have to find
your own way out of the hospital.

73
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,074
I am aware.

74
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,201
If, by any chance, you run into trouble,

75
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,913
I may have no choice
but to turn a blind eye.

76
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,540
I won't hold any grudges.

77
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,751
Please think it over just one more time.

78
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,796
This plan is just too dangerous.

79
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,631
Look here.

80
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,385
I'm Jang Tae-sang.

81
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:16,055
Japanese bullets and swords
won't give a hoot about who you are.

82
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,475
I'll dodge them on my own,
so don't worry is what I'm saying.

83
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,985
Come back alive, Master Jang.

84
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,779
I'll have your favorite cognac ready.

85
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,627
Let's go.

86
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,633
<i>I risked my life as such, but…</i>

87
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,396
This isn't what we agreed on.

88
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,814
You said you found Myeong-ja.

89
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,692
You even sent me a note.
So, what is all this?

90
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,570
Once you'd found a way out of here
and sent a signal,

91
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,364
then I was going to bring her out.

92
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,453
All right, fine.

93
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,289
Let's say there was a misunderstanding.

94
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,709
But what's the deal
with bringing along those kids?

95
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,960
Do you know them?

96
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,546
- I don't.
- Then why?

97
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,341
Why bring along
a string of total strangers?

98
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,593
What were you thinking? Why?

99
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,220
To save them.

100
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,059
Otherwise, they will all die.

101
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,773
Let's talk after we get down from here.

102
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,818
Two are already dead.

103
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,489
The rest of them
won't be making any noise for a while.

104
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,951
All right, kids. Follow me.

105
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,495
Here.

106
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,789
Come on.

107
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:05,873
Let us go.

108
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,024
What's this about an accident?

109
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,820
There are no traces
of any outsiders breaking in.

110
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,948
The kids who escaped
must have done this, sir.

111
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,371
Don't just stand there!

112
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,541
Split up and find those kids now! Go on!

113
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,625
Yes, sir!

114
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,639
What's all this? Where's Myeong-ja?

115
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,477
That I don't know.

116
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,731
And who on Earth are those kids?

117
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,773
I have no idea.

118
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,484
They were in the laboratory.

119
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,653
Laboratory?

120
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,613
They have a laboratory?

121
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,532
Who might you be?

122
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,536
I'm Kwon Jun-taek, Tae-sang's friend.

123
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,831
He's told me about you two.

124
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,084
Who's the Japanese guy?

125
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,507
He works at this hospital.

126
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,801
He doesn't look like a soldier
or a doctor.

127
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:43,846
Can we trust him?

128
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,848
Saving Myeong-ja is our priority.

129
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,142
Let's focus on that for now.

130
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,438
I think we should discuss
what to do with those kids first.

131
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:56,108
But what is this laboratory
you just mentioned?

132
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,548
I was working at a munitions factory

133
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,510
before I got dragged here.

134
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,888
They've been giving me shots every day.

135
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,016
What kind of shots could they be?

136
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,768
I don't know.

137
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,980
I just watched the other kids
die off one by one.

138
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,610
Some died after suffering
from a high fever.

139
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,321
Others died in their sleep.

140
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,115
Every day I heard people
screaming in agony…

141
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,537
begging to be saved.

142
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,498
They kept…

143
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,417
They kept screaming to be saved.

144
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,673
I saw something similar in Manchuria.

145
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:07,346
They were conducting
inhumane experiments on people there.

146
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,476
It looks like they are doing
the same thing here.

147
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,115
So, what?

148
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,617
Are you trying to say

149
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,537
Myeong-ja's going through
something similar?

150
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,080
Perhaps.

151
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,583
Then all the more reason for us
not to dawdle.

152
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,795
If we delay any longer,
something might happen to Myeong-ja.

153
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,213
But first, these kids need--

154
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,631
This doesn't concern me.

155
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,634
You caused this mess, so you handle it.

156
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,388
Are you really going to ignore these kids?

157
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:02,067
I have my own fish to fry.
I'm up to my ears in my own problems.

158
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,570
If I don't bring Myeong-ja to Ishikawa,

159
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,448
I'll lose everything I own
and everyone I hold dear.

160
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,075
I have no time or reason
to care about strangers,

161
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,286
so don't you try to guilt-trip me.

162
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,371
I won't risk my life to save these kids.

163
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,541
All I'm gonna do is find Myeong-ja
and take her out. Got that?

164
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,242
We can't find them anywhere.

165
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,828
Maybe they have already left the ward.

166
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:58,874
No, it's too heavily guarded
for them to slip past so easily.

167
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,710
Search more thoroughly.

168
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,171
They're hiding here somewhere.

169
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,591
Kids are good at hide-and-seek after all.

170
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,316
It should be able to fit at least two.

171
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,820
There's no time.
The smallest ones first. You and you.

172
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:10,821
And…

173
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,559
Why did you do that? What frightened you?

174
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,359
Come here.

175
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,525
That man… who is he?

176
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,572
What exactly does he do at this hospital?

177
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,287
Who is he?

178
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,294
He's Sachimoto.

179
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,882
The painter you've been looking for.

180
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,759
That's him.

181
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:54,943
What is that?

182
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,908
A present from my daughter.

183
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,785
She was 12, I think.

184
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,954
She had just learned wood carving

185
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,416
and gave her mother and I one each.

186
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:16,048
By the way, how did you two
end up becoming sleuths?

187
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:22,262
We're searching for my wife
who went missing ten years ago.

188
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,144
This.

189
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,898
Did you draw this about a year ago?

190
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,776
Yes, I did.

191
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,403
Do you know the woman in this drawing?

192
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,823
When and where did you meet her? No…

193
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,537
Do you happen to know where she is now?

194
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,291
How do you know her?

195
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,423
She's my mother.

196
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,517
Anything will do.

197
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,396
Just tell me anything you know about her.

198
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,481
Do you know…

199
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,361
where my mother is?

200
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,647
Fast, quiet,

201
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,941
and dangerous, right?

202
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,486
And moreover, powerful.

203
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,325
How many more can you create?

204
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,662
I can't say.

205
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:15,709
That's the only successful specimen
so far.

206
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:22,924
All the other specimens died
or became deformed in the process.

207
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,845
You must increase the success rate.

208
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:32,934
I would love to show His Majesty
this great result as soon as possible.

209
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:48,408
We're done for today.
Take the rest of the prisoners back up.

210
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:53,246
I have other business to attend to.
Excuse me.

211
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,421
Take them back.

212
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,666
I'm sorry.

213
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,668
I don't know.

214
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,503
You said you drew this.

215
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,841
I drew it, yes.

216
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,677
But where she is…

217
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,810
that I don't know.

218
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,938
Do you really not know?

219
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,947
I have spent ten years searching for her.

220
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,869
More than three years in Manchuria.

221
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,874
When I saw this drawing,
I returned in a heartbeat,

222
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,711
hoping that whoever drew this
would know where she was.

223
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,045
Yet you say you don't?

224
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,595
Are you sure you don't know?

225
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,597
My deepest apologies.

226
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,901
Can you pull a rickshaw?

227
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,447
I've done it a couple of times.

228
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,283
Come here.

229
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:47,796
From now on,

230
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,881
you are the leader.

231
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:51,967
As a man,

232
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:56,429
it's your responsibility to take
these kids out of here. All right?

233
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:07,274
We are going to play hide-and-seek now.

234
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,569
Don't let the Japanese soldiers find you

235
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,572
until the rickshaw stops moving.

236
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,865
You can't make a sound.

237
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,576
Can you do that?

238
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:29,379
Win and don't get caught,
and I'll give you one more as a prize.

239
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,172
Can you do it?

240
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:33,216
Here.

241
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:35,802
What's your plan?

242
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,680
We're going to send these kids out.

243
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:42,851
Let's get that done first,

244
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:44,811
Ms. Yoon Chae-ok.

245
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,111
What?

246
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,363
Mr. Sachimoto's room?

247
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,533
Yes, sir.
I heard a little girl's scream there.

248
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,465
Mr. Sachimoto.

249
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,468
Mr. Sachimoto!

250
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:19,846
Open it!

251
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,338
Mr. Sachimoto.

252
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,444
What is it?

253
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,489
Where are you headed, Mr. Sachimoto?

254
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,200
Why do you ask?

255
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:26,246
Some kids have escaped
from the underground laboratory.

256
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:29,457
And?

257
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,543
One of my corporals says

258
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:35,588
he heard a little girl's scream
coming from your room.

259
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,802
I was just cleaning up junk from my room.

260
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,973
May we take a look inside the cart?

261
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,178
<i>Look straight ahead and run.</i>

262
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,346
Don't hesitate or falter.

263
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,350
And do not stop or look back
as you pass the main gates.

264
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,775
Hold on.

265
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,242
Be confident. Stand tall.

266
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:51,748
You're simply leaving
the way you're supposed to, you hear?

267
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,486
Open the gates!

268
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,081
Hey!

269
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:43,550
Inform Director Ichiro
that the guest from Bonjeong is here.

270
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,467
Yes, sir!

271
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,454
Is there anything else
you'd like to check?

272
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,625
Tell me,

273
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:24,048
am I to inform the military police
every time I clean my room now?

274
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,969
No. I apologize for the trouble,
Mr. Sachimoto.

275
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:07,091
PAWNSHOP

276
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,617
Go and get Mr. Gu here right now.

277
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,202
Yes, ma'am.

278
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,832
And the other kids? Where are they?

279
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,509
My goodness. Not one, but two?

280
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,260
Come on out.

281
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,638
- There you go.
- Well done.

282
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,183
- You did well.
- You did well.

283
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,560
Good job.

284
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,229
- You did good.
- Good girl.

285
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,615
Oh dear. Two more?

286
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,617
Here, come on out.

287
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,171
Did the man give this to you?

288
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,758
But did we really win?

289
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,010
Win what?

290
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,928
Hide-and-seek.

291
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,265
He said he would give us
another tin of cookies

292
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,184
if we didn't get caught
by the Japanese soldiers.

293
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,772
Yes. That's right, you won.

294
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,858
There's no doubt about it.

295
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,320
You must be hungry.

296
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,822
Let's get you some food.

297
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,534
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

298
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,618
Come this way.

299
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,291
The carotid artery was severed
in one blow.

300
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,461
There was a teenage boy
among the escaped kids.

301
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,379
No.

302
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,715
The killer knows how to use a knife.

303
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:16,345
See if there were any Josenjings
among the soldiers who entered the lab.

304
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,431
Yes, sir. Right away, sir!

305
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,773
The guest from Bonjeong has arrived, sir.

306
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,752
My apologies for keeping you waiting.

307
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,755
I had some matters to take care of.

308
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,388
May I ask why you're here
at this hour, ma'am?

309
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,724
Jang Tae-sang.

310
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,018
I believe

311
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,271
he's inside this hospital right now.

312
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,984
Myeong-ja seems to be imprisoned here…

313
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:12,902
PRISON

314
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,988
…in the second-level underground prison
based on our information.

315
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,575
Are other Joseon people there as well?

316
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,410
It seems so.

317
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,706
We should hurry.

318
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,750
Only three hours left until dawn.

319
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,837
If we can't get Myeong-ja out before then,
things will get tricky.

320
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,088
Understood.

321
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,881
My shift ends soon.

322
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,760
They will suspect me
if I don't return in time.

323
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,387
Yes. I understand.

324
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:44,767
If you do reach the underground prison,
please find my little brother too.

325
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,895
His name is Oh Sang-deok.

326
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,190
He's in his early 20s
and of average height.

327
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:54,318
There is a black, thumb-sized mole
next to his right ear.

328
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,363
Please find him.

329
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,656
You have my word.

330
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,117
We'll search for him.

331
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,244
Thank you.

332
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,081
I should say goodbye here as well.

333
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,587
I sincerely hope
that you find what you're looking for.

334
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,351
All right. We should get going too.

335
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,063
You two should leave now as well.

336
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:36,277
You found Sachimoto
but didn't gain what you were looking for.

337
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,988
We've reached the end of our contract,

338
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,490
so you can stop here.

339
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,579
However, I will be taking this.

340
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,625
We promised to bring back Myeong-ja.

341
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,502
You found her whereabouts.
That's more than enough.

342
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,757
You have kept your promise,

343
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,051
so we'll keep ours as well.

344
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,428
As I said, you already kept your promise.

345
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,975
You have a knack for annoying people.

346
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,728
Why do you keep making me repeat myself?

347
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,648
Did I… do that?

348
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,445
I'll lead the way.

349
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,782
So try not to get lost.

350
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,578
Well…

351
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,872
Please excuse her.

352
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:34,210
My daughter takes promises very seriously.

353
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,461
Yes, well…

354
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,149
Damn it.

355
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:08,828
What's with those men?

356
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,246
I'll explain later.

357
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:12,081
Come on.

358
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:14,875
Are you all right?

359
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,086
What do you mean?

360
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,967
Are we supposed to go down here?

361
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:27,763
I see nothing.

362
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,355
Do you even know where this leads?

363
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,566
For God's sake.

364
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,279
We have no time to lose.

365
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,199
I'll have a look around,
so head down first.

366
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,451
I'll be right behind you.

367
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,114
I see someone on the rooftop of the ward.

368
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,282
Please go check!

369
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,076
<i>Keep an eye on it!</i>

370
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:31,952
Yes, sir!

371
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,475
I sprained my ankle a bit,
but not to worry.

372
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,665
What in the world…

373
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,003
This way.

374
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,399
FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF KOREA

375
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:57,830
- Hurry up!
- Move it!

376
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,039
Run!

377
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,624
This is an emergency!

378
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,376
We'll be moving in. Follow me!

379
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,294
Yes, sir!

380
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,217
Get up!

381
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,679
You there, Josenjing. Stand up!

382
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,848
We have an intruder.

383
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:19,185
Disease Control Platoon, arm yourselves
and head to the underground lab.

384
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,686
Get a move on!

385
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:21,729
Yes, sir!

386
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,908
Pardon me, Lady Maeda.

387
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,286
Nothing like this
has ever happened before.

388
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,371
I apologize for the inconvenience.

389
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:45,002
Those who consider themselves
to be flawless

390
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,047
let their guard down more easily.

391
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,216
In any case,

392
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:53,636
I insist that you safely guard
what I've entrusted to you.

393
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,347
Until the baby is born,

394
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,682
she must not be harmed

395
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,519
or killed.

396
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:07,107
But I'm sure you're already aware.

397
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:09,735
Yes, Lady Maeda.

398
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,238
I'll take care of it straight away.

399
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,038
Open it.

400
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,168
Get out.

401
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,965
Get out, now!

402
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:34,843
Drag her out.

403
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:37,763
No!

404
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,723
I don't want to die!

405
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,016
Please don't kill me!

406
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,144
Let go! Let go of me!

407
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,984
Don't kill me! Please!

408
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,779
What will become of us now?

409
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:54,947
Spare me!

410
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,933
Please don't kill me!

411
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,529
Help!

412
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:39,385
Please, I'm begging you! I'm with a child!

413
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,804
Please, spare the child!

414
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,849
Cool it if you want to live.

415
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,060
Don't make a fuss and keep quiet.

416
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,065
That way you will be safe,
at least until your baby is born.

417
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:40,422
Was that the lower floors?

418
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,634
The intruder reached
that far down already?

419
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,552
I don't believe so.

420
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:51,350
From now on, monitor and guard
every path leading to the underground lab.

421
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:55,479
Any outsider who has seen
the underground laboratory

422
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,773
must not leave this place alive.

423
00:46:58,774 --> 00:46:59,775
Understood?

424
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,360
Yes, sir!

425
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:09,034
They must have found out
that we're inside.

426
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,829
What were those gunshots?

427
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:16,124
Whatever they were, I don't think
we can use the emergency stairs anymore.

428
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,377
Then what do we do now?

429
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,879
Sachimoto showed me another route.

430
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,092
Here.

431
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:28,428
This leads to the laundry room
in the second-level basement.

432
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,764
It's usually used to send surgical gowns

433
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,684
from the underground laboratory
down to the laundry room,

434
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:36,812
but it is wide enough
for a person to pass through.

435
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,356
Where is that break room?

436
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,024
Right across from here.

437
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:49,491
Clean it up. Move it.

438
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,252
Are you okay?

439
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:44,421
Quickly now.

440
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,272
- All of you, to the other floors!
- Yes, sir!

441
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,316
Get a move on!

442
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,777
This is an emergency! Get it together!

443
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,028
Yes, sir!

444
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,404
Let's go on ahead.

445
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,434
We must hurry.

446
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,602
A soldier's onto us. Come on.

447
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,552
I'm not hurt. I'm fine. Totally fine.

448
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,304
Are you hurt?

449
00:50:58,847 --> 00:50:59,848
I'm okay.

450
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:04,478
You're okay?

451
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:12,903
Don't move!

452
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:20,744
Hand it over.

453
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:22,412
Hand it over!

454
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,922
Dirty Josenjing bastard!

455
00:51:58,532 --> 00:51:59,533
Chae-ok!

456
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,275
Sir, please help!

457
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,362
That thing… That creature…

458
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:01,863
It's on its way up here!

459
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:45,383
So you managed to keep your bravado
in this state.

460
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,013
Bravado?

461
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,015
More like bravery.

462
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:56,561
I wasn't being reckless,
just confident that I could win.

463
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:17,374
I think your friend
has already made his escape.

464
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:22,379
We agreed to move separately
when we came in.

465
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,008
Will you be all right?

466
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,593
Sturdy as a rock.

467
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:32,472
Let's go and find Myeong-ja.

468
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,769
We should split up here.

469
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:40,772
Master Jang,
check the second-level underground prison.

470
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,024
I'll take the third-level basement.

471
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,567
I'll go down instead.

472
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,736
Can't you see that he is injured?

473
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,030
Stay by his side and help him.

474
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,448
Father.

475
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,533
Do as I say.

476
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:54,369
That way, we can all move efficiently.

477
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:59,374
Let's meet up at our rendezvous
in an hour.

478
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:03,128
If I'm late, don't wait for me.
You know the drill.

479
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,172
Be careful.

480
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:21,438
You can go with him. I'll be fine.

481
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,398
I can handle it myself.

482
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:25,942
Follow me.

483
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,806
I heard quite a lot of gunshots earlier.

484
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,226
Don't you think something's going on
inside this place?

485
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:03,813
Stay here for now.
