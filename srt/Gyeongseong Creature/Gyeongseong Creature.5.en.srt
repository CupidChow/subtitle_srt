GYEONGSEONG CREATURE

2
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,995
FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF KOREA

3
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,041
In two weeks' time…

4
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:09,462
…a fundraiser will be held at Bumingwan
for the Frontline General Rally.

5
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:13,174
After Tokyo's bombing, the Japanese Army
planned a propaganda event

6
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:17,637
to exploit our resources and deploy
more Joseon men to the front lines.

7
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:22,225
It will be a fundraising party
to procure money for that rally.

8
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,978
Lieutenant General Minami,
Lieutenant General Seijiro,

9
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,146
Major General Junji,

10
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:30,108
Police Chief Nishimura,
and Commissioner Ishikawa will be there,

11
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,610
as will all the big names in Gyeongseong.

12
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,739
Jin Seon-jung of the United Society
and Park Yong-su

13
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,367
of the People's Livelihood Corps
will also be attending.

14
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:44,080
It will be a momentous occasion.
Make sure to attend it.

15
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,879
So, the leaders
of the Japanese occupation forces

16
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:54,799
and the heads of the pro-Japanese traitors
will all be gathered in one place.

17
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,887
This will be
the chance of a lifetime for us.

18
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,431
We have about 20 kilograms
of dynamite we swiped

19
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,350
when we were planning to explode
the Han River railway.

20
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:09,063
We had to abort the plan
when Comrade Jeong Seung-jong got caught,

21
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,858
but we still have the dynamite.

22
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,778
It's imperative that we don't get caught
before the rebellion.

23
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,573
Don't worry, Comrade Kwon.

24
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,658
Only I know the location

25
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:22,952
of the explosives.

26
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,629
Run!

27
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,480
Move it!

28
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,441
Comrade Kwon.

29
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,531
Comrade Lee In-hyeok? How did this happen?

30
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,909
For handing out seditious flyers.

31
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,829
And strangely, he's being taken
not to Seodaemun Prison, but…

32
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,039
But?

33
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,707
…to Ongseong Hospital.

34
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,023
Look here!

35
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:41,614
LONG LIVE THE EMPEROR
DEVOTE ALL TO WAR

36
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,461
Comrade Lee?

37
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,546
Who are you?

38
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,966
- Are you a Joseon-born?
- Excuse me.

39
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,051
Hey!

40
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,389
Help us, sir.

41
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,141
Please help us get out of here.

42
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,727
Do you know Lee In-hyeok?

43
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,688
I have a three-year-old
and a five-year-old at home.

44
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,150
They must've been starving
for days. Please.

45
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:22,238
Please help me get back home. Please?

46
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,700
Forgive me.
I'm on a more urgent mission right now.

47
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,785
Sir, please.

48
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,371
Hey! Over here!

49
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,873
Here!

50
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,583
- I'm sorry.
- Sir!

51
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,088
Comrade Kwon!

52
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,174
You came all this way…

53
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,261
Now, come on. Get us out of here.

54
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,432
I'm afraid I don't have time.

55
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,683
What do you mean?

56
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,728
Aren't you here to free us?

57
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,647
Tell me where you hid the dynamite.

58
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,151
We have less than ten days left
until the rebellion.

59
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,403
We cannot waste this precious opportunity!

60
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,657
Tell me where you hid the dynamite,
Comrade Lee.

61
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:08,910
No.

62
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,704
Free us first.

63
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,625
I can't afford to do that right now.

64
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,336
First, tell me where the dynamite is.

65
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,297
I promise, as soon as I get out,

66
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,175
I will find a way to free you two.

67
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,511
Freeing us comes first.

68
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,512
Comrade Lee!

69
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,596
Listen!

70
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,807
This place is a living hell!

71
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,768
This isn't an ordinary prison!

72
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,524
Comrade Kwon,
if we don't get out of this place…

73
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,736
you'll get no dynamite.

74
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,741
Don't move.

75
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,827
Hands above your head!

76
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,902
What on Earth was that thing?

77
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,282
I don't know what it is,
but I'm sure it was created here.

78
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,234
First, let's get out of this place.

79
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:37,196
There is a way to reach the central vent
behind this boiler room.

80
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,280
Let's head that way.

81
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,094
Drop your weapon.

82
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,474
Did you not hear me?!

83
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,559
Drop your knife.

EPISODE 5
DESPERATION

86
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,917
I said drop your knife!

87
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,007
For now, let's do what he says.

88
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,843
And what, die here in vain?

89
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,930
I'm saying let's not get carried away
by ill-advised bravery.

90
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:30,392
Not only are you quick to compromise,
but also quick to give up.

91
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,019
Call it quick judgment.

92
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,980
The ability to deal with crises

93
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,066
flexibly.

94
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,779
I can't believe you're laughing.

95
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,323
At least we escaped the creature.

96
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,991
I'm not so sure.

97
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,286
I wonder which creature is worse.

98
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,580
This is your final warning.

99
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,875
Drop your knife right now!

100
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,686
To die so recklessly
means to lose against them.

101
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,020
Drop it.

102
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,731
Surrender has never been an option for me.

103
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,025
I understand as I also hate losing,

104
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,194
so trust me and drop it.

105
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,073
My intention is not to die, but to live.

106
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,166
There are no survivors.

107
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,544
Is the 1st Military Police Squad all gone?

108
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,504
Yes. That's correct, sir.

109
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:45,986
Could it be

110
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,574
that it learned
how to operate the elevator?

111
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,496
How could you allow
something like this to happen?

112
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,039
My apologies.

113
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,794
We were attacked out of nowhere.

114
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,296
So, where is the specimen right now?

115
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,631
Rest assured, sir.

116
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,883
The elevator has already been shut down,

117
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,553
and machine gun crews are stationed
in all paths to the first-level basement.

118
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,265
We've also deployed combat units,
so the situation will be over soon.

119
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,018
Do you know what I hate the most?

120
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,938
Problems occurring when they shouldn't.

121
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:26,235
And what I hate more than that
is failing to fix such problems.

122
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,903
Forgive me, sir.

123
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:34,159
Apologizing helplessly and pathetically
without a plan to fix the problem

124
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,538
is what failures do, Mr. Soma.

125
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,170
Take care of it before something
even more annoying arises.

126
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,505
Understood?

127
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,631
Yes, sir!

128
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,970
We have captured an intruder, sir.

129
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,064
Look who we have here.

130
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,108
The young master of the Bugang Company.

131
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,362
I have heard
that you're quite a troublemaker.

132
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,656
It seems you're in big trouble now.

133
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,910
Did Jang Tae-sang
of Golden Treasure tag along?

134
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,829
This has nothing to do with them.

135
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,706
Don't tell me…

136
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,002
you're a rebel too?

137
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,716
I'd rather you didn't tell my old man.

138
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,809
Don't get smart with me.
You're in the wrong place for that.

139
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,104
It doesn't matter whose son you are.

140
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,357
That is to say, no one will care
should you die in here.

141
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,235
Understood?

142
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,825
Take him to the laboratory.

143
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,910
Yes, sir!

144
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,631
The timing couldn't have been better.
The hospital's funds were running short.

145
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,760
Teach him a hard lesson,
but not enough to kill him.

146
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,224
Get in.

147
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,065
Open this door! Open it!

148
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,775
Open the door.

149
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,070
Let go!

150
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,154
Keep still!

151
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,445
Sir!

152
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,198
What is it?

153
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,950
The disease control platoon sent word.

154
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:24,329
Two intruders caught on the second level
are being taken to Colonel Kato.

155
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,511
Who are they?

156
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,597
Intruders who have snuck
into the building.

157
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,112
Master Jang?

158
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,488
Is that Master Jang?

159
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,907
That's Master Jang.

160
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,118
Shut it!

161
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,127
This one is coming with me.

162
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,339
- Bring him.
- Yes, sir.

163
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,634
Where are you taking me? What about her?

164
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,551
Don't move!

165
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,680
Get your hands off her!

166
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,185
What? Is she your woman or something?

167
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,187
Let's go.

168
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,814
Stay where you are.
I'll find you no matter what.

169
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,237
I'll come for you!

170
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,113
I promise!

171
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,775
<i>The creature may be</i>
<i>more intelligent than expected.</i>

172
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,237
<i>It knows how to use the elevator…</i>

173
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,454
<i>and it's been more than an hour</i>
<i>since we lost sight of it.</i>

174
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,716
I wonder what it is that it's after.

175
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:56,648
We just apprehended the intruders.
It seems that they've seen the specimen.

176
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,160
Now, let's talk, shall we?

177
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,414
Why did you sneak in here?

178
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,416
What is your purpose?

179
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,753
I'm looking for someone.

180
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,383
Speaking the Joseon tongue
is prohibited, Josenjing.

181
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,843
I order you to speak in Japanese.

182
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:13,308
So it's illegal for a Joseon person
to speak the Joseon language,

183
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,771
but it's legal for you to do
what you're doing here?

184
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,318
Speak

185
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,028
in

186
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,906
Japanese.

187
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,077
If you can't understand me,
bring someone who speaks my language.

188
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,373
You seem more desperate, after all.

189
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:49,511
Now, why don't we start over?

190
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,764
Why did you sneak in here?

191
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,895
<i>What do you want to know?</i>

192
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:03,191
I'm sure you heard the news
about the Bombing of Tokyo.

193
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:04,943
Well,

194
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,404
through the grapevine, sure.

195
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,738
That being said,

196
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:12,826
I don't intend to return to Tokyo
even after the war ends.

197
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,997
My wife and child
share an affection for Gyeongseong.

198
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,623
They wish to keep living here.

199
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,459
So?

200
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,339
A settlement fund of 300 yen,
a house to live in,

201
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,302
and a store about ten <i>pyeong </i>big.

202
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:35,223
Provide me with these,
and I'll let you leave this place alive.

203
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,608
Why should I agree to those terms?

204
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:48,528
Because you already owe me once
for your life.

205
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,282
May we take a look inside the cart?

206
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,631
Is there anything else
you'd like to check?

207
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,509
No. I apologize for the trouble,
Mr. Sachimoto.

208
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,346
<i>Frankly, I was quite taken aback.</i>

209
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,932
I knew you were here for Akiko,

210
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,851
but I didn't expect you
to help the kids escape.

211
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,773
Anyway, where is Myeong-ja?

212
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,026
Give up.

213
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,905
Leaving with her is impossible now.

214
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,741
Your plan has failed.

215
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,412
Why is the underground prison
filled with Joseon people?

216
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:44,501
What are you doing
with those innocent women and children?

217
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,130
And what about that horrifying creature?

218
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,342
Why have you created such a thing?

219
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:57,347
Have you actually been running
biological experiments on people?

220
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,142
I take it…

221
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,396
that you're rejecting my offer.

222
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,363
What about Yoon Chae-ok?

223
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,741
Where is the woman that was with me?

224
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,251
That must hurt.

225
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,545
Look at that.

226
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:46,187
If you want to live,
accept my terms and save yourself!

227
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,982
If I do leave here,
I'll be a dead man anyway.

228
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,612
So tell me where Akiko
and Yoon Chae-ok are being kept…

229
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,699
or we won't have a deal.

230
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,877
Why did you come in here?

231
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,004
What is your purpose?

232
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,717
Answer me right now!

233
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,306
Screw you.

234
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,395
Come grab her.

235
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,266
I know quite well

236
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:10,689
how to deal with girls like you.

237
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,614
Answer me, Josenjing!

238
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,581
You may be able to violate me by force…

239
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,920
but that doesn't mean you win.

240
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,508
Do you still not understand?

241
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:39,718
Bitch.

242
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,678
You're dead!

243
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:42,679
Stop!

244
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,107
That's enough, First Sergeant Haneda.

245
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,026
No, sir.
I'll make sure she learns a lesson.

246
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,571
Can't you see?

247
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,198
You have already lost.

248
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,301
<i>You were right.</i>

249
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:05,887
<i>Just when you think</i>

250
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,849
<i>the cherry blossoms</i>
<i>have bloomed splendidly,</i>

251
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,811
<i>they begin to fall.</i>

252
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:30,787
Mrs. Nawol!

253
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,582
What about Master Jang? Has he returned?

254
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,551
He's not back yet?

255
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:58,022
You seem to have stayed up all night.

256
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:01,776
Mm-hmm.

257
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:06,948
You seem to have gone out
very late last night.

258
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,325
Yes.

259
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:40,857
Have a seat.

260
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:47,322
I came as soon as I received your message.

261
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,325
What on Earth is going on?

262
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,954
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Water, please.

263
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:04,589
Your immature son
has gotten himself into big trouble.

264
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:09,761
Last night, he was caught trespassing
in Ongseong Hospital.

265
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:15,516
I am deeply ashamed
that he's caused such inconvenience.

266
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,393
Inconvenience is an understatement.

267
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,607
The situation is quite serious.

268
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:27,528
Not only did he trespass…

269
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,532
I heard he's a rebel.

270
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,996
If things go wrong, your son

271
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,166
and the Bugang Company
could both end up in danger.

272
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,146
So, you're a rebel?

273
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,151
What is it that you lot want?

274
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,654
Joseon's independence.

275
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,115
Something like that?

276
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,980
To be honest,

277
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,357
torture isn't my cup of tea.

278
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,781
It's exhausting, unpleasant, and messy.

279
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,617
It'd be much neater

280
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,705
to put you on the table
and crack your head open

281
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,165
or slice open your stomach.

282
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,182
Write down the names
of your fellow intruders

283
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,894
and the exact purpose of your intrusion.

284
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,105
You have an hour.

285
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,901
If you don't write it down in an hour,
you'll find yourself

286
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:34,447
lying face-up on that dissection table.

287
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,041
Joseon's independence, huh?

288
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,086
Will you ever grow up?

289
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,964
Are you even aware
of who the Bugang Company leeches off of?

290
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:54,926
Foolish bastard.

291
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:14,153
If you do reach the underground prison,
please find my little brother too.

292
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,780
His name is Oh Sang-deok.

293
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:20,701
<i>There is a black, thumb-sized mole</i>
<i>next to his right ear.</i>

294
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,764
Why do you do that to yourself?

295
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,649
Do you think getting wasted
will solve your problems?

296
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,615
But I feel better now that I've thrown up.

297
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,744
Your family called several times
from Anguk-dong.

298
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,833
You should call it a night and go home.

299
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:12,962
Tae-sang.

300
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,051
I'm so ashamed of my father.

301
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:26,100
I'm ashamed of how well-off he's become
from betraying his country.

302
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:31,814
And I hate myself
for living lavishly thanks to that.

303
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:37,570
The very people who groveled
at my father's feet for crumbs

304
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,741
also pointed fingers at us
and badmouthed us behind our backs.

305
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,119
I was so ashamed of that.

306
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,583
That's why I beat the hell out of everyone

307
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,335
who pointed their fingers at you.

308
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,965
You really were something, even back then.

309
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:02,303
You threw the best punches
yet refused to lead a gang of your own.

310
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,557
Because making a living
was the most important thing for me.

311
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,852
You're smart.

312
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,063
You're competent.

313
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,108
So why are you running a pawnshop?

314
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,904
Because it suits my taste,

315
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,281
and I'm good at it.

316
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,826
As a man,

317
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:29,580
do you truly have no desire
to serve a bigger cause?

318
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,917
You really are persistent.

319
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,962
Aren't you tired of saying that
for the past ten years?

320
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,800
Well, you're a good man.

321
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,931
My sincerity, my patriotism,
my everything.

322
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,143
You're the only friend
who recognizes them.

323
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:57,566
So join us at the Patriotic Society,
Tae-sang!

324
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,280
Go away. The smell of alcohol
is ruining my new suit.

325
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:06,742
Let's burn for our country
and go out like a passionate flame, okay?

326
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,954
I said no.

327
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:13,457
I'm going to live a long, cold life.

328
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,458
Damn it.

329
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,377
Hey!

330
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,130
Tae-sang! I'm not done with you yet.

331
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:38,232
I guess even the filthy-rich master
of the House of Golden Treasure

332
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,067
can't escape prison.

333
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:44,822
You didn't care to grease
some big shot's palm with your fortune?

334
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,491
How did someone like you end up here?

335
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,493
I know, right?

336
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,330
This is all because of Myeong-ja.

337
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:53,831
Wait, no.

338
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,251
Not Myeong-ja. Is it because of Ishikawa?

339
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:58,669
No.

340
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,921
Maybe that wife of his?

341
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:03,841
Look.

342
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,845
Did you come in with Comrade Kwon?

343
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:12,433
I don't deserve
to be mentioned alongside him.

344
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:17,897
He's risking his life for a nobler cause
than rescuing a nobody like Myeong-ja.

345
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:25,154
They say that human lives
are so common and trivial,

346
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,741
yet it scares me
to think about losing mine.

347
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,957
My goodness, I rambled on for a bit there.

348
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,296
I should stop running my mouth
and start preparing to get out of here.

349
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,757
What do you mean?

350
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,301
How are you going to escape?

351
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,514
I'm Jang Tae-sang.

352
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:55,393
Did you really think
the filthy-rich master of Golden Treasure

353
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,603
came in here
without greasing anyone's palm?

354
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:04,110
From now on, grant me these three things.

355
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:09,073
First, send word to Mrs. Nawol
of the House of Golden Treasure.

356
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:18,999
Hello?

357
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,835
Pardon?

358
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,920
Yes, this is Mrs. Nawol speaking.

359
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,755
This is a message from Master Jang.

360
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,549
Listen carefully.

361
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:29,927
Go ahead.

362
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,264
What's your second request?

363
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,767
Remove all guards and sentries
from the prison.

364
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,019
You two, follow me.

365
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,688
Right now, sir?

366
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,776
It's about the specimen
on the fourth-level basement.

367
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,403
Shut up and follow me!

368
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,072
Yes, sir.

369
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,869
Hey, you!

370
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,328
You too.

371
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,455
Yes, sir.

372
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,315
Let us come with you!

373
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,357
Take us with you.

374
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,277
Master Jang, don't abandon us.
Take us too!

375
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,905
Save us, Master Jang. Save us!

376
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,573
Save us, Master Jang.

377
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,787
- Master Jang…
- Just wait 30 minutes.

378
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,706
I'll be back.

379
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,917
How do you expect us to believe that?

380
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,044
What if you don't come back?

381
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,463
You seem to have a bit of a trust issue.

382
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,593
I promise to come back,

383
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:56,430
so don't do anything
and stay put until I do.

384
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,641
Okay.

385
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,770
- Master Jang.
- Master Jang! Where are you going?

386
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,024
The third request is too much.

387
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:08,984
You could die.

388
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,570
I'll decide for myself
whether I die or not.

389
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,782
Yoon Chae-ok.

390
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:16,992
Where is she?

391
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,208
Do you need this?

392
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:44,728
Thank you.

393
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,734
I don't speak the Joseon tongue.

394
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,988
I was stationed in Manchuria.

395
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,365
With the disease control platoon?

396
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,911
Did you bring that creature
from there as well?

397
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,456
You…

398
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,461
Are you with the Resistance?

399
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:13,048
I was on the search for my mother
who'd gone missing ten years ago.

400
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,760
While searching for her,

401
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,639
I found out what you people did
on Manwol Island.

402
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:28,105
I never expected
to hear about Manwol Island here.

403
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:31,442
Why did you bring the creature
all the way to Gyeongseong?

404
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:37,031
Because of my sincere curiosity
and passion as a scientist

405
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,534
and my affection for my creation.

406
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,536
You know,

407
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:45,080
for those complex reasons.

408
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,134
By the way,

409
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,347
have we met before?

410
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,392
I'm certain

411
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,937
that I know those eyes from somewhere.

412
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,197
Tell me,

413
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,201
what was the name of your lost mother?

414
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,787
Choi Seong-sim.

415
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:28,916
Seishin.

416
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,187
Your name.

417
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:51,772
Choi…

418
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,066
Seong-sim.

419
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:00,989
Seishin.

420
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,334
But

421
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,671
why do you ask for my mother's name?

422
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,762
How was it in person? My specimen.

423
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:26,807
It was horrifying.

424
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:28,934
Did you perhaps

425
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:33,397
feel anything else
when you faced the specimen?

426
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,107
Not really.

427
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,944
I was too busy running away
to feel anything else.

428
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:42,364
It seemed like it existed only to attack.

429
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,373
Now it's your turn to answer.

430
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,127
Why did you ask for my mother's name?

431
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:56,879
Do you…

432
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,382
know my mother, by any chance?

433
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,475
Your Japanese is quite good.

434
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,562
Why did you suffer needlessly back there?

435
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,981
Even if I had answered in Japanese…

436
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,777
nothing would've changed.

437
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:23,739
I see.

438
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,922
- Take her away.
- Yes, sir.

439
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,350
Don't touch her
without my explicit permission.

440
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,979
If you disobey my orders,

441
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:40,315
you will be demoted to an infantryman.

442
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,694
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, sir.

443
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,505
Just wait.

444
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:07,509
I'm going to kill you with my own hands.

445
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,096
I'd like to see you try it.

446
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,684
Inferior soldier.

447
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,145
"Inferior soldier"?

448
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,314
"Inferior soldier"!

449
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,648
"Inferior soldier."

450
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:23,859
Shut up.

451
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,737
Do you have a death wish?

452
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,660
Officer Asano would like to see you, sir.

453
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:33,720
My son may be immature at times,
but I've no brother and he's the only son.

454
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,514
He is to carry on the family name.

455
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,018
Please have mercy
and forgive him just this once.

456
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,731
I beg of you, Dr. Ichiro!

457
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,986
You put me in a difficult position.

458
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,366
We'll see what happens.

459
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,128
Did you put in the right amount?

460
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:07,629
Yes, sir.

461
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,965
I did as you instructed.

462
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:20,058
<i>He's a fickle man.</i>
<i>We will need to prepare alternative plans.</i>

463
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,185
Yes, sir.

464
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,022
Why don't you leave that up to us?

465
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:34,865
Aren't you
from the House of Golden Treasure?

466
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,450
Yes.

467
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:41,038
And we just got ahold of a plan
to save Master Kwon.

468
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:15,924
I MISS YOU, CHAE-OK
MY DEAR DAUGHTER

469
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,900
<i>Have we met before?</i>

470
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,361
I know those eyes from somewhere.

471
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,408
What was the name of your lost mother?

472
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:02,512
<i>I want</i>

473
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:04,973
<i>to live.</i>

474
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,438
<i>I want to live…</i>

475
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:17,944
<i>so I can see you.</i>

476
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:22,908
<i>My dear daughter.</i>

477
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:29,748
I MISS YOU, CHAE-OK
MY DEAR DAUGHTER

478
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,875
Chae-ok.

479
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,451
Mother.

480
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,670
I'm starving.

481
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,421
What time is it?

482
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,799
We still have an hour left.

483
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,112
- It's the real deal!
- What is it?

484
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:43,905
Caramel?

485
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:47,242
Why is something so valuable
rolling around in here?

486
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:49,160
There's another one here.

487
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,136
Hey, are you all right?

488
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,813
What's wrong? Are you hurt? Ms. Yoon!

489
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:24,696
What happened?

490
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:26,489
What's wrong?

491
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,785
My mother was here.

492
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:32,912
Your mother?

493
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:37,751
I MISS YOU, CHAE-OK
MY DEAR DAUGHTER

494
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,170
Your mother was here?

495
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,505
She might still be here.

496
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:53,433
I get where you're coming from,
but we're in a bad spot. Why don't we…

497
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:59,189
You move according to your plan.

498
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,733
I'll move on my own from now on.

499
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,735
Where will you even go?

500
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:06,488
Now that I know my mother is here,
I can't just leave.

501
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,491
I'm going to find her.

502
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,411
Look.

503
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:16,039
This place is swarming
with Japanese soldiers.

504
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:19,501
They are armed and searching for us.
And that's not all.

505
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:22,796
A mysterious creature is wreaking havoc.
What can you do by yourself?

506
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,092
Listen to me.
Why don't we get out of here for today?

507
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:30,428
I'll look for another way
to find out about your mother.

508
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:34,849
What are you going to do
if you run into the creature again?

509
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:37,060
How do you plan to fight it on your own?

510
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,937
And should something bad happen--

511
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,031
Thank you.

512
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,330
And I'm sorry
I can't stay with you until the end.

513
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:17,976
Must you really go?

514
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,145
Ten years.

515
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:27,026
For ten years, I've looked everywhere
in search of my mother.

516
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:30,947
And now I know she's here.

517
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:35,785
So I have to find her.

518
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,843
Stay alive.

You.

526
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,822
You know who Choi Seong-sim is, don't you?

527
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,203
Where is she?

528
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:14,962
Answer me!

529
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:19,884
Where is my mother right now?
