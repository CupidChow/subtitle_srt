1 YEAR AGO
ONGSEONG HOSPITAL, GYEONGSEONG

3
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,884
Ryu Sachimoto, graduated
from Tokyo University of the Arts…

4
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,095
You volunteered?

5
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,179
Yes.

6
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,766
To serve His Majesty
and the Empire of Japan--

7
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,352
And get paid well while you're at it.

8
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,988
What is this, sir?

9
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,656
It's called <i>Kaitai Shinsho.</i>

10
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,118
You mean a book on anatomy?

11
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:46,666
Books such as those have been around
in Germany since 1722.

12
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,585
Although lagging behind,

13
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,921
we're working to elevate
our empire's medical standards

14
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:57,343
here at Ongseong Hospital via a vast range
of research studies and experiments.

15
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,889
Your job is to keep a record of them.

16
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,599
So,

17
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,643
what I'm supposed to draw is…

18
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,569
Now, which part shall we work on today?

19
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,990
We have a new painter with us today.

20
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,826
Why don't we start off lightly
by opening up the abdomen?

21
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,328
Yes, sir.

22
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,538
Scalpel.

23
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,291
Please don't kill me.

24
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,002
Please. Please spare me!

25
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,379
Doctor! Please!

26
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,131
Please don't kill me!

27
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,022
Sachimoto!

28
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,107
Get back here at once!

29
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,654
<i>- I was merely a penniless painter.</i>
<i>- </i>Sachimoto!

30
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,406
<i>I needed money,</i>

31
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:04,244
<i>and I chose Joseon</i>
<i>because of the high pay, but…</i>

32
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,643
There's no need to cry.

33
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,858
You'll get used to it soon enough,
just like everyone else here.

34
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,821
That's the thing about humans.

35
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,825
We are quick to adapt to anything.

36
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,411
Whether it be longing…

37
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,457
or anguish.

38
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,047
Hey, time's up. Hurry up.

EPISODE 2
MOTHER

41
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,262
<i>Why have you accepted</i>
<i>such a man's request?</i>

42
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,848
Well, there was no reason not to.

43
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,728
That man will find the missing person.
We will obtain information on Sachimoto.

44
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,938
He is an insolent and shameless man.

45
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,317
Don't be so quick to judge a person.

46
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,861
I can tell by the way he speaks,

47
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,907
and how he treats
others' problems so lightly.

48
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,076
We are nothing but mere sleuths to him.

49
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,080
We've reached an agreement.

50
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,666
All we need to do
is work toward our mutual benefit.

51
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:23,878
This case…

52
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,632
I have a bad feeling about it.

53
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,802
I had the same feeling on Manwol Island,

54
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,014
and you were badly hurt then.

55
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,811
This will be the last time, Chae-ok.

56
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,107
After this is over,

57
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,527
you should return home.

58
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,362
What about Mother?

59
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,700
Finding your mother is my fate
and my burden to bear.

60
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,288
I can't let you bear it any longer.

61
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,248
Father.

62
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,875
You should live your own life.

63
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,254
This is our last job together.

64
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,405
Until the cherry blossoms fall.

65
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,094
What do you think about those sleuths?

66
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,014
Do you think they have what it takes?

67
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,266
Judging by what they said,

68
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,728
they didn't strike me as amateurs.

69
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,228
Who's taking the next shift?

70
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,897
I heard it was Kinoshita.

71
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,399
Oh, the new kid?

72
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,651
He's no good.

73
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,644
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir!

74
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,840
How is it
that we can't find a single lead?

75
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,551
I combed through
Myeong-ja's favorite tea shops,

76
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,388
restaurants, boutiques, and shoe stores.
No one knows her whereabouts.

77
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,973
How is this possible?

78
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,769
I even visited
that rickshaw office she frequents,

79
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,187
but even they didn't know.

80
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,606
No one's given her a ride or seen her.

81
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,900
Gosh, is she gone with the wind?

82
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,902
She disappeared without a trace.

83
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,280
It's as if she evaporated. That's it.
Myeong-ja evaporated.

84
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:47,952
A person always leaves behind
some trace wherever they go.

85
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,453
We just haven't found it.

86
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:57,044
By the way, is that really
how they're tailing us right now?

87
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,796
Do they think we're idiots?

88
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,132
I mean, that's the most conspicuous tail
I have ever seen.

89
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,470
It's quite unsettling to pretend
to not notice them. Sheesh!

90
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,642
- Fighting over that chamber pot.
- Has he lost his mind?

91
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:18,816
Answer me!
What color does this look like to you?

92
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,317
Well…

93
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,278
It's white.

94
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,990
And what do you call
white porcelain in Joseon?

95
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,992
<i>Baekja, </i>sir.

96
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,619
Then…

97
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,581
what is this?

98
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,458
Answer me!

99
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,377
I'm asking you what this is!

100
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,172
Let's see.

101
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,009
How do I put this?

102
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,720
It's too shoddy
to be called fine porcelain.

103
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,931
It looks like
an ordinary piece of pottery to me.

104
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,893
And yet, I paid 100 won for that.

105
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,561
So what?

106
00:14:56,145 --> 00:15:00,024
How much would you give me
if I were to pawn it here?

107
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,067
Do you have a written guarantee on you?

108
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,361
A receipt would also be fine.

109
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,908
I don't have either.

110
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,832
You shelled out 100 won for a chamber pot
that's barely worth 10 jeon,

111
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,084
and you don't have a guarantee
or a receipt?

112
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,464
It's clear to me that you were scammed.

113
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:28,052
This is a matter for the police bureau,
not a pawnshop.

114
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,473
Master Jang.

115
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,060
Be a good man and just take the pot.

116
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,939
I heard Ishikawa will be confiscating
everything you own.

117
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,774
Says who?

118
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,027
Everyone in Bonjeong
knows about it already.

119
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,613
The House of Golden Treasure
will have a new master.

120
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:53,202
You're going to lose everything anyway.
What's one more chamber pot to you?

121
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,832
Would you look at this bastard?

122
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,001
What are you yapping about?

123
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,086
What?

124
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,837
"This bastard"?

125
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,423
Stop disrupting my business and get out.

126
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,634
Keep pushing your luck
and you might get hurt.

127
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,512
Oh, and try not to speak
the Joseon tongue if you can.

128
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,514
Your pronunciation sucks.

129
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,431
It's the worst!

130
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,558
Damn you!

131
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,477
You're dead!

132
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:39,498
The House of Golden Treasure
is owned by me, Jang Tae-sang,

133
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,750
and it will stay that way.

134
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:47,423
So if you cause a disturbance in my shop
or even dare to dream of robbing me,

135
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,633
you better be prepared

136
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,344
to either die or come very close to dying.

137
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,725
Come on! My arm's hurting!

138
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,729
My arm keeps giving out.
It must be my age.

139
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,023
See? Look…

140
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,858
Hey.

141
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,360
You should leave.

142
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,203
- Move!
- Get lost!

143
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,455
Out of the way!

144
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,003
Let's go.

145
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,680
From now on, we must all stay vigilant.

146
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,515
What?

147
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,310
What do you mean?

148
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,479
He means we should find Myeong-ja soon,

149
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:47,316
or else scoundrels like him
will keep showing up to bother us.

150
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,152
Which reminds me.

151
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,700
They found the last place
Myeong-ja visited.

152
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,619
What?

153
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,715
We found the rickshaw puller
who gave her a ride seven days ago.

154
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,636
What? No way! That can't be!

155
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:19,264
I chased down every single puller
working for Spring Moon Hall.

156
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,476
I asked around
and investigated everything myself!

157
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,895
The man doesn't work for Spring Moon Hall.

158
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,398
Then what?

159
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,192
You said she could've been killed.

160
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,987
So we thought about
who could've killed her,

161
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,365
and only one person came to mind.

162
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,009
Where's Mr. Takashi?

163
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,680
He fell ill and will rest
for three to four days.

164
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,226
<i>Lady Yukiko Maeda.</i>

165
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,857
So Yukiko Maeda called Myeong-ja out?

166
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,776
She was called
to Ishikawa's house at first,

167
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,362
then moved elsewhere shortly after.

168
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,364
Where would that be?

169
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,116
Ongseong Hospital.

170
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,035
Ong… Ongseong Hospital?

171
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,954
Are you certain?

172
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,548
Please don't kill me!

173
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,177
You are certain it was Ongseong Hospital?

174
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,889
Yes! I swear it was Ongseong Hospital!

175
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:45,392
I swear it on my mother
and father's lives!

176
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,977
It was Ongseong Hospital!

177
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,273
I told you, I took her there myself!

178
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:57,279
She disappeared after the puller
dropped her off at Ongseong Hospital,

179
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,450
so it is likely that she's still in there,
don't you think?

180
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,119
Gosh, no. That makes no sense.

181
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,746
What doesn't make sense?

182
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:09,249
Look, here's the thing
about Ongseong Hospital.

183
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,626
It's hard to get in there

184
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:15,422
unless you are Japanese military, police,
or a Government-General official.

185
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,925
A Joseon courtesan
could never get past its gates!

186
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:22,054
You don't know how tight their security is
at the gate with all the inspections.

187
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:27,100
What if Yukiko Maeda pulled some strings
and arranged it?

188
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,602
Why would she do that?

189
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:33,273
Why would she take her husband's mistress
to a Japanese-only hospital?

190
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,734
We can get inside the hospital
to figure that out.

191
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,153
My God, what is the matter with you?

192
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,323
I just said that we Joseon-borns
are not allowed in there!

193
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,659
I heard that Master Jang
has good connections.

194
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,829
But not good enough to get us inside?

195
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:56,463
Well, I do know some Joseon individuals
who can visit that hospital.

196
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,548
So, can we get in or not?

197
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,300
That I'll have to see.

198
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,804
Forget it. If you can't make it happen,
we'll find a way.

199
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:07,224
You're an impatient one, aren't you?
Who says I can't do it?

200
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,810
I'm just saying, let's make a plan.

201
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:13,563
We ought to be fully prepared
in whatever we do.

202
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,898
Don't you know that?

203
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,909
Something on my face?

204
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,006
What are you doing?

205
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,758
Oh. Give these to the two outside.

206
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,176
What's your plan?

207
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,803
How dare they doubt me?

208
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:49,349
I'll show them
how shrewd and meticulous I am.

209
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,601
What's the money for?
What are you up to this time?

210
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,353
What do you think?

211
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,857
Doing the impossible, of course.

212
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,491
- What is this?
- Money.

213
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:08,618
It's money.

214
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,289
I don't care if you use it
for the independence movement.

215
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:15,083
I'm giving it to you,
so spend it as you wish.

216
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,087
What trick are you pulling?

217
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,093
Let me borrow your ID.

218
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,470
My ID?

219
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:30,223
Only a few Joseon people in Gyeongseong
are allowed into Ongseong Hospital,

220
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,726
and your family is among them.

221
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,811
- Am I right?
- Why do you ask?

222
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:36,730
Are you unwell?

223
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,482
No, not me.

224
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,483
Wait!

225
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,904
If this has anything to do with Ishikawa,
leave me out of it.

226
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,827
Think of it as saving your friend's life.

227
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,580
If you still consider me a friend,
that is.

228
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,665
If you're not ill, then who is?

229
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,044
I should at least know who it is
before I lend it to you.

230
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,922
Don't ask too many questions.
It's for your own good.

231
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:05,801
You're here to steal my identity,
and you're worried about me?

232
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:07,886
Will you help?

233
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,809
How wonderful it would be
for you to use such passion for us.

234
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:23,026
Sorry, but I don't daydream
about something like independence.

235
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:27,364
How can I dare to take back
what even the king failed to protect?

236
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,492
All I want, in these turbulent times,

237
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,120
is to strive as stubbornly as I can

238
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,706
to stay alive and safe day after day.

239
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:38,667
So,

240
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,795
will you do this for me?

241
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,719
Return it in one piece.

242
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,057
Will do.

243
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,156
So, how did it go?

244
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,617
Are the sleuths here yet?

245
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,496
Oh, there they are.

246
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,291
That one's pretty too!

247
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,169
So beautiful!

248
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,955
- Let's get going.
- Huh?

249
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,874
We don't have all day.

250
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,418
Yes, we should go.

251
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,503
Please hop in.

252
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:16,598
Oh, it's good manners
to help a lady get in the car.

253
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:18,850
No need.

254
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,364
Let's go.

255
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:57,931
Identification.

256
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,727
This is my master.

257
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,188
You're familiar
with the Bugang Company, aren't you?

258
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,065
He's the firstborn son of the family.

259
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,446
Are they with you?

260
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:19,953
They are my master's fiancée
and her father.

261
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:29,004
Oh, it's almost time for our appointment.

262
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,423
Please hurry.

263
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:36,219
Dr. Takahashi absolutely hates it
when people are late for appointments.

264
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,014
Damn Josenjing…

265
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,516
Hey, let them through!

266
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,851
Thank you!

267
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,441
Wait, hold up!

268
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:07,959
You forgot this.

269
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,086
Oh, silly me! Anyway…

270
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,338
Thank you, sir!

271
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:45,789
Ongseong Hospital?

272
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:49,626
Yes, sir.
He just went in with some company.

273
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,713
Should I tell him to stay and keep watch?

274
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,573
RECORDS ROOM

275
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,179
I'm here to see Dr. Takahashi.

276
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,515
Dr. Takahashi?

277
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,018
<i>Dr. Takahashi is our family physician.</i>

278
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,062
But he will be out of the office today.

279
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,940
He plays soft tennis
every Thursday afternoon.

280
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,443
Even better.

281
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,279
Dr. Takahashi is out of the office
this afternoon.

282
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:02,490
But I made an appointment
to see him today.

283
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,285
Could you check one more time?

284
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,163
- Please wait a moment.
- Sure.

285
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:26,848
Oh, my stomach!

286
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,600
What's wrong?

287
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,229
Are you all right?

288
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,690
- Where does it hurt?
- My stomach!

289
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,900
Hey, Gap-pyeong!

290
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,526
Gap-pyeong!

291
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,488
- Are you all right?
- Gap-pyeong!

292
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:45,074
- It's coming out of my bottom!
- What's coming out of your bottom?

293
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,659
Oh, it hurts!

294
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,077
What's coming out?

295
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,662
- It's coming out!
- Is it?

296
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:57,587
Hang in there!

297
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,422
Are there any doctors? A doctor!

298
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,007
Doctor!

299
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:06,763
Hang in there!

300
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,520
Akiko…

301
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,563
Akiko…

302
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,403
Akiko…

303
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,248
Who are you?

304
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,798
What are you doing here?

305
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:44,843
I…

306
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,221
got a bit lost.

307
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:52,183
If you got lost,
why were you flipping through the records?

308
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,728
A friend of mine
is staying at this hospital,

309
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,189
but I just can't seem to find them.

310
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,072
I can tell you're from Joseon.

311
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,366
Let's not make a scene.

312
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,368
I'll leave quietly.

313
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,414
Is that all right?

314
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:15,999
Why are you here?

315
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,293
Reveal who you are first.

316
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,927
Don't make a scene, she said.

317
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,519
Are you… from Manchuria?

318
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,480
Who are you?

319
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:49,490
The doctor will be here soon.
Hang in there.

320
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,076
I think the doctor's here. He's here!

321
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,333
This should ease his pain for now.

322
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,837
- Take off his jacket!
- Yes, Doctor.

323
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,339
Wait, no!

324
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,673
No…

325
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,216
No, stop!

326
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,384
You can't!

327
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,137
Please don't kill me! Please!

328
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,389
Master, please!

329
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,351
Please, Master…

330
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,019
- Let's hurry!
- Yes, Doctor!

331
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,771
It's okay. You'll feel better soon.

332
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,147
No!

333
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,482
- Gap-pyeong!
- No…

334
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,400
Hey, you! Come here!

335
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,653
Let's not do this!

336
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,531
Come here!

337
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:35,620
Oh, hold on! Hold on a second…

338
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,753
- What?
- The pain's suddenly gone.

339
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:44,754
Really?

340
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,800
How can this be?
My pain is completely gone!

341
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,051
What was that?

342
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,387
It doesn't hurt anymore, Doctor!

343
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,888
That's amazing!

344
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,726
Thank you, sir.
You truly are a skilled doctor!

345
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:09,779
Fascinating.

346
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,576
Were you going to let them
give me that shot?

347
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,578
Well, they didn't.

348
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,625
What was that?

349
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,545
What's going on? Did you hear that?

350
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,838
Please don't be alarmed!

351
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:30,216
The nearby military base
must be holding another target practice.

352
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,263
That's strange. The sound came
from underneath the building.

353
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,764
Let's move for now.

354
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,266
Follow me.

355
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,693
- Why did you open fire?
- We failed to capture it.

356
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,529
Two were attacked
before we approached the door!

357
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,615
One corporal is still alive, sir!

358
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,367
Please help me!

359
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,286
Please help…

360
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:04,751
What should we do?

361
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,510
I'll go and rescue the corporal!

362
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,804
Stay still. Nobody move!

363
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,639
Please let me save him, sir!

364
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:20,808
Be quiet.

365
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,727
Don't move a muscle!

366
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:26,939
This experiment is
of vital importance to us.

367
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:27,857
Understood?

368
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:32,070
Colonel Kato. Over there.

369
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,990
What… is that thing?

370
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,408
Save me!

371
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,368
Please…

372
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,122
Please save me!

373
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,666
Help me!

374
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,918
Please…

375
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,319
Stop it!

376
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,946
No! Stop right there!

377
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,011
She is a goddess.

378
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,770
A goddess has been born!

379
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,684
Hey, what are you doing here?

380
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,394
What is going on?

381
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,980
We will be spending the night here.

382
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,273
What?

383
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,400
What about us? Us too?

384
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:37,737
You will only get in the way,
so I suggest you get out.

385
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,032
At least tell us what's going on.

386
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,370
There is a military ward in the back.

387
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,415
Something very fishy is going on
in the basement.

388
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:53,502
They say Joseon people
from Seodaemun Prison are sent there,

389
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,088
but apparently, none of them

390
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,633
have come back.

391
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,762
Is Myeong-ja in there too?

392
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,139
We're planning to find that out.

393
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,224
What…

394
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,977
Where did you even get that information?

395
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,944
Something's afoot
in the military ward right now.

396
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,862
Why don't you come back another day?

397
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,406
We don't have time for that.

398
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,076
Just lead the way.
We'll take care of the rest.

399
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:34,710
Wait, just…

400
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,049
Just…

401
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,218
Just what is going on right now?

402
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:45,763
What could this janitor
possibly have told you that's--

403
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:50,059
My younger brother was transferred here
from Seodaemun Prison a year ago.

404
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:55,314
He was moved here because of a high fever,
but I've lost contact with him ever since.

405
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,734
I've looked for him,
but he wasn't even on the records here.

406
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,821
Oh dear. So you snuck in here to find him.

407
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,950
Why should we believe you?
You're a complete stranger.

408
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,794
What's that?

409
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,088
It's the sign of the Patriotic Society.

410
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,425
Heck, it's one of the independence groups.

411
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,679
You should head back first.

412
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:31,142
We'll check if Myeong-ja is actually here
and send you a message.

413
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,477
But…

414
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,895
I'm ready.

415
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,397
Follow me.

416
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,066
Hey, wait.

417
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,652
Oh, yeah. Thank you for the clothes.

418
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,988
You know that's not what I meant.

419
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,244
Did you have something else to say?

420
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:53,706
What is it?

421
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:55,833
Say it.

422
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:01,964
Well,

423
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,842
I just…

424
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:10,598
I just think this plan is too reckless,
so I'm saying

425
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:15,186
we should come up with a safer plan.

426
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,063
"Until the cherry blossoms fall."

427
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:22,276
Once cherry blossoms open,
they reach full bloom quickly.

428
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,571
Then they begin to fall
just when you think they've all bloomed.

429
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,783
So we have no time or reason to delay.

430
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,952
Still, it wasn't part of the plan
for you to stay here.

431
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,121
You tailor your principles to situations.

432
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,458
It's only a slight change in plan.
What's the big deal?

433
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,003
Isn't this what you call flexibility?

434
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,008
We'll do our job.

435
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,969
You do yours and look into Sachimoto.

436
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:50,805
All right?

437
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:53,724
Chae-ok.

438
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,142
I'm coming.

439
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:05,778
Wow, those two sure are quick
to take initiative. Right, Master Jang?

440
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,579
Hey, you there!

441
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,707
This area is off-limits to outsiders.

442
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,042
Who are you?

443
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,545
Oh, apologies!

444
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,713
We were only looking for the restroom.

445
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,215
Let us go, Master.

446
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,592
Wait just a minute!

447
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,643
Oh, there you are.

448
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:45,651
I checked, and Dr. Takahashi
is indeed out of the office today.

449
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,529
Oh, is that so?

450
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,990
There must have been a misunderstanding.

451
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,200
Dear me…

452
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,535
Is he a visitor?

453
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,831
Yes, he is Dr. Takahashi's outpatient.

454
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,092
You must leave now.

455
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,721
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

456
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:21,145
All visitors and outpatients
with appointments must leave the premises.

457
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,689
- Why is the military here?
- I repeat.

458
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:24,690
What is going on?

459
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:31,363
All visitors and outpatients
with appointments must leave the premises!

460
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,158
Please exit the building, everyone.

461
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,123
Colonel Kato. Please give the order.

462
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,876
The lab door might break any moment now!

463
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,338
Sir!

464
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,301
We're moving it to Level 4.

465
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,762
Prepare the nitrogen.

466
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:55,888
Yes, sir!

467
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,890
Nitrogen! Bring the nitrogen!

468
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:58,974
Yes, sir!

469
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,192
There's nothing to worry about.

470
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,988
We are moving you to a place
more fitting of a goddess.

471
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,366
What was that about?

472
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,662
I'm sure they will be fine.

473
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,455
They are supposed to be experts.

474
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:25,251
Once they confirm Myeong-ja's in there,
they will get out of there.

475
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:29,255
- About those two…
- Yeah.

476
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:33,384
They seem to take their work
as seriously as I do, right?

477
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,702
NO ENTRY

478
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,538
NO ENTRY

479
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,457
NO ENTRY

480
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,281
Any movement?

481
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,784
None, sir. It seems to be fully asleep.

482
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,580
What are all these, sir?

483
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,417
They seem to be… some kind of spores.

484
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,169
They're anthrax.

485
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:36,882
It's protecting itself even in its sleep.

486
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,134
We're done moving it, sir.

487
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,302
Close the door.

488
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,692
Move it to Level 4.

489
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,736
Don't stop injecting nitrogen
during transportation.

490
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,822
Avoid contact with the spores in the air.

491
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,407
Let us all be careful.

492
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,825
Yes, sir!

493
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:03,742
Start moving!

494
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,112
I guess it's snow.

495
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,491
It melts away quickly.

496
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:25,634
Help!

497
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,927
Marvelous.

498
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,833
Didn't you say the Japanese soldiers
are being treated here?

499
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,169
Most patients stay
on the second and third floors.

500
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:45,797
The first floor has offices,
communications rooms, and liaison offices.

501
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,845
More like a military facility
than a hospital.

502
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:55,515
The security is so tight
that I'm not allowed to go near it.

503
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,102
I only get to go in once every two days
to clean the wards.

504
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,396
Why is that eastern watchtower empty?

505
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,691
A man fell to his death once
because it was too weak.

506
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:08,570
There were talks of renovation,
but it's been neglected since then.

507
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,239
Can you make it to that tower?

508
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,454
It won't be easy,

509
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,206
but I can do it.

510
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,916
- I'll be back.
- Wait.

511
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,295
Hey…

512
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:41,913
Where did she go?

513
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,592
- Quickly!
- Yes, sir!

514
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,103
- What should we do, sir?
- Get ready to move!

515
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,187
- Yes, sir!
- Move out!

516
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,355
Move it!

517
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,440
Quickly!

518
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,109
- Hurry!
- Come on!

519
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,653
- Prepare to move.
- Yes, sir!

520
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,280
- To the basement!
- Yes, sir!

521
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,867
Move along! Quickly!

522
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,179
You're still here?

523
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,603
Talk to me. What is it now?

524
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,148
I simply don't understand why.

525
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:15,483
Why what?

526
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,486
Why it bothers me so much.

527
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,906
What does?

528
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,873
I mean, look at the mess I'm in.

529
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,585
Ishikawa has my life in his hands.

530
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:38,798
If I don't find Myeong-ja,
my entire fortune will be confiscated,

531
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:42,385
and I could even be dragged off to war.

532
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:45,513
Moreover, hyenas and vultures
are circling this shop,

533
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,391
eager to take a bite of whatever they can.

534
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,896
So, why am I so…

535
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,316
bothered by her?

536
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,443
You mean the sleuth girl?

537
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,195
Who?

538
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:01,988
The "her" you just mentioned.

539
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,073
"Her"?

540
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:06,743
Did I just say that?

541
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,411
How unfortunate.

542
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,956
They say there's no cure for lovesickness.

543
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,625
Whoa, lovesickness? Watch what you say!

544
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,252
I'm Jang Tae-sang.

545
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:18,546
All the beautiful girls in this city
couldn't even make me flinch.

546
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,633
Bukchon's hottest guy!
Namchon's number one man!

547
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:23,468
Which proves that you're lovesick.

548
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,055
You turned your nose up
at all those beauties,

549
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:29,557
and look at you now.

550
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,686
Of all the girls,
a sleuth girl stole your heart.

551
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,604
No, it's not like that at all!

552
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,147
What is it, then?

553
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,066
You know…

554
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,279
Well… humanism?

555
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,780
Humanism?

556
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,240
Yes, humanism.

557
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:47,701
Love for mankind.

558
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:54,040
I'm worrying and pondering
purely out of my love for mankind.

559
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:54,958
Got that?

560
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,626
Then there's no need to worry.

561
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,004
I should have dragged her out of there.

562
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:02,757
I shouldn't have left her
at the hospital like that, right?

563
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,010
If you have time to waste,
go find Sachimoto.

564
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:09,347
Standing there worrying
won't change a single thing.

565
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:13,143
Be the man that you are
and show us how you do things your way!

566
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:15,478
Do your part is what I'm saying.

567
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,484
Do you think so?

568
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:25,280
You're right.

569
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,116
Where are you going?

570
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:30,702
I'm off to do my part my way.

571
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:49,220
What gives?

572
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:54,517
I refuse to drive you around anymore.

573
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:59,773
Okay. All right. Just write this down.

574
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,817
Sachimoto. A Japanese male in his mid-30s.

575
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,029
Write it down.

576
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,407
A professional painter.

577
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:12,660
Ask Commissioner Ishikawa
to search for such a man

578
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,330
among the residents of Gyeongseong.

579
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:19,542
This is crucial to finding Myeong-ja,
so he needs to be thorough, understand?

580
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,710
- Yes.
- Okay!

581
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,145
Enjoy.

582
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,117
Who are you drawing?

583
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:57,622
My apologies.

584
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,042
The woman in the drawing
looked like she was from Joseon.

585
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:06,506
How can you tell?

586
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,759
The parting of her hair.

587
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,180
Is that right?

588
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,518
You are very skilled at drawing.

589
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:21,187
I guess you're a painter?

590
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,117
Breaking news!

591
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,619
Ongseong Hospital
will be closed indefinitely!

592
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:39,706
Ongseong Hospital closes indefinitely
due to an unknown contagion!

593
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,291
- Choi was right.
- Breaking news!

594
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,668
- This is about yesterday.
- Breaking news!

595
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:47,422
- It will be closed indefinitely!
- Breaking news!

596
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:48,923
It's an unknown contagion!

597
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:52,010
ONGSEONG HOSPITAL CLOSED INDEFINITELY
POSSIBLY DUE TO CONTAGIOUS DISEASE

598
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,141
Get off now!

599
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,685
Hurry! Move your feet!

600
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:02,437
Faster!

601
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,646
Build the barricades.

602
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,482
I said, hurry up!

603
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,941
Get off! Move them quickly!

604
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:09,569
CLOSED

605
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:10,695
Speed it up!

606
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:34,260
What are you talking about?
The hospital's surrounded by soldiers?

607
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:38,848
No one can get in from the outside,
and no one can get out from the inside.

608
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,851
They even had machine guns.
It looks pretty serious, sir.

609
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:44,812
No word from the sleuths yet?

610
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:47,774
I don't think
they made it out of the hospital.

611
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,866
Master Jang. Where are you going?

612
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,326
Want me to come with you?

613
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,662
Go after him already.

614
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:02,705
Okay! I was about to!

615
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:22,267
I checked, and Dr. Takahashi
is indeed out of the office today.

616
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,060
What brings you here?

617
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,487
WE FOUND MYEONG-JA

618
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:38,074
What about the person
who gave this to you?

619
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,243
They are still inside.

620
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,288
I managed to escape

621
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,707
before the hospital
got completely shut down,

622
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,293
just as dawn broke.

623
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,046
Those people, are they safe?

624
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,174
I don't know.

625
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:58,970
Is it true that an infectious disease
has spread in there?

626
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:01,681
I don't know.

627
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,600
Please be honest with me!

628
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:07,186
What's going on in there right now?

629
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,147
I don't know either!

630
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,029
Last night…

631
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,617
so many people died at the hospital.

632
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,955
<i>Countless people lost their lives.</i>

633
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:28,041
<i>I don't know why.</i>

634
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,335
<i>And there's no way I can find out.</i>

635
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,130
Why you?

636
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:39,093
Why did you bring this note to me?
Answer me.

637
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:58,029
Horrific things are happening
inside Ongseong Hospital right now.

638
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:02,075
People are dying like crazy,
but we don't know why.

639
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:07,080
My comrades attempted
to find out the truth multiple times…

640
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:11,167
but no one made it back.

641
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,463
This time

642
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:17,965
may be no exception.

643
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,806
WE FOUND MYEONG-JA

644
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:54,377
- Mr. Gu.
- Yes, go on.

645
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,672
I'm afraid I have to go in there myself.

646
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,006
Go in where?

647
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:01,843
- Ongseong Hospital.
- Master Jang!

648
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:03,428
- Master.
- Master?

649
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:06,389
Get everything ready.

650
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:08,766
I'm going in.

651
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,482
<i>Stuck in my head</i>

652
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,735
<i>I've been searchin' for the reason</i>

653
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,239
<i>Nameless longing</i>

654
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:25,742
<i>I've been waitin' for you for so long</i>

655
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:28,745
<i>But got no direction</i>

656
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:31,247
<i>No matter I wanna reach you</i>

657
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:33,458
<i>Another way you runnin'</i>

658
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,042
<i>Goin' on and on</i>

659
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,919
<i>But need a way to get to you</i>

660
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,382
<i>You</i>

661
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:44,552
<i>You know I'm so stuck with you</i>

662
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:45,511
<i>No, oh, oh, oh</i>

663
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,388
<i>You</i>

664
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,558
<i>Babe, I don't care at all</i>

665
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:53,561
<i>You'll never know what I could do</i>

666
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:56,314
<i>You'll never know</i>
<i>What we could have been</i>

667
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:59,317
<i>For you</i>
<i>No, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

668
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,402
<i>Do you know</i>

669
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:02,528
<i>Oh, no</i>

670
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,071
<i>All the way I found you here</i>

671
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:07,325
<i>Oh, I'll be right back for you</i>

672
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:08,409
<i>Oh, no</i>

673
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,161
<i>All the way I found you here</i>

674
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,331
<i>Oh, I'll be right back for you</i>

675
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:14,874
<i>Oh, no</i>

676
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:21,756
<i>Chasing the lights</i>
<i>Even don't know where I'm goin'</i>

677
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:26,219
<i>Losing my sight</i>

678
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,805
<i>Hope you know that</i>
<i>What I'm lookin' for</i>

679
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:31,724
<i>But got no direction</i>

680
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,268
<i>No matter I wanna reach you</i>

681
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:38,147
<i>Another way you runnin'</i>
<i>Goin' on and on</i>

682
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,066
<i>But need a way to get to you</i>

683
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:46,155
<i>Ride on a paper plane</i>

684
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:51,911
<i>Sandcastles on a seaside</i>

685
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:54,372
<i>Don't scare me at all</i>

686
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:57,291
<i>If I can get on with you forever</i>

687
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:00,586
<i>Just wanna be there</i>
<i>With you forever</i>

688
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:04,340
<i>How beauty miserable us</i>

689
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:06,425
<i>Let me keep on</i>

690
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,636
<i>Know, what I could do</i>

691
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:11,347
<i>You'll never know</i>
<i>What we could have been</i>

692
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:14,308
<i>For you</i>
<i>No, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

693
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:16,352
<i>Do you know</i>

694
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:17,436
<i>Oh, no</i>

695
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,146
<i>All the way I found you here</i>

696
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:22,358
<i>Oh, I'll be right back for you</i>

697
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:23,359
<i>Oh, no</i>

698
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:25,319
<i>All the way I found you here</i>

699
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,322
<i>Oh, I'll be right back for you</i>

700
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:29,907
<i>Oh, no</i>

701
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:34,328
<i>Lead me to the way towards you</i>

702
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:41,586
<i>I've been waitin' for so long</i>
<i>I'm ready to run to you</i>

703
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:45,381
<i>Reason for another reason</i>

704
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:49,051
<i>Now I'm so sick of waitin'</i>

705
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:51,304
<i>Voices in my head</i>

706
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:54,432
<i>Mess around in my mind</i>

707
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:56,601
<i>Know, what I could do</i>

708
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:59,353
<i>You'll never know</i>
<i>What we could have been</i>

709
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:02,231
<i>For you</i>
<i>No, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

710
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,358
<i>Do you know</i>

711
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:05,610
<i>Oh, no</i>

712
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:08,571
<i>You'll never know</i>
<i>What I could do</i>

713
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:11,407
