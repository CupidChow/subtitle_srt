1
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:03,878
What do you think?

2
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:06,965
I did the right thing, didn't I?

3
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:13,054
I think I did the right thing.

4
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,228
I don't know.

5
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:04,814
<i>There are roughly</i>
<i>around 14 million people in Metro Manila</i>

6
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:09,277
<i>and the public transport system</i>
<i>in the capital region, includes</i>

7
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,825
<i>buses, jeepneys, tricycles,</i>
<i>taxis and the rail transit systems.</i>

8
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:20,038
<i>But what choice do we have?</i>

9
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:24,542
<i>I spend around four to five hours</i>
<i>in traffic a day.</i>

10
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,836
<i>That's 20 to 25 hours a week.</i>

11
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,005
<i>At least 80 hours a month.</i>

12
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,591
<i>960 hours a year.</i>

13
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,927
<i>This is the reality for most Filipinos.</i>

14
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,136
<i>Shit, right?</i>

15
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,971
<i>I'm from Quezon City.</i>

16
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,265
<i>I'm from Alabang.</i>

17
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,208
@Tino, you got the job?
Down for Tagaytay?

18
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,325
No more seats?

19
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,014
Thank you.

20
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,475
Wait…

21
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,685
Wait up!

22
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:06,853
Sorry about that.

23
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,107
- Hi.
- Hi, sir.

24
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,984
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

25
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,527
Thank you.

26
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,121
I'm sorry, I was here first.

27
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,041
Actually, I got here first.

28
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,459
That's my bag.

29
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,880
My coffee.

30
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,006
Really?

31
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,387
Drink up, "Tita Babes."

32
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,447
I have a meeting.

33
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,199
Sorry.

34
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,618
You know what, it's okay.

35
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,789
Share a seat and win a friend.

36
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,377
Or not.

37
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,338
<i>- Good morning.</i>
- Hi! Sorry!

38
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,757
Sorry, I'm two minutes late. Yes.

39
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,260
The traffic was bad.

40
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,011
Well, good morning.

41
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,721
Thank you so much for your time.

42
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,640
Call me Aica, please.

43
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:28,601
<i>- Introduce yourself.</i>
- My course is communication,

44
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:34,691
but now I'm here
in the marketing industry for a year now.

45
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,152
<i>- And five years from now?</i>
- Well, five years from now,

46
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:44,325
I see myself as a producer
for news and documentaries.

47
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,368
You know…

48
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:50,206
Going to new places, telling stories
of people who deserve to be heard.

49
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:56,004
But I'm on a new journey now
and I'm embracing the new path.

50
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,383
And, you know,
I'm very goal-oriented and honest.

51
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,096
- What a liar.
- Sorry?

52
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,931
<i>Are you with someone right now?</i>

53
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,392
No, it's just really noisy here.

54
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,643
<i>We're done.</i>

55
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,020
- That's it?
<i>- Yes.</i>

56
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,689
Thank you so much for your time.
Thank you so much.

57
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,190
<i>- Okay!</i>
- I'll be waiting.

58
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,275
Thank you.

59
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,696
What's your deal?

60
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:22,905
Do we know each other?

61
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,240
You think you're honest?

62
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,200
Seriously.

63
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,079
Your answers are obviously rehearsed.

64
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,206
There.

65
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,625
I can see it in your eyes.

66
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,880
I'm glad that I won't ever see you again.

67
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:44,927
Miss!

68
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,597
Your coffee.

69
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,481
Right where you left it.

70
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,780
Have a good day, Tita Babes.

71
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:13,790
Shit.

72
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,125
Okay.

73
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,044
Was he handsome?

74
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,253
He was nosy.

75
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,798
You didn't answer the question.

76
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,759
Honey, Aica did not answer.

77
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,303
But what were you doing at a coffee shop?

78
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,514
Aren't you stingy?

79
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,557
I needed the Wi-Fi.

80
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,059
Then someone bothered me.

81
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:36,604
Anyway, when is the design team's
new hire starting?

82
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:40,066
I need banners and a screen display.

83
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,819
I think that's him.

84
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,248
Hi.

85
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,007
Aics, this is Tino.

86
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,801
He's our new designer.

87
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,594
You're so lucky, Tino.

88
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,722
She's one of the most loyal employees
in the company.

89
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,516
Take it from here, Aica.

90
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,602
I have to get back to work. Bye.

91
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,693
Nice to meet you, most loyal,

92
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,778
Tita Babes.

93
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,906
I mean, Miss Aica.

94
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,624
So…

95
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,917
This is Accounting.

96
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:44,172
Stay on their good side
so they'll speed up your budget approvals

97
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,716
and pay you on time.

98
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,510
This is the Quiet room.
You see, they're all quiet.

99
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,888
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.

100
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:56,476
This is the HR Department.
I think they're on break now.

101
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,019
And over here…

102
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,187
There.

103
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,773
We put up these posters last year

104
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,026
but I didn't really like them.

105
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,527
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

106
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,571
- The papers, okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

107
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,739
Thanks.

108
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,451
Let's make them more modern.

109
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,120
You know? More pleasing to the eyes.

110
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,330
- I don't like them.
- Hi.

111
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,582
- Got it.
- Good morning!

112
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,084
The cafeteria is upstairs.

113
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,587
The food is affordable and delicious, so…

114
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,339
The food isn't free?

115
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,925
Nothing's free in this world.

116
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,593
Now, we have this…

117
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,763
So, this is our standee.

118
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,558
I'm not sold on this.
Feels like it's lacking something.

119
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,770
You might come up
with some ideas to improve it.

120
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,189
I planned to put a standee here

121
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,192
so our clients can see our Mother's Room.

122
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:52,949
All marketing materials,
like banners, posters, presentations,

123
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,617
will be handled by Design.

124
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,661
- Okay.
- Basically, we're like partners.

125
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,831
But you're planning to resign…

126
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,086
We never saw each other, okay?

127
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,837
You heard nothing.

128
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,506
Tita Babes doesn't exist.

129
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,632
Are we clear?

130
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,592
Yes, boss.

131
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,261
One last tip.

132
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,638
Miss Dina is the head of Marketing.

133
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,266
She's a grumpy workaholic,

134
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,184
but make her laugh and you'll be fine.

135
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,730
She must be the reason
you're looking for a new job…

136
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,442
- Good morning, Aica.
- Good morning, ma'am.

137
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,319
- Tino, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

138
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,613
Yes, I interviewed you.

139
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,907
I'm Dina David, the VP for Marketing

140
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,952
and I trust that Aica's
teaching you the ropes.

141
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,453
Yes, ma'am.

142
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,497
Okay then, carry on.

143
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,166
- Have a good day, ma'am.
- Okay.

144
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,337
She's nice. She's just grumpy around you.

145
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,422
Whatever!

146
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,528
Aica.

147
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,032
Check on Mom.

148
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,509
Let me do it.

149
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,095
It's fine.

150
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,600
- Let me.
- It's fine.

151
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,144
I'll do it, I'm almost done.

152
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,104
I just have something in my eye.

153
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,900
Are you sure?

154
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,402
How come you're sniffling, too, Mom?

155
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,820
Something in your eye?

156
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,781
Don't let me catch you drinking later.

157
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,699
I haven't drunk in a long time.

158
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,453
What did I tell you?
Let's just focus on baking.

159
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,706
Don't cry over people who aren't worth it.

160
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,583
I got this.

161
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,585
No matter what,

162
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,587
he's still your dad.

163
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,258
Really?

164
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,428
Seems like being a dad
is just an option for him.

165
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,473
He comes home
when it's convenient for him.

166
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,517
Aren't you tired of him?

167
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:29,355
You'll understand when you fall in love.

168
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,025
Fall in love?

169
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:34,860
Please, Mom.

170
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,947
The only "love" I know are the beloved

171
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,410
cost of rice, living, breathing…

172
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:46,080
Bea, make sure to save
your allowances, okay?

173
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,873
Dental school is expensive.

174
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,458
Don't you worry, Aica.

175
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,003
When you get old, I'll do your dentures.

176
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,547
Let me see.

177
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,590
I'll use Ivocap.

178
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,717
Why don't you do it now?

179
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,344
Maybe she'll smile more.

180
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,931
She scares men off,
that's why she's single.

181
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,391
- Mom…
- Do it now.

182
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,227
Mom, I know someone
who's not afraid of Aica.

183
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,979
- Who?
- Raf.

184
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,231
- No way! Shut up!
- Listen!

185
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,775
Even if you lose your teeth,
he'll still love you.

186
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,068
No.

187
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,112
- Bea…
- No, listen…

188
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,254
Sorry, sorry.

189
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,805
Sir?

190
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,015
Okay.

191
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,726
Thank you.

192
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:06,076
This is a Tier Three client,
so let's use their colors.

193
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,830
They're on our top ten priorities.

194
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,625
Wait, you're nodding a lot.

195
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,709
Are you okay?

196
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:19,006
Yeah, I'll do whatever you ask.

197
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,090
- Go on.
- Hey!

198
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,427
An explanation won't cost you.

199
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,389
I'd love to know
how you came up with that design.

200
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,353
No, I'm good.

201
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,772
Not "good." It should be "very good."

202
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,857
I want to hear your thoughts.

203
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,984
Okay…

204
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:43,906
The standee character holding a banner
feels a bit outdated to me.

205
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:48,452
Perfect! Now I know
what's going on in your head.

206
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,416
Yes. And…

207
00:13:56,001 --> 00:14:00,089
we could also put a flag
instead of a banner

208
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,590
to keep it relevant.

209
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,092
Right.

210
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:07,972
So that way, we can still use your design.

211
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,181
Right?

212
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,599
You're right.

213
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,767
Good job.

214
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:16,355
Two orders of premium assorted sandwiches.

215
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,608
Didn't the client request for <i>halal</i> meals?

216
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,069
Will you be paying for all of them?

217
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,989
Why didn't you let me know sooner

218
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:29,618
so we could have canceled the order?

219
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,705
Miss Dina, it's my fault.

220
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,249
As her superior,
I should have double-checked.

221
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,501
Any thoughts on how to solve this?

222
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:41,881
I was thinking,
since we have another client coming,

223
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,800
maybe we can just switch the food?

224
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,387
Okay, that's fine with me.

225
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,473
Gotta rush, lots of meetings. Bye.

226
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,892
Hey.

227
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,854
Don't be scared next time.

228
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,940
You can speak up, all right?
It won't hurt.

229
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:04,403
You're the only one
that can express what's on your mind.

230
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,072
Thank you.

231
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:44,068
This guy said he didn't want flute panels.

232
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,528
And then… Surprise!

233
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,281
After 24 hours, he chose the flute panel.

234
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,409
Your dad will be super happy
and proud of you, son.

235
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,830
And you, Tara, please put your phone down.

236
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,415
- Hi, Tino.
- Hey.

237
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,003
Was it hard to book a ride?

238
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,381
I told you to ride with me.

239
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,632
I'm here.

240
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,926
How's your first week?

241
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,469
It's okay.

242
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,637
Work.

243
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:12,972
Normal.

244
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,474
Wow, so nonchalant.

245
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,768
Come on, Tino.

246
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,937
Please, I need you to grow up.

247
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,897
This is the real world.

248
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,525
If you're not happy with your job,

249
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:28,195
why don't you just take
the board and join the firm?

250
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,656
Your dad's getting old.

251
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,325
He can't always be the one traveling.

252
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:37,121
And besides, your brother
is practically drowning in work

253
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,456
because he's trying
to do everything alone.

254
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,000
Help him out.

255
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,711
I can manage, Mom. Easy.

256
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:48,549
I'm just saying,
don't let your degree go to waste.

257
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,843
I'll do it, Mom.

258
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,429
Improve your Filipino first.

259
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,223
None of you are fluent.

260
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:02,104
If you can reduce your four F's,

261
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,856
you might stand a chance.

262
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,983
Well, at least I have F's,

263
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,903
unlike Tino who has none at all.

264
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,698
"F" as in "feelings."

265
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,535
Tino, aren't you interested
in anyone at all?

266
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,537
Not even a crush?

267
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,259
Hey, I have a list of revisions.

268
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,094
Wait, can I check this?

269
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,058
What's up with her?

270
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,685
Who? Aica?

271
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,811
Yes, why…

272
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,522
Why is she always so busy?

273
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,691
She's the breadwinner of her family.

274
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,527
That's why all she does is work.

275
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,533
Can't hardworking people smile?

276
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,204
Why? You want to make her smile?

277
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,538
Wow.

278
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,457
- No, not really.
- Really?

279
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,125
I'm just saying.

280
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,045
She's single if that's what you're asking.

281
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,881
But a lot of guys are into her,

282
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:14,551
so if you want her to notice you,

283
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,261
do your job really well.

284
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,347
Revisions.

285
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,488
Wait.

286
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,451
- Aica!
- Granny…

287
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,621
Here are the baking pans
I borrowed. Thank you.

288
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,705
Sure.

289
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,125
Aica, it's late.
Why are you still working?

290
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,836
That's just how it is.

291
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,003
Do you know that?

292
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,131
- Whoa.
- Hey! Stop that!

293
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,091
You smell awful.

294
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,677
Look who's talking!

295
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,054
Why do you even work there?

296
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,557
There are job opportunities
here in the south.

297
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,517
You can even do remote work.

298
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,477
You talk too much.

299
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,272
Do you even have any idea
how hard it is to find a job?

300
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,485
All Raf wants to say is
he wants you near him.

301
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,614
Granny, please.
Raf and I grew up together.

302
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,576
- Right.
- That's the point.

303
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,995
You know each other so well.

304
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,957
Remember when you used
to play in the rain together?

305
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,209
Raf always wanted to be naked.

306
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,212
- Granny, time for you to rest.
- Excuse me?

307
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,506
- Yes, Granny.
- You might be tired now.

308
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,757
- Yes.
- I think so, too.

309
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,842
- Rest.
- Let's rest.

310
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,094
- Thank you.
- Love you, Granny.

311
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,221
- See you.
- Let's go, Granny.

312
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,891
- Let's go.
- You talk too much.

313
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,314
On behalf of the management,

314
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:54,443
we would like to thank all of you
for all your hard work.

315
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,112
We would not have landed this client

316
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,657
without the contribution
of each and every one of you.

317
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,619
So give yourselves a round of applause

318
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,914
and enjoy your pizza.

319
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,083
By the way,
I know most of you have met him

320
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,878
but I'd like to formally
introduce him to the team.

321
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,589
Tino… This is Tino Guerra.

322
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,507
Welcome to our company.

323
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,303
Okay so, I'm counting my calories.

324
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,472
Just have your pizza, okay?

325
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,848
And eat it, too.

326
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,767
Bye, guys. Bye.

327
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,935
Aica, let's go.

328
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,938
Remember? Pre-final deck?
We have to review that.

329
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,191
It's due by the end of the week. Come on!

330
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,237
Get some pizza.

331
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,113
I'll eat later.

332
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,699
Can't Aica eat first?

333
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,202
No way.

334
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:48,747
Ms. Dina is always buying us
overworked slaves off with pizza.

335
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,791
You're a Guerra, right?

336
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,295
Like Architect Deo Guerra?

337
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,800
Damn…

338
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,969
You're some big shot, Tino.

339
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:07,224
Oh, no, my dad is big time.

340
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,392
Not me.

341
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,478
So, Tino…

342
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,523
How's your parents' relationship?

343
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:19,403
Maybe you're looking for a stepmom,
or a sister-in-law?

344
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,656
You already have a foreign boyfriend.
You're embarrassing.

345
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,616
Like, for real.

346
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,870
Welcome to the company, Tino.

347
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,331
Thank you.

348
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:48,932
Here.

349
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,644
Thanks.

350
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,485
You work as if you'll inherit
this company.

351
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,154
You would know.

352
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,242
I guess news travels fast.

353
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:14,041
I won't be inheriting anything, though,
since I'm not an architect.

354
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,506
Why are you working so hard anyway?

355
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,971
Aren't you already
looking for another job?

356
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,641
I turned down their offer.
The salary was low,

357
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:36,396
and they didn't seem to consider
my year of experience.

358
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:40,692
And why would I let someone else
do my job when I do it so well?

359
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,363
Hold on, my sister's calling.

360
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,699
Hello?

361
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,201
<i>Aica, about Mom and Dad…</i>

362
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,245
<i>- Mom and Dad are fighting again.</i>
- What about Mom?

363
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,455
<i>Raf said so.</i>

364
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,832
<i>I'm still in school.</i>

365
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,627
I'll take care of it.
I'm on my way home. Bye.

366
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,295
Wait. It's an emergency.

367
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,506
How do you go home?

368
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,924
By commuting.

369
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,895
Over here.

370
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,772
- Here?
- Yes, thanks.

371
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:22,859
I'll send you the payment
for the toll and that other thing--

372
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,402
- It's nothing.
- Thank you!

373
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,739
- Focus on yourself first.
- You should head home. Please.

374
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,325
Thank you. Bye.

375
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,538
I was planning to pay.

376
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,331
I'm not a thief.

377
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,999
I was the one who got robbed.

378
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,168
It was a scam.

379
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,504
Are you leaving again?

380
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,423
You think this house is a bank?

381
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,301
Are you going to spend all your money
on your women again?

382
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,804
- Answer me, Noel!
- Mom, that's enough.

383
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,722
We're talking about business.

384
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,267
What mistress?

385
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:59,271
- Who else?
- There's no one! You never believe me!

386
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:03,900
- All you do is nag!
- Because you're never around!

387
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:04,943
Nagging!

388
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,903
Dad, if you want leave, just leave.

389
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,280
I will!

390
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,573
Then go!

391
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,699
Don't come back!

392
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,368
- Mom…
- Go ahead! Don't come back!

393
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:15,912
- I'm leaving.
- Leave!

394
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:20,709
You give us nothing but headaches.

395
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,002
It never ends!

396
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,253
Never!

397
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,671
Leave!

398
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,052
What are you doing here?

399
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,680
I'm not here.

400
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,475
Look at that.

401
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:42,189
We've only just met, and you already
saw how dramatic my life is.

402
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,653
Don't feel sorry for me, please.

403
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,914
Don't worry about it.

404
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,208
What are you doing?

405
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,835
Tino's not here, right?

406
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,754
You can talk to me in the meantime.

407
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,423
You're crazy.

408
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:11,760
Seriously.

409
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,512
I don't feel sorry for you.

410
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:20,393
But I'm feeling a little
ashamed of myself.

411
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,731
What am I even doing with my life?

412
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,193
I hope to have the same

413
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,819
drive,

414
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,031
competence, passion.

415
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,201
Wow.

416
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:40,330
That sounded like a performance appraisal.

417
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,959
That's almost an excellent score.

418
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,628
Then let's add in teamwork, too.

419
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,219
You should go home. It's late.

420
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,138
Now, she's kicking me out.

421
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,892
By the way…

422
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,310
Thank you.

423
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,355
You weren't here, okay?

424
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,236
Yes, he's not here.

425
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,572
Okay, go now. It's late.

426
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,283
Let me just finish this.

427
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,951
- Is that okay?
- What?

428
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,911
It's so good. Let's not waste it.

429
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,037
Okay.

430
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:24,541
If you don't leave,
I'll wipe this on your face.

431
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,668
Whoa! Hey! Okay, fine.

432
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,296
Go home. It's late.

433
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,463
Wait!

434
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,510
- Go home.
- As if the icing earlier wasn't enough.

435
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,431
Don't go home looking like that. Hold on!

436
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,349
- Since you're already home…
- Hey!

437
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,310
Tino!

438
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,979
Who's Tino? There's no Tino here.

439
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,277
That weirdo.

440
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:05,290
When you slept for only two hours
but you need to go to work.

441
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,102
We don't have time for that.

442
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,188
We've got bills to pay.

443
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,627
- Tita Babes.
- "Babes."

444
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,420
- He gave her coffee.
- So cute.

445
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,588
Up late last night.

446
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,465
Up late again tonight.

447
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:57,926
Why were you up late?

448
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,804
You're so cute, Tita Babes.

449
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,864
Aica!

450
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,073
Huh?

451
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,701
Glad I caught you.

452
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:08,246
I've emailed the study
for the merch items.

453
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,498
Okay, sure.

454
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,624
I'll check later.

455
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,918
No, it's okay. Just do it tomorrow.

456
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,336
Are you heading home?

457
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:16,921
I'll go with you.

458
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,466
What? But you…

459
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,594
You don't even commute.

460
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:25,513
You're going to Quezon City,
and I'm headed to Alabang.

461
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,518
How did you know?

462
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,855
Hey. Maybe you stalked me.

463
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:37,400
- I'm a stalker?
- You look like a stalker.

464
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,777
You've got some nerve.

465
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,821
Which one of us sent a friend request?

466
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,324
Why haven't you accepted it?

467
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,368
We've been working together for a month.

468
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,287
Aren't we friends yet?

469
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:53,249
You can't consider
all your co-workers as friends.

470
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:56,211
There are boundaries.

471
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,593
What if I make a LinkedIn account?

472
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,304
Will you accept my invite?

473
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:09,140
Will you let me in?

474
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,268
No! Get off the boundary.

475
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,188
But seriously, how are you?

476
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,940
How's work so far?

477
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,691
I'm getting the hang of it.

478
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,819
I learned from the best.

479
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,988
My boss… You…

480
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:29,035
I mean you, Angel and Issa.

481
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:35,875
You keep thanking us.

482
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,711
Why don't you pay us instead?

483
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:42,215
Accept my friend request,
so you can send me a QR code.

484
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,425
Look, I'll pay now.

485
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,512
I was kidding, you idiot!

486
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,055
I was joking.

487
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,307
You rich people…

488
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,685
I'm going home.

489
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,103
Bye-bye.

490
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,325
<i>Hey, don't blame me</i>
<i>if you can't book a ride later.</i>

491
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,911
Which city is halfway
between north and south?

492
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,001
Is it Cubao?

493
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,377
Cubao?

494
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,503
Wrong.

495
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:24,591
Mandaluyong and Ortigas
is the halfway point of QC and Alabang.

496
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,843
You little flirts.

497
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,607
Tino?

498
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,110
Here.

499
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,614
<i>You northies are unfair.</i>

500
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,407
<i>We always come to you.</i>

501
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:55,204
Well, that guy said Ortigas-Mandaluyong
is the halfway point…

502
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,999
No way! It's Makati.

503
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,168
See? Right?

504
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,794
That's too far.

505
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,671
You're obviously a southie.

506
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,759
Don't you know that it takes twice as long
to go from Quezon City to Mandaluyong

507
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,345
as it does from Mandaluyong to the south?

508
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,180
That's why this is the halfway.

509
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,474
No need to get worked up about it.

510
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,225
Fine, then.

511
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,144
<i>How many partners have you had?</i>

512
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,812
<i>Be honest.</i>

513
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,023
- Me?
- Yes.

514
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,276
Be honest.

515
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,947
Wait, I'm thinking
which ones were official.

516
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,531
Wow, that many?

517
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,533
No, the rest are just flings.

518
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,618
Fling?

519
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:34,953
Yes, just flirting.

520
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,330
So, you're some playboy?

521
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,374
How scary.

522
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:47,173
<i>This large</i> kwek-kwek <i>is delicious.</i>

523
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,299
Large <i>kwek-kwek?</i>

524
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,177
- What large <i>kwek-kwek?</i>
- This one.

525
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,764
Look at it, it's huge.

526
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:55,890
Look at it.

527
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,642
- You idiot!
- Small and large.

528
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,394
That's not a large <i>kwek-kwek.</i>

529
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,355
They don't come in sizes like fries do.

530
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,274
That's called <i>tokneneng.</i>

531
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:09,278
My family is nothing compared to yours.

532
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,698
Sure, we're fine.

533
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,158
We're not struggling financially.

534
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:20,707
But I don't really feel like
they're my family.

535
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:24,293
Aside from my little sister,
she's a sweetie.

536
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,548
Hold on.

537
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,216
Your balls are delicious.

538
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,053
I have to buy something in Ayala.

539
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,932
In Ayala?

540
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:45,815
There's a mall right here, it's huge.

541
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,817
You couldn't find what you needed there?

542
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,069
Shop here instead.

543
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:55,742
It's not that they're trying
to make me feel small.

544
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,161
It's just how I feel.

545
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:01,289
I feel like I have to prove myself

546
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:06,919
because I still don't know
what I want to do with my life.

547
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:10,173
Grab your large <i>kwek-kwek.</i>

548
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,549
You mean my balls?

549
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,176
Here they are.

550
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:21,350
Seriously. I mean…

551
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,686
I don't know. I hope…

552
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,397
you find what you're looking for.

553
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,525
I hope you don't settle for "okay."

554
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:36,616
You have to live. Not just survive.

555
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,049
<i>You don't have to take me home.</i>

556
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:57,053
This is my way of thanking you
for helping me get regularized.

557
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,598
You just want me all to yourself.

558
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,573
Aica, actually…

559
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,035
I want to ask you something.

560
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,914
But I'm not here.

561
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,501
What?

562
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,759
I was just wondering…

563
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:42,056
if you wanted to take this
to the next level?

564
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,065
What do you mean?

565
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,776
Well…

566
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,778
Do you want to make it official?

567
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,446
You know…

568
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,575
May I kiss the bride?

569
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,610
<i>So, you'll leave me, too.</i>

570
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,742
<i>Honestly, I don't understand</i>

571
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,745
<i>what I've done wrong.</i>

572
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,539
<i>Where we went wrong.</i>

573
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,709
We could've talked about this.

574
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,721
Happy anniversary, babes.

575
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:46,973
I miss you.

576
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,434
Happy anniversary. Thanks for the flowers.

577
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:55,273
- You lucky girl.
- He's so nice.

578
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,817
Hi, Tino. We miss you.

579
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,153
The five months you're gone
feels like five years. I swear.

580
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,489
Sorry I left you guys.

581
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:07,493
Issa, I heard you made
an internal transfer.

582
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,787
Congratulations!

583
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,248
Thank you! Work hard, play hard, girl.

584
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:16,127
Tino, why not swing by Ortigas
instead of making these video calls?

585
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,586
- Right.
- You're in Ayala.

586
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,088
- You're in Ayala, right?
- Hey!

587
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,257
This is not a long-distance relationship.

588
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,467
Don't worry, Tino will pick me up later.

589
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,593
Right?

590
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,013
Keep your word, Tino.

591
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,139
- Come on.
- Show up.

592
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,515
- Bring snacks.
- See you.

593
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,017
I have to get back.

594
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,184
Okay, bye.

595
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,269
- Bye.
- I love you.

596
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,395
Photographer's here.

597
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,022
Okay…

598
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,148
MJ?

599
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,694
He's good. Confident.

600
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:42,778
I like him.

601
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,157
Didn't I tell you, sir?

602
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:50,870
We need the product to have…

603
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,459
Tino?

604
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:44,215
I thought it was your second anniversary
with Auntie Aica today?

605
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:45,966
Right.

606
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,635
My God…

607
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,471
- Aica would be so mad.
- I can get there.

608
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:54,433
You'll never reach
your third anniversary at this point.

609
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,810
I'm going.

610
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,405
What's going on?

611
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,282
Let's check the map.

612
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,080
See, there was an accident.

613
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,751
Sorry, babes.

614
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,214
It's not your fault, okay? It's okay.

615
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,510
Let's just reschedule for next time.

616
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,804
Are you sure?

617
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,055
Yeah.

618
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:34,974
Super super sure.

619
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,392
Super super sure?

620
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:42,022
It's not your fault that this happened.
No one could have predicted this.

621
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:45,276
Besides, I'm happy with this.

622
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,323
I'm still really sorry
my plan fell through.

623
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,741
It's okay.

624
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,327
Let me take you home.

625
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,706
You're sleepy?

626
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,167
No, I'm fine.

627
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,002
"No, I'm fine."

628
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:05,754
I can still manage.

629
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,300
Spend the night at my place.

630
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,552
It's dangerous to drive
when you're sleepy.

631
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,095
No.

632
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,513
I'm not sleepy.

633
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,391
Yeah, right.

634
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,310
- I'm serious.
- I can manage, see?

635
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:21,312
Don't drive if you're sleepy.

636
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,106
I won't, I promise.

637
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,070
Tino?

638
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:32,990
Tino.

639
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,834
Good morning, babes.

640
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:45,336
Surprise.

641
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,259
At least I had the sense not to drive

642
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,512
all the way back when I was sleepy.

643
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:59,058
I didn't have to pay
for toll and gas, either.

644
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,645
Drive you to work?

645
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,443
Hello, Angel? Yes, I'm sorry.
I got held up in traffic.

646
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,029
Yes, I'm on my way.
I'll run when I get there.

647
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,118
I'm sorry, babes.

648
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,414
I didn't mean to make you worry.

649
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:27,795
I thought that I could
handle it last night.

650
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:32,508
I just didn't know
I was that tired from work.

651
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,762
I'm really sorry, babes.

652
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,433
Aren't you happy
that I'm driving you to work?

653
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,310
You're going to be late.

654
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,105
I'm working from home.

655
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,649
They're trying this new setup.

656
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,818
Haven't we talked about this?

657
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:55,739
We should know
how to balance love and career.

658
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:59,368
If either one suffers in the end,
then we have to choose.

659
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:02,746
I choose love.

660
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:07,668
I'm kidding. You're being too harsh.

661
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,169
I'm being practical.

662
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,797
Yeah, I get it.

663
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,844
But we can make this work, right?

664
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,262
Eyes on the road.

665
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:27,187
You're giving up on me?

666
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:28,814
Really?

667
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:32,735
Aren't you madly in love with me?

668
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,447
So annoying.

669
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,622
It's nobody's fault.

670
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,167
Nobody.

671
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,635
Yes, Auntie?

672
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:58,844
<i>Are you with Tino?</i>

673
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,763
No, he went home last night.

674
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,181
<i>He's not here. Can you…</i>

675
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,141
Yes, sure.

676
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,188
- Ma'am?
<i>- Where's the deck?</i>

677
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,065
- I'll send it ASAP.
<i>- Make it quick!</i>

678
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,274
Yes, ma'am.

679
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:16,862
It's a miracle you're still here!
You're never late for work.

680
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,156
Raf, did you see Tino last night?

681
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,824
No. Why, what happened?

682
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:24,662
He didn't go home last night.
I'm getting worried.

683
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,206
I told him to stay the night.

684
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,458
You'll be late. Come with me.

685
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,918
Okay.

686
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,398
Haven't we talked about this?

687
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:59,029
We should know
how to balance love and career.

688
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:02,908
Aica, pick up!

689
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:06,286
The meeting's about to start.

690
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,997
Come on, Aica, hurry!

691
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,458
I thought you wouldn't make it.

692
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,335
What's wrong with you?

693
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,421
I'm so sorry. I had an emergency.

694
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,505
Gosh.

695
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,132
My gosh.

696
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,343
DId you finish it?

697
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:25,055
- The presentation?
- It's here.

698
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:28,892
Are we good?

699
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:29,935
Yes.

700
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,019
Okay.

701
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:35,399
To our Board of Directors,
we would like to present our wins

702
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:38,193
of our marketing team this quarter.

703
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,988
We have a verbal award from Pixl Games.

704
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,823
Aica, Pixl Games.

705
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,491
Aica, next slide.

706
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:45,784
There you go.

707
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,412
So we have a verbal award from Pixl Games.

708
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:54,251
Finally, we have won this client
after one and a half years of negotiation.

709
00:45:54,918 --> 00:46:01,758
And, just to let you know, our efficacy
rate for our clients and customers…

710
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,344
So those who have been
satisfied with our products…

711
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,513
92% have been satisfied

712
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,099
and for the new companies
for collaboration,

713
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,686
have an efficacy rate of 53%.

714
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,396
53%?

715
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,983
It says here that it's 73%.

716
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,276
Are you sure?

717
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,153
Which is it?

718
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,364
For a while, sir…

719
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:28,619
Yes, it's 73%.

720
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:32,664
Aica, can you make the corrections now?

721
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,750
I beg your indulgence, sir.

722
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,001
There!

723
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,127
There we have it.

724
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:43,300
73% for our new companies
for collaboration.

725
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:48,055
Moving forward, I'd like
to introduce to you our…

726
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,806
Got chewed out by the boss again?

727
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:54,853
Let's talk about your anniversary instead.

728
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,813
Was it a happy anniversary?

729
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,732
We didn't get to go out.

730
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:03,195
I don't mind, it's just another expense.

731
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,322
It's Tino who wants it.

732
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:08,325
Fine. You know, you should go home.

733
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:13,080
Don't look at me like that.

734
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,456
Stop working overtime.

735
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,583
And use your vacation leave.

736
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,418
You're not taking care of yourself.

737
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:22,214
Our bosses won't take care
of us if we get sick.

738
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,303
Hello, babes.

739
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:29,805
How are you?

740
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:32,057
<i>I got in trouble again.</i>

741
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:33,809
By the way,

742
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,435
are we going out tonight?

743
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:37,813
<i>Sorry, babes.</i>

744
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:40,691
<i>Our reservation got cancelled.</i>

745
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,779
It's okay. I understand.

746
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,700
I'll text you when I'm leaving.

747
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,326
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye-bye.

748
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,708
Tino, how was the presentation?

749
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,626
It was okay.

750
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,588
Sorry, was that Aica?
Are you two going out tonight?

751
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:04,756
No.

752
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,552
I can't find…

753
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,597
a good place, our previous
reservation got canceled,

754
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,724
and our schedules just won't match.

755
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:14,891
- There's--
- That's it?

756
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,351
A reservation?

757
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,061
I'll take care of it.

758
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,230
Okay? I have an idea.

759
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:26,945
Hello?

760
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:29,489
<i>Babes, get ready tonight.</i>

761
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,074
<i>I was able to work it out.</i>

762
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:33,952
Really?

763
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,245
Okay then.

764
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,538
Love you. Bye-bye.

765
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,674
It feels like it's been ages
since we last went on a date.

766
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:51,219
It almost feels like
our first time all over again.

767
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,516
And you're as pretty as ever.

768
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,228
That's a fact.

769
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,563
Just kidding.

770
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,190
Seriously,

771
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:06,652
I hope this isn't our first and last date.

772
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:07,736
I know.

773
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,198
We've been pretty busy lately.

774
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,699
I'm sorry.

775
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:16,995
Aica, by the way,

776
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:20,415
your interview
with the online news network…

777
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:23,418
are you really bailing on it?

778
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,588
- Well…
- I mean, it would be a waste.

779
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:30,676
Their compensation rate
is lower compared to…

780
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,803
But you should still go for it.

781
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,306
You've wanted to be in the news industry.

782
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,350
Just give it a shot,

783
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:41,603
so you can at least
get a feel for the industry.

784
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,816
It's not that easy

785
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:49,277
to just quit and follow your dreams.

786
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,446
Babes…

787
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,156
Hi! How are you?

788
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,741
Are you guys enjoying?

789
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,702
- Hi, Aica! Good to see you.
- Hi!

790
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:59,913
I hope my friend's restaurant
is accommodating you well.

791
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:01,373
- It is.
- Actually…

792
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,375
he wants to meet you. Is that okay?

793
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,961
He's a potential client.

794
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,212
Is it okay?

795
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:10,340
- Up to you.
- I'll be quick,

796
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:11,800
just five minutes.

797
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,051
Go.

798
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,721
All right, let's go?

799
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,432
I'll be back.

800
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:19,808
- I love you.
- Let's go?

801
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,147
Hey, Tino.

802
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,273
Nice to meet you.

803
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,953
- Let me know if I can help.
- Yeah.

804
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:42,748
- It was really nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

805
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,666
Thank you Mia. Excuse me.

806
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,043
Thank you. Keep in touch.

807
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,660
Is that how women are?

808
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,580
They think that we can just
read their minds?

809
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:31,838
You men are good
at playing dumb in relationships.

810
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,803
<i>Some might think it's shallow but</i>

811
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,180
<i>that was our time.</i>

812
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,308
<i>I really miss him.</i>

813
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:48,021
<i>He's right in front of me</i>
<i>but it feels like he's not there.</i>

814
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,440
<i>Like we're not together.</i>

815
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,443
<i>Are we still even "together"?</i>

816
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,538
Aica.

817
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:57,966
I'm sorry.

818
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,551
I said I'm fine.

819
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:00,677
Aica.

820
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:03,096
Come on, Aica.

821
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:07,475
Babes.

822
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,521
Didn't I tell you not to follow me?

823
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:14,816
Babes, look, I'm sorry.

824
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:21,323
Please?

825
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:31,541
I was just trying to show you that

826
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,919
I'm serious about my job.

827
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,715
Because that's what we're supposed to do.

828
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,300
Right?

829
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:48,224
I just didn't realize that I've been
neglecting our relationship.

830
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,230
I'm sorry.

831
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,319
Please, babes.

832
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:11,915
You know what, Tino?

833
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:16,211
I was happy before I knew you.

834
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,922
I was focused on my career.

835
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,799
I'm going out with friends.

836
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:23,259
I was saving up for Mom.

837
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,097
But then, you came along.

838
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:32,018
You messed up my life.
You messed up my system.

839
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:37,065
But it was okay because I love you.

840
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,529
But you got me used to…

841
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:45,615
a life where you're always there.

842
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,745
Then suddenly, you're gone.

843
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,708
But I can't…

844
00:54:56,084 --> 00:55:00,797
I don't think I can handle
being away from you.

845
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:14,894
Maybe…

846
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,023
Maybe we should…

847
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,191
- Break up--
- Move in together…

848
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,883
I just thought we should move in together

849
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:49,179
'cause I was thinking
of getting a condo anyway.

850
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:57,062
I figured it would
make things easier for us.

851
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:01,900
I mean, look at all the time
we waste on the road.

852
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:08,073
You know, it would be easier

853
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:12,077
if we just moved in together,
if we get it together.

854
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,373
We'll be able to save up.

855
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,418
We'll see each other all the time. We can…

856
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:25,715
see each other from morning to night,
from when you go to sleep.

857
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:31,179
And then when we wake up, we're together.

858
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:35,892
Babes,

859
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:40,188
please…

860
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:46,736
Please.

861
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,119
Are you tired?

862
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,511
- I know.
- Here.

863
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:55,847
So cute.

864
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:57,974
I love it.

865
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,548
You know,

866
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,676
I thought we were okay.

867
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:19,222
The whole time, I thought we were fine.

868
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:26,437
And I felt like
I was always doing my best.

869
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,108
Always.

870
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:57,010
- Hey, babes.
- Hi.

871
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:00,471
I got us some tissue.

872
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:07,895
Chips.

873
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:10,690
Why did you buy three packs of tissue?

874
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,110
We've already gone over budget.

875
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,404
And what's this?

876
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:20,033
We're paying for two Internet bills?

877
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:23,494
Because we lose signal sometimes.

878
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:28,958
I just thought having another one
would be handy for work.

879
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,170
We can have two connections.

880
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:35,173
Sure, if we're rich.
But we're not! What's this?

881
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,387
Seriously?

882
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:45,600
Weren't you complaining the other day
about your stylus not working?

883
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:47,894
You should have just bought that instead.

884
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:55,109
Okay, babes. It won't happen again.

885
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:02,909
Sir, we can start the meeting.

886
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:05,870
Okay, let's start. Are you guys ready?

887
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:07,038
- Ready.
- Yes, sir.

888
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:11,959
Okay, I'd like to assign
our next project to Tino.

889
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,044
Okay.

890
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:21,386
Thus, they forget
what living really means.

891
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:24,138
And that's what Shift-li wants to change.

892
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:31,646
Shift-li will teach the students
on how to ace their sales.

893
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:34,357
Thank you.

894
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,067
Congratulations.

895
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,151
Hey.

896
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,403
Thank you.

897
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,116
Look,

898
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,492
the layout is a mess.

899
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,912
I can't figure out
what they're trying to sell.

900
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,998
- If I designed that--
- But they're not our client.

901
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:52,834
Aren't we on our break?

902
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:54,919
Are you going to keep talking about work?

903
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,048
Okay, fine. It's breaktime.

904
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:04,303
If not, you won't be able
to copy it when you lose the files…

905
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,055
Hey Tino, congratulations.

906
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,599
Hey, thanks.

907
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,977
Hey! Come on!

908
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,687
Okay, fine.

909
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:28,161
My babes looks so happy today.

910
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:31,914
I think I'm getting a promotion soon.

911
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,208
You're up for promotion?

912
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,295
It will depend on the assessment.

913
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,630
Babes, congrats!

914
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,716
I'm sure you'll get it.

915
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:45,303
Next thing you know,
you're buying a sports car.

916
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,263
I'll have my own vroom-vroom?

917
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:48,598
That's not how you say it.

918
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:51,809
- Like that.
- Is that how it is?

919
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:54,687
Is that so? I hope I do get it.

920
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,940
Congrats, babes.

921
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:01,736
I want one here.

922
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:16,083
Look, babes.

923
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,296
It's about a long-distance relationship.

924
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:23,758
What if I join a reality show?

925
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:28,221
Then I'll become an actor and I'll fall
in love with my onscreen partner.

926
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:32,642
Their chemistry is amazing. It feels real.

927
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:35,311
Come on.

928
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:36,938
I'm busy.

929
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,949
Okay, everyone, good job. Cheers!

930
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,617
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

931
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,077
Yes!

932
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:53,120
Congrats!

933
01:03:58,584 --> 01:03:59,710
Are you okay?

934
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,339
Hey.

935
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:05,550
Why the long face?

936
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:09,011
The project was a success.
We should celebrate.

937
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:10,471
Yeah.

938
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:13,099
You're right.

939
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:17,228
Think about my offer, okay?

940
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:20,231
The design course in the UK.

941
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:23,484
Look,

942
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:29,949
they have art management courses
which could benefit you in the future.

943
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:33,077
- Yes.
- And besides,

944
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:35,371
it's just 18 months, it'll fly by.

945
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:39,250
And if you're worried about the expenses…

946
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:40,918
You'll take care of it?

947
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,379
We will pay the partial fee.

948
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:46,007
Regarding the balance,

949
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:50,261
the company will help you
look for scholarship plans.

950
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:53,347
Don't waste this opportunity.

951
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,141
And believe me,

952
01:04:57,226 --> 01:05:00,062
it was one of
the best experiences of my life.

953
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:03,983
It shaped who I am today.

954
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,738
Boss, thank you.

955
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:09,864
No, thank you.

956
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:10,948
Thanks.

957
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:12,992
Cheers?

958
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:16,329
- Cheers!
- Is this a meeting or a party?

959
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:42,104
<i>- Aica, I went over the deck…</i>
- Yes.

960
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,899
<i>…and I'm not satisfied.</i>
<i>I want you to review it again.</i>

961
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:46,192
<i>- Okay?</i>
- Okay.

962
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:51,489
Aica, are you still happy?

963
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,825
I'll always be here for you.

964
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,412
<i>Girl, when I was transferred, oh, my God,</i>

965
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,915
<i>I've never been happier.</i>

966
01:06:01,248 --> 01:06:03,376
<i>Do you even still like your job?</i>

967
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:11,425
<i>What's going on, Aica?</i>
<i>You've been slipping up a lot lately.</i>

968
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:13,970
<i>If there's a problem, let me know,</i>

969
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:17,890
<i>and I can have someone else do your job.</i>

970
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:25,147
You guys go ahead.
I just need to finish something.

971
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,570
<i>I'm so sorry, Aica, but management thinks</i>

972
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:34,031
you're not yet ready for the promotion.

973
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:38,786
Congratulations.

974
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:40,371
You did well.

975
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:05,539
Hi, Angel. Do you know where Aica is?
She didn't join us earlier.

976
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:11,378
<i>Tino, she didn't get the promotion.</i>
<i>I'm sure she's on her way home now.</i>

977
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:41,367
Hey…

978
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:51,544
It's okay.

979
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:06,642
Why not just quit?

980
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:15,234
This isn't even your dream, right?

981
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:32,001
Just quit. Okay?

982
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:38,674
Do whatever you want.

983
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:42,011
I'll take care of you.

984
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:45,598
Okay?

985
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,686
After putting Aica through hell,

986
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:53,439
they promoted the newbie, Janine.

987
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:54,773
Oh, no.

988
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,442
That's so confusing

989
01:09:56,525 --> 01:10:00,613
because shouldn't the basis of a promotion
be competence?

990
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:03,115
I'm sorry, I'm just so confused.

991
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,701
Aica deserved that promotion.

992
01:10:05,826 --> 01:10:06,952
Exactly.

993
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,538
She worked so hard for years, you know?

994
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,541
And she doesn't even like this job.

995
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:16,921
Wait, what happens when you go to Canada?

996
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:20,090
Aica will be all alone…

997
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:22,760
You're leaving?

998
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,097
Haven't you noticed anything?

999
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:28,974
Oh, my God!

1000
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,643
Wow, congrats!

1001
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,103
Why didn't you say anything?

1002
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,064
I don't want the attention.

1003
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:37,608
Come on, I'm happy for you.

1004
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,985
You're leaving, too.

1005
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,820
It's the end of the PowerPak Girls?

1006
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:44,823
Hey, nothing's going to change.

1007
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,408
What about you and Tino?

1008
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:48,244
Any plans?

1009
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:52,331
I'm sure you guys are next
since you already live together.

1010
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:18,232
Should I put a ring on it?

1011
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:22,027
Don't be silly, it's too early.

1012
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:26,615
Why not?

1013
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:30,202
Don't you want to go
on a honeymoon already?

1014
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:02,651
I love you.

1015
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,529
So much.

1016
01:12:08,615 --> 01:12:10,159
I love you, too.

1017
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:11,702
How much?

1018
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:14,496
This is how much I love you.

1019
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,002
What's this?

1020
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,504
My love for you. Check it out.

1021
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:25,632
My love for you is expensive.

1022
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,181
What's this?

1023
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:33,807
It's a gift.

1024
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:35,768
It's just a staycation.

1025
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:39,605
You've been so busy lately.

1026
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:44,109
I feel we could use
some quality time together

1027
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:47,071
and we can hang out.

1028
01:12:47,237 --> 01:12:50,074
Tino, this is too expensive.

1029
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:53,452
We could have used
this money on something else.

1030
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:55,996
Why do we have to go there

1031
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,291
when we can do the same things here?

1032
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:01,919
We have a lot of bills to pay.

1033
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:04,213
Get a refund.

1034
01:13:17,684 --> 01:13:18,769
Mom…

1035
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:23,732
- Yes?
- What if I quit my job?

1036
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:26,735
What?

1037
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:28,821
Aren't you happy anymore?

1038
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,032
If you're no longer happy,

1039
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,493
then quit.

1040
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:44,169
What about Bea's tuition
and the bills for the bakeshop?

1041
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:48,674
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

1042
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:55,597
Are you keeping something from me, Mom?

1043
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:58,350
No.

1044
01:13:58,684 --> 01:13:59,726
Nothing.

1045
01:14:00,727 --> 01:14:02,020
Tell me the truth.

1046
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:05,357
I'm not hiding anything.

1047
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:08,861
Can't a mom be supportive of her child?

1048
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:13,532
Here are the ingredients, love.

1049
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:14,658
Dad?

1050
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,538
Aica…

1051
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:24,835
So, that's it. You took him back.

1052
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:28,130
This is different.

1053
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:29,756
You got back with him?

1054
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:33,427
Aren't you tired yet?

1055
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:36,597
How many times will you go through this?

1056
01:14:37,097 --> 01:14:38,599
You'll get back together,

1057
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:41,560
he'll leave, you'll get heartbroken,

1058
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:43,187
then you'll get together again.

1059
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:46,356
Mom, aren't you tired?

1060
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:49,818
He's sick, Aica.

1061
01:14:50,777 --> 01:14:51,904
It's bad.

1062
01:14:52,529 --> 01:14:53,989
He needs us.

1063
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:02,372
He won't get anything from us
even if he stays here.

1064
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:09,004
We used the down payment for
the bakeshop's space to buy his medicine.

1065
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:22,351
<i>I wanted to tell him about</i>
<i>what happened to Dad.</i>

1066
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:28,649
<i>I was going to tell her about</i>
<i>the scholarship program.</i>

1067
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:32,194
<i>I'm tired.</i>

1068
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:36,448
<i>I'm excited.</i>

1069
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:41,203
<i>Is it a heavy subject?</i>

1070
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:45,499
<i>But is it the right time?</i>

1071
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,548
<i>I don't want us to have issues.</i>

1072
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:56,969
<i>We might have some issues.</i>

1073
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:08,105
<i>- We're still okay.</i>
<i>- We're still okay.</i>

1074
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:29,960
Aica, Dad's in the hospital.

1075
01:16:43,807 --> 01:16:44,850
Tino.

1076
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:47,811
One bottle?

1077
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:57,946
Yeah.

1078
01:17:00,657 --> 01:17:03,118
<i>I just don't get her sometimes.</i>

1079
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:07,873
I was just trying to do
something nice for her.

1080
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:10,000
But…

1081
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:13,754
I don't understand

1082
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:18,091
why she doesn't appreciate my efforts.

1083
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:22,346
Maybe she's just going through something?

1084
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:25,307
Then why doesn't she tell me?

1085
01:17:25,932 --> 01:17:27,351
It's that easy.

1086
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,896
It's not always that easy.

1087
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:33,815
Mia, what's the point of me
being her boyfriend?

1088
01:17:35,025 --> 01:17:37,861
No matter what,
I'll always be there for her.

1089
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:42,407
That's what a boyfriend's for,
to listen and give support.

1090
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:47,454
I even declined Sir Simon's offer
to go to the UK.

1091
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:50,207
- You didn't take it?
- No.

1092
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:53,752
Of course not, I don't want to leave Aica.

1093
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:57,089
It's not the right time

1094
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:59,841
to leave her right now.

1095
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:23,365
Tino.

1096
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:24,908
Sleeping here?

1097
01:18:24,991 --> 01:18:26,535
Enzo.

1098
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:28,203
Let's do shots.

1099
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:31,123
- Please.
- No way.

1100
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:33,333
Mom's going to flip
if she see you like this.

1101
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:34,793
Why would she?

1102
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:37,129
We're just celebrating.

1103
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:39,840
Because…

1104
01:18:40,465 --> 01:18:41,675
I got promoted.

1105
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:46,096
Yes! Nice!
That's what we've been waiting for.

1106
01:18:46,179 --> 01:18:51,685
My boss offered me
a scholarship to the UK.

1107
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:56,815
Wait, I thought we're celebrating?

1108
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:58,150
Why do you look so sad?

1109
01:19:01,027 --> 01:19:03,155
Aica didn't get the promotion.

1110
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:05,574
- Oh, shit.
- And…

1111
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:09,536
Recently, I've been trying,

1112
01:19:09,786 --> 01:19:12,956
and I've been having a hard time

1113
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:15,625
telling her about mine.

1114
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:22,382
I feel like it might be insensitive
of me to tell her now.

1115
01:19:25,802 --> 01:19:27,971
I don't want her to get hurt.

1116
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:36,396
Hello?

1117
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:39,649
<i>Hi, Aica! Sorry, this is Mia.</i>

1118
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:41,485
<i>Tino left his phone.</i>

1119
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,153
<i>I think he's drunk.</i>

1120
01:19:43,236 --> 01:19:45,322
<i>You can get. We're at View Bar.</i>

1121
01:19:45,405 --> 01:19:46,364
Okay. Sure.

1122
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,074
- Thanks.
<i>- All right.</i>

1123
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:52,704
If you didn't have to worry
about anything,

1124
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:54,456
would you take the offer?

1125
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:56,666
I mean,

1126
01:19:58,168 --> 01:20:00,670
I really like what I'm doing right now.

1127
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:04,466
You know what?

1128
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:07,302
That's the first time
I have heard you say,

1129
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:08,970
"I really like what I'm doing."

1130
01:20:22,567 --> 01:20:24,402
You know, you're young, bro.

1131
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:26,404
You've got to think about your future.

1132
01:20:30,116 --> 01:20:31,326
What about Aica?

1133
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:35,247
- Hi, Mia.
- Hi! How are you?

1134
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:36,873
Sorry, here's his phone.

1135
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:37,916
Thanks.

1136
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:40,293
Anyway, this is Eunice.

1137
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:41,586
My girlfriend.

1138
01:20:43,046 --> 01:20:45,131
- Eunice.
- Hi! Nice meeting you.

1139
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:49,177
You know, I really admire Tino

1140
01:20:49,302 --> 01:20:53,056
for passing up on
that design course in the UK.

1141
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:56,476
He loves you so much.

1142
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:18,874
Here's your phone.

1143
01:21:22,335 --> 01:21:23,503
Thank you.

1144
01:21:24,462 --> 01:21:25,547
Sorry…

1145
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:28,884
I got home late.

1146
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:45,734
Babes?

1147
01:21:46,818 --> 01:21:47,986
Are you okay?

1148
01:21:55,994 --> 01:21:56,995
I think…

1149
01:21:57,871 --> 01:21:59,414
I think I'm pregnant.

1150
01:22:08,548 --> 01:22:09,758
It's okay.

1151
01:22:11,718 --> 01:22:12,802
It's a good thing.

1152
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:14,346
Right?

1153
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:16,890
I'm actually excited.

1154
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:21,561
Maybe we can get a little Tino or Aica.

1155
01:22:22,562 --> 01:22:24,689
Hey, either way, it's cute.

1156
01:22:25,231 --> 01:22:26,775
It's a good thing.

1157
01:22:32,072 --> 01:22:33,490
You're not pregnant.

1158
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:35,992
You're just very stressed.

1159
01:22:36,534 --> 01:22:38,536
You need to take it easy.

1160
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:41,665
Will you excuse me? I'll be right back.

1161
01:22:50,256 --> 01:22:51,424
This is good.

1162
01:22:52,258 --> 01:22:53,259
Right?

1163
01:22:58,598 --> 01:23:01,768
It's good, right?

1164
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:05,313
Yes.

1165
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:08,608
This is definitely okay.

1166
01:23:10,902 --> 01:23:11,945
Okay.

1167
01:23:44,769 --> 01:23:46,062
Turn right over there.

1168
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:48,023
There.

1169
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:53,611
The map says to go straight.

1170
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,449
That's where I always turn right.
Trust me.

1171
01:23:57,532 --> 01:23:59,617
The ETA says this route is faster.

1172
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:01,786
Do you know better than the ETA?

1173
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:12,756
What's your problem?

1174
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:14,507
Are you okay?

1175
01:24:14,799 --> 01:24:16,301
They were being reckless.

1176
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:21,431
If you have a problem, tell me.

1177
01:24:21,931 --> 01:24:23,641
Don't act like this.

1178
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:26,686
I've turned right.

1179
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:29,522
Look at the traffic.
There's even a road repair going on.

1180
01:24:31,524 --> 01:24:32,692
What the hell?

1181
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:35,111
That dumbass wasn't looking.

1182
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:37,655
Tell me what your problem is.

1183
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:39,991
- I don't want us to fight.
- I'm okay!

1184
01:24:40,116 --> 01:24:41,659
You call that "okay"?

1185
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:43,119
Did I say I wasn't?

1186
01:25:06,476 --> 01:25:08,394
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing!

1187
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:10,021
There is something wrong.

1188
01:25:10,313 --> 01:25:11,397
What is it?

1189
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:13,191
You want a family?

1190
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:16,402
You want to study in the UK?

1191
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:21,116
Mia told me you turned down
the offer because of me.

1192
01:25:21,282 --> 01:25:23,743
You told Mia, but not me.

1193
01:25:25,411 --> 01:25:27,080
I was going to tell you.

1194
01:25:27,497 --> 01:25:29,874
You should have,

1195
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,793
but you didn't.

1196
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:34,045
Because we don't talk anymore.

1197
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:36,214
You're in a much better place now.

1198
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,263
And that's a bad thing?

1199
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:45,557
No.

1200
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:47,809
Not at all.

1201
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:50,145
I'm actually happy for you.

1202
01:25:50,937 --> 01:25:51,980
Really?

1203
01:25:53,773 --> 01:25:55,692
Doesn't seem like it, though.

1204
01:25:56,526 --> 01:25:59,654
If you're happy for me,
then why are we fighting?

1205
01:26:01,906 --> 01:26:02,949
Why?

1206
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:10,498
Why do I feel like the happier I am,
the more you get angry?

1207
01:26:11,749 --> 01:26:16,629
The tissue, the staycation,
then this design course in the UK…

1208
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:20,008
You're just like this cloud.

1209
01:26:20,216 --> 01:26:23,303
A dark cloud that just can't be happy.

1210
01:26:23,928 --> 01:26:26,556
I wanted to share all my wins with you.

1211
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:27,765
All of it.

1212
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:31,603
I wanted to share everything with you,
but it's hard.

1213
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:35,523
It's written all over your face
that you're unhappy.

1214
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:39,944
I'm doing all of this… Just look around!

1215
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,822
Damn, is it still not good enough?

1216
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:45,617
I'm doing this for us.

1217
01:26:48,786 --> 01:26:50,413
But how can I go on

1218
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:53,082
when it only makes you jealous?

1219
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:55,376
It's not a competition.

1220
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:56,669
Fine!

1221
01:26:59,964 --> 01:27:02,217
Yes, I'm jealous.

1222
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:05,762
Is that what you want to hear?

1223
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:08,598
Sorry, then.

1224
01:27:09,599 --> 01:27:11,851
Sorry I can't relate to your success.

1225
01:27:13,811 --> 01:27:15,438
I'm trying, though.

1226
01:27:19,692 --> 01:27:21,778
But, really, I'm happy for you.

1227
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,529
So happy.

1228
01:27:23,613 --> 01:27:28,701
I'm happy because finally your life
isn't just "okay" anymore.

1229
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:31,287
Finally, you found what you needed,

1230
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:32,914
what you wanted to do.

1231
01:27:34,832 --> 01:27:37,252
But what else do you want me to say?

1232
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:38,878
That I'm happy for you?

1233
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:43,174
That I'm happy for you
but I'm not happy for myself?

1234
01:27:46,469 --> 01:27:48,763
That I'm happy that I'm miserable?

1235
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:52,600
Yes, Tino, I am sad.

1236
01:27:53,476 --> 01:27:56,354
And it's embarrassing
because it's the truth.

1237
01:27:57,689 --> 01:27:59,774
This is how I feel.

1238
01:28:21,004 --> 01:28:23,256
Aica, I'll help you.

1239
01:28:27,176 --> 01:28:28,761
We're a couple,

1240
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:30,638
right?

1241
01:28:32,473 --> 01:28:35,476
Couples are partners.

1242
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:40,481
Aica, what am I here for?

1243
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:44,777
Isn't it my job to support you?

1244
01:28:45,778 --> 01:28:47,864
Or maybe you don't trust me?

1245
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:54,620
Is that why you were so relieved
when you found out we weren't pregnant?

1246
01:28:55,538 --> 01:28:58,458
Aica, I'm not the person you used to know.

1247
01:28:58,541 --> 01:29:00,877
Okay? This isn't the same Tino.

1248
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:02,378
I've changed.

1249
01:29:02,462 --> 01:29:04,130
Exactly.

1250
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:08,217
You're not the Tino I once knew.

1251
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:10,970
You've changed.

1252
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:14,849
But I'm still the same.

1253
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:18,144
Look how far you've come, Tino.

1254
01:29:21,731 --> 01:29:23,816
I know I need to work on myself.

1255
01:29:24,317 --> 01:29:27,153
Only I can help myself.

1256
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:30,448
So, go ahead
with your plans to go to the UK.

1257
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:47,006
Okay, Aica.

1258
01:29:47,298 --> 01:29:48,382
Listen.

1259
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:51,302
Aics…

1260
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:55,098
I'll accept the offer to go to the UK.

1261
01:29:57,183 --> 01:29:58,935
Long-distance relationship?

1262
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:02,980
We've been through that before,

1263
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:05,233
right?

1264
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,693
Quezon City to Alabang.

1265
01:30:07,777 --> 01:30:08,986
Back and forth…

1266
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:10,696
That's not the problem.

1267
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:13,116
Distance is not the problem.

1268
01:30:13,616 --> 01:30:15,326
I'm from Alabang, you, Quezon City.

1269
01:30:15,409 --> 01:30:17,328
We made it work.

1270
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:18,621
But now,

1271
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,624
we live in the same house,

1272
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:25,753
but you still feel so far away, Tino.

1273
01:30:27,296 --> 01:30:28,381
Babes…

1274
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:33,511
if there's a will, there's a way.

1275
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:38,349
If you really love someone,
you don't just give up easily.

1276
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:40,184
You know, it would be easier

1277
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:43,479
if you just admitted
that you never really loved me.

1278
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,232
I never loved you?

1279
01:30:51,487 --> 01:30:53,573
I gave you everything.

1280
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,414
But you left me behind.

1281
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,419
You're so distant now.

1282
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:10,548
I needed you back then.

1283
01:31:12,967 --> 01:31:14,427
Where were you?

1284
01:31:17,763 --> 01:31:18,890
Babes…

1285
01:31:22,393 --> 01:31:24,395
I'm not happy, Tino.

1286
01:31:24,687 --> 01:31:27,064
I'm not happy anymore.

1287
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:33,446
Are we breaking up?

1288
01:31:58,054 --> 01:32:00,348
That's just how life goes.

1289
01:32:05,436 --> 01:32:07,980
Our lives were heading
to different directions.

1290
01:32:14,695 --> 01:32:15,863
There's no other way.

1291
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:23,287
So, I ended it.

1292
01:32:53,192 --> 01:32:55,361
Funny how mad I am at Dad

1293
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:58,406
when I'm just like him.

1294
01:33:00,324 --> 01:33:01,325
A burden.

1295
01:33:06,664 --> 01:33:08,541
You're carrying a heavy load,

1296
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:11,460
but you're not a burden.

1297
01:33:14,922 --> 01:33:17,300
You don't have to carry all that weight.

1298
01:33:18,801 --> 01:33:21,262
We can lighten the load together.

1299
01:33:22,471 --> 01:33:24,056
How, Mom?

1300
01:33:24,765 --> 01:33:26,309
By forgiving Dad?

1301
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:29,270
That's not fair.

1302
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:34,650
Should I forgive him
just because he's dying?

1303
01:33:35,318 --> 01:33:37,445
After everything he's done?

1304
01:33:41,073 --> 01:33:43,951
You don't have to forgive him
if you don't want to.

1305
01:33:45,953 --> 01:33:47,496
Be angry,

1306
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:49,081
confront him.

1307
01:33:52,084 --> 01:33:54,128
Then I'll be the bad child?

1308
01:33:56,213 --> 01:33:57,214
No.

1309
01:33:58,090 --> 01:33:59,967
You'll just be his child.

1310
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:07,975
You've always taken care of us.

1311
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:11,687
You put your dreams aside for us.

1312
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:15,524
You've sacrificed so much.

1313
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:19,570
And it's my fault

1314
01:34:22,948 --> 01:34:25,201
that you had to take on a parental role

1315
01:34:26,702 --> 01:34:28,537
because I wasn't strong enough.

1316
01:34:30,623 --> 01:34:32,333
I'm sorry.

1317
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:36,295
I'm so sorry.

1318
01:34:42,718 --> 01:34:44,303
But I'm changing that.

1319
01:34:45,888 --> 01:34:48,140
You don't have to carry the baggage alone.

1320
01:34:49,141 --> 01:34:51,018
I'll take care of us.

1321
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:55,398
Go and do what you really want to do,

1322
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:57,274
okay?

1323
01:34:58,442 --> 01:35:00,319
Can I really do that, Mom?

1324
01:35:01,278 --> 01:35:02,655
Is it okay?

1325
01:36:32,953 --> 01:36:34,705
Is it really over?

1326
01:36:42,796 --> 01:36:43,923
I don't know.

1327
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:51,889
She's the one who wanted to leave.

1328
01:36:54,558 --> 01:36:55,768
She ended it.

1329
01:36:59,855 --> 01:37:01,524
I just don't understand.

1330
01:37:01,982 --> 01:37:08,155
I feel like I did everything I could.

1331
01:37:10,616 --> 01:37:13,327
I felt like we were okay.

1332
01:37:14,954 --> 01:37:16,664
I felt like…

1333
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:20,626
I was at my best,

1334
01:37:21,835 --> 01:37:24,380
and I was doing everything for her.

1335
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:28,759
But she still left.

1336
01:37:30,928 --> 01:37:32,471
So, what now?

1337
01:37:34,348 --> 01:37:36,433
Why are you telling me all this?

1338
01:37:37,226 --> 01:37:38,602
To get me on your side?

1339
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:42,690
So I can say it's Aica's fault?

1340
01:37:44,733 --> 01:37:47,570
What I'm hearing is
it's all about you, Tino.

1341
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:50,781
"I felt this, I felt that."

1342
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:53,826
But what about Aica's feelings?

1343
01:37:53,951 --> 01:37:56,245
Clearly, she's not happy anymore.

1344
01:37:56,537 --> 01:37:58,414
She's different from you, Tino.

1345
01:37:59,957 --> 01:38:02,459
Let her go

1346
01:38:02,626 --> 01:38:05,004
so she can find herself.

1347
01:38:05,129 --> 01:38:07,464
Don't you want her to be happy?

1348
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:34,575
We can't just end like this.

1349
01:38:36,118 --> 01:38:37,119
Right?

1350
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:45,252
<i>Where are we going?</i>

1351
01:38:51,717 --> 01:38:52,926
<i>I don't know.</i>

1352
01:38:55,471 --> 01:38:57,723
<i>Just let me be with you,</i>

1353
01:38:59,308 --> 01:39:01,769
<i>even if it's just for one more ride.</i>

1354
01:40:17,761 --> 01:40:19,888
Sir, we can start the meeting.

1355
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:25,018
Good morning, everyone.

1356
01:40:25,102 --> 01:40:26,603
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1357
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:28,480
Morning, guys. Morning, sir.

1358
01:40:28,564 --> 01:40:30,733
So, our first slide.

1359
01:40:31,191 --> 01:40:32,067
Let's start…

1360
01:40:43,245 --> 01:40:47,207
I hope the transportation system
around here improves.

1361
01:40:47,624 --> 01:40:52,963
Commuting to work is hard for us.

1362
01:40:54,214 --> 01:40:59,094
And that's a wrap, everyone!
Thank you very much.

1363
01:40:59,178 --> 01:41:00,763
Thank you.

1364
01:41:04,266 --> 01:41:06,351
Good job, Aica. Going home?

1365
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:07,936
Are you taking the service van?

1366
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:10,689
I brought my car. See you.

1367
01:42:42,573 --> 01:42:44,074
Want to grab some coffee?

1368
01:42:46,869 --> 01:42:50,831
Yeah. Sure, Miss Babes.

1369
01:42:53,041 --> 01:42:54,167
Where to?
