1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Your mom left a letter for you.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:09,760
‪PREVIOUSLY

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,480
Here are the newbies.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,000
There's info about illegal
labor practices on a flash drive,

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,400
so I stole it.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,560
- Why are those freaks here?
- Take us to the hospital.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,520
Their boss’s name is…

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,200
Peem.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,480
I have a job for you.

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,240
You are the "Please be generous" heroes!

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,600
Why are you doing this to him?

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,840
You meddling idiots,
you’ll get what's coming to you too.

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,120
‪DEBTOR WILL GET BEATEN UP
‪BY "PLEASE BE GENEROUS" HEROES

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,800
Seng said they've been beating
people in the neighborhood, saying they're

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,040
the "Please be generous" gang.

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,680
Make people see. Let people know how
horrible the "Please be generous" gang is.

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,080
From the looks of it, I think
they're trying to make people hate us.

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,040
You're right.

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,800
Those bad guys behind masks…

20
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,920
It's clear now. Peem is behind this.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,840
And I've given the culprits' address
to the police.

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,120
Huh?

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,599
They're faster than I thought.

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,120
Oh, I thought no one was home.

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,920
- Why are you hiding over there?
- Whoa.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,360
Granny, you scared us!
We thought it was the police.

27
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,720
Huh? Why would you think it's the police?

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,560
Well, our gang has become the bad guys.
We need to grab our stuff and run.

29
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,440
Huh?

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,960
Hey…

31
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,720
Anyway, let's stay here for now.

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,160
Tomorrow,
we’ll figure out what to do next.

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,400
Thank you so much, Ms. Kam.

34
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,160
If it weren’t for you,
we wouldn’t know where to go.

35
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,080
Well, I had to help.

36
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,039
Someone told my dad
that he would prove he's good enough.

37
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,240
How can he prove it
if he ends up in jail first?

38
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,360
My dad’s calling me. I have to go now.

39
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,800
Call me if anything comes up.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,360
Oh, right. I'm happy for Granny
that Arm remembers now.

41
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,000
Arm isn’t as bad as you feared.

42
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,160
Thanks a lot, Thua.

43
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,160
But I still feel guilty.

44
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,440
It’s like we didn’t trust our own son.

45
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,240
The situation led to that, Granny.
Arm probably won’t be mad at you, right?

46
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes.

47
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,320
If Mom didn’t feel anything
when she found out

48
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,720
I did something wrong, I’d feel awful.

49
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,880
Right now, we have
two main issues to deal with.

50
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,640
The fake "Please be generous" gang

51
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,720
and the human trafficking gang,
both caused by Peem.

52
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,040
I think we should deal
with the human trafficking gang first.

53
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,240
If we can unmask Peem,

54
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,520
the fake "Please be generous" gang problem
will be solved too.

55
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,960
That's true.

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,880
But from what Arm told us,

57
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,040
we’ll need to get the flash drive first.
Where is it?

58
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,720
It’s at the warehouse.
I hid it there before getting caught.

59
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,840
In that case, we need to come up
with a plan to get the flash drive back.

60
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,000
We need to run from the police
and deal with human traffickers.

61
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,440
Without their special powers,

62
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,240
those three are just a kid,
a pregnant woman, and an old person.

63
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,880
Even on the bus, people give up their
seats for them. How can they help anyone?

64
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,320
Ms. Kam.

65
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,280
Is there a room at the garage
with only one way in and out?

66
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,920
There is. What do you need it for?

67
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,600
I was thinking of having a team meeting.

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,960
Hmm?

69
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,760
Alright, everyone,

70
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,240
we need to have a meeting
before we move forward with the big plan.

71
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,800
What meeting?

72
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,760
Aren’t we in a hurry?

73
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,720
Come on, Granny. Arm, could you grab
the bag from the bus up front?

74
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,960
Yeah, sure.

75
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,640
- Thank you.
- No problem.

76
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,760
Oh, I forgot to mention the color.
Hope he won’t get confused.

77
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,880
It’s green.

78
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,160
Arm!

79
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,520
Sorry, everyone.

80
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,280
- Hey, wait!
- Thua!

81
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,000
- Thua!
- What are you doing?

82
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,120
- Thua, open the door now!
- Thua!

83
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,040
- Thua!
- Thua!

84
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,000
- Arm!
- Hey, what's up, Thua?

85
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,560
There’s no bag. I’ve locked Granny
and the others in that room.

86
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,640
Huh? Why did you do that?

87
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,880
Since they don't have any powers,
I didn't want them to take any risks.

88
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,840
So, I decided to go on my own.

89
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,920
Then I’m coming with you. I’m the only one
who knows where the evidence is hidden.

90
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

91
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,520
Why are all their phones turned off?

92
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,040
This is strange.

93
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,320
Kam, there you are.

94
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,160
Come outside with me.

95
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,280
I’m busy. I’m not going.

96
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,760
Come outside with me,
and you’ll be amazed.

97
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,640
Amazed by what, dad? I’m not going.

98
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,160
Fine, I’ll tell you.

99
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,680
I’ve caught the "Please be generous" gang.

100
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,200
Huh?

101
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,840
The "Please be generous" gang.

102
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,280
Let's go.

103
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,280
This is the place.
I hid the flash drive here. Let’s go.

104
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,960
Wow, Arm.
Do you think we’ll be able to find it?

105
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,320
Don’t worry, I know where it is.

106
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,760
- Okay, that’s a relief.
- Let’s go.

107
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,480
I'm not sure if we're here for a campaign

108
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,360
or a concert.

109
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,880
Pay attention. Don't get arrogant,
thinking we're above others.

110
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,600
Yes, mom.

111
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,920
Arm, I've been looking for you everywhere.
Why did you suddenly come back?

112
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,880
Hey, wait a minute.

113
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,120
Mom, I'll take this call quickly.

114
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,520
- Is everything all set?
- Yes, everything is set.

115
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,080
Boss, Arm is back at our warehouse.

116
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,560
Back at the warehouse? Why?

117
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,400
It seems like he's looking for something.

118
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,960
I think he might have hidden
some evidence before running away.

119
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,880
Should I deal with him now,
or what should we do, boss?

120
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,160
Let him find it, take it,
and then deal with him.

121
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,400
Understood, boss.

122
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,960
Peem, it's time.

123
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,720
‪Let's go.

124
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,640
WE'RE READY TO FIX THE SYSTEM
AND CARE FOR THE PEOPLE

125
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,520
- It’s so mysterious.
- Calm down. We’ll find it for sure.

126
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,640
Hey!

127
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,320
Is the file still here?

128
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,440
- Yes, of course.
- Hey!

129
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,440
- Let’s go.
- Hey, stop!

130
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,680
Duck down.

131
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,320
Damn it, when did they catch up?

132
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,680
I miss Granny's time-stop power.

133
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,160
I think you should escape first.

134
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,800
No, we stick together.

135
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,520
Let’s go. Hurry.

136
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,560
Come on.

137
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,440
We’re screwed.

138
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,720
- Arm!
- What should we do?

139
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,280
Arm, you can’t escape me.
Hand over the flash drive.

140
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,920
‪Don't give it to them.

141
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,400
- What should we do?
- Fall back.

142
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
Dammit!

143
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,040
Phew.

144
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,400
- Where's the police?
- Yeah, where are they?

145
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,080
- Hey, Mom.
- Oh!

146
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,040
How did you get here? You'll get caught!
Luckily the police showed up in time.

147
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,280
- Oh.
- Wow.

148
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,040
You guys fooled us.

149
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,880
We almost lost our voices

150
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,040
before someone came to unlock the door.

151
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,520
You wanted to play the hero alone, huh?

152
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,520
Come on. We got the evidence now.
Let’s go handle this.

153
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,360
And this is my policy,
which I will implement,

154
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,400
and it is the promise
I am making to all of you.

155
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,840
And this is our top candidate
for this district.

156
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,920
Please give a round of applause
for Mr. Peem!

157
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,440
Wait a minute, everyone!

158
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,560
Don’t applaud the wrong person!

159
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,360
This man

160
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,840
isn’t as good as you think.

161
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,560
Excuse me,

162
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,880
but if you’re here to cause trouble,
I’ll have to call the police.

163
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,440
That’s perfect! Call them.

164
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,560
I've been wanting to meet them
to show them the evidence

165
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,560
of how vile you are.

166
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,400
Please leave the event.

167
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,360
- Leave the event now.
- Hey, wait! What?

168
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,080
- Leave now.
- No, please don’t!

169
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,640
Officer, you're just in time!

170
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,120
Arrest them!
They’re causing trouble at my event!

171
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,480
It’s you, Peem, who should be arrested!

172
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,880
Hey!

173
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,800
That's the "Please be generous" gang.

174
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,960
What's going on here?

175
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,520
Alright, I’ll explain.

176
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,960
They’re the fake
"Please be generous" gang,

177
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,400
and they’ve confessed.

178
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,880
What’s this, Dad?

179
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,960
It’s the "Please be generous" gang.

180
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,960
Seng and I saw them
beating up an old man just now.

181
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,480
It only took a little effort
to catch them. They had no power.

182
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,920
Now, you’ll see that Thua

183
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,560
is the real criminal here.

184
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,800
Wait, it’s not Thua?

185
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,800
Oh.

186
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,160
And the one who hired them
to cause trouble is Peem.

187
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,240
Everyone, don’t listen
to only one side of the story.

188
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,680
I would never do something like that.

189
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,440
I don’t even know those people.

190
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,720
Oh.

191
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,600
Is that true?

192
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,880
Alright then.
Let's have the police investigate it.

193
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,200
I still have
another crime to report today.

194
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,440
Peem is the leader
of a human trafficking gang.

195
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,400
What? Really?

196
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,640
In here is a list of victims,

197
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,600
profit accounts,

198
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,720
money laundering routes,

199
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,320
and names of all the people
involved in this operation.

200
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,840
How are you sure it’s me?

201
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,319
Oh, I’m quite sure because I have this.

202
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,040
The most important file of all.
Let me show you.

203
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,520
Wait a second.

204
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,599
Let me borrow this, please?

205
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,079
The order is for 200 people.

206
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,359
Do whatever it takes. I give you one week.

207
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,280
That’s a lot, Mr. Peem.
I don’t think we’ll make it in time.

208
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,800
I said do whatever it takes.
You can deceive, drug,

209
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,600
- or kidnap them, just get it done.
- Understood.

210
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,880
We’ll have to take you to the station.

211
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,760
- Let’s go, Peem.
- Follow him!

212
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,480
- You bastard!
- You jerk!

213
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,680
Hey!

214
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,800
Stay here! Let the police handle it.

215
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,400
- Got it?
- Fine.

216
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,640
We’re just regular folks now.

217
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,840
Not only that,
but we have other things to do.

218
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,360
What else, Granny?

219
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,920
Haven’t you noticed? Phakbung isn’t here.

220
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,680
Oh, you’re right. Bung, where is she?

221
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,320
You’re right, Granny.

222
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,200
Hang in there.

223
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,480
One, two…

224
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,320
It's a girl.

225
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,440
The baby is very strong!
She's the loudest in the ward.

226
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,040
Really?

227
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,680
Of course! Her mom is very strong.

228
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,160
Even while pregnant,
she was always active.

229
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,840
Thua.

230
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,520
Thua.

231
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Oh, nothing.

232
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,800
Hey, Granddad! Hello, Granddad!

233
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,400
Hello.

234
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,040
Hello.

235
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,880
How are you, dear?

236
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,200
Oh, this must be my grandchild.

237
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,320
Come on. Let me see your face.

238
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,040
Let’s see.

239
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,640
Small mouth, little nose.
Who do you look like?

240
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,560
She looks like her grandmom.

241
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,440
So adorable!

242
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,280
So cute.

243
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,280
Such cute round eyes.

244
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,240
I'm relieved, Mom,
that Phakbung gave birth safely.

245
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,520
Right.

246
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,240
The human trafficking gang
has also been exposed.

247
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,480
From now on,

248
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,040
all the bad things
should be over for good.

249
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,560
I won't have to be afraid
of them anymore, Mom.

250
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,200
Hmm.

251
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,680
Arm, promise me

252
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,960
that you won't leave me
and go far away again.

253
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,560
I promise, Mom.

254
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,200
From now on, I will always stay with you.

255
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,400
That's great, isn't it?
Everyone's prayers have come true.

256
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,480
Tomorrow, you should go home
and see your mom.

257
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,680
Hey, why are you rushing me to leave?

258
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,240
I'm not rushing you,
but you must miss your mom, right?

259
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,560
I do miss her,
but I'm worried about you, Thua.

260
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,120
Huh? Why are you worried about me?
I'm perfectly fine.

261
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,840
Well, you haven't had a happy ending
with Kam yet.

262
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,880
Yeah.

263
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,000
Saying that makes me stressed.

264
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,960
Why is no one picking up?
Both Mom and Nutty aren't answering.

265
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,760
They turned off their phones?

266
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,480
This is all because of you, Thua!

267
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,120
So, how’s it going, new mom?

268
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,520
Wow, I finally understand
what everyone meant

269
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,200
when they said to rest
and stock up before giving birth.

270
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,640
But it's a happy kind of tiredness, right?

271
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,600
Exactly, but it's not too bad
since my parents

272
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,440
argue over who gets to care for the baby.

273
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,880
How’s everyone doing?

274
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Well, I think I’ll keep
the Laab restaurant open.

275
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,960
I’ll have Granny and Arm help out.

276
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,680
As for me, I got into a new school.
I’ll be back for the next term.

277
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,680
I’m planning to go back to school too.

278
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,880
I’m so happy to see everyone doing well.

279
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,840
This is like what they say,
"If we don’t give up,

280
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,080
life will always have a way forward."

281
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,920
But it’s a pity, we don’t have
any special powers anymore.

282
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,560
That’s because all our wishes came true.

283
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,360
But I’m still thinking
what we should do with our page.

284
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,760
People are still sending us

285
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,000
requests for help every day.

286
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,800
I think we should tell them the truth.

287
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,440
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

288
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,280
Today, we have an important announcement
for all our followers.

289
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,520
It's time for our page to close down.

290
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,400
The reason is that all the heroes here

291
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,560
no longer have their powers.

292
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,000
Actually, we're just regular people,
like everyone else.

293
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,400
Our powers were a result
of a strange coincidence.

294
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,720
On the day we had our problems,
we were on the same bus,

295
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,400
and that bus got into an accident

296
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,920
at a place with a sacred presence.

297
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,360
We made a wish and gained powers.

298
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,680
Since then, we’ve used our powers

299
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,560
to help others and solve our own problems.

300
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,560
Now that our problems are resolved,

301
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,800
our powers have disappeared.

302
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,840
We can’t use our powers anymore.

303
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,400
So, from now on,

304
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,520
there will be no more
"Please be generous" heroes,

305
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,200
but we will continue
to do good as ordinary humans.

306
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,920
And we believe everyone can do the same.

307
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,320
Thank you for everything.

308
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,320
We hope everyone will help

309
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,000
take care of our society.

310
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,320
Now, we must say goodbye.

311
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,160
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

312
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,880
Bye!

313
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,560
Stay strong!

314
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,680
Hey.

315
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,840
So, "Please be generous" heroes

316
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,880
were just regular people like us?

317
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,200
If that’s the case,

318
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,840
then I can be a hero too!

319
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,200
Do you know where to go to make a wish?

320
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,480
It's easy.

321
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,600
Just search old news to find
where bus accidents have happened.

322
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,880
Look, I found it!

323
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,640
Hey, that was quick!

324
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,680
Seriously?

325
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,720
Now, I'm finally going
to have magical powers

326
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,920
and be a hero too.

327
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,040
Dear spirit, please grant me a magic hand.

328
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,160
I want to fly. I'm so tired of traffic.

329
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,680
I want to be charming,
so everyone falls for me.

330
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,600
I want lots of people to love me.

331
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,160
Please. Amen.

332
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,960
Just give it to me!

333
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,680
With all this fighting,
I wonder if I'll even get it.

334
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,120
Come on, kids, come on! Twenty baht
for the "Please be generous" mask,

335
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
the hero mask! Hurry up!

336
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,600
Look, the "Please be generous" heroes
have become a fashion trend now.

337
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,760
"Please be generous" heroes!

338
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,960
It's unbelievable

339
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,520
that people found the crash site
from the news

340
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,080
and rushed to make wishes.

341
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,360
It would be great
if more people gained powers,

342
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,640
then we'd have more heroes.

343
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,400
Why do you want more heroes, though?

344
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,600
Well, we still haven't caught Peem yet.

345
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,400
May you give us an interview?

346
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,040
It’s been ten days
since Mr. Peem's disappearance.

347
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,560
How do you feel about it, Ms. Pethai?

348
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,960
Has Mr. Peem not contacted you at all?

349
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,960
Do you not know that Mr. Peem was involved
in human trafficking?

350
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,920
What do you think?

351
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,200
I will answer this question
for the last time.

352
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,960
I truly did not know about Mr. Peem's
involvement in human trafficking.

353
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,640
To me, this is wrong
both legally and morally.

354
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,600
I stand with what is right

355
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,200
and hope that the police
will catch the perpetrators soon.

356
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,680
Does that mean you won’t try to help?

357
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,240
What do you mean?

358
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,240
I will not intervene,
and I hope the punishment will be severe.

359
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,600
They both managed to escape,

360
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,040
both my mom and Nutty.

361
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,920
- Hello.
- Mr. Peem.

362
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,560
I have a way to help you
escape the country.

363
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,520
We can leave tomorrow.

364
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,280
I’m not going anywhere.

365
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,360
I need to get back at those
who hurt me first.

366
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,640
‪AH'S BUS GARAGE 30 YEARS CELEBRATION

367
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,040
Everyone, don't hold back!

368
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,880
It's the 30th anniversary
of my bus garage.

369
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,640
Let's make it a blast today!

370
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,640
We’ve got food, music, everything
you need. Just say the word.

371
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,720
Let's go.

372
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,280
Ah is so amazing,

373
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,080
starting from nothing,
and now look at what he’s built.

374
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,000
You can do it too. I’m rooting for you.

375
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,920
Whoa, alright!

376
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,080
In 30 years, I’ll celebrate the success
of my restaurant, Laab Itthirit!

377
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,720
One year is enough.

378
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,840
I’m not sure I’ll make it that long!

379
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,480
Come on, Mom.

380
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,920
Have you decided on your major yet?

381
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,200
Uh, I want to study psychology.
I want to help others.

382
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,280
You're always serious.

383
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,040
Good, I like it.

384
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,840
Hey! Someone requested this song!

385
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,680
Got it!

386
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,520
You all must be so happy
having such a big celebration like this.

387
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,320
I’m really sad I couldn’t join,

388
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
so I’m sending a gift instead.

389
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,640
There’s a bomb hidden at this party,

390
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,640
and it will activate in 30 minutes.

391
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,160
Quick, everyone, run!

392
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,640
- There’s a bomb!
- A bomb?

393
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,720
A bomb!

394
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,840
Everyone!

395
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,320
Hurry up and run!

396
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,760
Go!

397
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,880
Oh my gosh!

398
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,560
- Kam, hurry!
- Don't worry about me!

399
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,720
I need to call the police first.
Just a moment!

400
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,960
Run first. Now's not the time.
You can call them later.

401
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,040
We need to stay safe. Go!

402
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,920
Arm, Dr. Korn, take everyone and run now.

403
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,280
- Please!
- What about you, Thua?

404
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,640
I'll find the bomb first.

405
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,800
Why are you finding it?

406
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,680
Because it’s not just Ah's bus garage,
it’s the whole community.

407
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,920
Ah's bus garage is huge.
How can you find it all by yourself, Thua?

408
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,560
We have 30 minutes. Let's just run, okay?

409
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,960
But if we all look together,
we might find it faster.

410
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,600
It’s dangerous.

411
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,000
But we're a team, Thua.

412
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,560
Ugh, stop talking.
Let’s go find it quickly!

413
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,440
Okay, if we have five minutes left,
we have to run. Is that okay?

414
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,520
- Okay!
- Got it!

415
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,800
Alright, spread out.

416
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,920
- Go!
- Go!

417
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,600
Thank you. Officer, please hurry!

418
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,400
How fast can they really be? You know
how bad the traffic is in Bangkok.

419
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,760
Thua? Has anyone seen him?

420
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,400
Granny, Phakbung, Typhoon?
Have they not come out yet?

421
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,120
Thua went to find the bomb, Ms. Kam.

422
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,800
What? Why would he do that?

423
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,760
He said he doesn’t want
this place to blow up.

424
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,440
It can set fire to the whole community.

425
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,360
He's right. If the garage burns,

426
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,920
the community’s doomed, Dad.

427
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,720
- No bomb in the office.
- No bomb here either.

428
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,800
We’ve got 20 minutes left.

429
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,240
Ugh, wish we could stop time!

430
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,840
Wishing won’t help now.

431
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,360
Come on. Everyone’s working
so hard together. We’ll find it.

432
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,360
Let’s keep looking.

433
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,680
- Let’s go!
- Let’s go!

434
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,320
We’re helping too.

435
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,360
Why did you come back here?
It’s too dangerous!

436
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,840
This isn’t just my garage.

437
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,440
But it’s our community!

438
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,360
That’s right.
We have to protect our homes!

439
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,160
I called the police.
The EOD team is on their way.

440
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,240
Let’s stop arguing and go!
We’ve got 18 minutes left. Let's find it.

441
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,200
Alright, listen up!
If you find the bomb, don’t touch it.

442
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,480
If we’ve got only five minutes left
and it’s still not found, run!

443
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,800
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

444
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,800
- Go!
- Go!

445
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,360
Let's find it.

446
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,640
Have you found it, Seng?

447
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,080
- No, not yet.
- Look deeper!

448
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,760
Doctor, check there!

449
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,880
I found the bomb!

450
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,160
Kam!

451
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,720
- Kam!
- Ms. Kam!

452
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,080
Kam!

453
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,760
‪With a bomb stuck like this,

454
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,560
we shouldn’t move it around.

455
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,640
Yeah, it could explode
if we tamper with it.

456
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,800
Then, I think we need to move this bus as
far away from the community as possible.

457
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,560
Everyone, get out of the car.
I’ll handle it.

458
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,720
Trust me.

459
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,400
You too, Ms. Kam.

460
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,120
Ms. Kam, why are you still on the bus?

461
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,320
I’ll stay with you.

462
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,159
Don’t argue. We don’t have much time left.

463
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,840
Oh, right.

464
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,679
Wait!

465
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,360
What if it explodes
when we start the ignition?

466
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,560
Oh, right.

467
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,199
What should we do then?

468
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,840
You’re all finished.

469
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,960
Go!

470
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,080
- Just a little more!
- We’re almost there!

471
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,040
Go!

472
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,000
Everyone, move away from the bus!

473
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,720
- Ms. Kam!
- Let’s go, Thua.

474
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,440
Yes.

475
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,880
Ouch!

476
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,280
- Ms. Kam!
- Ms. Kam!

477
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,800
- Ms. Kam!
- Don’t! Don’t go!

478
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,600
Is everything alright? Ride on my back.

479
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,480
The bomb is in
the bus engine compartment, officer.

480
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,920
Kam!

481
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,360
Are you okay?

482
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,480
I’m okay.

483
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,760
You’re safe now.

484
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,920
After a long search,

485
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,200
the police have received another
lead on Peem's whereabouts,

486
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,480
following an attempted bombing
at a bus garage,

487
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:33,080
which was successfully handled
by the community.

488
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,520
This led to further investigation

489
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:40,080
and the capture of the suspect,

490
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,480
who is now being processed

491
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,000
for legal action.

492
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,280
Finally, it's really over this time.

493
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,840
Alright, everyone,

494
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,200
let's go back to celebrating
as we were before.

495
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,560
- Seng!
- Yes.

496
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,840
Play the music now.
And I mean the real music.

497
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,960
Got it.

498
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,600
Kam.

499
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,480
- Thua.
- What are you doing sitting here?

500
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,560
Just watching everyone.

501
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,320
Do you think like I do?

502
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,080
About what happened today?

503
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,200
Actually, in this world,
if everyone works together

504
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,800
and helps each other, I think

505
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,360
there's no need for heroes
or people with superpowers, right?

506
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,640
But for me, today, there was someone.

507
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,080
Someone who carried me out.

508
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,600
Ms. Kam…

509
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,840
At that time, it was just the two of us.

510
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,920
Can you always be my hero?

511
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,960
Miss… Kam.

512
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,600
What do you mean?

513
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,600
Well, it’s you! Always acting cool,

514
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,080
I have to say it myself.

515
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,760
So, do you like me or not?

516
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,800
Of course I do!

517
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,560
I've liked you
since the first time we met.

518
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,000
That's it.

519
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,480
Hey, what’s going on here?

520
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,320
How can you like each other
if I don't approve?

521
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,520
Dad, what now?

522
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,480
I’ll approve, but…

523
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,960
You have to dance with me first.

524
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,680
Dance with me.

525
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,680
Okay?

526
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,680
After the struggles we've been through,

527
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,800
I finally understand.

528
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,800
Even though everyone’s life may be
difficult or there are problems to solve,

529
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,960
we can get through everything

530
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:34,080
if we have the strength, determination,
and belief in what’s right.

531
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,280
Even without superpowers, it’s okay.

532
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,120
As long as we have kindness
and are ready to help,

533
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,560
we’re each other’s heroes.

534
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,760
- Yes, and then Granny sat over there.
- Yes.

535
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:11,600
Everyone, are you ready?
I'm gonna take the photo now.

536
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,120
- Okay.
- Come on.

537
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,160
Here we go.

538
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,600
- Hurry up!
- Hurry up!

539
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,920
Be careful, Doctor.

540
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,360
- Yay!
- Yay!

541
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,240
