1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,760
<i>Please help me. Please kill her for me.</i>

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,440
<i>If you don't help me,</i>

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,640
<i>I will kill her myself.</i>

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,760
She seems questionable, Granny.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,080
Asking us to kill someone?

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,080
‪PREVIOUSLY

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,360
Is that a gun? I saw someone
bring a gun into a hospital.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,080
- Stop!
- What the hell are you doing?

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,080
- Die!
- Stop! You're gonna kill her!

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,800
Hey, wait!

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,360
Why did you help me?
Getting arrested might be a good idea,

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,760
so I can tell the reporters
what Prang did.

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,600
<i>She runs a modeling agency as a front.</i>

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,800
<i>In reality, she lured us</i>
<i>to film pornography</i>

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,040
<i>and used it to blackmail us,</i>
<i>so we'd do whatever they wanted.</i>

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,600
<i>My daughter is one of her victims.</i>

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,600
We cannot let Ms. Kam know
that we're "Please be generous"

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,480
or things will get more complicated.

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,320
We have more important things
to take care of.

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,800
Are we gonna do it today?

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,160
This hero is so ready for the mission,
he's shaking!

22
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,920
<i>You're all under arrest.</i>

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
THE RINGLEADER

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,920
EVIDENCE

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,880
All the evidence is in the warehouse.

26
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,000
Please take over the case, officers.

27
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,480
Why do these four look familiar?

28
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,560
<i>The police raided</i>
<i>the hideout of the modeling agency</i>

29
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,000
<i>that was blackmailing children thanks</i>
<i>to the leads from "Please be generous".</i>

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,120
<i>When they arrived,</i>
<i>many suspected were found tied up,</i>

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,920
<i>but one of them managed to escape.</i>

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,640
<i>After the interrogations,</i>
<i>the police believe</i>

33
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,360
<i>the person who avoided capture</i>

34
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,200
<i>is the ringleader.</i>

35
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,160
THE RINGLEADER

36
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,360
But we tied them up already.
How did Prang manage to escape?

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,280
Exactly.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,120
Everyone’s tied up now.

39
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,960
We’ve found the evidence.

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,200
Then we don’t need to wait anymore.

41
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,080
Let’s go tell the police.

42
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,600
- Go.
- Let's go!

43
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,560
THE RINGLEADER

44
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,120
You ruined me,
so you’re all going down too!

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,280
Damn!

46
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,840
We tied her up so well,
and she still managed to escape.

47
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,520
What do we do now?

48
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,960
Hey!

49
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,600
What’s up, Bung?

50
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,880
Prang used a fake account
to send a message,

51
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,800
saying she has
more compromising photos of Anya.

52
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,440
- And other kids.
- Huh?

53
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,240
Was she just threatening us?

54
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,560
She’s not just threatening us.
She sent the pictures too.

55
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,120
And there are more pictures of the kids.

56
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,760
PLEASE BE GENEROUS

57
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,040
What does she want?

58
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,560
Prang also messaged saying that tomorrow,

59
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,360
the "Please be generous" team

60
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,200
must livestream and reveal their faces
by taking off their masks.

61
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,640
If they don't do it,

62
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,800
the compromising photos of the kids
will be posted on social media.

63
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,560
This is bad, really bad.

64
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,640
If we reveal our true identities,

65
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,720
we’re definitely going to get caught
and experimented on.

66
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,320
But if she really does post
the compromising photos of the kids,

67
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,960
even if we get caught,
we’ll have to accept it.

68
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,440
We have to reveal our faces
to help all the kids.

69
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,600
<i>Reveal your faces</i>
<i>or I'll leak the compromising pics</i>

70
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,480
<i>of the kids in five minutes.</i>

71
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
PLEASE BE GENEROUS

72
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,360
<i>Please don’t release the kids’ pictures.</i>
<i>We’ll reveal ourselves now.</i>

73
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,480
Alright, let’s do it.

74
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,440
Hey, "Please be generous"
is about to reveal themselves!

75
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,200
- Hey, come look, Auntie!
- What?

76
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,520
- Auntie!
- Where?

77
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,800
Hey, hey! "Please be generous"
is about to reveal themselves.

78
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,160
Hurry up!

79
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
<i>The one who’s about</i>
<i>to be exposed isn’t us.</i>

80
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,840
<i>It’s you!</i>

81
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,960
You dare talk back to me?

82
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,520
Alright, I’ll release
all the videos of the kids.

83
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,680
What’s with the power going out now?

84
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,880
The internet’s down again. Dammit!

85
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,480
How did you get in here?

86
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,640
I’ve thought about it,
and we really shouldn’t reveal ourselves.

87
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,440
But Prang said she’ll release
the compromising photos of the kids.

88
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,720
I can’t let that happen.

89
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,000
We can't let her win, Granny.

90
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,000
Right now, we need to find Prang

91
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,680
and get the kids' photos
before she does anything like that.

92
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,000
Just one day?
How can we find someone in one day?

93
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,200
We’ll have to look at people close to her.

94
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,159
But from what I know,
she doesn’t have any siblings.

95
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,640
She only has her subordinates.

96
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,360
Yeah, right. Her subordinates!

97
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,960
We should go ask her subordinates.

98
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,760
But they're being held
at the police station.

99
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,040
If we go ask them,
we’ll definitely be suspected

100
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,560
of being involved with Prang.

101
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,600
It’s too risky.

102
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,360
Then we don’t need to investigate.

103
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,040
We’ll have someone we trust

104
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,360
investigate for us instead.

105
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,720
The police said you guys
won’t say anything about Prang,

106
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,440
even though she left you

107
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,400
and ran off alone.

108
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,320
Why are you protecting her?

109
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,760
If everyone runs away with me,
we'll all be accomplices.

110
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,760
But if I run away alone, all the blame

111
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,160
will fall on me.

112
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,320
So, everyone stay here,

113
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,280
stay quiet, and don’t mention me.

114
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,800
That way, everyone will be safe. Got it?

115
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,040
- Got it.
- Okay.

116
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,960
I don’t know anything about Prang.

117
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,000
Don't ask. I don’t know.

118
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,800
If you think answering like this
will save you,

119
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,280
you’re wrong.

120
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,840
The police already said
that everyone has to be punished.

121
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,560
Prang didn’t say that.

122
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,960
I knew it! You were tricked by Prang.

123
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,880
You’ll be in prison for a long time.

124
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,960
No! Soon, my wife will be giving birth.

125
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,640
But Prang, your boss,

126
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,160
is about to harm
hundreds or thousands of kids.

127
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,400
She plans to post
all the explicit images on social media.

128
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,120
Don’t you feel sorry for the kids?

129
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,800
What if the kid
who’s suffering was your own?

130
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,880
How would you feel?

131
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,160
How did you find me?

132
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,880
It's because your subordinates
woke up to the truth.

133
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,280
No one is protecting someone
as evil as you anymore.

134
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,160
This time, we won’t let you escape.

135
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,840
Dream on.

136
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,760
Hey!

137
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,240
What’s happening?

138
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,680
What did you do to me just now?

139
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,240
Why am I in this state?

140
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,080
You guys aren’t human, right?
You guys are definitely monsters.

141
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,960
The only monster in this room is you.

142
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,640
You’re a horrible creature,

143
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,280
preying on innocent children
until they commit suicide.

144
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,800
You’re not human!

145
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,200
Stop playing your moral lesson games.

146
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,880
Stop teaching me. It’s annoying.

147
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,200
If you want to arrest me, go ahead.
I’m not afraid.

148
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,520
A few years in prison?
I’ll be out and living my life again.

149
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,160
Prison would be too easy for you.

150
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,960
We’ll punish you ourselves.

151
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,520
What are you going to do?

152
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,040
Hey!

153
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,680
Hey! Ugh!

154
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,680
Got it from the restaurant.

155
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,280
Ugh!

156
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,800
Have you dug the hole yet?

157
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,640
Three meters deep.

158
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,360
- Good!
- No good!

159
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,320
Please, don’t do anything to me!

160
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,640
If you don’t want us to punish you,

161
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,000
you’ll have to follow our orders.

162
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,720
Okay! Tell me what to do.

163
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,040
Just one thing. I want to go to jail.
I don’t want to die.

164
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,160
I confess.

165
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,040
I'm the owner of a modeling agency

166
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,320
that tricked kids
into filming pornographic videos

167
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,720
in order to sell them.

168
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,360
And then,

169
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,600
I used those videos to threaten
and blackmail the kids

170
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,840
into doing whatever I wanted.

171
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,400
The kids aren't at fault at all.

172
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,120
It's all my fault.

173
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,520
<i>We’ve already handed</i>
<i>all the evidence over to the police.</i>

174
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,880
<i>As for the remaining evidence,</i>
<i>we destroyed it</i>

175
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,800
<i>to make sure it can't be used again.</i>

176
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,160
<i>There’s danger around us every day.</i>

177
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,080
<i>Everyone has to be careful.</i>
<i>Don’t trust anyone too easily.</i>

178
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,840
<i>Don’t let anyone</i>
<i>record compromising videos of us.</i>

179
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,200
<i>Because if something unexpected happens,</i>

180
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,800
<i>we’ll be the ones who regret it the most.</i>

181
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,120
Oh, so cool!

182
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,160
I kind of regret it.
They were about to reveal their faces.

183
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,720
It might be a boy,

184
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,400
a teenage boy and girl,

185
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,320
and a slightly older woman.

186
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,880
Why do they feel so familiar?

187
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,720
They're so familiar,

188
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,200
like I’ve seen them before.

189
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,160
"The hero, 'Please be generous',
exposed the modeling agency."

190
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,520
"'Please be generous' uncovered
the agency's exploitation of kids."

191
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,320
"Those who do good should be praised.

192
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,760
'Please be generous'
is the pride of Thailand."

193
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,280
Why isn't there any news about me
joining the political party?

194
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,920
How will the public know?

195
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,160
Sorry, I’ve sent the news
to various pages,

196
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,000
but now, the "Please be generous"
hero news is huge.

197
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,680
Everyone’s cheering for them
to become the prime minister

198
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,720
or analyzing who these people are.

199
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,120
No one’s paying attention
to your news, Mr. Peem.

200
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,040
If it stays quiet like this,
it could be bad.

201
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,200
I won’t let them steal the spotlight.

202
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,600
But the news
is all about them right now, sir.

203
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,800
We can create our own buzz

204
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,600
if we control the media.

205
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,840
Contact this woman.

206
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,200
She applied to be my assistant.
I’ll interview her myself.

207
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,320
What are you planning to do, Mr. Peem?

208
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,560
This woman's profile is interesting.

209
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,200
She's close with the media,
which could be useful for us.

210
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,000
Understood.

211
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,720
I've secretly admired your work
for a long time, Mr. Peem.

212
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,920
I'm so happy
that you called me in for an interview.

213
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,600
I really like your ideals

214
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,480
and would love to work with you.

215
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,040
If you want to work together,

216
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,400
stop calling me Mr. Peem.

217
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,720
First, you should call me Peem.

218
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,520
Go ahead. Try calling me that.

219
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,040
Peem.

220
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,760
That's cute.

221
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,320
You're way cuter than I am, Peem.

222
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,480
I don't even know what I'm saying.

223
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,080
I'm about to work with you!

224
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,680
I'm happy to hear
that you appreciate my work.

225
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,000
Even though I’ve been a bit quiet lately,

226
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,200
even after joining a political party,

227
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,360
no one seems to care,
and no one has covered my story yet.

228
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,240
I care, though.

229
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,720
But if not enough people care,

230
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,600
I won’t be able to do work for the people.

231
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,800
In politics, it’s not just about skill,

232
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,720
you also need to rely on your reputation.

233
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,280
I’ll help you, Peem.

234
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,560
My dad is the head
of the TV news department.

235
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,680
I’ll talk to him and get some reporters
to cover your story.

236
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,440
Would that be okay?

237
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,000
Good people should be supported.

238
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,880
Thank you very much, my new assistant.

239
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,000
Does this mean I’ve already got the job?

240
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,000
Yes.

241
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,920
Thank you so much, Peem!

242
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,760
If you need anything, just let me know.

243
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,440
Great! If that's the case,

244
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,480
could you arrange a meeting
with your dad today?

245
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,360
Tomorrow,

246
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,800
I’ll be volunteering
to build a restroom at a temple.

247
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,680
I want the public to know
that I’m doing this for them.

248
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,880
Of course!

249
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Thank you.

250
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,760
Rungfah and Anya sent a video.

251
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,480
Let’s watch it quickly.

252
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,920
Thua!

253
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,040
Come here. Here!

254
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,440
- Ready?
- Oh, go ahead, Granny.

255
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,320
<i>Hello, our heroes.</i>

256
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,640
<i>Anya.</i>

257
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,680
<i>Do you have anything</i>
<i>you want to tell them? Go ahead, dear.</i>

258
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,680
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

259
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,840
<i>If it weren’t for you all helping,</i>

260
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,360
<i>I wouldn’t know how I would keep going.</i>

261
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,560
<i>You all gave me and my child</i>

262
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,840
<i>the strength to keep going in this world.</i>

263
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,480
<i>I’m really grateful.</i>

264
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,640
- So sweet, right?
- Yes.

265
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,040
Can I show this video to Ms. Kam?

266
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,680
She helped us with this case too.

267
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,680
I think she’d be really happy to see it.

268
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,560
Okay, but you have to promise

269
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,840
not to say who it’s from.

270
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,960
Okay, but can I ask for one more thing?

271
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,120
What?

272
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,520
- Just one thing.
- What is it?

273
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
Trust each other.

274
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,400
Ms. Kam,

275
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,120
the hero kindly sent a picture
with their signatures for you

276
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,840
in order to thank you for your help.

277
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,000
Please thank them for me. That’s so sweet.

278
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,040
Granny, look at this!

279
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,760
That's very cute!

280
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,160
But honestly,
I don’t need anything in return.

281
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,160
Just knowing that I helped someone
makes me really happy.

282
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,880
That’s even sweeter.

283
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,440
Huh?

284
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,520
Huh?

285
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,800
Oh, here it is! Oh, Typhoon!

286
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
You’re even cuter when you walk over.

287
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,000
Look, he's so cute.

288
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,480
I’m not cute.

289
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,840
I’m handsome.

290
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,600
Granny!

291
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,640
Oh, Typhoon!

292
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,200
Hey, Kam, there’s one more thing.

293
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,960
"Please be generous" wants you
to watch the video

294
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,840
where Rungfah and Anya
are expressing their thanks.

295
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,760
- I’ll send it to you in a minute.
- Okay.

296
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,000
Hold on a sec.

297
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,840
Peem is livestreaming.

298
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,840
<i>We’re going to restore this temple today.</i>

299
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,560
<i>Please help with the painting</i>

300
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,040
<i>and cleaning around the temple, okay?</i>

301
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,560
- He’s on-site at the temple right now.
- <i>There.</i>

302
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,120
- Um.
- <i>Over there.</i>

303
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,520
- Whoa, so many TV reporters are there!
- <i>What are you doing today?</i>

304
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,160
<i>We’re going to distribute food.</i>

305
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,400
- Hmm?
- <i>And…</i>

306
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Who's next to your boyfriend?

307
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,920
<i>I haven’t looked into it yet.</i>

308
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,120
I don't know either.

309
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,520
- <i>Photo, please.</i>
- <i>Thank you.</i>

310
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,360
She’s beautiful.

311
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,480
Look, she’s even wiping the sweat off him.

312
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,160
I bet they’re really close.

313
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,440
Hey, don’t say that.

314
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,080
His girlfriend is sitting right here.

315
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,200
Oh.

316
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,120
But, who's the woman
next to her boyfriend?

317
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,080
Why does she have to wipe
his face and sweat?

318
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,200
Isn't that the job

319
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,680
of his real girlfriend?

320
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,880
Oh, this already hurts enough.

321
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,720
Don't make it worse.

322
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,840
Granny, you’re really making it worse.

323
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,520
Ms. Kam!

324
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,160
Don’t overthink. It’s nothing.

325
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,360
Peem really likes you.

326
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,840
Well…

327
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,800
The clouds aren’t the same every day,

328
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,040
and people’s hearts are like that too.

329
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,960
Today, they say they like you a lot,

330
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,320
but tomorrow,
they might change their mind.

331
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,000
- Granny!
- Granny!

332
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,640
Granny has a point!

333
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,080
I have to see it for myself.

334
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,400
Ms. Kam!

335
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,040
Oh.

336
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,880
- Oh, Ms. Kam.
- Ms. Kam!

337
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,160
- Granny.
- Oh!

338
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,400
- Ms. Kam!
- Ms. Kam!

339
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,840
- Can I go with you?
- Kam!

340
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,360
- Granny!
- Ugh! Wait for me.

341
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,480
I want to see with my own eyes too.

342
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,400
Oh, what about the Laab restaurant?

343
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,720
It’s closed. In the afternoon,

344
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,440
it doesn't sell very well anyway.

345
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,600
So, I let Typhoon and Bung take a break.

346
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,040
I’m not in the mood to cook either.

347
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,640
I do want to know who that woman is.

348
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,360
That’s right. I want to know too.

349
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,480
Then, let’s hurry up.

350
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,800
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

351
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,320
So, who's the real girlfriend?

352
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,520
Wait for me!

353
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,160
Oh, he's there!

354
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,680
Just working.
Doesn't seem like anything's happening.

355
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,520
Peem, wait a moment.

356
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
Look closely.

357
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,120
The woman wipes the sweat,
the man wipes the paint.

358
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,600
Don’t they have hands?

359
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,640
- Hey!
- Hey, Ms. Kam!

360
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,000
Why are you stopping time?

361
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,160
Well, we need to find evidence first.

362
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,320
If we find it,
we can let Ms. Kam go ahead.

363
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,840
How will we find evidence, Granny?

364
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,040
Look for secrets.

365
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,320
Here, Granny.

366
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,000
Grab it!

367
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,360
Hurry up, Thua.

368
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,400
Wait, password! Oh, face scan.

369
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,600
He’s not getting away with this.

370
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,840
Found anything?

371
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,200
Chat room? Saying "I miss you"?

372
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,200
"I love you", anything?

373
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,120
‪Hey!

374
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,840
Did you find it?

375
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,120
Yes, I did.

376
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,040
But it’s not Peem telling
another girl "I love you".

377
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,680
- Huh?
- It’s Ms. Kam telling Peem,

378
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,360
"I miss you."

379
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,840
It hurts my heart.

380
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,560
That means

381
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,240
Peem didn’t chat with this woman?

382
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,920
I think

383
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,840
If I were dating Kam, I wouldn’t cheat.

384
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,160
I think nothing’s going on
between them, Granny.

385
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,400
Not chatting doesn’t mean
there’s nothing going on.

386
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,600
I don’t know, but look at the way
they look at each other.

387
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,240
There's a spark, something playful
I can't quite describe it.

388
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,080
I think there’s definitely
something going on.

389
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,600
What should we do now, Granny?

390
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,560
Do nothing.

391
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,320
Let Kam handle this!

392
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,320
Should we give it back to him?

393
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,880
Thua!

394
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,800
That was close.

395
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,840
Go now, fast!

396
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,840
What are you all up to?

397
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,680
Oh, Kam!

398
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,280
Why didn’t you say you were coming?
I could’ve invited you to volunteer.

399
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,840
Maybe you forgot to invite me

400
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,440
because someone else
was already helping out.

401
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,000
This is Nutty, my new assistant.

402
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,800
Nutty, this is Kam, my girlfriend.

403
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,960
Excuse me, Mr. Peem.

404
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,000
It’s time to hand out the food.

405
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,560
Alright.

406
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,200
Kam, I’ll head off now.
If you’d like to help, join in.

407
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,960
Got it.

408
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,120
Introducing his girlfriend
in front of another woman

409
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,160
shows he has nothing to hide.

410
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,560
I’d say there’s probably nothing going on.

411
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,400
Right? So, should we head back?

412
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,560
Not yet.

413
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,080
My gut tells me
there’s something odd here.

414
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,840
I need to find out.

415
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,720
If that’s what you think,

416
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,360
then I’ll help investigate!

417
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,760
Alright, don’t forget
to take the water as well.

418
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,160
Here you go.

419
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,400
Thanks.

420
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,520
Thanks.

421
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,680
Here.

422
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,280
- Peem.
- Thank you.

423
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,800
Yes?

424
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,240
- I’m heading home now.
- Okay.

425
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,120
If you’re tired, take a break.
Don’t overdo it.

426
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,200
Please take care
of my boyfriend, assistant.

427
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,880
Got it.

428
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,000
Call me when you get home. I miss you.

429
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,600
I miss you too.

430
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,640
Mr. Peem, may I talk to you for a moment?

431
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,480
Sure.

432
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,440
Nutty, I’ll be right back.
Handle things here for me.

433
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,320
Yes.

434
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,560
What is it?

435
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,840
Mr. Peem, you should be careful.

436
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,040
The way you’re handling
both of them like this,

437
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,880
I’m afraid you might lose both.

438
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,800
You’re worrying about nothing.

439
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,280
I’m not that weak.

440
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,360
Kam and Nutty are the two
who can help push me forward.

441
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,360
I’ll keep both of them.

442
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,560
Nutty.

443
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,280
Why are you sitting here alone?

444
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,320
Why don’t you ask yourself
what you’ve done?

445
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,480
You already have a girlfriend,

446
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,760
but you’re treating me
like you’re still single.

447
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,320
Are you trying to get my dad
to share the news?

448
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,960
If that’s the case, I’m not okay with it.

449
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,360
Nutty.

450
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,080
There’s a real reason for this.

451
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,560
There’s something I haven’t told anyone,

452
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,320
but I need to tell you.

453
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,800
My mom is forcing me to be with Kam.

454
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,320
Is your mom from the Ayutthaya period?

455
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,600
This is modern times,
and she’s still trying to force you?

456
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,400
It’s true, Nutty.

457
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,360
My parents and Kam’s parents are friends,

458
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,680
so they want us to be together.

459
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,040
But I can’t force myself to stay in this.

460
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,320
I’m trying to break up with Kam
without hurting my mom.

461
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,000
I just need some time.

462
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,200
Please understand.

463
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,840
Are you making this up?

464
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,840
If you don’t believe me,
I’ll call my mom right now.

465
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,960
MOM

466
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,040
Okay.

467
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,200
You don’t need to bother your mom.
I believe you now.

468
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,880
But if you really want
to break up with her,

469
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,480
today I need your time, just for me.

470
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,160
Is that okay?

471
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,600
Of course.

472
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,080
KAM

473
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,600
Today, my time is only for you, Nutty.

474
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,200
Not answering the phone, what is he doing?

475
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,000
If you want to know,
why didn’t you stay with him?

476
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,200
Why did you go say goodbye
to him before leaving?

477
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,640
Because a good detective shouldn't let
the target know where we are.

478
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,960
Smart! Well done.

479
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,080
You're good at praising.

480
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,160
In that case, why don't you introduce me
to "Please be generous"?

481
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,200
I can be a hero too.

482
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,640
You and Granny should join me
to become heroes.

483
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,800
Among those four,
two look like you and Granny,

484
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,880
so you both could be heroes too.

485
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,000
Me? Oh, no.

486
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,720
I’m too old for that.

487
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,840
When I walk,

488
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,320
my knees crack, and I’m not sure
if I can hold them together.

489
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,760
Let me rest, please.

490
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,080
As for Thua, he's been sick.

491
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,960
He couldn't do it either.

492
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,920
What disease does he have?

493
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,320
Lung disease.

494
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,640
Lung disease?

495
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,520
Pneumonia, lung infection,

496
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,120
lung inflammation?

497
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,480
Well, I'm just chicken-hearted.

498
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,880
I’m too scared. I don’t think
I could be a hero.

499
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,520
It’s okay.
Everyone has their own strengths.

500
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,160
Just help me investigate.

501
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,520
Ms. Kam!

502
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,960
Wake up, Ms. Kam.

503
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,200
- What?
- Ms. Kam!

504
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,520
- Wake up!
- Ugh, just took a nap.

505
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,760
Stop bothering me.

506
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,320
Alright, I won’t bother you.

507
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,120
But your boyfriend just got in the car
with that beautiful assistant.

508
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,640
- What?
- Huh?

509
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,440
What are we waiting for? Hurry up!

510
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,280
But, Ms. Kam, it’s that way.

511
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,360
Ugh, why didn’t you tell me sooner?

512
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,000
Oh, let’s go.

513
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,880
- Wait for me!
- Wait for me!

514
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,560
Let’s go together.

515
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,600
- Get in, Granny.
- Let's go!

516
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,159
- Which side?
- Granny, this side.

517
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,840
Let’s go!

518
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,040
- Oh.
- To where?

519
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,840
Follow that car.

520
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,400
There they are!

521
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,760
Oh.

522
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,440
- Is something wrong?
- It's okay.

523
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,760
This is crossing the line.

524
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,240
- Argh!
- Ms. Kam!

525
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,480
What's going on? Why did everything stop,

526
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,560
except me and you?

527
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,400
Even the watch’s stopped ticking.

528
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,440
Can you stop time, Granny?

529
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,560
Or are you one
of the "Please be generous" heroes?

530
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,120
Alright, let's talk honestly
about the truth.

531
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,360
Is it okay, Kam?
This might get embarrassing.

532
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,160
See, she didn’t even laugh.

533
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,640
Okay, Ms. Kam.

534
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,960
We’re the real
"Please be generous" heroes.

535
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,600
But please don’t be mad.

536
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,680
We had to keep it a secret for a reason.

537
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,640
Really.

538
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,360
Then show me your powers first.

539
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,680
Everyone, step aside.

540
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,120
Step aside.

541
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,240
I just got cut by a knife yesterday.

542
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,640
Wow.

543
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,480
Here I am. I’m next!

544
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,320
It needs to be touched just a little.

545
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Come on, Ms. Kam. Touch me.

546
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,040
Alright then.

547
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,080
She's confused and shocked.

548
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,240
And…

549
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,040
I can’t believe I’m seeing all this.

550
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,200
Ms. Kam, please keep this a secret.

551
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,760
It’s a matter of life
and death for all of us.

552
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,000
Please.

553
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,800
I know. I’m not mad at any of you.

554
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,760
Oh, why do you have to make
that serious face?

555
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,920
Oh, I’m so excited!

556
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,240
Tonight, I’ll definitely
have sweet dreams.

557
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,000
Don’t worry, everyone.

558
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,160
I’ll keep this secret with my life.

559
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,920
I know being heroes

560
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,360
means hiding our identities
to carry out our missions smoothly.

561
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,520
Thank you so much, Ms. Kam.

562
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,400
From now on, if you ever need our help,

563
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,160
just let us know.

564
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,000
We’re ready to use our powers
to help you, Kam.

565
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,320
Really? Well…

566
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,800
Never mind.

567
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,920
Are you sure there’s nothing you need?

568
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,600
Of course.

569
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,560
Okay.

570
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,720
So, who’s going to clean up now?

571
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,640
Probably you, Thua.

572
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,320
Let's give each other some space,
so I can reflect on things.

573
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,640
<i>I don’t know why,</i>
<i>but I feel so at ease when I’m with you.</i>

574
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,920
NEXT EPISODE

575
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
"The San Karun Foundation's
bank account got hacked."

576
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,600
I think the culprit must be
one of these three.

577
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,160
That's a lot of money!

578
