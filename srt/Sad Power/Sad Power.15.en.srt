00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,000
Thank you, Phakbung.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,760
Don’t forget. If you overuse your powers,

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,920
you’ll get weaker,
and it could affect the baby.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,480
Hey, Bung!

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,760
- Ouch!
- Hey, Bung!

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,640
- Kam, let's talk first.
- Let me go.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,400
Stop it, Peem.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,760
I've caused you so much trouble.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,920
But I'm glad I could do something for you.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,880
I'll take you to catch the real thief who
stole money from the San Karun Foundation.

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,280
So, where’s the culprit?

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,560
You waited for me, secretly followed Thua,

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,080
tried to catch someone who was
already about to turn themselves in.

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,320
When I see a thief, I have to catch them.
It’s my duty as a good citizen.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,800
Well then, go ahead
and be a good citizen your way, alone.

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,680
What are you going to do?

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,880
We’re breaking up, Peem.

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,560
I've selected the most urgent task for us.

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,760
That is to help Tonkla,
a 14-year-old child with autism,

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,840
who is regularly bullied
by his classmates.

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,920
His mom sent a message asking for our help

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,400
because he refuses to speak
about who is bullying him.

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,400
We need to investigate it.

25
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,440
I've planned
an undercover operation for everyone.

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,360
Wow, Ms. Kam!

27
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,360
You've a solution and an undercover plan.
You're amazing!

28
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,640
It's all set.
If that's the case, the meeting is over.

29
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,440
No, we can't! Let’s go over the next task.

30
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,800
Huh? This task isn’t finished yet?
There’s more?

31
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,280
Of course, we have two--

32
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,760
Two? That’s easy!

33
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,760
Two hundred and fifty-six tasks.

34
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,720
Here.

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,920
I’ve gathered all the messages
sent to the page.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,680
I've summarized them
by importance. All set.

37
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,920
Oh, Kam!

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,680
These are thousands of messages!

39
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,640
Oh, how did you finish it so quickly?

40
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,160
It's nothing.
I finished it in no time. Super easy.

41
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,959
- Hey, Ms. Kam!
- She's awake.

42
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,160
Ms. Kam, be careful.

43
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,240
How are you?

44
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,360
Don’t tell me you’ve been working
all night without sleeping.

45
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,760
Well, I was determined to finish the work,

46
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,000
but the next thing I knew, it was morning.

47
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,640
You said working hard doesn’t kill anyone,

48
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,400
but just now, you almost got into trouble.
Luckily, Phakbung was there to help.

49
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,040
Thanks so much, Phakbung.

50
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,040
I’m fine now.
Let’s continue with the work.

51
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,200
- Maybe we shouldn’t.
- Huh?

52
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,960
I think you should rest.

53
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,960
But we have so much work.

54
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,680
Oh, Ms. Kam, it’s good
that you’re focused on your work,

55
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,440
but you also need
to take care of your health.

56
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,600
Exactly. Doing good work is great,
but if your health suffers,

57
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,000
it’s not worth it.

58
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,640
And Kam, don’t let the energy
I gave you go to waste.

59
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,120
In that case, Ms. Kam should rest today.
I’ll take you back.

60
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,280
Back to rest.

61
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,080
Yes, let Thua take you back.

62
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,560
Go on, Thua.

63
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,200
- Take her back.
- Go ahead.

64
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,160
Go ahead.

65
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,560
Here, her bag.

66
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,080
Why are you taking a fan? The bag!

67
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,600
- Want me to carry you? Just kidding.
- It's fine.

68
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,160
I'm sorry for always causing problems.

69
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,560
- Hmm.
- Ouch.

70
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,400
Why did you hit the brakes?

71
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,880
I was surprised!

72
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,680
You haven’t caused any problems at all.

73
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,520
The reason everyone wants you to go home
is because they care.

74
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,520
Since you joined "Please be generous",

75
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,560
it’s made the work much easier.

76
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,840
Really?

77
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,640
Thank you so much.

78
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,680
Hey, no need to thank me.

79
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,600
I’m just happy and proud
to be with "Please be generous".

80
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,880
Helping others feels really great.

81
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,360
I think you're probably
super hungry now too, right?

82
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,160
Don’t tease me.

83
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,880
I just got caught up in work
and forgot to eat or sleep.

84
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,960
Well then, how about
we go grab something to eat?

85
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,080
Why are you smiling?

86
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,680
Huh? Uh, the cat is cute.

87
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,360
A cat? Where?

88
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,680
It jumped over there.

89
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,560
Don't worry about it.
Let's eat while it's hot.

90
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,360
Eating without talking is boring.
Tell me something.

91
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,480
What should I tell you?

92
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,400
How did the "Please be generous" team
come together?

93
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,640
Well, one day, we were on the same bus.

94
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,840
We saw a meteor shower together,

95
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,799
and then the bus crashed.

96
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,799
But it was a miracle. Everyone survived.
And then we all got powers.

97
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,520
Except for me. It's kind of bad, right?

98
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,560
Who says that’s bad? You’re special, Thua.

99
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:53,200
You don’t need superpowers
to help others. That’s so cool!

100
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,280
Cool?

101
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,040
Yeah! Take me to the accident site.
I want to see it.

102
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,320
Okay, but maybe another day.

103
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,680
I think today, you need to rest more.

104
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,120
Alright.

105
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,840
But this place is kind of cold.

106
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,320
It's not cold, though.

107
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,600
Really? I feel kind of weirdly cold.

108
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,680
But you’re sweating, Kam.

109
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,680
Sorry. Can I borrow your hand?

110
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,320
Is it hot?

111
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,480
Yeah, it's hot. Hey!

112
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,320
It’s really hot!

113
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,800
I think you might have a fever.
You should go rest right away

114
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,720
Alright. I'll rest
and come back tomorrow to help.

115
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,480
No need! Rest until you're fully better.
Then come back and help.

116
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,320
And don’t feel bad
about not working today.

117
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,200
There are still over 200 tasks
waiting for you.

118
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,160
I’ll go get you some medicine.

119
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,040
Wait here after you finish eating,
and don’t go out in the sun.

120
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,320
I'll be right back.

121
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,040
All set, Granny.

122
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,840
Let's go! I'm ready.

123
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,800
Pregnant women should be careful
and not overdo it.

124
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,680
Your job
is just to stand by outside with me.

125
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,520
Let Thua and Phoon handle things.

126
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,320
Yeah, let me take care of it.

127
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,480
Alright, everyone. Ready to go
to the Somboonpoon Sukjai School?

128
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,400
- Ready!
- Ready!

129
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,640
What’s up? Not ready?

130
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,560
I haven't perfected my disguise yet.

131
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,840
Hey, your school uniform
already looks fine.

132
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,680
What’s wrong? Just now,
you seemed like you wanted to go.

133
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,400
Nothing. Come on. Let's go!

134
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,000
Go on. Hurry up!

135
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,080
- Let's go!
- Huh?

136
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,600
- Go on!
- Let's go!

137
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,720
- Go!
- Let's go!

138
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,440
What is it, Granny?

139
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,360
Well, autistic children tend
to like looking at things that spin.

140
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,440
Tonkla's mom said that
Tonkla loves watching the fan spin.

141
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,480
It’s this spinning thing
that will make Tonkla

142
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,000
trust you.

143
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,200
- Typhoon, time for school!
- Go on!

144
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,440
I'm ready!

145
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
Let's go.

146
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,320
100% ORANGE JUICE, 10 BAHT EACH

147
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,720
Do you like it?

148
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,280
Here, for you.

149
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,880
I’ll take care of you from now on.

150
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,720
If anyone tries to bully you,
I’ll handle it for you.

151
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,920
Hey, what’s a little kid

152
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,360
doing over here
in the high school section?

153
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,680
The elementary school is over there.
Go on to your classroom.

154
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,960
Yes, ma’am.

155
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,160
Wait a minute.

156
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,440
You look familiar. Which class are you in?

157
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,600
What's up?

158
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,600
I asked which class you're in.

159
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,520
Oh, how did you end up here?

160
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,760
This is my nephew. He just moved here
and must've gotten lost.

161
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
I'll take him to his class.

162
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,400
Oh, okay.

163
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,040
Let's go!

164
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,840
We almost got caught.

165
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,760
How are we going
to investigate about Tonkla?

166
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,680
We’ll use technology.

167
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,040
Cool!

168
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,000
Alright.

169
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,640
That's all for today.

170
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,960
And don't forget
to turn in your homework, okay?

171
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,560
Yes, Teacher!

172
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,880
Students, bow!

173
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,560
Thank you, Teacher!

174
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,240
Don't forget your homework!

175
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,600
Yes, ma'am.

176
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,000
See you!

177
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,800
Hey, go on!

178
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,920
Did you bring your own windmill?

179
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,560
You’re such a kid!
You should be in kindergarten!

180
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,760
- Ouch!
- What? You’re crying over this?

181
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,960
Bad person.
My mom told me not to talk to you.

182
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,520
What did you say?

183
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,560
Don’t bother me, bad person!

184
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,960
I’ll show you some good behavior then.

185
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,560
Come on. Let’s go to the restroom.

186
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,920
Tonkla, don’t go!

187
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,200
Boys go to the restroom,
girls don’t need to worry.

188
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,680
You know what will happen
if you do, right?

189
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,040
Come on, Tonkla! Let’s go!

190
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,840
Come to me, Fei, the good one. Come on!

191
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,080
Did they trick him into getting hurt?
Let's go check it out. Hurry!

192
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,840
THE RESTROOM IS OUT OF ORDER

193
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,760
Alright, I’ll give it back to you.

194
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,160
How about now? Am I a good person?

195
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,880
Then, don’t go talking to others,
saying I’m a bad person, you idiot!

196
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,280
Let’s listen to some music.
Come on. Go get it.

197
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,480
Hurry up!

198
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,680
If you're scared,

199
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,560
just listen to music.
Hey, listen to the music!

200
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,640
Tung tung palong pong ching
Tung tung palong pong ching

201
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,840
You're tough only with the weak.
If you dare, come fight me.

202
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,240
What the hell is that?

203
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,560
Hey, hey!

204
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,320
- Let’s run!
- Hurry.

205
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,640
Hmm.

206
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,240
Tonkla.

207
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,880
Get up. It’s okay.

208
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,400
It's okay.

209
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,600
Relax, Tonkla.

210
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,240
I've sent the evidence
to the administration.

211
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,000
With this, Fei and his gang should be
in trouble with the teachers now.

212
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,080
Thitath, Kawi,

213
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,720
Phakorn from Grade 9, room two,

214
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,200
please come
to the administration office immediately.

215
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,920
Thitath,

216
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,640
- That's their names, right?
- Kawi, Phakorn

217
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,680
- Yeah, they were called so quickly.
- from Grade 9…

218
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,800
This should stop the bullying of Tonkla,

219
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,480
and Fei and his gang,
well, they're in trouble now.

220
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,000
- Come on!
- Yes!

221
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,640
Mission completed.

222
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,440
- Wow, that was fast!
- We're just that good.

223
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,360
Yeah, Typhoon knows this school so well.

224
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,600
Well,

225
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,360
Kam did a great job with the school map.
You didn't bother to look at it.

226
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,880
There's a sound coming
from inside the school. What happened?

227
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,520
- Sounds like it's not a good thing.
- Right.

228
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,320
- Let's stop time and go check it out.
- Let's go.

229
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,840
Why is everyone getting sick
at the same time?

230
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,880
This is serious.

231
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,240
They must have eaten something bad.

232
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,480
Or maybe they were poisoned?

233
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,560
Are you crazy? Who would poison
anyone in school? There's no way.

234
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,120
Well, whatever happened,
let's treat them first.

235
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,480
Come on!

236
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,040
I'll help you.

237
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,840
Phoon, go get the teacher.
Hurry up, and get the teacher.

238
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,720
- Are you feeling better?
- Is that okay, Bung?

239
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,160
- That's fine, Granny.
- Okay.

240
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
I'll help you.

241
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,920
Hello. Hello?

242
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,680
Send an ambulance
to Somboonpoon Sukjai School urgently.

243
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,840
Yes, Somboonpoon Sukjai. Hurry.

244
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,520
Okay, thank you.

245
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,320
Bung, this kid is in serious condition.

246
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,760
- Ouch!
- Bung!

247
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,840
What's wrong?

248
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,160
I'm fine, Granny.

249
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,080
But this kid can't hold on.
I'll help this kid first.

250
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,680
Don't push yourself, sweetie.
If it's too much, stop.

251
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,760
Got it, Granny.

252
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,600
- Just a moment. We've called the hospital.
- I'll help you.

253
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,240
- The ambulance is on its way.
- Hey, you!

254
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,040
Bung, stop. Stop.

255
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,840
Enough. Stop! No more. No more treatment.

256
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,440
Granny, I'm fine. I'll try again.

257
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,640
- Bung!
- Bung!

258
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,280
‪-Bung!
‪-Bung!

259
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,800
It's enough, Bung. Stop!

260
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,160
Everyone, the teacher is coming!

261
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,800
- Can you get up?
- Yes, Granny.

262
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,440
Hey, Granny!

263
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,840
I think the ambulance is almost here.
We need to hurry.

264
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,880
Let's go.

265
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,520
This afternoon,
an unexpected incident occurred

266
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,920
at Somboonpoon Sukjai School.

267
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,760
Nearly the entire Grade 9 level
reported simultaneous stomach pain.

268
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,480
Preliminary investigations
suggest food poisoning

269
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,800
as the likely cause,
possibly from school meals.

270
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,440
I swear, I’ve never served
anything bad to the kids.

271
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,520
I use fresh ingredients every day.

272
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,000
I really don’t know how they got sick,
I honestly don’t!

273
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,080
Although the cook denies all allegations,

274
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,280
the school principal has announced
an investigation to uncover the truth

275
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,240
and to take strict action
against the responsible party.

276
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,720
I don’t think the cook is lying.

277
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,760
If it’s not the cook,

278
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,480
then who caused the kids to fall ill?

279
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,160
Don’t think I’m being pessimistic,

280
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,440
but I feel there’s more to this school

281
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,760
than just bullying.

282
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,440
So, what is it then?

283
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,920
I don't know.

284
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,320
What?

285
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,080
If you want to know,
you’ve got to investigate!

286
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,200
Take it easy. Take a rest.

287
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,120
You’ve already used up a lot of power.

288
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,760
I’m fine, Granny.

289
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,800
I want to find out who’s heartless enough
to harm the entire school like this.

290
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,400
She seems to be working hard,

291
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,840
and the place looks clean and tidy.

292
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,760
Hi!

293
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,040
Oh, the delivery's here?
Just wait a moment. I'll be right out.

294
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,200
Granny, should we go in
and take a closer look?

295
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,720
Okay, let's go.

296
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,280
Hey!

297
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,400
Someone got here before us!

298
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,760
- Is it good?
- Yes. I love it so much.

299
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,240
Delicious.

300
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,000
You're Ningning
from Grade 9, room two, right?

301
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,040
Yes.

302
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,560
Teacher Nipa called for you
in the science room. Right now.

303
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,960
- Uh, okay.
- Go alone.

304
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,800
Go alone!

305
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,120
Why should I go?

306
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,840
Go alone!

307
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,920
Teacher Nipa.

308
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,320
Hey, wait a minute!

309
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,000
If you go out,

310
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,840
we'll tell everyone that you're the one
who poisoned your friends.

311
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,880
How do you know?

312
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,200
Who are you?

313
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,960
You're the "Please be generous" heroes,
right?

314
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,240
Yes, we are.

315
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,800
We're here to catch you for poisoning them
and deliberately bullying your friends.

316
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,600
They aren't friends. They deserved it!

317
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,800
People who hurt others first
should face the consequences.

318
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,920
Especially Fei, he should suffer more.

319
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,720
If it's about Fei,
we already told the teacher.

320
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,680
You guys are more innocent than I thought.

321
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,280
Do you think telling the teacher
solved everything?

322
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,280
Fei thought Tonkla reported him,
but why did he come back to bully us?

323
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,000
It's enough!

324
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,680
If you love him so much,
if you protect him so much,

325
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,880
you'll end up like him! Go, catch them!

326
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,600
Let us go!

327
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,680
Ugh! Hey!

328
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,920
Hey, stop! Stop!!

329
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,960
Cold… Cold. I want the windmill.

330
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,360
- I want the windmill.
- Stop!

331
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,440
And you better remember this. Don’t go
reporting me to the teacher again,

332
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,200
or things will get even worse for you.

333
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:31,920
They've bullied me and others,
not just Tonkla.

334
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,040
This isn’t the first time.
They've always been like this.

335
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,600
I get that you want revenge on Fei,

336
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,760
but why drag everyone else into it?

337
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,040
Those people saw others getting hurt

338
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,200
and did nothing. They deserved it!

339
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,440
But it’s not right!
You shouldn’t hurt others.

340
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,080
So what? Should I just let myself
get bullied forever?

341
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,200
Even if the teachers punish them,
they’ll just go bully someone else.

342
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,840
People like that deserved what they got.

343
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,640
You can scold me all you want,
but don’t forget

344
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,000
that you’re no different from me.

345
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,000
When something happens,
instead of letting the police handle it,

346
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,120
you take matters into your own hands.

347
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,120
You’re just like me, aren’t you?

348
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,680
Hurry! Excuse me.

349
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,240
I’ve got no idea
what to do about Ningning.

350
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,600
Let’s think about it later.
For now, let’s sneak out quietly.

351
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,120
Typhoon! Is that you?

352
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,520
Oh, It's really you. Typhoon.

353
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,800
- Oh, Typhoon!
- Teacher!

354
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,200
How do you know Typhoon?

355
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,000
Oh, are you friends with Typhoon?

356
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,320
I used to be Typhoon’s homeroom teacher.

357
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,360
Why didn’t you ever tell us you used
to study at Somboonpoon Sukjai School?

358
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,640
I was scared you’d find out
and send me back there.

359
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,280
I hate that school.

360
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,280
Why is that, Phoon?

361
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,320
It’s too expensive. Tuition, uniforms,
everything costs too much.

362
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,800
My mom wanted me in a good, pricey school,

363
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,680
but no matter how much she borrowed,
it was never enough.

364
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,680
Was the teacher here to ask
about unpaid fees earlier?

365
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,880
Not at all, Phoon.
The teacher wasn’t here for that.

366
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,080
She just wanted to talk to you.

367
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,640
Typhoon's mom called,
but Typhoon hasn’t come to school.

368
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,200
The school didn't know how to reach him.

369
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,640
His mom seems really worried.

370
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,600
Anyway, I’ll give you her number,

371
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,520
and Typhoon should contact her.

372
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,960
Here.

373
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,840
- Then, let's call your mom.
- Yeah.

374
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,600
Mom, it's me, Phoon.

375
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,080
Who's Phoon?

376
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,320
It's me, your son, Phoon.

377
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,280
Sorry, wrong number.

378
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,200
I just changed my number.

379
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,880
The previous
owner might not have updated it.

380
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,160
Again. My mom's gone again.

381
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,760
I just want to see her.
I want to help her get away from that man.

382
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,360
Phoon.

383
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,680
You're searching for her,

384
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,000
and she's searching for you.

385
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,040
Someday, you'll be reunited.

386
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,960
Here, eat more.

387
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,440
- Eat a lot.
- Here you go.

388
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,280
Hey, you don’t like yardlong beans, right?
I’ll make it short for you.

389
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,440
No more long beans. Only short ones now.

390
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,320
- Wow.
- How’s that? Do you like it short now?

391
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,160
Hey, Bung!
About what we were supposed to discuss

392
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,720
after investigating Ningning, what is it?

393
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,000
Sorry to interrupt!

394
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,720
There's breaking news. The school has
caught the one who poisoned the students.

395
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,120
It's a female student named Ningning.

396
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,120
The school has reviewed footage
from the cafeteria cameras

397
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,280
and discovered that a female student,
N, a pseudonym,

398
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,800
put laxatives in the food,

399
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,480
causing many of her classmates
to experience stomach pain.

400
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:05,560
The school administration
also issued a statement

401
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,600
that they will conduct
a thorough investigation into the matter.

402
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,720
What's important
is that if the investigation finds

403
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,520
that the student is at fault,
she may face suspension

404
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,200
or even expulsion.

405
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,400
That's so sad.
Can we go to the school and tell them

406
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,240
that Ningning did it to help her friends?

407
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,640
But helping friends
by seeking revenge isn't right.

408
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,040
But no student
should ruin their future over this.

409
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,280
- We let Granny reverse time then.
- No!

410
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,680
If we use her power to reverse time
and help that student,

411
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,760
she might forget everything again.

412
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,840
But she already remembers now.

413
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,440
Yes, but if we do nothing,

414
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,960
that student's future will be ruined.

415
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,280
Do you think Granny's future
isn't important?

416
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,840
Hey, calm down.

417
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,320
That's not what I mean, Bung.

418
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,440
Thua and I suggest it because we believe
"Please be generous" can help others.

419
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,160
Oh, so because of the power,

420
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,880
"Please be generous" heroes
have the duty to help others?

421
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,239
So, please understand this, Ms. Kam.

422
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,880
Granny and I won’t use our powers anymore.

423
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,719
We can't help anyone else anymore.

424
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,800
Are you here about Ningning?

425
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,320
Yes, could we meet her, please?

426
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:42,679
I'm afraid that won’t be possible,
as she's no longer here.

427
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,639
She has confessed and resigned.

428
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,480
This is the result of cowardice.

429
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,480
Because "Please be generous" didn’t help,
now her future is ruined.

430
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,560
- What should we do about other cases?
- We need to talk it through.

431
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,560
Hey, Thua, calm down!

432
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,000
You're all here.

433
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,160
Do you know
we can't help Ningning anymore?

434
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,800
We can't help anyone
if we can’t even save ourselves.

435
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,840
So, that means from now on, there's
no more "Please be generous", right?

436
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,480
Let me think about it.
I haven’t decided yet.

437
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,160
What about you, Typhoon?

438
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,120
I don’t know.

439
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,080
The consequences of having powers
are scary. Thua, you don't understand.

440
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,560
Exactly. I don’t understand.

441
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,400
I don’t get why I’m the only one
without powers. Because if I had them,

442
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,760
I wouldn't be afraid of anything.

443
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,000
Oh, you can say that because you’ve never
experienced what we’ve been through.

444
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,000
Hey, Bung!

445
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,440
- Bung, what’s wrong?
- Ouch.

446
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,360
- Does your stomach hurt, dear?
- Why is it hurting?

447
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,200
She hasn’t even used her powers yet.

448
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,040
Granny!

449
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,240
Why is it getting bigger, Granny?

450
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,080
Hurry. Take her to the hospital, quickly!

451
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,720
Bung.

452
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,320
How are you doing?

453
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,320
How's Bung doing, Doctor?

454
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,160
The ultrasound shows the umbilical cord
is around the baby's neck.

455
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,440
It's not dangerous for now,
but be extra cautious going forward.

456
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,960
Make sure to visit the doctor regularly

457
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,040
and count the baby's movements
to monitor any issues.

458
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,440
So, what about that--

459
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,920
My baby is fine.

460
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,760
Are you sure, Bung?

461
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,520
I've never seen a case where the pregnancy
is progressing so quickly,

462
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,800
but everything is fine.

463
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,680
No need for hospitalization today.
From now on,

464
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,680
if anything unusual happens,

465
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,480
make sure to come in right away.

466
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,160
Okay, thank you, Doctor.

467
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,480
The next patient is waiting, Doctor.

468
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,800
- I'll be leaving now.
- Okay.

469
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,280
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

470
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:47,200
It's alright now. Let's go home and rest.

471
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,160
I don't want to go home yet, Granny.

472
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,840
If you don't want to go home,
where do you want to go?

473
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,920
Why did you suddenly
want to come here, Bung?

474
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,960
I’m curious about the power
and what it really means.

475
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,880
And why does using it seem
to backfire on us?

476
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,480
I want to know too.
What have we done wrong?

477
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,400
It feels like we’re being punished.

478
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,480
The power started after the crash.
Everything must have started from there.

479
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,720
Okay, I’ll help find answers.

480
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,760
I’m just as curious as you all
about why I’m different,

481
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,360
even though I was in the same situation.

482
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,760
- Then, let’s start looking around here.
- Let’s split up.

483
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,120
- Okay.
- Okay.

484
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,080
- Granny.
- Huh?

485
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,840
We three?

486
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,640
But we just went that way.

487
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,760
Hey, everyone, look at this!
Over here! Hey!

488
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,760
- Let’s go, quick!
- Oh.

489
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,440
- Why is there a shrine here?
- Let’s check it out, Granny.

490
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,040
- What is this?
- I don't know what this shrine is.

491
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,600
A shrine…

492
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,080
I must survive. My baby must survive.

493
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,560
I have to protect my baby
and keep it safe.

494
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,680
Mom, I don't want to die.
Why am I so weak like this?

495
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,640
No, I can't die yet.
I need to find my son.

496
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,840
Hey, what happened? What’s going on?

497
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,400
Our powers came from our wishes.
At that time,

498
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,680
I wished

499
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,840
not to die and asked to see my son
before it was too late.

500
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,280
As for me,
I wished for my baby to be safe.

501
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,080
And I wished not to be weak anymore.

502
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,840
As for me, I didn’t wish for anything.

503
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,880
Oh, I get it now.

504
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,760
What about the negative effects
of the powers?

505
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,440
Do you know what happened
and how we can fix it?

506
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,800
- No.
- Um, I don’t know.

507
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,200
So, what should we do now?

508
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,640
Oh, so you're having
trouble sleeping too, Thua?

509
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,680
I didn't know

510
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,280
that you got these powers
to solve your own problems.

511
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,680
Maybe all these bad things
happening to you

512
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,280
might be

513
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,800
because of me. I'm sorry.

514
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,000
No, don’t blame yourself.

515
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,960
I chose to be part of "Please be generous"
from the beginning.

516
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,120
Me too, I thought it was fun.

517
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,760
I felt good about helping others too.

518
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,120
Until…

519
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,440
Well, things have reached this point.

520
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,040
I think we shouldn’t force it anymore.
It’s dangerous,

521
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,120
especially for you, Bung.
If something happens to the baby,

522
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,120
I’ll feel guilty for the rest of my life.

523
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:56,120
What about the page we’ve been running?

524
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,440
Are we just going to abandon it?

525
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,640
There are still many people
waiting for our help.

526
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,440
Yeah.

527
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,920
What are we going to do now?

528
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,440
I was the one who wanted to open the page.
I’ll take responsibility for it.

529
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,040
Are you sure, Thua?
You don’t have any special powers.

530
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,760
NEXT EPISODE

531
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,600
You evil spirit, you're gonna die!

532
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,080
That was exhausting, huh?

533
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,440
It took so long to clear things up.

534
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,840
This is us without special powers.

535
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,880
Hey, when did you two get this close?

536
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,360
We used our powers to reverse time
to find Phoon's mom.

537
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,120
It matches with our wish.

538
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,640
- Stop!
- Phoon! Granny's condition is worsening!

539
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,600
