1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,960
<i>Well, who can resist, right?</i>

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,280
<i>Peem is such a good guy.</i>

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,200
I'm gonna do better than Peem.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,760
Let's start a hero page.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,720
What's the name of the hero page?

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,160
"Please be generous!"

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,120
- Huh?
- <i>Thua!</i>

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,640
How dare you bring these people
to stay in my house for free?

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,720
Get out!

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,280
The reason we did this is because
we really don't have a place to stay.

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,080
Fine. You can stay!
But you have to pay rent.

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,160
Forty-eight thousand.
I'm giving you three days.

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,200
If you all want to stay,
then you'll need to help out.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,600
- What do you want us to do?
- Open a Laab Restaurant.

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,960
Sure, what would you like?

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,560
Som Tum Laos, noted! Tom Saab, too?

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,640
- Do you want Laab, pork Laab, beef Laab?
- Should we get some water?

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,360
Thank you for supporting
the Laab Itthirit Restaurant.

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,320
Who parked like this?

20
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,880
There's another car.

21
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,560
Alright, done.

22
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,960
Hey, you! How could you do that?

23
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,600
Oh no, someone saw me!

24
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,200
Let's talk first.

25
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,920
Wait, wait.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,120
Ugh, why are you following me?

27
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,880
Where did he go?

28
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,040
Ouch!

29
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,200
Hey!

30
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,160
You! Hey!

31
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,760
What should I do? You're bleeding!

32
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,280
What should I do? Oh no!

33
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,840
Millionaire!

34
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,880
Hey, we've been selling for so long.
Why do we only have this much?

35
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,080
I don't think it's just this much.

36
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,320
This is for the cost of pork,

37
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,680
vegetables,

38
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,120
and ingredients.

39
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,360
There's only 20 left.

40
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,400
How are we going
to pay the rent with this?

41
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,760
I think maybe we miscalculated the costs.

42
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,720
I don't think so. Did we lose any money?
Maybe we should check before we go.

43
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,960
Can you bend down, Granny?
I don't think you can.

44
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,360
I'm going out to buy stuff
for tomorrow's sale.

45
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,480
Be careful not to drop anything. Oh! Hey!

46
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,760
Hey, it's not just 20 that's left!

47
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,840
We only have three days left. I think
we won't make enough money in time, Thua.

48
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,800
We've got three days! Don't give up.
I think the money fell around here.

49
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,200
Thua!

50
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,120
- Hey! Ms. Kam!
- Oh no! Your head!

51
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,680
Wow, it's you, Ms. Kam! Oh!

52
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,440
Does it hurt a lot, Thua?

53
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,240
My head's fine, but my heart hurts.

54
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,040
- Huh?
- What hurts? What do you mean?

55
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,080
Oh, it's nothing.

56
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,560
What's wrong, Ms. Kam? Is everything okay?

57
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,120
Can I leave an announcement
at your restaurant?

58
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,560
- Of course, Kam!
- Thank you, Granny.

59
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,880
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.

60
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,960
- Yes.
- Let's go.

61
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,680
"Missing child.

62
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,520
If you have any information,
please report it.

63
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,800
A reward of one million baht!"

64
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,360
Hey! Thua!

65
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,720
We've got a way out!

66
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,120
What do you mean, Granny?

67
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,560
Wait, a million?

68
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,200
There are many copies.
We could win millions!

69
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,680
- Bung, this is bad!
- Huh?

70
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,640
What's wrong?

71
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,120
A child's injured.
I don't know if he'll survive.

72
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,400
Where? Where is he?

73
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,840
Come on!

74
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The heaven's on our side, Granny.
If we find the kid,

75
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,640
we could get a million baht!

76
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,040
Why aren't we looking for the kid?
Why are we at the father's house?

77
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,520
We need information first, Granny.
Where did the kid go missing? When? How?

78
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,960
If the kid's father knew,
he would've gone looking already.

79
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,960
He hasn't found him yet.

80
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,800
We need to know the details,
so we can start properly. Let's go.

81
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,280
What are you doing here?

82
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,480
Um.

83
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,360
This is probably the guy.

84
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,000
Uh, we're here to see Torpob.

85
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,600
Did you have an appointment?

86
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,160
Do we need an appointment?

87
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,600
We're here about the missing child.
Please let us in.

88
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,960
Do you have any leads?

89
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,000
- No!
- Oh!

90
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,240
No leads? Then you can't come in.

91
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,400
Why is it so difficult?

92
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,480
- Oh!
- Huh?

93
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,120
- Here they come.
- Thua!

94
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,800
Hey, Thua, what are you doing here?

95
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,440
- Kam, Peem!
- Hello.

96
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,400
Hello!

97
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,480
You guys are here together again.

98
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,440
Wow, so many awards!

99
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,560
It's not just this.

100
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,480
Torpob is a very accomplished academic.

101
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,000
He has a lot of research
and books published, many of them.

102
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,480
Here, for example, this book

103
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,120
has been translated into
nine languages and is sold worldwide.

104
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,680
Wow, no wonder he's so rich!

105
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,000
I can't believe

106
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,960
someone like you, Peem,
also wants the reward money.

107
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,280
I'm not doing it for the money.

108
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,400
Torpob and I know each other personally.

109
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,960
I'm definitely helping him out.

110
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,919
I don't want the money either.

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,200
I'm just worried about the child
and want him back with his family.

112
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,559
I'm not doing this for…

113
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,800
For anyone or accuse anyone.

114
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,680
Torpob,

115
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,720
we'd like more information.

116
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,600
Can you tell us again what happened
when Title went missing?

117
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,200
Sure.

118
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,520
- Bung, he's right here.
- Ouch!

119
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,280
- Right here!
- Hey!

120
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,160
Hey, my head,

121
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,520
it doesn't hurt anymore!

122
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,440
Bung, there's an injury here too.

123
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,600
- Hey, where? Whoa, it's here!
- Stay still.

124
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,400
Let me check.

125
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,080
Hey! Where did it go?

126
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,320
You're so troublesome.

127
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,760
Why are you following me?

128
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,320
Are you guys

129
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,600
aliens or something?

130
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,480
Are you crazy?

131
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,760
We're just regular people,

132
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,520
but we got involved in something special.

133
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,120
If I tell yoou, you can't tell anyone!

134
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,280
This has to stay a secret.

135
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,720
Why?

136
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,960
Well, I just don't want
to get into trouble.

137
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,600
If the wrong people find out,
it could get messy.

138
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,440
I won't tell anyone!

139
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,320
Thua and Granny are at the restaurant.
Don't worry, it's all clear.

140
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,360
LAAB ITTHIRIT RESTAURANT

141
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,920
Come inside first.

142
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,360
Do you all live here?

143
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,760
And do you all have special powers?

144
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,560
Granny does, but Thua doesn't.

145
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,360
That's amazing!

146
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,800
Stay here for now. You're still young.

147
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,120
It's dangerous to be outside alone.

148
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,520
Thank you.

149
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,320
They say similar people are drawn
to each other. I guess it's true.

150
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,480
This place is clearly a gathering
of runaway kids.

151
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,440
Thua probably won't be okay with this.

152
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,640
For sure. Things are rough
with money right now too.

153
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,160
So, you have to stay quiet
and hide for now.

154
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Don't let Thua find out, okay?

155
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,720
But you haven't told us why you ran away.

156
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,520
I'd say it's more like I can't go home.

157
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,680
<i>My dad is strict</i>

158
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,160
<i>and very serious.</i>

159
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,040
<i>The thing he's most serious about</i>

160
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,520
<i>is my studies.</i>

161
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,040
<i>I have to go to tutoring every day.</i>

162
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Study hard, my son.

163
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,560
<i>Because my dad wants me to excel.</i>

164
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,680
<i>I have to get first place</i>

165
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,000
<i>and get full marks in every subject.</i>

166
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,840
Done. Ugh.

167
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,600
Finished already?

168
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,520
Here, do this one too.

169
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,760
This is a regional level exam.

170
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,960
<i>Even on weekends, I have to do exercises.</i>

171
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,560
<i>I never get to hang out with my friends.</i>

172
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,880
<i>But every time my dad sees</i>
<i>that I got first place,</i>

173
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,400
<i>he's so happy.</i>

174
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,640
<i>So I try hard</i>

175
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,120
<i>because I want him to be proud.</i>

176
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,640
Do you always get first place?

177
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,320
No.

178
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,000
Oh, everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

179
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,960
If I fail,

180
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,560
my dad gets really angry

181
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,280
and punishes me by making me
study even more.

182
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,440
I'm not allowed to leave my room.

183
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,680
Let me guess.

184
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,320
You didn't get first place this term.
That's why you're afraid to go home.

185
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,000
That day, I dropped Title off
at the tutoring school.

186
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,680
In the evening,
I went to pick him up as usual.

187
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,200
But Title was missing from school.

188
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,600
So, no one saw Title at all?

189
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,160
No.

190
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,080
That's strange.
A kid just disappears like that?

191
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,120
Did you check the CCTV footage?

192
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,080
I did.

193
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,560
But there's no footage of Title
leaving the school.

194
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,240
We searched everywhere
but couldn't find him.

195
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,640
I really can't imagine
where Title could have gone.

196
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,360
Don't tell me he slipped
into another dimension!

197
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,720
Um…

198
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,880
Well, where should we start looking?

199
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,080
Have you asked anyone there?

200
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,720
They might know something
since it was the last place he was at.

201
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,080
I'll have the police help us, too.

202
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Hello, Officer.

203
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,960
If you're really serious,
don't use any connections, okay?

204
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,760
What should we do next?

205
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,760
Yes, Dad.

206
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,520
Do you want me to go back
to the garage now?

207
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,120
But…

208
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,880
If you have something to do,
you can go ahead, Kam.

209
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,880
I'll take you. We're going
the same way anyway, right?

210
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,800
So if you have anything to do,
feel free to go ahead.

211
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,840
How will you go?

212
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,240
By taxi.

213
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,640
You should come with me.
That way, we can talk about Title too.

214
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,080
- Sounds good.
- Go.

215
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,520
Kam!

216
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,920
Just accept it.

217
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,320
He's handsome,

218
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,640
cool,

219
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,080
and has a good personality.
What do you have to compete with him?

220
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,840
Granny, don't say that.

221
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,400
Just wait and see. I'll only lose for now.

222
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,560
If we find the kid first, just wait,

223
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,600
Kam will definitely notice me.

224
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,760
I really have to thank Sathaporn.

225
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,000
Without him,
I wouldn't have gotten my son back.

226
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,960
Oh, it's nothing.

227
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,800
I'm just so happy and glad
that I could help a cute kid

228
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,280
reunite with his father.

229
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,160
You really did a good deed.

230
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,400
You're really dependable.

231
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,040
I admire you, Thua.

232
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,880
Thank you.

233
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,320
Marry me.

234
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,000
Woah!

235
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,680
Yes, I'll marry you!

236
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,720
- Woohoo, get married!
- No!

237
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,760
Kam. I love you. I really do.
You can't do this!

238
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,880
Oh!

239
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,599
I love Thua. I love Thua only.

240
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,359
No, Kam, you can't do this! Oh, Kam.

241
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,520
Serves you right!

242
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,200
- Hey, where are you going, Granny?
- I'm out looking for the kid.

243
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,120
Wait for me, Granny!

244
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,240
Thua doesn't enter this room much.
You should stay in here for now.

245
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,480
I'll bring you a new shirt.
There are plenty more in the bag.

246
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,520
Thank you for helping me.

247
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,720
No problem. I understand you.

248
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,120
Hey, Thua's calling!

249
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,000
Thua's calling! Oh, what should we do?

250
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,720
What should we do?

251
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,480
Quiet. Maybe he's calling to ask us
to come back to the restaurant.

252
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,720
Okay, I'm coming, Thua.

253
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,120
Huh? Is there an urgent task?

254
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,800
Okay, I'll be right there.

255
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,720
What's the mission, Bung?

256
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,680
I don't know. He said I need to find him.

257
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,440
Well…

258
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,320
You guys go save the world.
I'll be fine here.

259
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,880
Wow, it's not that serious.

260
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,960
Anyway, just stay here
and don't sneak out.

261
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,720
If Thua comes back,
it'll be hard to get in.

262
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,480
Let's go, Typhoon.

263
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,240
- Hey!
- Granny.

264
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,040
Did someone ask for help?

265
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,800
Yes, a child was kidnapped from here.

266
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,640
The child's father didn't mention
anything about kidnapping.

267
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,360
The cameras didn't catch the kid leaving,

268
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,720
so that means the kid left
in an unusual way. I think

269
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,000
it's definitely a kidnapping.

270
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,600
Do you have a photo of that child?

271
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,880
MISSING CHILD "TITLE"

272
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,600
Dad!

273
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,080
Didn't Peem help search for him?
Why do we need to get involved?

274
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,000
We should do what we can. If more people
see it, we can find him easier.

275
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,040
Let's do it offline and online.

276
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,760
Alright, then I'll help. I'll post it
on Facebook and Twitter. Is that enough?

277
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,600
Don't forget TikTok, Dad!

278
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,600
MISSING CHILD "TITLE"

279
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,040
TEL: 099 253 5192 - TORPOB
REWARD: 1,000,000 BAHT

280
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,680
Oh! Why didn't you tell me
when you found him? We wasted time.

281
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,680
Hey, you didn't mention that
the missing kid was Title!

282
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,560
Yeah, you just said a kid was kidnapped.
How could we know it's him?

283
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,800
Exactly! You make up your own stories
and blame others!

284
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,560
Ugh, stop arguing and just hurry up!

285
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,000
Wait, everyone!

286
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,320
Wait for me here! I'll be right back.

287
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
Huh?

288
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,800
Title!

289
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,640
- Hey!
- What's going on?

290
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,560
- Did you find him?
- He's not here anymore.

291
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,120
Alright, everyone,
let's search everywhere!

292
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
I told him not to go anywhere!

293
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,560
- Um, the master bedroom! Go!
- Let's go!

294
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,760
Okay, let's split up.

295
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,840
- Did you find him?
- No, I didn't.

296
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,720
Then, Granny!

297
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,360
I guess you have to use
your special powers.

298
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,880
Right. Stop time?

299
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,400
No, rewind time!

300
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,000
Go back about…

301
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,960
four hours, to when
Typhoon and I just left the house.

302
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,640
Title probably hasn't left yet.

303
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,200
- Oh! Come!
- Let's go.

304
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,160
- Are you ready?
- Of course!

305
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,280
- Hey!
- Huh?

306
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,720
Granny!

307
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
- Hey!
- Not here, Granny!

308
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,880
Why are we here?

309
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,080
- Whoa!
- Oh, sorry!

310
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,000
- I got nervous and took you here instead.
- It's fine, Granny. Try again.

311
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
- Let's go again!
- Come on!

312
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,880
- Mhm.
- Okay.

313
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,200
Oh, Granny, it's the street!

314
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,640
- Oh! Car! A car's coming!
- Hurry up!

315
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,080
Hey, Granny, this isn't the place either!
It's too late. Hurry up! Let's go again!

316
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,400
- Stop, everyone. Don't rush her!
- Come on!

317
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,720
- Granny, calm down, focus, focus!
- Focus.

318
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,840
Wrong again!

319
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,720
It's okay, Granny. We're still close
in time. Title might still be at home.

320
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,880
No more teleporting, just run!
This is faster! Come on!

321
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,200
Hurry up! Go, go!

322
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,440
Oh, I need my inhaler.

323
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,080
Oh, wait for me!

324
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,160
Anyway, just stay here
and don't sneak out.

325
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,920
If Thua comes back,
it'll be hard to get in.

326
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,880
I'm hungry, that's why.

327
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,040
Hey!

328
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,320
Title!

329
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,040
I'm sorry to bother you, Officer.

330
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:00,520
Thank you so much.
Please follow up on this matter for me.

331
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Hello, Torpob.

332
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,600
Torpob? Dad!

333
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,640
Alright. Don't worry.

334
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,080
I've spoken to the officer.

335
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,880
The police will interrogate everyone
at the school again.

336
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,880
<i>Thank you, Peem.</i>
<i>I'm really worried about Title.</i>

337
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,280
Dad!

338
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,560
I promised Title's late mother
I'd take care of him,

339
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,560
but if something happens to him,

340
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,520
I'll blame myself forever.

341
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,440
Calm down.

342
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,080
Don't overthink like that.

343
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,920
<i>Hello, Peem. Is something wrong?</i>

344
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,320
It's nothing. I'll call you back later.

345
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,920
He's not here.

346
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Huh?

347
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,920
So, does that mean,
as soon as we left, Title left too?

348
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,680
It's my fault for not being accurate
when I reversed time.

349
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,480
It's okay, Granny.

350
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,040
Thua, let's split up and search.
He couldn't have gone far.

351
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,040
Okay. Then let's split up.

352
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,000
- Come on!
- Let's go!

353
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,720
Dad says he loves me the most.
Even though I didn't get first place,

354
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,160
he probably wouldn't mind.

355
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,800
Yeah, I'm gonna see Dad soon.

356
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,880
Help me!

357
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,760
Help me!

358
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,040
Did you find anything?

359
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,040
No, not at all. How about you?
Have you found Title yet?

360
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,320
Not yet. If I found him, would I ask you?

361
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,840
Well, that's right.

362
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,280
I'll be going now.

363
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,880
Wait a second, Granny.

364
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,440
If I found him, would I ask you?

365
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,760
Isn't that kind of annoying?

366
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,680
Oh, come on. Don't think too much
about silly things.

367
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,800
Let's just go find Title.

368
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,080
Let's go.

369
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,760
Why did you bring me here?
Are you going to hurt me?

370
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,240
If I was going to hurt you,
would I let you talk like this?

371
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:19,160
Well, that's right.
So, why did you bring me here?

372
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,360
I saw you almost walk into the people
searching for you, messing everything up.

373
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,080
So what? Is this fear? You can't escape,
so you're just going home?

374
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,880
You know, right now,
you're worth a million.

375
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,160
Huh?

376
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,760
From my experience,

377
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,640
if you're going to run,
you better run far, man.

378
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,240
But if you're running from me, Jack,

379
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,760
no matter how you try, you won't escape.

380
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,160
Cherry!

381
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,240
Hey! Wait a minute.

382
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,320
This kid is worth a million, huh?

383
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,160
Yes!

384
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,840
A million is not enough to pay off
the debt, though. I just kept him for fun.

385
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,240
Give me some time. I'll go get some money
to pay off the debt.

386
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,360
Why are you wasting time?

387
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,400
If the kid's father can pay
a million for him,

388
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,840
then three million
shouldn't be hard to come by, right?

389
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,920
But he's still just a kid.

390
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,040
Jack!

391
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,160
You were once a kid, and so was I.
So, what's the big deal?

392
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,920
If this kid can make money, I'll use him.

393
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,040
Go get the poster. I'm gonna call his dad.

394
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,880
Oh, this is such a mess!

395
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,920
If we had just told each other sooner,
Title wouldn't have disappeared.

396
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,560
Don't blame us! You didn't tell me
that the missing kid was Title!

397
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,080
What should we do?

398
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,920
Wait a minute!
When you brought Title here,

399
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,440
did anyone see?

400
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,840
So what if they did?

401
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,920
Oh man, if someone saw, we'll look like
the kidnappers who took Title!

402
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,600
Instead of being heroes,
we'll be suspects instead!

403
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,440
So, in the end, you're just worried
about yourself, right?

404
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,120
Oh, it's not like that!

405
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,040
I've been in a situation where
I was misunderstood before,

406
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,160
and it was horrible.

407
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,360
Right now, it's like we're the ones
who made Title disappear.

408
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,600
We have to tell everyone the truth.

409
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,880
I hope Ms. Kam understands.

410
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,760
I don't understand. How could you guys
find Title and just let him escape again?

411
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,520
Well, as soon as we found out,
we rushed home to find Titile.

412
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,040
But when we got there,
he was already gone.

413
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,520
We really didn't know the kid we helped
was the one everyone was looking for.

414
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,880
Once we realized Title was the one,
we searched for him,

415
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,280
but couldn't find him.

416
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,680
So, why didn't you tell me
when we met yesterday?

417
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,040
If you had told Peem from the start,

418
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,040
we probably would have found Title by now.

419
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,360
The thing is,
yesterday was really chaotic.

420
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,080
Thua probably didn't think quickly enough.

421
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,600
But we've already told you.
We're also worried about Title.

422
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,840
Title might have run away to hide
because he doesn't want to go home.

423
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,640
If Title ran away,
where would he go to hide?

424
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,520
What did you say?

425
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,600
Title is with you?

426
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,040
<i>Three million, in cash, unmarked bills,</i>

427
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,000
in exchange for your son's life. Got it?

428
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,400
Let me talk to my son first.

429
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,240
You!

430
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,600
Why are you letting this guy take my spot?

431
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,760
Have the money ready.
I'll call you again in three hours.

432
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,320
Oh, and if the police find out about this,

433
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,200
your son will be dead.

434
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,440
Title!

435
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,520
The reason why there's a reward
and we still haven't found Title,

436
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,800
I think someone's been inflating
the price to you,

437
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,160
knowing you're willing to pay.

438
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,080
What the hell are you guys
arguing about? Huh?

439
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,280
Huh?

440
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,040
This guy's trying to take my usual spot.

441
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,720
Then go play in another spot.

442
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,600
But my dad already paid
for the spot for me.

443
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,280
Your dad will never pay
as much as this kid's dad.

444
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,960
It's okay, I'll give it to him.
By the way, how did you get here?

445
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,760
Aren't you supposed to be at school,
or did you run away from home too?

446
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,360
Run away from home? This is my school!

447
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,960
Move!

448
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,400
Go play on another computer.
There are plenty of others for you.

449
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,520
‪Let's go.

450
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,720
Then, Granny, Phakbung, Typhoon,
and I will go out to help with the search.

451
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,680
Wait a minute.

452
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,800
How can we be sure

453
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,920
that your running around
and getting close to everyone

454
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,280
isn't just creating a situation
or cooperating with the criminals?

455
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,480
Oh, that's just absurd.

456
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,639
Suddenly,
you have a lot of relatives popping up,

457
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,960
and you all want money, right?

458
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,320
Peem, I don't want to accuse Thua again.

459
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,120
If you want to protect them,
they have to prove themselves.

460
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,800
What do you think?

461
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,719
If you're really innocent,

462
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,000
you should stay here.
Don't contact anyone, no matter what.

463
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:38,239
Peem and I have enough people.
We don't need your help finding him.

464
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,880
Where are you and Torpob going?

465
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,760
He's going to get money from the bank.

466
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,240
And I'm going to rush to find the police
to bring in some signal jamming equipment.

467
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,120
Is there anything I can help with?

468
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,800
Well, Kam, go find some volunteers who can
access the area better than these people,

469
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,880
and take care of Thua
and the others, okay?

470
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,480
Peem, do you really think Thua
and the others are criminals?

471
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,560
They're just ordinary people,
with two kids and an old person.

472
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,280
If criminals demand ransom
and cause harm, how can they fight back?

473
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,440
And like I said,

474
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,040
they need to stay under watch here
to prove they're not involved.

475
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,120
So, you're really worried about them.

476
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,400
I didn't think of it that way.
You're amazing!

477
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,600
I care about everyone.

478
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,520
Especially you, Kam.

479
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,000
Okay, Peem, please be careful.

480
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,120
I will. I'm leaving now.

481
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,560
<i>So this is what</i>
<i>real-life heroes are like, huh?</i>

482
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,440
In the end, I guess I won't be a hero.

483
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,920
What hero? Right now, we're suspects.

484
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,440
Suddenly, we've been arrested,
our phone's have been confiscated.

485
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,480
We can't even turn back time
to fix things,

486
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,960
and when we try to stop time,
we have no idea where to look.

487
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,680
On top of that,

488
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,880
we're being watched. Whoa, this is tough.

489
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,160
This is exactly the kind of situation
where a hero has to step in.

490
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,960
When the hero and his helpers
are misunderstood,

491
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,960
they have to overcome the crisis

492
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,440
to successfully help those in need.

493
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,360
Wow, this looks really good.

494
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,240
You're exaggerating.
This is just instant noodles.

495
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,320
I've only seen this on TV.
I've never had it before.

496
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,200
How were you raised?

497
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,520
My mom passed away,

498
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,480
and my dad only lets me eat good,
healthy food.

499
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,840
Well, your dad raised you well.
I thought your dad would be like mine.

500
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,120
Oh, then what's your dad like?

501
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,960
Oh, my dad? He'd kick and punch me

502
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,160
like I was a punching bag.
That's why I ran away from home.

503
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,440
Wow, your dad sounds really scary.

504
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,520
My dad just wants me to study hard

505
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,960
and always be first in class.

506
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,240
So, you ran away from home
because you didn't want to study?

507
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,960
No, I ran away
because I didn't get first place.

508
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,440
Dammit, I brought you here
thinking your dad beat you like mine.

509
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,800
Hey, are you full yet? I've got a plan
that I need you to help with.

510
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,760
You'll help me go back home
without my dad getting mad, right?

511
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,120
Yeah, that's right.

512
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,040
In a little while, I'll call your dad.

513
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,880
You just need to tell him
to bring three million.

514
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,880
That's all, then you'll be safe.

515
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,400
Why does it have to be three million?

516
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,440
Well, the more your dad's willing to pay,

517
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,440
the more it shows he really loves you.

518
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,520
And if he's willing to pay three million,

519
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,000
it means he loves you a lot

520
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,200
and won't be mad at you anymore.

521
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,360
So, I just have to prove it, and then
I'll get the money back to my dad, right?

522
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,160
Hey, Cherry, come here.

523
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,800
Cherry, if you get the money,
you're going to let him go, right?

524
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,240
He's already seen our faces.
If we let him go, we're all screwed.

525
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,160
We'll send him to the border factory.

526
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,280
The three million is for the debt.
The ransom is mine.

527
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,360
I didn't want it to go down like this.

528
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,720
I don't care whether you want it or not.

529
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,960
Since that kid thinks
his parents are so awful,

530
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,480
I'm just helping him avoid
those horrible parents. That's it.

531
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,320
Alright, ytlk to your dad.

532
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,520
- Hello?
- Hello, boss?

533
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,320
Huh? They brought the cops?

534
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,000
Those plainclothes cops have been
inside for a while, boss.

535
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,320
Looks like that kid's dad
is pretty influential.

536
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,240
They're calling.

537
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,440
Just tell me where you want to meet.

538
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,040
Hell, maybe?

539
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,400
I told you not to involve the cops.

540
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,720
Dad! Dad, help me!

541
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,720
Title! Title, my son!

542
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,960
<i>Is it really you?</i>

543
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,600
Cry louder!

544
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,120
Cry? How do I cry?

545
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,600
Cry!

546
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,560
Cherry, don't hurt him!

547
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,440
What are you going to do to my son?

548
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,840
Clear up the cop situation!

549
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,280
I'll contact you again.

550
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,560
If I find out there are still cops,
what you'll be getting back

551
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,360
is a corpse!

552
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,560
<i>The batch of kids to be sent</i>
<i>to the border is a big one.</i>

553
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,960
<i>The people helping out,</i>
<i>make sure they do it right.</i>

554
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,880
Hey, it's working!

555
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,880
What do you mean?

556
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,520
Thua's in danger.

557
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,040
Even though we have to reveal
that we have powers, we must do it.

558
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,200
Who says we're going to reveal ourselves?

559
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,400
Stop it!

560
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:36,760
