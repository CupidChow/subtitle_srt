PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,920
<i>This is yesterday, Granny!</i>

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Don't tell me…

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,960
You don't just stop time,

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,520
you can also turn it back?

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,920
We checked everything.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,280
No donations were found.

8
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,040
If the robbers didn't take the donations,

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,720
then who did it?

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,640
I don't know.

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,560
But they're gone from my house.

12
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,160
<i>I'll take responsibility for it.</i>

13
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,120
<i>Thua!</i>

14
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,440
<i>I found them! They're here!</i>

15
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,000
Hey, what's this? How did this happen?
Is this real?

16
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,800
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,520
Because of me, you got fired.

18
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,720
If you still want to come back to work,

19
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,320
I'll talk to Dad for you.

20
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,960
Or if you want help finding a new job,

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,120
just let me know.

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,920
I really feel bad about this.

23
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,920
As long as you know
I'm not the one to blame,

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,240
that's enough for me.

25
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,640
No,

26
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,520
I made a mistake,
and I have to make up for it.

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,880
Let me help you.

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,480
Well, how about this?

29
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,120
What do you want to do?

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,560
I can do anything.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,920
As long as I can be close to you, Ms. Kam.

32
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,520
I'd like to have you close by too, Thua.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,080
Thua.

34
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,120
Thua!

35
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,840
Yes?

36
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,400
What did you say, Ms. Kam?
I was lost in thought for a second.

37
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,840
So, what do you want to do for work?

38
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,240
Phen is going back to Udon,

39
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,000
and I don't know

40
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,440
where I'll find such good Laab
like this again.

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
I've figured it out.
I know what I want to do.

42
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,160
You're just a kid.
How can you live on your own?

43
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,800
There's no need to go.
Just stay here with us.

44
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,800
Thua already told me
this house has many rooms.

45
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,120
Is that a good idea, Granny?

46
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,040
Yes, of course.

47
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,200
We've shared the same fate,
surviving the bus accident together.

48
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,960
It's only right that we live together now.

49
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,880
Thua is kind. He won't mind.

50
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,160
Yeah.

51
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,400
I'm kind. And right now, I'm feeling good.

52
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,640
See?

53
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,640
So, that means Thua is okay
with us living here, right?

54
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,320
You can stay.

55
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,240
But everyone has to help with the work.

56
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,440
Sure!

57
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,840
Just tell us what to do. Right, kids?

58
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,240
I can help with the work! I'm strong.
Don't believe me? Look.

59
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,080
Pretty good, huh?

60
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,480
Oh no, I didn't even say anything yet.

61
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,200
You broke the chair!

62
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
Hey, Typhoon!

63
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,560
Your hand, it's bleeding!

64
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,240
Oh, don't worry.
It's just a little scratch.

65
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,080
Bung can fix it, no problem.

66
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,440
Huh?

67
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,640
Your face.

68
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,280
You're still a kid. Are you a doctor?

69
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,640
Oh, no.

70
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,560
I just graduated from high school.

71
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,160
What? Then how can you treat people?

72
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,280
Bung has a special power.

73
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,440
- Huh?
- Huh?

74
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,880
Don't believe me? Watch!

75
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,640
Come on. Bung, try it.

76
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,400
Hey!

77
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,440
It really worked!

78
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,880
How did you do that?

79
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,840
Ever since the meteor shower

80
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,200
and the bus crash,
my healing power just came to me.

81
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,080
Wait. Everyone has powers?

82
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,160
Why don't I have any?

83
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,520
I don't even know how I got mine.

84
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,800
I don't care

85
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,280
where the power comes from.

86
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,480
All I know is, I really like it!

87
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,000
Right.

88
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,000
Alright, forget about the powers for now.
Let's get back to the present.

89
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,520
If we're going to live together,
we need to work together.

90
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,920
I get it.

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,640
You already told us,
but what do you want us to do?

92
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,400
Open a Laab restaurant.

93
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,960
Huh?

94
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah, you heard right.
We're opening a Laab restaurant.

95
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,320
The only problem is…

96
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,160
I don't know how to make Laab.

97
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,920
Granny, can you teach us?

98
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,520
Of course!

99
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,520
My Laab

100
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,040
is so delicious,
at the level of Shell Chuan Chim.

101
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,680
But!

102
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,760
In return, Thua,
you'll have to help me find my child.

103
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Deal, Granny!

104
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,120
There's an empty room upstairs.
Come on up.

105
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,480
You guys are staying in this room.

106
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,240
Because Granny sleeps downstairs.

107
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,720
And you want us to sleep in this room?

108
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Won't the landlord get mad at you?

109
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,160
No, they won't get mad

110
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,200
if they don't know.

111
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,920
Oh!

112
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,440
Lord,

113
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,120
may all the sacred beings
protect my son Arm,

114
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,680
and keep him safe, please, Lord.

115
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,680
Granny!

116
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,960
Bung and I are going to sleep here, okay?

117
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,960
Typhoon dragged me here, Granny.
I think he's scared of ghosts.

118
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,000
Alright, alright, come on in, kids.

119
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,080
Why did you two run away from home?

120
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,280
By now, your parents and family
must be worried sick.

121
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,440
I still miss my own child too.

122
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,400
Huh? Don't you miss your home?

123
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,560
Hah!

124
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,120
Fast asleep already.

125
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,800
What about you, Bung? Don't you miss home?

126
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,680
I don't know what you've been through,

127
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,080
but every problem has a way out, my dear.

128
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,920
If you need anything,
you can talk to me about it.

129
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,280
I can't sleep in this room, Granny.

130
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,600
I think I'll go back to my own room.

131
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,600
No.

132
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,200
Yes, Dad.

133
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,240
Let Thua open a Laab restaurant
in our garage.

134
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,680
I found the missing donations.

135
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,480
Thua didn't take them. It was the thieves.

136
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,840
I feel so bad for getting Thua fired.

137
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,200
So, Dad, you have to help me.

138
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,200
Forget about Thua for now.

139
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,600
Today, Kam,

140
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,640
we need to talk.

141
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,520
Tell me. Who is he?

142
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,320
You're welcome!

143
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,440
You know, with a big face like mine,
I get all worked up

144
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,880
when I see pictures of you
flirting with that guy.

145
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,520
Calm down, Dad.

146
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,080
What's his name? Where's he from? Who are
his parents? And he's flirting with you?

147
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,520
Why don't you introduce the guy to me,
so I can scan him first?

148
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,920
Dad, it's not like that.

149
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,240
It's just, well, a little bit, you know?

150
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,480
No need to explain.

151
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,200
- Ah!
- Hmm?

152
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,640
There's a guy here to see Ms. Kam.

153
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,440
I'm going to deal with him and show him
what it means to respect his elders.

154
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,360
Is this the guy who won't enter
through the window and insist on the hole?

155
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,520
It's "enter through the door"!

156
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,440
If you can't remember,
then don't say the proverb.

157
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,160
The meaning is still the same!

158
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,240
This guy!

159
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,640
Hello. I'm Peem.

160
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,120
My mom asked me to give this to you.

161
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,240
Your mom?

162
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,520
He's the son of MP Pethai, Dad.

163
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,240
The son of MP Pethai?

164
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,640
Oh my.

165
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,200
- For you.
- Oh, you didn't have to bring anything.

166
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,840
Actually, I wanted
to introduce myself to you.

167
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,240
I've been working with Kam on some
community projects for a while now,

168
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,040
and I thought I should officially
introduce myself.

169
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,400
Wow!

170
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,320
You really don't leave
your roots behind, do you?

171
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,240
Just like your mom, huh?

172
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh! Hey!

173
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,880
You've been working with Peem
and didn't tell me?

174
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,440
Did you ever listen to me, Dad?

175
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,760
Uh, is it not okay
for Kam to work with me?

176
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,120
Hah, no, it's fine.

177
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,360
It's totally fine!

178
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,840
Kam!

179
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,360
Take care of her, okay?

180
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,760
Of course.
I'll take care of Kam the best I can.

181
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,760
LAAB ITTHIRIT RESTAURANT

182
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,520
It's ready.

183
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,360
Come and try it!

184
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,480
Laab Itthirit, all done!

185
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,320
But the kitchen is a mess, bro.

186
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,720
Eh, it'll be fine.

187
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,920
We got delicious food,
so it's worth it, right?

188
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,120
And we have to thank Granny

189
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,720
for this lesson in making Laab.

190
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,800
It's nothing.

191
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,160
Now that Laab is done,

192
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,800
when are you going to take me
to find my child?

193
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,080
Later, Granny.
Let me sell at least one plate first.

194
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,200
I'll be back soon. I'm in a hurry.

195
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,960
Oh, he's gone already.

196
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,480
Did you always want to be a politician
like your mom since you were a kid?

197
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,320
My mom has been my inspiration.

198
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,120
One day, I'll help everyone
just like she did.

199
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,160
You'll definitely make it!

200
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,040
I'll be cheering you on, sir.

201
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,400
Thank you.

202
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,880
But you don't have to call me sir.

203
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,160
It sounds too distant.

204
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,120
We're close now, so just call me Peem.

205
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,960
Okay.

206
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,560
Peem.

207
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,160
Alright, let's finish eating,

208
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,920
then we'll head out to the field together.

209
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,080
Okay, sounds good.

210
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,600
Um…

211
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,600
Kam, you've got something on your mouth.

212
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,040
Let me clean it for you.

213
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,400
Oh, it's fine.

214
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,960
No, it's okay. Let me clean it for you.

215
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,680
Thua!

216
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,480
Are you okay?

217
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,520
I'm fine.

218
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,520
Well,

219
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,400
I just brought Laab for you,
but it spilled everywhere.

220
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,880
I'll make it again.

221
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,640
Who's this?

222
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,400
The bus ticket taker at the garage.

223
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,280
The bus ticket taker?

224
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,840
Hey, put this in the basin and tidy it up.

225
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,760
Thua!

226
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,440
Thua!

227
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,520
When will you help Granny find her child?

228
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,640
Later.

229
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,320
But you promised her

230
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,800
you'd help her find her child.

231
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,000
Why do you keep postponing it?
You haven't kept your promise yet.

232
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,880
Bung, it's okay.

233
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,720
Because you're like this.

234
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,839
This is why Thua keeps
taking advantage of you.

235
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,040
That's harsh.

236
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,480
Hey! What are you talking about?

237
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,079
Think about it.

238
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,160
When you asked Granny
to teach you how to make Laab,

239
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,640
she taught you right away the next day.

240
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,120
But when she needs your help
to find her child,

241
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,040
you ignore her.

242
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,360
Isn't that taking advantage?
What should I call you?

243
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,480
Selfish?

244
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,160
What? Selfish?

245
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,800
Why are you saying it like that?

246
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,760
I just don't feel like helping Granny
look for her child right now.

247
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,480
Not in the mood?

248
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,640
What if Granny didn't feel like
helping you?

249
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
By now, you'd probably be in jail.

250
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,920
Huh? What do you mean?

251
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,160
<i>I promised Kam</i>

252
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,720
<i>I'd take responsibility,</i>

253
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,360
<i>and if I can't find it,</i>
<i>I'll turn myself in.</i>

254
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,160
If we can get the donated stuff back,

255
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,280
everything will be fine, right?

256
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,320
That's right.

257
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,560
Then, there's only one way.

258
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,520
You must use the time-reversal power
to get them back.

259
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,840
Wow!

260
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,040
Here!

261
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,760
Wait, wait.

262
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,560
So, does this mean the real thieves are…

263
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,800
Bung, Typhoon, and Granny?

264
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,400
Did you not sleep much, bro?
You're rambling.

265
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,720
Oh, I'm not rambling. Just think about it.

266
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,720
The donated stuff, right?
How could they disappear without a trace?

267
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,400
If the thieves didn't take them,

268
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,760
then it must've been you guys with
your time-reversal power taking them.

269
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,480
Hey!

270
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,600
That makes sense.

271
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,000
See? I told you, Granny!

272
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,200
I told you not to mess
with stuff from the past.

273
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,400
If they hadn't disappeared,

274
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,120
Kam wouldn't be yelling at me.

275
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,240
But Granny did it because
she cares about you!

276
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,920
You never worry about anyone but yourself.

277
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,520
She's doing good
and getting punished for it.

278
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,880
Whoever wants to stay, stay. I'm leaving.

279
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,840
Fine. If you want to leave, then leave.

280
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,960
What should we do now, just the two of us?

281
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,080
Bung is gone already,

282
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,720
and I don't think
Thua wants me to stay here.

283
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,680
I'll probably have to go back to my mom.

284
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,800
Yeah, that's good.

285
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,520
Go back to your mom.

286
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,960
She'll be so happy to see you.

287
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,880
Don't do it! Ouch!

288
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,440
- Mom!
- You!

289
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,760
Hey!

290
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,240
You're as small as a puppy.

291
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
What can you do to me, huh?

292
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,840
Don't!

293
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,600
Don't hurt my child!

294
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,680
- Run, Typhoon!
- Let go!

295
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,160
- Mom!
- I said run!

296
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,240
I said run!

297
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,480
- Let me go!
- You!

298
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,480

‪-Stop! No!

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,440
Mom!

301
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,240
I said run!

302
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,720
Maybe this isn't good, Granny.

303
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh, don't overthink it.

304
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,800
Going back to your mom will be the best.

305
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,240
Or is there something wrong at home?

306
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,200
I don't know how to get home, Granny.
Which bus should I take?

307
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,800
Oh, come on. It's very simple.

308
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,200
I can take you.

309
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,240
Don't worry about the bus route.
I know it.

310
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,520
Do you know all the bus routes?

311
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,160
Heh, not really.

312
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,280
Just ask the bus ticket taker.

313
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,160
But don't worry.
I'll take you there myself.

314
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,480
NO OUTSIDERS ALLOWED WITHOUT PERMISSION

315
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,480
Thank you, Granny, for bringing me here.

316
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,200
Oh, it's no problem.

317
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,120
I felt like going for a ride
and getting some fresh air anyway.

318
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,960
So,

319
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,880
- is this where your home is?
- It's right here.

320
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,520
Want me to go to your mom with you?

321
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,560
No, it's okay. You should head back.

322
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,920
Alright then. Take care, dear.

323
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,160
Thank you.

324
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,120
Mom, I'm back!

325
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,480
Where is everything?

326
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,160
Hey, Typhoon!

327
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,080
Your mom's gone.

328
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,920
She packed up and left with Hiew.

329
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,640
Where did she go?

330
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,600
No idea. But I do know that

331
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,400
she doesn't want you.

332
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,400
You, good-for-nothing, Boo-hoo!

333
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,480
What are you looking at?

334
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,160
You, good-for-nothing, abandoned child.

335
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,000
You, good-for-nothing, abandoned child.

336
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,120
Boo-hoo!

337
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,320
Why?

338
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,720
Typhoon, don't, dear.

339
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,880
Mom left me!

340
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,200
Typhoon!

341
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,600
It's okay, sweetheart.

342
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,640
Come live with me, alright?

343
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,160
Okay? Thua won't mind. Don't cry, sweetie.

344
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,080
Don't cry, dear.

345
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,120

00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,920
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

360
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,880
Yes.

361
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,280
Here you go.

362
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,920
Are you tired?

363
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,320
Not at all. I'm happy to help you
with your work.

364
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,320
Wow, Peem, you make Ms. Kam
work so hard for you, huh?

365
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
Choy, I'd like a pack of tissues, please.

366
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,520
- Sure. Wet or dry?
- Dry, please.

367
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,000
For your face or for things?

368
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,440
For my face.

369
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,760
Thick or thin?

370
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,840
The thickest you've got.

371
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,160
Pack or roll?

372
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,520
Come on. Anything's fine.
Just give me one already.

373
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,840
Okay, here!

374
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,200
Here you go!

375
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
Keep the change.

376
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,320
Choy, one shaved ice, please.

377
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,240
Hey, you!

378
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,800
Kam must've done some amazing
good deeds in her past life.

379
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,560
I'm so jealous, I could burst.

380
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,440
I wish I had a great guy like that

381
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,440
to take care of me.

382
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,920
A politician's son
and a garage owner's daughter,

383
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,640
such a perfect match, like gold and jade.

384
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,840
Hey, they're handing out goods today,

385
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,400
but next time, who knows?

386
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,720
Maybe wedding invitations!

387
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,480
- Oh my!
- Oh my!

388
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,120
Jeez. Take it!

389
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,280
You won't have to say much more.

390
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,000
Here, Choy. I don't need this anymore.

391
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,720
No returns.

392
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,880
Just keep it to wipe your tears instead.

393
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,520
So, it hurts, doesn't it?

394
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,240
Seeing the girl you like
with that handsome guy.

395
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,560
Well, who can resist, right?

396
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,840
Peem is such a good guy.

397
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,760
I'm gonna do better than Peem.

398
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,080
Nonsense.

399
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,880
Know your place!

400
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,960
How could you be better than him?

401
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,160
He's got money, fans,

402
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,280
and a famous mom.

403
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,640
But you? What do you have?

404
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,680
I have… I have power!

405
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,680
Just wait.

406
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,520
My power!

407
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,800
Granny!

408
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,440
Bung!

409
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,680
Typhoon!

410
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,520
Bung!

411
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,400
Bung! Typhoon!

412
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,200
Where did everyone go?

413
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,800
<i>I'm dropping Typhoon off at home.</i>

414
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,720
<i>Typhoon and Bung</i>
<i>won't stay with you anymore.</i>

415
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,840
They're not staying?

416
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,640
No, no!

417
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,200
Come back! Granny!

418
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,960
LAAB ITTHIRIT RESTAURANT

419
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,400
Granny!

420
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,000
Where should we go, dear?

421
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,840
I mean… I'm pregnant.

422
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,440
Huh?

423
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,920
So, what should we do?

424
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,040
Can we talk about this later? Right now,

425
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,080
I'm practicing for an important tryout.

426
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,800
Fine. Go back to your practice.

427
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,320
Okay.

428
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,120
Who's pregnant?

429
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,400
Uh… My friend is, Mom.

430
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,640
Don't hang out with friends like that.
They'll drag you down.

431
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,440
<i>Kids these days,</i>

432
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,840
<i>always causing trouble.</i>

433
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,280
<i>At eight weeks of pregnancy,</i>

434
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,120
<i>the arms, legs, fingers,</i>
<i>and toes begin to form,</i>

435
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,160
<i>while the bones and muscles</i>
<i>develop almost completely.</i>

436
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,120
Mom!

437
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,240
I have good news!

438
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,160
What is it, sweetheart?

439
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,120
I got a scholarship to study
at a university in Chiang Mai!

440
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,000
That's amazing!

441
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,960
I'm so proud of you!

442
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,560
Hmm.

443
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,400
Let's stay here.

444
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,840
Where are you going?

445
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,000
- Let go of me!
- No!

446
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,560
- Come with me!
- No!

447
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,680
She's not going anywhere!

448
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,800
- Granny! Typhoon!
- What the heck?

449
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,600
What's a little kid like you
gonna do to me? Huh?

450
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,000
- Bung, are you okay?
- Granny!

451
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,040
I'm fine, Granny!

452
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,400
How did you and Typhoon find me?

453
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,720
It's late.

454
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,680
Where did Phakbung go?

455
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,000
I'm so worried about you, Bung.

456
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,520
Let's go look for her, Granny!

457
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,560
I don't even know where to start.

458
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,280
It's easy!

459
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,040
Just use your time-rewinding power

460
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,240
to see where she went,

461
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,600
and then we'll find her!

462
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,640
If it weren't for you and Typhoon,

463
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,800
I'd probably be dead by now.

464
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,840
Oh dear. This world,

465
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,800
It's not as safe

466
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,360
or simple as you think, Bung.

467
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,160
It's much more dangerous than that.

468
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,720
That's right. Come back and stay with us.

469
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,680
Don't live on your own anymore.

470
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,480
But Thua…

471
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,600
It's okay.

472
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,800
ROOM AVAILABLE, TEL: 099 2585192

473
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,920
Even buses have signs

474
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,080
asking people to give up their seats
for kids, pregnant women, and the elderly.

475
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,520
Thua, you should be
accommodating to us too.

476
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,560
If you all want to stay,
then you'll need to help out.

477
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,960
With the Laab Restaurant?

478
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,400
- Sure, why not? Right, everyone?
- Yes!

479
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,400
The Laab Restaurant is just a cover.

480
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,120
Right now,

481
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,520
we need to aim for something bigger.

482
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,239
With great power

483
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,120
comes great responsibility,

484
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,920
and this is our chance as ordinary people

485
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,480
to use our power

486
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,480
to make society better.

487
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,800
Wow, you're so delusional.

488
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,360
What?

489
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,600
I mean, that's amazing!

490
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,040
- That's a great idea!
- Right?

491
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,040
So, does that mean everyone will help?

492
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,440
If we help, we can stay, right?

493
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,480
Right!

494
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,120
Then we'll help.

495
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,080
That means everyone here will be a hero!

496
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,640
Let's start a hero page!

497
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,960
What's the name of hero page?

498
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,440
Hero page, hero page, um…

499
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,880
Ah! "Please be generous!"

500
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,280
Huh?

501
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,400
<i>If we talk about a person</i>
<i>who's in the spotlight,</i>

502
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,200
<i>I believe the name "Sathaporn Samakdee"</i>

503
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,680
<i>or "Admin Thua"</i>
<i>from the "Please be generous" page</i>

504
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,560
<i>must be one of those names that's</i>
<i>definitely on the minds of many people.</i>

505
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,080
<i>Because recently,</i>

506
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,640
<i>Admin Thua has dedicated himself</i>

507
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,560
<i>as a mediator, coordinating</i>

508
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,080
<i>with the "Please be generous" heroes</i>

509
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,000
<i>to help many people.</i>

510
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,960
<i>This has earned him a lot of admiration.</i>

511
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,880
<i>Plus, it also led to him being voted</i>

512
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,600
<i>as a distinguished person</i>
<i>by the public nationwide.</i>

513
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,680
For me,

514
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,320
doing good is something
we should do anyway.

515
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,680
Whether I receive awards or not,

516
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,240
I will continue to focus on doing good,

517
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,800
so that our society will be better.
Thank you, everyone.

518
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,640
Thua!

519
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,400
I really like you. Will you date me?

520
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,360
Ms. Kam!

521
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,560
Get married!

522
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:31,120
Get married!

523
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,520
Get married!

524
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,960
I'm getting married!

525
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,120
Hey, Thua!

526
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,720
If you're awake, come over here
and help us out, quick!

527
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,440
It was just a dream?

528
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,520
The pork is all mashed up.

529
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,120
Thua, can you help pick the vegetables?

530
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,680
Why doesn't anyone know
about our page yet?

531
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,880
What should we even do
to compete with him?

532
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,880
You're right.

533
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,640
Hey, Typhoon, tonight,
massage my back for me.

534
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,680
It's killing me.

535
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,640
Your back's sore, Granny?
I'll give you a full treatment.

536
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,680
Wow!

537
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,280
- I've prepared it already.
- Oh wow!

538
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Oh, come on, guys.
Can you pay attention to me?

539
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,000
What's up, Thua?
If you have something to say, say it.

540
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,800
Jeez, fine. I won't talk anymore.

541
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,360
Wait. When we left the house,
did we close the door?

542
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,120
- Yes, we did!
- Yes!

543
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,440
- And the lights?
- The lights weren't on.

544
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,720
ROOM AVAILABLE, TEL: 099 2585192

545
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,040
- Huh?
- Hey!

546
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,720
Hurry up!

547
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,960
Hey!

548
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,600
Were there thieves in the house again?

549
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,160
- Huh! Time to take action!
- Wait a second!

550
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
I don't think it's thieves.

551
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,680
No thief would pile stuff like this.

552
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,920
It's not thieves!

553
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,040
It's the owner of the house.

554
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,960
Niow!

555
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:22,760
Thua! How dare you bring these people
to stay in my house for free?

556
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,040
Get out of here,

557
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,200
or I'll call the police
and have you all arrested!

558
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,760
Um, calm down.

559
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,280
Can we just talk things through, please?

560
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,440
Get out!

561
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,440
Hey, wait a second. Wait, wait, wait!

562
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,320
Bung! Stop!

563
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,040
I'm really sorry.

564
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,840
The reason we did this is because
we really don't have a place to stay.

565
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,600
Yes, please.

566
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,080
I'm begging you. Don't kick us out.

567
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,240
Please.

568
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,240
Fine. You can stay!

569
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,640
Wow!

570
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,200
But you have to pay rent.

571
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,040
Four thousand per room,

572
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,160
four rooms, that's 16,000.

573
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,600
Water and electricity separate.

574
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,680
One month deposit, one month advance.

575
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:19,080
In total, 48,000.
I'm giving you three days.

576
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,560
Go!

577
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,520
- Forty-eight thousand!
- Forty-eight thousand!

578
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,560
Tough like her name!

579
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,840
Here you go! What would you like?

580
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,440
Som Tum Laos?

581
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,720
Som Tum Laos, noted! Tom Saab, too?

582
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,040
Table one is ready. Serve it properly.

583
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,440
- Thua!
- Yes?

584
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,280
Bring three sets of plates,

585
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,640
forks, and spoons to the customers.

586
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,240
Got it.

587
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,440
- Hey!
- Yes!

588
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,200
I'm here!

589
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,720
LAAB ITTHIRIT RESTAURANT

590
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,560
Do you want Laab, pork Laab, beef Laab?

591
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,280
NEXT EPISODE

592
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,000
How could you do that?

593
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,800
<i>Oh no, someone saw me!</i>

594
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,280
If you know, you can't tell anyone!

595
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,880
This has to stay a secret.

596
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,960
<i>A child has been kidnapped from here!</i>

597
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,360
<i>Title!</i>

598
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,080
<i>When you brought Title here,</i>
<i>did anyone see?</i>

599
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,080
So what if they did?

600
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,000
Oh man, if someone saw, we'll look like
the kidnappers who took Title!

601
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,600
Instead of being heroes,
we'll be suspects instead!

602
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,560
