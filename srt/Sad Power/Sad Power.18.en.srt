1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,920
You better shut up! Will you shut up?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,360
Stop!

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,720
PREVIOUSLY

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,040
Typhoon!

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,960
Typhoon!

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,000
At the shelter, they’ll help
take care of me and my mom,

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,640
and also find us a place to stay.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,440
Typhoon, you finally
completed your mission, huh?

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,760
It’s really time for me to leave now.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,360
Everyone. Let’s help Granny
search for her son, okay?

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,440
If only I’d been more decisive that day,

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,720
I could have stopped Arm
from going to work overseas.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,720
There’s an update
on the human trafficking gang.

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,320
Let’s investigate it.

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,720
Either way, I’m not letting you out.

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,920
"If you go after me to Thua’s house,

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,680
I'll really run away from you for good."

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,760
I won’t give up! I’m going to separate
Kam from Thua, no matter what.

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,840
"My daughter is missing.
Her name is Phakbung."

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,040
Don’t reply to my mom’s messages,
or I'll run away from here,

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,920
and no one will ever find me again.

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,480
Don’t tell me

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,840
you’re here to convince me
to go back to Mom too.

24
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,440
I have no right to convince you.

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,760
because I don’t even know

26
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,240
what it feels like
to have time with a mom.

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,320
I'm not trying to be dramatic,

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,760
I’m just being honest.

29
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,320
I know how it feels to live

30
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,080
without a family.

31
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,040
Living without a family
is really lonely, Bung.

32
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,640
If you don’t go back,

33
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,320
your mom will probably feel lonely too.

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,000
It’s hard, though,

35
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,720
deciding between making her lonely

36
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,880
or breaking her heart.

37
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,000
What’s the right thing to do?

38
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,600
I can’t make that decision for you.

39
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,560
But if you decide to leave,

40
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,320
I’ll support you.

41
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,320
And if you don’t go back,

42
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,320
just remember.

43
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,880
This place can be your family too.

44
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,760
- Granny!
- What?

45
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,040
Hey, someone sent us a lead on our page

46
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,000
about the human trafficking gang.
We need to get to the warehouse!

47
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,800
- Let’s go, Phoon! Hurry up, Phoon!
- Thua!

48
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,440
- Huh?
- Phoon is staying with his mom now.

49
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,840
Oh, right!

50
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,760
So, it’s just me and you left, huh?

51
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,480
What about Bung? Let me call Bung first.

52
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,800
How’s it going?

53
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,280
She’s not answering. What should we do?

54
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,680
- Ms. Kam! Hold on. We’ve got Ms. Kam.
- Yeah.

55
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,440
Let me get the eggs off the stove.

56
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,400
Okay.

57
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,440
Okay, I’ll catch up in a bit.

58
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,920
Hey!

59
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,240
Seriously, Dad?

60
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,840
Today, you’re not running off anywhere.

61
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,560
I’m free,
and I want to spend time with you.

62
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,480
Did you ask me
if I want to spend time with you?

63
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,080
Kam.

64
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,280
If you’re running off to Thua’s place,

65
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,360
Seng and I are coming too.

66
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,680
Wherever or however
you want to save humanity,

67
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,680
I’m fine with it.

68
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,320
Well, I’m not fine with it!

69
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,320
This is the riverside warehouse
that the page follower reported.

70
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,440
Granny, they’re moving people right now!

71
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,480
That’s bad. You have to help them!

72
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,160
- But they have guns!
- Huh?

73
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,400
And I don’t have power like Phoon.
Can you really stop time?

74
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,680
I’m not sure about that. What do we do?

75
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,800
Or maybe it’s too risky.
Should we just leave it?

76
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,280
What about those people, though?

77
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,480
I’ll handle it!

78
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,680
- Hey, Phoon!
- Phoon!

79
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,040
How did you get here?

80
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,680
I called Kam, and she told me
everyone’s searching for Arm.

81
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,200
So, I asked Mom to let me come.
Don’t worry, Granny.

82
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,960
I’ll help you find Arm, no matter what.

83
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,200
Really, Phoon?

84
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Thank you so much, dear.

85
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,200
Come here. Give me a hug! I missed you.

86
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,560
Wait, let’s get back to the mission.

87
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,280
I feel better now.

88
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,320
Come on. Let’s go!

89
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,560
Come on.

90
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,640
- Hey!
- Oh!

91
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,800
What is it, Phoon?

92
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,160
I didn’t mean to!

93
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,120
I just tried to grab the milk carton,
but my power acted on its own.

94
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,960
Right now, I don’t know what’s wrong.
I can’t control it.

95
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,520
Oh.

96
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,720
What a shame!

97
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,040
In that case, I'll stop time. Let’s go!

98
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,800
You said you were going to stop time,
so why are we here?

99
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,520
Yeah, wait.

100
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,360
Wait.

101
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,080
Look, we’ve gone back three hours!

102
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,480
Huh?

103
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,400
I don’t know!

104
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,280
I tried to stop time,

105
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,159
but it didn’t work.

106
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,480
Instead, it sent us back here!

107
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,520
Okay, Granny. Let’s think this through.
We need to get back to help them.

108
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,640
Oh.

109
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,440
We need to warp back. Go back now.

110
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,680
Go back?

111
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,680
- Warp back?
- Go back.

112
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,440
- Okay, I'll go back now!
- Hold her.

113
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,800
Hold her.

114
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
Hold.

115
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,280
- The same place!
- Huh?

116
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,880
We’re back to the present!

117
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,040
But they’re not here anymore.

118
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,200
- What the heck?
- You’re right, Thua.

119
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,520
Wait, let me try rewinding time again.

120
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,560
- Come on.
- Let’s do this, Granny.

121
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,120
- Hey, Granny!
- Granny!

122
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,520
What’s wrong?

123
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,280
I suddenly got this splitting headache.

124
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,760
Maybe you should rest for a bit.

125
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,120
Granny’s power is acting up.

126
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,440
Phoon’s power is also out of control.

127
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,360
Could it be that some higher force
is taking everyone’s powers away?

128
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,480
Huh?

129
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,760
Let’s rest for now.

130
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,360
If you’re calling just to say
there’s no progress,

131
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,120
I’m going to fire you.

132
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,000
Wait a moment! I’ve found your daughter.

133
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,920
What? Where?

134
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,720
I followed her to the bus community,

135
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,320
but then I lost track of her.
I’ll send you the location pin.

136
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,720
Alright, thank you very much!

137
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Mom!

138
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,720
Excuse me. May I ask you something?

139
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,960
Stop for a moment, please.

140
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,600
Bung.

141
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,880
Bung, is that you? Why are you running?
Wait for me, Bung!

142
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,640
- Bung!
- Hey, the baby might slip out!

143
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,680
Your belly's big! Don't run!

144
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,920
Pregnant?

145
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,080
Bung is pregnant?

146
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,000
Everyone, this is bad!

147
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,520
- What’s wrong?
- Well…

148
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,080
My mom came here
and found out that I’m pregnant.

149
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,400
- Huh?
- Huh?

150
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,920
Are you sure that who you saw
was really Phakbung?

151
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,920
You said you only saw
the back of her, didn’t you?

152
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,560
She’s my daughter. Even if I only
saw her back, I’d recognize her.

153
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,400
Here’s all the information I have
on the human trafficking gang.

154
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,720
Thank you, Mr. Peem.

155
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,000
The information you provided
is very helpful to the police.

156
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,000
You're welcome, Officer. I’m determined
to do everything I can to help society.

157
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,560
Officer!

158
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,760
Please help my daughter!

159
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,640
She was kidnapped
by the human trafficking gang.

160
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,280
Here are pictures of our daughter.

161
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,880
My wife suspects
they’ve made her pregnant too.

162
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,160
Well, as soon as we found out,

163
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,520
we rushed home to find Title.

164
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,160
We really didn't know

165
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,760
the kid we helped
was the one everyone was looking for.

166
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,720
Phakbung is your daughter?

167
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,320
Do you know her?

168
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,480
Yes, I’ve met her before.

169
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,680
But she isn’t with
the human trafficking gang.

170
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,520
Is it going to dry out?

171
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,760
The powers are unstable, and now,
there's more trouble with Phakbung.

172
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,680
See, this is what they say.

173
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,680
Bad luck doesn’t come alone.

174
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,080
It brings its friends along.

175
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,040
So, what should we do? Can we help her?

176
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,520
Phakbung must be really upset.

177
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,040
She went to her room
and hasn’t come out since.

178
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,080
Should we go check on her, Granny?

179
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,960
Hmm, alright.

180
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,520
‪Let’s go.

181
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,400
Hello. Is anyone home?

182
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,680
Who are you looking for?

183
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,600
We’re looking for this girl.

184
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,720
Please open the door.

185
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,040
Phakbung, my daughter!

186
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,360
Phakbung!

187
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,440
The police are here.

188
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,680
Please open the door.

189
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,600
The clothes.

190
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,200
Gather the clothes, Phoon.

191
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,480
Alright, sure. Go ahead.

192
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,600
Feel free. Take your time.

193
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,480
Oh, who taught you
to hang the laundry like this, Phoon?

194
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,720
Thua hung them up.

195
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,840
Hurry up. Help out!

196
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,920
Oh no, it fell again.

197
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,040
Hurry!

198
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,920
Where is my daughter?

199
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,640
Um… Uh, well…

200
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,600
Search it, Officer.

201
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,360
Wait, calm down! What’s going on here?

202
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,200
Wait, Officer…

203
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,960
Well…

204
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,280
Thua.

205
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,480
Wait!

206
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,520
- Why can't we go upstairs?
- The room's a mess.

207
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,640
She must be upstairs!

208
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,680
Get out of the way. After you, Officer.

209
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,760
See? There’s nothing here.

210
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,040
I told you.

211
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,520
Wait a minute.

212
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,880
What about these clothes?
Who is the owner?

213
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
Hey!

214
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,000
These are Phakbung’s clothes!

215
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,880
And this is her bag.

216
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,920
These are definitely hers!

217
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,920
These are your child's, right?

218
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,200
- Yes, they are.
- Take him away.

219
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,880
Hey, calm down, Officer.

220
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,160
Wait! Let’s talk this over.

221
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,880
- Don’t resist, please.
- Whoa.

222
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,160
Where did you hide my daughter?
Tell me now!

223
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,040
Can we talk calmly, please?

224
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,040
Let’s talk at the station.

225
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,720
Where is my daughter?

226
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,120
- Calm down, Officer.
- Don’t resist, please.

227
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,080
Here, drink this, so you can calm down.

228
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,000
I know you’re worried,

229
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,440
but running away like this
isn’t the answer.

230
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,880
Please go back and meet your mom and dad.

231
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,760
No.

232
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,680
Why not? Don’t you trust your parents?

233
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,080
It’s because I know what they’re like,

234
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,120
that’s why I don’t want to see them.

235
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,640
Bung, listen to me.

236
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,880
Don’t be so pessimistic.

237
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,320
Oh, Bung, you’re here.

238
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,960
Bung, when did you come out?

239
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,760
Do you know we're in trouble now?

240
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,359
What happened?

241
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,200
It’s Peem.
He brought your mom to the house.

242
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,040
The police have already taken Thua.

243
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,680
Why did the police arrest him?

244
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,720
Because Bung’s parents think
he got Bung pregnant.

245
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,240
- Huh?
- Huh?

246
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,760
I didn’t kidnap anyone,
and I didn’t make Bung pregnant.

247
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,520
Please believe me.

248
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,640
But I remember
you were with Bung the whole time.

249
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Well…

250
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,120
Okay, that part is true.

251
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,840
Then, confess.

252
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,400
How did you lure her?
And where is she now?

253
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,080
I don’t know
if I made the right choice or not

254
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,000
by running away from my parents.

255
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,520
If it were me,

256
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,800
I would go back and talk to my parents
and clear things up.

257
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,800
Whatever the outcome is,
I’ll deal with it later.

258
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,440
But they’ll be heartbroken, Thua.

259
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,160
See? Saying that means

260
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,120
you still care about your parents, huh?

261
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,520
Can you promise me something?

262
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,680
Please don’t tell anyone about this.

263
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,520
If my parents find out,

264
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,160
I want to be the one
to tell them everything.

265
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,320
But for now, I need some time to think.

266
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,200
Okay, I promise. I won’t say anything.

267
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,960
Listen, I really can’t say it.

268
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,120
Please understand.

269
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,240
Luring a minor is a criminal offense.

270
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,280
Even though you don't tell us,
you'll still end up in jail.

271
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,160
Hey! I’m telling you,
I didn’t lure anyone!

272
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,400
Please believe me.

273
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,800
I didn’t lure anyone. Please.

274
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,800
If you don't speak,
you’ll stay here for a while.

275
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,120
Take him to the cell.

276
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,120
Hey, what is this? Hey, Officer!

277
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,280
- You bastard! Give my child back!
- Ouch!

278
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,200
- Give my child back!
- Calm down.

279
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,440
Oh my, stop! Stop! Stop it!

280
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,760
Thua didn’t do anything wrong.
Officer, please let him go!

281
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,240
Thua didn’t lure anyone,
but he helped Phakbung.

282
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,640
She's pregnant. The baby doesn't have
a father, so she ran away from home.

283
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,680
Then she had an accident.

284
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,200
If Thua hadn’t helped her, we don’t know
what would have happened.

285
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,440
Bung is pregnant and without a father?

286
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,920
- Hey, dear!
- Oh my goodness!

287
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,120
Dear!

288
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,800
- Dear!
- Sit down at the table first.

289
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
Dear!

290
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,280
How is it?

291
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,160
If you’re worried like this,

292
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,280
why didn’t you go
with them from the start?

293
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,800
Did you hear everything, Ah?

294
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,520
Well…

295
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,680
I still can't bring myself
to face my parents.

296
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,120
Why?

297
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,680
Are your parents strict?
Or don’t they love you?

298
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,480
Seeing this reminds me
of when I was pregnant with Kam.

299
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,880
Uh, no.

300
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,720
I mean, her mom was pregnant.

301
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,160
I know. You don’t have to tell me.

302
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,720
It's a pity

303
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,520
that I didn’t make peace
with Chief Khachon back then.

304
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,400
He never had the chance to take care
of his only granddaughter

305
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,560
during such an important moment.

306
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,800
If I could turn back time,

307
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,760
I wouldn’t have made that mistake.

308
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,280
Well, back then, we didn’t know

309
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,480
if Chief Khachon would accept Kam.

310
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,200
I lost my chance,

311
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,120
but you still have time.

312
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,840
Kam.

313
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,760
How's Thua?

314
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,240
The police released Thua,

315
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,200
but your mom…

316
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,960
Huh? Mom?

317
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,800
What happened to my mom, Kam?

318
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,240
You can go home now, Thua.

319
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,600
MALE DETAINEE INTERROGATION ROOM

320
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,720
Alright.

321
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,000
I want to file a defamation complain.

322
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,320
Please take care of it, Officer.

323
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,080
It's part of the process.

324
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,560
If the suspect files a counterclaim,
it'll be a waste of time for the police.

325
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,200
Hey, but you’re not the police!
And you’re accusing me!

326
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,400
I won’t stand for it!

327
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,520
Why are you getting upset now, Thua?
Let’s go home.

328
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,040
He didn’t mean it.

329
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,720
Let’s just end it here.

330
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,280
I can’t, Granny. This is about my dignity!

331
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,400
Nonsense.

332
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,720
See? Clearly!

333
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,000
Officer, take care of this!
He’s accusing me again!

334
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,120
Hey! Where are you going?

335
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,160
Mr. Peem! I mean, Peem!

336
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,640
Officer, take care of this!

337
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,560
Yes, Ms. Kam?

338
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,920
Okay. I'll go now.

339
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,840
Uh…

340
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,280
Why did Bung come here, Kam?

341
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,840
I heard her mom’s not feeling well.

342
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,280
- This is bad.
- Why?

343
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,120
We haven’t told her
about the unstable powers yet.

344
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,600
What if she uses her healing power on
her mom? I wonder how that will turn out.

345
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,320
But from what I can tell,
my power and Granny's power

346
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,160
don’t seem too good either.

347
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,360
In that case, let’s split up
and look for her.

348
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
- Yeah.
- Let's go!

349
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
What happened?

350
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,160
- It’s nothing. Just a little bump.
- We'll go that way.

351
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,200
- Let’s go.
- Okay.

352
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,080
Mom.

353
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,120
I’m sorry.

354
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,320
Don’t, Bung. Trust me.

355
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,360
Why?

356
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,880
Bung.

357
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,120
Come out first. Trust me.

358
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,080
- Go.
- Go.

359
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,880
- Let me go.
- I won’t let you go. Trust me.

360
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,160
- Let me go.
- Bung.

361
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,480
- Sit down first.
- Sit down.

362
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,400
Sit down!

363
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,640
What’s going on here? Don’t you see

364
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,760
that my mom’s condition isn’t too good?

365
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,120
Bung, if you use your power,

366
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,400
your mom might get worse.

367
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,400
Everyone’s power is unstable right now.

368
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,120
Yesterday, I went to search for Arm.

369
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,320
Granny and I couldn’t control our powers.

370
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,840
Yes, I took everyone to the wrong place.

371
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,760
And he couldn’t control his power.

372
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,880
- Really, Granny?
- Yeah.

373
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,600
We wouldn’t lie
about something this important.

374
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,520
Here’s an idea. Just now, Thua got hurt.

375
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,480
Why not try using the power

376
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,960
and see what happens?

377
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,960
Let’s give it a try.

378
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,440
Come on.

379
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,520
- Come on.
- Good luck, Bung!

380
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,960
Ouch. Oh no.

381
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,800
- Hey, why did it turn out like that?
- Bung.

382
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,320
See? Do you believe us now?

383
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,720
Ouch!

384
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,720
From the information we've received,

385
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,600
we’ve been able to help
many victims of human trafficking.

386
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,760
We will continue to investigate
and target the masterminds behind it.

387
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,120
I heard this success was due to
your information, Mr. Peem. Is that true?

388
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,720
Yes. My team and I
are following this closely

389
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,280
and will keep working with the police

390
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,760
to dismantle this criminal organization.

391
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,640
Is it true that you're planning to run
for parliament

392
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,880
in the next election?

393
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,600
Wait a minute.
How did you hear about this?

394
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,840
- Is it true?
- Please answer.

395
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,200
Yes, it's true.
I ask for everyone’s support.

396
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,960
Okay, may I take a photo?

397
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,240
He's really handsome.

398
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,840
I almost had a famous son-in-law!

399
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,560
Hmm…

400
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,680
Hey, Kam.

401
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,880
Kam.

402
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,840
- What, Dad?
- Don’t you feel regretful about Peem?

403
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,320
No, Dad.

404
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,040
It wouldn't have worked out between us.

405
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,240
I'm more comfortable with Thua.

406
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,240
Hey!

407
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,640
Why are you bringing up Thua?

408
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,080
Don’t talk about him, please.

409
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,760
Fine, changing the topic.

410
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,400
Thanks, Dad.

411
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,480
- Thanks for what?
- For comforting Phakbung.

412
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,920
You knew?

413
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,160
How's she doing? Is she better?

414
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,080
Not yet, Dad. It’ll take time.

415
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,160
If I were pregnant without
a father like her, what would you do?

416
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,280
Oh!

417
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,200
My daughter,

418
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,120
always asking these questions.

419
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,440
Please answer, Dad.

420
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,480
Well, as parents,

421
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,480
when the child makes a mistake,

422
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,320
we still have to forgive them in the end.

423
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,720
So, if I were pregnant with Thua,

424
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,800
you'd be okay with it?

425
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,040
You're bringing up Thua again, huh?

426
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,760
- Bringing up him again? Shut your mouth!
- Just kidding, Dad.

427
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,560
- Don’t joke about it.
- Oh, just kidding.

428
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,320
- Next time, don’t mention him.
- Oh.

429
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,680
There’s no pregnancy. Nothing like that.

430
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,400
My head hurts.

431
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,520
The launch of your campaign
went really well.

432
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,320
The hashtag "Future MP Peem"
is trending too.

433
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,400
I must thank you, Nutty.

434
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,000
Without you, this wouldn’t have happened.

435
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,080
No, Peem, it's you who's amazing.
I only helped a little bit.

436
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,520
Is there anything you want?
I'll give you anything.

437
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,520
No need. I'm happy to help.

438
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,440
Thank you.

439
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,320
Mr. Peem, someone’s here to see you.

440
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,360
Peem, I need your help with something.

441
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,280
Thank you so much for agreeing to help me.

442
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,320
No problem. If there's any progress,
I'll update you right away.

443
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,800
Thank you.

444
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,760
Why are you wasting time
on something so small?

445
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,000
I sympathize. As a father, he probably
really wants to see his daughter.

446
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,560
Where did you take my daughter?

447
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,680
Isn’t this a bit much, Officer?

448
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,800
What’s the charge, Officer?

449
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,560
- Oh no.
- Officer!

450
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,920
You've been caught.

451
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,920
We've surrounded this place.

452
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,440
This cloth is the same as what
the "Please be generous" gang uses.

453
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,360
Does that mean those people
are the "Please be generous" heroes?

454
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,720
There is a kid, a pregnant woman,
and an elderly person.

455
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,720
Why didn’t I notice?

456
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,160
So, what do you want me to do next?

457
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,400
Keep an eye on them for now.

458
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,720
Got it.

459
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,440
I want to help my mom.

460
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,080
If something happens to her,

461
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,200
I’ll feel guilty for the rest of my life.

462
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,120
I understand.

463
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,720
But with our powers like this,
what can we do?

464
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,000
It’s not just your mom, Bung,

465
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,560
who needs help.

466
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,760
I’ve been getting a ton of inbox messages.

467
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,120
Hundreds!

468
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,160
Yeah, exactly.

469
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,360
So, how about we pick a case
and go after it?

470
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,880
Are you sure you want to go help?

471
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,760
What if it just makes things worse?

472
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,800
If you get caught, it’ll be a real mess.

473
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,440
I don’t want to just sit around.

474
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,320
The first thing we need to do

475
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,720
is figure out
why our powers are out of control.

476
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,000
How are we supposed to find that out?

477
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,680
Wherever we got our powers from,

478
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,800
that’s where we need to go.

479
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,480
I hope we’ll find the answer.

480
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,320
Let’s go. We need to hurry.

481
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,240
Let's go.

482
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,760
ROOM AVAILABLE, TEL: 099 2585192

483
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,960
Hey, have you guys noticed?

484
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,120
We haven’t heard anything about
the "Please be generous" gang lately.

485
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,760
Yeah, there’s a rumor they were taken out
by criminals. Is that true?

486
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,560
Are you crazy? What kind of criminal
could take them down?

487
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,920
They have superpowers!

488
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,400
But they’ve been quiet lately.

489
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,280
I sent them a message asking for help,

490
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,960
and no one replied.

491
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,680
Someone read my message,
but no one responded.

492
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,280
- Yeah.
- Same here!

493
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,000
Do you think
they’ve stopped helping people?

494
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,480
- Hmm.
- Huh?

495
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,560
Seems like those weird heroes
might be having some issues.

496
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,440
Then, let’s talk to them.

497
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,080
- Right.
- Excuse me.

498
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,800
I overheard you talking
about the "Please be generous" gang.

499
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,040
Is there something I can help with?

500
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,080
If there’s anything, let Peem know
if it’s about the community.

501
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,600
That’s right. I have a team
dedicated to solving social problems.

502
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,920
Yeah, he handles a lot of social issues.

503
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,040
- Really?
- Absolutely. Just tell me.

504
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,400
- That’s great! Please help…
- There's…

505
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,240
Me first. Someone keeps parking
in front of my house.

506
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,880
- We argue daily!
- I’ll handle it.

507
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,920
Please help!

508
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,400
Granny, do we really need all this stuff?

509
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,800
Of course! No one goes to pray
to sacred spirits empty-handed,

510
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,960
especially when asking for help.

511
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,600
If I were a spirit,
I wouldn’t want flowers.

512
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,880
I’d ask for snacks instead.

513
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,040
Don’t be silly, Typhoon!

514
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,160
Hey! Oh no!

515
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,160
- Thua.
- Huh, Granny?

516
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,320
I forgot the red soda!

517
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,440
Oh, Granny. What if the spirit’s
cutting back on sugar?

518
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,480
If we go back to buy it, we’ll be late!

519
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,760
Please, just one more thing.

520
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,440
It won’t be complete without it!

521
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,280
Don’t tell me we have to go back.

522
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,239
A man with a mustache buying hair clips?

523
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,800
Did you all see that?

524
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,760
He looks strange, doesn’t he, Thua?

525
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,719
Hey. When I bought flowers,

526
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,320
I noticed him earlier.
He acted the same way.

527
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,600
Is he following us?

528
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,280
- What does he want?
- Um…

529
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,719
Let’s find out!

530
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,920
- Gotcha!
- Gotcha!

531
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,960
One, two, three!

532
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,280
- Over here! Why do you follow women?
- What the heck!

533
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,400
Hey!

534
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,480
I almost lost the baby!

535
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,520
Is Thua still not here, Granny?

536
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,360
Right!

537
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,440
I think that guy’s following him,

538
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,040
so he's probably leading him away.

539
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,200
What should we do now?

540
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,480
Hello? Oh, Dr. Korn?

541
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,080
Is Mom’s condition critical?

542
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,960
Okay, I’ll head over right away.

543
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,520
- Go, go! Hurry to the hospital!
- Let's go.

544
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,680
- Hurry! Let's go.
- Alright.

545
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,720
Let's go!

546
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,520
I went to see Mr. Peem.

547
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,520
He promised to help find Bung.

548
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,760
You're here.

549
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,160
You tricked me!

550
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,680
Why did you lie,
saying Mom's condition was critical?

551
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,640
Don't you have anything better to do?

552
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,640
How did you know she’s my mom?

553
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,880
I saw the same last name.

554
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,560
And your mom’s missing child

555
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,360
isn’t exactly a secret.

556
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,960
Then tell me, why make me panic like that?

557
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,360
I’m sorry.

558
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,840
I was just really concerned about you.

559
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,160
I apologize for lying.

560
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,800
You still love and care about your mom.

561
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,600
Why don’t you go back to her?

562
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,920
You wouldn’t understand.

563
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,840
No, I don’t.

564
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,440
Why didn’t you do the right thing
when you had the chance?

565
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,640
And if something happens later,

566
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,240
you can’t fix it.

567
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,880
Are you prepared to carry
that guilt forever?

568
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,840
I…

569
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,240
Don’t do something you’ll regret later.

570
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,440
You don't know anything.
You can say whatever you want.

571
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,720
If I hadn’t run away from home,

572
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,640
they would have forced me to abort.

573
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,520
How do you know that?

574
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,480
Because I asked my mom.

575
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,120
I pretended it was for a friend,

576
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,040
but she couldn’t accept it.

577
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,040
What your mom said was just her thought.

578
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,240
She didn’t even know you were pregnant.

579
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,640
Stop talking. I’m leaving.

580
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,160
Doctor, please come to check
on the patient in room 3111.

581
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,600
Room 3111? That’s my mom’s room.

582
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
Hey!

583
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,480
Mom!

584
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,720
Bung, you should go out for now.

585
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,760
Do you think Thua will get caught, Granny?

586
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,040
Oh. I’m exhausted.

587
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,760
Bring me some water, please.

588
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,640
- Thua.
- So tired.

589
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,400
Why did you take so long?

590
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,400
I thought you got caught.

591
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,000
- Granny.
- Huh?

592
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,800
I won’t get caught easily,

593
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,840
but it took so long to shake him off.
He was really persistent.

594
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,720
Here, drink up first.

595
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,320
Who is he? Why is he following us?

596
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm choking.

597
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,760
I don’t know, but it can’t be good.

598
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,040
Ugh.

599
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,680
Thua, Granny, Typhoon!

600
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,520
I thought I wouldn’t find anyone.

601
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,280
What’s up?

602
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,760
You didn’t check your phones, did you?

603
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,680
Huh?

604
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,560
Our page is getting flooded with insults.

605
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,920
I'M DISAPPOINTED - YOU ALL ARE CRUEL
LIARS - SCAMMER

606
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,880
They say we didn’t really
want to help people.

607
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,240
Well, our powers aren’t working right now.

608
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,080
What should we do?

609
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,720
Should we find a case
that’s easier to handle first?

610
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,080
No need. They’re upset

611
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,160
because someone else
is handling things for us.

612
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,120
So, they think we’re just sitting around.

613
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,640
Who did it for us?

614
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,640
Peem.

615
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,720
Does Peem know our secret now?

616
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,320
I’m going to expose all of them

617
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,400
and turn their supporters
into my base of power.

618
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,400
Someone from our page messaged

619
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,360
about finding an escaped illegal worker
from human traffickers.

620
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,680
- Arm!
- Really?

621
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,320
Without powers,
we can’t help Arm on our own.

622
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,200
We need to find a way
to get our powers back to normal.

623
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,720
Tell us where the person who ran off is.

624
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,080
Go ask him in hell.

625
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,560
Power of destruction!

626
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,560
