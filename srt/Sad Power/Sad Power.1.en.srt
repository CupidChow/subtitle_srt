00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,960
<i>Someone once told me the world these days</i>

3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,360
<i>was a hostile place. It's so true.</i>

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,480
<i>Because it's hard enough</i>
<i>just to survive each day.</i>

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,160
<i>And no matter how hard we try,</i>

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,720
<i>we may fall victim to bad luck.</i>

7
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,280
<i>And this kind of bad luck</i>
<i>is so indiscriminating</i>

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,720
<i>that sometimes I wonder,</i>
<i>"What have I done wrong?"</i>

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,080
<i>"Why isn't luck ever on my side?"</i>

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,280
<i>"Why are there only problems?"</i>

11
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,920
Whoa, meteor shower!

12
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,320
Ever heard this? They say,

13
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,600
if you want something,
make a wish to shooting stars.

14
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,840
Nonsense, Joed.

15
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,400
If that were true, everyone in the world
would never know disappointment.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,960
Gee, Thua!

17
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,240
Shit! We're screwed!

18
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,640
Joed!

19
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,480
Joed! What the hell?

20
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,960
Shit.

21
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,200
Kid?

22
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,720
Shit. No heartbeat.

23
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Miss?

24
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,280
Shit.

25
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,520
She's not breathing either.
Granny? What the heck?

26
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,200
Are they all dead? What do I do? Phone.

27
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,399
Hello? Wait. Wrong number.

28
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,880
One… One-six… One-six-eight-six.

29
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,360
Mister?

30
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,440
Mister?

31
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,440
‪My baby?

32
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,480
- Is she dead? My bags?
- Mister?

33
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,160
Miss, wait for me! Miss!

34
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,840
Such a big crash.

35
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,200
Why am I not hurt?

36
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,600
But that's a good thing.

37
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,760
Why are you following me?

38
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,840
Stop following me. Go home.

39
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,840
I can't go home!

40
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,160
It's okay. Don't cry.

41
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,800
Son?

42
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,480
Son?

43
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,920
- Son?
- Ghost!

44
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,800
Ghost? Where? Where's the ghost? Where?

45
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,120
- Where?
- You're the ghost.

46
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,440
Huh? Me?

47
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,520
- Yeah. You are!
- No, I'm not a ghost. No!

48
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,760
- Here, touch me.
- No!

49
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,040
- Touch me.
- No!

50
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,200
If I'm a ghost, how can I touch you?
Think. Come on. Think.

51
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,080
You're right.

52
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,200
I'm still warm. See?

53
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,120
You're right.

54
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,480
Wait. Are you okay, Granny? Should I take
you to a hospital? Are you hurt anywhere?

55
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,920
No, but I…

56
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,480
I want you to take me here.

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,280
31/8 M.6 BANG KRATHUEK
SAM PHRAN, NAKHON PATHOM

58
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,520
Here. Drink it.

59
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,840
Thank you, miss.

60
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,800
No more crying.

61
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,000
Uh, what's your name?

62
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm Phakbung. What about you?

63
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,120
My name's Typhoon.

64
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,160
So, tell me

65
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,440
why you can't go home.

66
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,360
Can I crash at your house tonight?

67
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,160
I can't go home either.

68
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,480
Why not?

69
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,280
Hey, stop running! Hey!

70
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,040
What the hell?

71
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,040
- No! Let me go!
- Stay still.

72
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Hey, who's there?

73
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,800
Come on! Stop!

74
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,640
Stop!

75
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,919
Hey! Stop!

76
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,520
Stop! Stop right there!

77
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,120
Hey, they're kids, boss.

78
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,600
- So what? They saw us stab someone.
- Typhoon, run!

79
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,920
- Hey, catch him!
- Hey!

80
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,080
- Hey!
- No!

81
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,560
- No.
- Get her.

82
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,480
Bung!

83
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,920
- Let go. Get off me.
- Hey.

84
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,800
Awesome.

85
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,520
Wow, Typhoon.

86
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,520
Hey!

87
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,760
Hey, no!

88
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,840
Typhoon!

89
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,520
How are you? Are you okay?
Are you hurt anywhere?

90
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,160
Looks like he's done, boss.

91
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,840
Get him. What are you waiting for?

92
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,680
Is that a good idea?
Why don't you lead the way?

93
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,120
Hey, help me.

94
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,200
This is the place. I remember it.
Come on, Thua.

95
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,880
Arm? Arm, baby?

96
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,720
Arm, open the door, baby!

97
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,920
- Arm?
- Granny.

98
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,400
From the look of it,
I don't think anyone's here.

99
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,040
Arm? Arm, it's your mother!

100
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,200
- You're back, right?
- What's going on?

101
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,560
No one lives in that room.

102
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,200
Even since I moved here,
that room's always been empty.

103
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,640
And how long have you lived here?

104
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,080
Almost a year.

105
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,720
Do you have other relatives?
I'll take you to them.

106
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,840
Then, where do you live?
Or where have you been living?

107
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,480
I'll take you there.

108
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,280
No. I…

109
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,400
I don't want to live there anymore.

110
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,040
Mom,

111
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,480
please don't be mad at me.
I'll call you often.

112
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,520
‪NURSING HOME

113
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,880
I understand, baby,
that you have to work far from home.

114
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,080
You're worried. You don't want me
to live by myself, so you put me here.

115
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,960
I'm contracted for only six months.
Please wait for me.

116
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,200
When I get the money, I'll pick you up.

117
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,960
I'll move you to a big, beautiful house.

118
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,920
You'll have space to plant flowers
the way you want.

119
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,320
‪Actually,

120
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,280
just having you with me

121
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,200
makes me the happiest.

122
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,240
I love you, Mom.

123
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,000
I'll hurry back, Mom.

124
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,520
Did you know the doctor called
and talked to me the other day?

125
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,120
About what?

126
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,360
About Granny Cheuy.

127
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,200
This round of her health tests
came back awful.

128
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,840
The doctor warned her
to watch out for lots of things

129
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,360
because she's quite old.

130

LAUNDRY SERVICES
FREE PICK-UP AND DELIVERY

<i>I've waited for almost a year, Thua.</i>

132
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,200
Arm said he'd be gone for only six months.

133
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,160
Something bad must have happened.

134
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,640
Arm never breaks his promises.
With him missing like this…

135
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,640
I…

136
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,480
I'm scared.

137
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,160
I couldn't just wait and do nothing.

138
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,680
- Let go!
- Get in there!

139
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,920
What do we do?

140
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,000
Turn around. I'll untie you.

141
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,200
How do I untie this?

142
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,000
Just a sec.

143
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,120
- Got it?
- Yes.

144
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,520
Untie me too.

145
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,720
It's locked from the outside.

146
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,520
Bung, I'm scared.

147
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,320
Wait. Come here.

148
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,120
Tell me what happened earlier.

149
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,280
How could you suddenly
have that much strength?

150
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,200
But I'd never had
that kind of strength before.

151
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,040
And suddenly, it just went away.

152
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,280
So, what happened?

153
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,480
You got injured?
Where did you get that from?

154
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,240
I have no idea.

155
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,920
Let me see.

156
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,000
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

157
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,280
The wound's gone.
And there's no more pain.

158
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,120
Those kids seem strange, boss.

159
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,040
I think so too.
Especially the boy. He was so strong.

160
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,200
True, boss. He was like a superhero.

161
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,200
Or are we both superheroes?

162
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,840
Whoa.

163
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,320
Really?

164
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,400
Where were you last night, Thua?
You didn't answer your phone.

165
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,160
Such a big crash.
The police had to question witnesses.

166
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,280
But you and Joed were nowhere to be found.

167
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,120
I'm sorry, boss. I was in shock, so I…

168
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,800
went home to calm down.

169
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,160
- What about Joed?
- He ran.

170
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,360
He ran?

171
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,000
Wonderful.

172
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,920
Go to the police station.

173
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,760
Hurry and give your statement

174
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,040
before my migraine acts up!

175
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,720
Dad?

176
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,280
- Go already!
- I'm going!

177
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,560
Who was that, Dad?

178
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,840
What got you so mad?
I heard your voice all the way up there.

179
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,560
I was mad at Thua.

180
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,840
Thua?

181
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,400
Gee.

182
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,360
What did you do to deserve this, Thua?
You'd been robbed, then had a crash.

183
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,840
<i>You see, my bad luck started two days ago.</i>

184
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,800
TWO DAYS EARLIER

185
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,520
DONATION BOX

186
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,400
All done, Ms. Kam.

187
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,400
Thanks for lending me your space, Thua.

188
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,080
We could actually keep them
at the bus garage.

189
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,280
No. If my dad sees them,
he'll complain my ears off.

190
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,360
He always says I'm nosy.

191
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,360
That's not true, Ms. Kam.

192
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,480
You're just a generous person
who loves to help people.

193
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,680
Thanks, Thua.

194
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,080
Now that it's done, I'm going.

195
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,400
Okay.

196
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,520
- Bye.
- Bye.

197
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,480
My angel.

198
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,600
How did this one get here?

199
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,840
Whoa.

200
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,560
Where's her stuff?

201
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,720
Granny, are you hungry?
I bought you noodles.

202
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,400
- Thanks a lot.
- Did you sleep well last night?

203
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,360
I had to wake up early for work,
so I couldn't wait for you.

204
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,000
I did. You got off work already?

205
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,160
No, Granny.

206
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,440
I still have go to the police station.
I came by to drop off the noodles.

207
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,240
Get a bowl.

208
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,840
And if you don't know where to go,

209
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,880
you can stay here for now.

210
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,240
Thanks a lot.

211
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,280
You were kind enough to let me stay
with you and now you're taking care of me.

212
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,640
Thua! I'm here to get my stuff.

213
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,960
Are you his grandmother?
We've never met. Hello.

214
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,680
Hello there.

215
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,560
I'm taking my stuff to donate.

216
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,680
Uh…

217
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,080
Where's the key?

218
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,760
The key… Uh…

219
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,960
Oh, there it is.

220
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,840
Ms. Kam, can we maybe

221
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,800
do it a few days later?

222
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,800
We can't. I already set up
a meeting with the community.

223
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,080
Maybe we can…

224
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,440
Stop talking. Get out of the way.

225
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,240
Come here.

226
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,680
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

227
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,280
Where's my stuff?

228
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,400
Whoa, where's your stuff?

229
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,680
I can explain.

230
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,040
No, I can't explain.

231
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,240
Don't tell me you sold it, Thua.

232
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,160
You tricked Ms. Kam to keep her stuff
here, then you stole and sold it?

233
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,640
I didn't, Ms. Kam. Absolutely not.

234
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,400
I didn't steal it, Ms. Kam.

235
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
You're an asshole.

236
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,520
- Let's go talk to the police.
- Ms. Kam.

237
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,960
- Let's go.
- I can explain, Ms. Kam.

238
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,880
- Come here.
- Ms. Kam! I can explain!

239
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,000
- Ms. Kam!
- Wait for me!

240
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,040
What…

241
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,440
Yes. If there's progress,

242
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,760
do me a favor and call me right away.

243
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,960
Thank you very much, Officer. Thank you.

244
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,000
Or did Thua really steal it?

245
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,560
But the police said there was no evidence.

246
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,160
But if Thua didn't take it, how could
my stuff for donation go missing?

247
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,400
What stuff, Kam?

248
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,920
The stuff I bought with the money
I skimmed from you to help fire victims.

249
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,200
Hm?

250
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,400
Again?

251
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,960
Just a little, Dad.
Other people helped pay for it too.

252
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,920
You forced me
to make merit unwittingly again.

253
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,320
Gee, Dad,

254
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,440
our society is still full of inequalities.

255
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,640
There are a lot of people in need.

256
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,480
The world needs generosity, Dad.

257
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,440
Do it moderately, baby. I'm begging you.

258
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,560
One of my buses just got totaled.

259
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,840
And we still don't know
how Thua factored in the crash.

260
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,200
And now he stole from you.

261
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,160
This guy.

262
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,840
I don't think I can keep him.

263
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,840
The police said there was no evidence,
so they let me go.

264
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,800
Tell me again how her stuff went missing.

265
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,400
After I put everything in there,

266
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,360
I locked the room as usual.
When I looked again, everything was gone.

267
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,000
Was it long before you rechecked?

268
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,000
Gee, Granny, less than ten minutes.

269
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,000
- Huh?
- Right?

270
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,320
So much stuff.

271
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,640
How could it go missing
in less than ten minutes?

272
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,840
I think the robbers
must have lied in wait to steal it.

273
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,360
I'll swear at any temple.
I didn't steal it, Granny.

274
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,800
I believe you.

275
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,520
You're quite gullible.

276
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,360
Someone who's kind enough
to take an old woman to look for her kid

277
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,760
and let that woman who had nowhere to go
stay with him would never do such a thing.

278
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,040
Thank you, Granny.

279
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,320
But Ms. Kam doesn't agree with you.

280
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,280
Worried she'll hate you?

281
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,280
Crushing on her, aren't you?

282
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,960
Wait.

283
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,200
Can you read people's minds?

284
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,320
The way you looked at her was so obvious.

285
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,520
I could tell how you felt
looking from a block away.

286
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,720
Wait a minute.

287
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,880
If you know, then Ms. Kam must know too.

288
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,840
I'm so screwed.
Will she think I don't know my place?

289
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,320
I'm doomed.

290
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,080
Shit, it got worse. Wait, Granny.

291
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,600
- What?
- I forgot. I'll be right back.

292
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,960
Thua?

293
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,680
Why are the flowers wilting today, Dad?

294
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,240
It's so hot. Even people are wilting.

295
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,080
Didn't the gardener come in?

296
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,800
Since when did our garage have a gardener?

297
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,760
Oh, that's right. I forgot.

298
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,200
I'll be right back, Dad.

299
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,120
Whoa!

300
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,000
Just half a day. Gee.
This one's wilting too.

301
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,840
Don't die yet. Not yet.

302
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,440
Come back. Come on.
Be beautiful again. Don't die yet.

303
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,040
There's no gardener.
So, who has been doing it?

304
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,240
Never mind. I'll do it myself.

305
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,800
Thua!

306
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,840
Ms. Kam.

307
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,480
You're the one who's been watering them?

308
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,480
You don't have to anymore.

309
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,680
Why not?

310
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:23,200
I said not to come back here
until you found my stuff.

311
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,640
But Ms. Kam, I really didn't take it.

312
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,240
It went missing from your house.
You have to take responsibility.

313
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,040
I'll give you three days.

314
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,320
Come here, sir. Here he is.

315
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,760
Thua. The thief.

316
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,480
You dared come back here. Are you really
going to let a thief work in our garage?

317
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,760
You're fired.

318
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,680
Stop.

319
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,200
You look like you're going to faint.

320
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,800
Why can't I do it?

321
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,520
We don't even know how it happened.

322
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,840
I'm hungry! Get me food! I'm hungry!

323
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,960
Oi!

324
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,080
Shut up!

325
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,280
Here you go.

326
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,400
Don't you have real food?

327
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,880
This is all we have. You want it or not?

328
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,400
ROOM AVAILABLE, TEL: 099 2585192

329
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,920
Ah fired me.

330
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,360
And I have to return
Ms. Kam's stuff in three days.

331
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,760
Hang in there, Thua. Think carefully.

332
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,560
How about this? Why don't you
eat something first? A full stomach

333
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,520
will help your brain work.

334
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,080
Okay? I'll cook you something.

335
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,040
All right, let's see
what you have in the kitchen.

336
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,320
Oh, you have eggs.

337
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,640
That's good. I'll make Thai omelet.

338
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,960
Is Thai omelet okay, Thua?

339
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,040
Huh? Thua?

340
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,240
What's wrong? Thua?

341
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,800
Thua, son? Why are you like this?

342
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,600
What's going on? Thua?

343
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,520
Thua?

344
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,760
What the heck?

345
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,360
What is happening?

346
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,720
Why is everything frozen except me?

347
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,080
What the heck?

348
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,720
What happened just now? Think. I…

349
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,960
You have eggs.

350
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,680
That's good. I'll make Thai omelet.

351
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,000
It's okay, Granny. I'll do it.

352
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,280
And you don't have to cook anything.
I'm not hungry yet.

353
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,720
I can stop time.

354
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,960
I'm still hungry.

355
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,760
Me too.

356
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,440
These criminals are so mean.

357
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,360
They lock us up
and won't feed us properly.

358
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,960
I think we should escape.

359
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,040
- Really?
- Yes.

360
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,840
We have to take risks.

361
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,080
Or do you want to stay here?

362
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,080
No.

363
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,400
Damn you, wrought iron!

364
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,280
Whoa!

365
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,080
Your power's back.

366
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,160
Come on. Let's go.

367
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,280
Thua.

368
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,440
I have a magical power.

369
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,480
I can stop time.

370
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,880
What?

371
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,800
Really. Just now,

372
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,880
this plate was floating right here.

373
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,000
I'll show you. Watch.

374
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,600
Watch.

375
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,040
Oh.

376
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,400
Gee, Granny.

377
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,679
Why are you throwing
my plate for fun? It's broken. Look.

378
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,239
Gee.

379
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,760
I can really stop time.

380
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,320
Thua.

381
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,840
I can really stop time.

382
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,880
You can stop time,
but please stop throwing my plates.

383
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,560
I'm begging you.

384
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,960
Let's go that way.

385
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,680
Hey! How did they get out?

386
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,880
Don't you run!

387
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,080
Bring it on.

388
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,880
Well.

389
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,400
- Bye.
- Where are you going?

390
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,800
Hey, what's going on?

391
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,920
See? Just like what I told you.

392
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,240
- Get in there.
- You go.

393
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,440
Whoa!

394
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,640
Typhoon.

395
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,760
He lost his strength, boss.

396
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,960
You're okay, right?

397
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,560
Stop playing, Granny,
or I'll run out of plates.

398
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,520
I can really stop time.

399
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,960
You saw I was stressed out,
so you made a joke to cheer me up, right?

400
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,360
But your joke isn't funny.
I'm more stressed out now.

401
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,560
Thua.

402
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,920
I… Stop!

403
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,480
Oi, stop what, Granny?

404
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,280
So, I have to touch you

405
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,080
to keep you from being frozen.

406
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,120
Right. Yeah.

407
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,760
What, Granny? How many times now?
I'm tired of picking up broken plates.

408
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,320
Whoa!

409
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,520
Believe me now?

410
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,440
I do, Granny.

411
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,400
- What the heck?
- That's enough, right?

412
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,160
- How can do you that?
- No idea.

413
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,560
I just can all of a sudden.

414
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,560
Bung, my power's gone again.

415
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,160
Yeah, it's okay.

416
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,440
But your power doesn't last long.
And it's not permanent.

417
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,120
You're right. I wonder
how I regained my strength.

418
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,120
- I got it.
- Because I drank milk?

419
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,760
Keep it down or they'll hear you.

420
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,240
Yes. Remember?

421
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,160
You first got your power
because you'd just had milk.

422
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,400
That must be it.
So what if I have milk again?

423
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,120
We'll be able to escape.

424
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,560
I'm hungry!

425
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,120
I want milk! Let me have some milk!

426
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,040
- I'm hun--
- Hey!

427
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,400
What? Going to run again? I heard you two.

428
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,480
Lock the girl up in another room.

429
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,640
- Come here.
- Don't hurt Bung.

430
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,400
From now on, you do as I say,

431
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,960
or your sister dies.

432
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,840
I became a mage all of a sudden.

433
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,800
Wow, Granny.
You use such an old-fashioned word.

434
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,160
Aren't you excited, Thua?

435
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,400
I am, Granny, but I'm more worried
about the missing stuff.

436
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,560
Make way!

437
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:16,240
Hey! Did you hear Chong's house
was robbed last night?

438
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,440
Robbers, Granny. Maybe

439
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,520
they were the ones who robbed my house.

440
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,680
What do we do?

441
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,280
Stop time, Granny.
Then we'll check out that house.

442
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,920
There may be leads.

443
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,480
You got it.

444
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,840
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

445
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,280
- Now what? Split up and look.
- Let's split up and look.

446
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,480
- Did you find anything?
- No.

447
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,920
Hey!

448
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,640
- I got it!
- Why would you snap your fingers?

449
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,880
I forgot. I was getting an idea.

450
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,400
What's that?

451
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,760
The shock made me forget.

452
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,960
Granny. What the heck?

453
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,720
Who's talking in there? Let's check.

454
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,160
- Let's check.
- Granny, stop time.

455
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,840
Do it. Snap your fingers, Granny.

456
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,080
<i>Even though we haven't located</i>
<i>the robbers, we can look for that kid.</i>

457
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,680
- What kid?
- The kid who has a power like you do.

‪NEXT EPISODE

459
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,720
<i>When I locate the kid,</i>
<i>we'll locate the robbers.</i>

460
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,840
The robbers locked up those two kids here.

461
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,680
I can calculate
auspicious time for travel.

462
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,960
<i>Then, calculate if today's right</i>
<i>for robbing Ah's house.</i>

463
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,520
- <i>Ah's house? That's Ms. Kam's house!</i>
- <i>That's right.</i>
