1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,920
Someone from our page messaged

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,600
about finding an escaped illegal worker
from human traffickers.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,840
They even sent a picture.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,280
Arm.

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,200
Is it really him?

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,840
Without powers,
we can’t help Arm on our own.

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,720
Then we’ll have to fight

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,200
without any powers.

9
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,640
‪PREVIOUSLY

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,720
Granny! Hey!

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,320
Someone messaged the page,

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,240
saying they found a worker
who escaped from human traffickers.

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,840
He's Granny Cheuy's child.

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,119
I want you to help me find him.

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,400
Hello, Dad?

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,520
Where are you, Kam?

17
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,440
I’m at the hospital, Dad.

18
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,080
Okay, bye, Dad.
I have to go pick up the medicine.

19
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,760
I never taught my child to lie.

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,880
Trust me. I have a plan to help her.

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,720
I've already asked Peem
to help with Granny's son.

22
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,560
He’s the one who brought Bung's parents
to arrest Thua.

23
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,680
Sorry, I didn’t think about that.

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,680
I’ll go with you then.

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,000
I had the "Please be generous" page hacked
to lure the scammers.

26
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,920
The good citizen informed us that Arm is
hiding behind there. Let's check it out.

27
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,200
Please help my mom and Granny.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,200
- Is it the boss's order?
- Yeah.

29
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,880
Keep it down, will you? If they all die,
no one's gonna work for you.

30
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,920
I'll just find more.
There are a lot of fools out there.

31
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,520
Take care of this.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,160
Okay.

33
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,600
Are you leaving straight away?

34
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,600
We have a lot of new girls today.

35
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,360
- Come enjoy.
- Alright.

36
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,800
This way.

37
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,680
Come on.

38
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,880
Hey, Arm is gone. Has anyone seen him?

39
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,120
No, I haven't.

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,520
- Arm is gone?
- Yeah.

41
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,560
So, the crucial info is gone too.

42
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,640
Dammit!

43
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,000
Hey!

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,560
- Ah!
- Ow!

45
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,520
Arm.

46
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,240
Arm.

47
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,160
Oh, Granny, you're awake?

48
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,640
Phoon, I know where Arm is now.

49
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,840
He is at a temple.

50
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,760
Huh? But a good citizen

51
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,360
sent us a message, saying
that Arm is at the old warehouse.

52
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,880
Right now, Thua and Kam
are looking for him.

53
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,840
Phoon, call Thua for me quickly.

54
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,520
Hello? It's me. We just got here,
at the warehouse.

55
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,560
Thua, come back now.

56
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,800
I know now that Arm
is at a temple somewhere.

57
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,920
But it's not that warehouse.

58
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,960
Wait a sec. You're awake, Granny?

59
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,800
What's going on now? Arm is at a temple?

60
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,040
Why did the good citizen say
Arm is at the warehouse?

61
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,040
Run, Thua. We were double-crossed.
Hurry up.

62
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,720
Granny, don't be like that again.
I was so scared.

63
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,120
I'm fine now.

64
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,520
If it wasn't for your vision,

65
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,400
Ms. Kam and I would be done for.

66
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,600
About Peem, I get it.

67
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,000
But what does your dad
have to do with it, Kam?

68
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,520
I've thought about it.

69
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,600
My dad couldn't have caught us.

70
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,640
The only person who could
have done it was Peem.

71
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,040
He saw Arm in the photo I showed him.

72
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,200
And I guess he hacked our Facebook page.

73
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,680
I'm really sorry, guys,

74
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,320
for causing all this trouble.

75
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,680
Hey, Ms. Kam. No one is mad at you.

76
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,600
If you all got exposed because of me,

77
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,280
I would…

78
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,000
Come on, Kam.

79
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,200
You heard it. No one is mad at you.

80
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,760
By the way, how did I get the vision?

81
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,200
I think it's because of me.

82
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,680
Huh? Phakbung.

83
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,560
Where's Dr. Korn?

84
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,760
I asked him to leave.

85
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,400
And I went to pray to the gods
at the shrine to ask for their help.

86
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,680
What? You went there alone?

87
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,400
Something could have happened to you.

88
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,360
Come on, Thua. Bung

89
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,920
was worried about us,
just like we're worried about her.

90
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,560
You're a lot more mature than your age.

91
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,640
I got that from TV.

92
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,000
Granny, did something happen to you again?

93
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,040
Even though we didn't get our powers back,

94
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,400
at least,

95
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,800
the gods are helping us.

96
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,440
Right. We should have faith
in doing good deeds.

97
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,240
And helping others.

98
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,320
I know now that
the power of ordinary people

99
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,440
is the greatest. This time,
let me fight alongside you.

100
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,039
As for us,

101
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,960
"Please be generous" heroes,

102
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,679
even though we don't have powers,
we will fight, right?

103
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,799
- Right?
- Right!

104
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,480
And this time too, we'll help Arm
because we're…

105
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,560
- "Please be generous" gang!
- "Please be generous" gang!

106
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,720
- Go!
- Go!

107
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,880
Someone spotted Arm, the one who stole
our info, in the community, sir.

108
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,360
Deal with him as soon as possible.

109
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,520
Yes, sir.

110
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,320
The temple Arm is at looks like this.

111
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
All temples look the same, Granny.

112
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,200
Do you remember the temple's name?

113
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,600
Now, this is a big problem.

114
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,120
There are tens of thousands
of temples in Thailand. How do we find it?

115
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,000
Uh…

116
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,800
Granny, can you think of anything else

117
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,200
that makes this temple stand out?

118
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,880
- I got it. A flag!
- Huh?

119
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,720
One side of the flag is gray,

120
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,320
and the other side is orange.

121
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,720
And there's a circle in the middle.

122
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,800
The Buddha image
is in the middle, like this.

123
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:13,320
Beside the Buddha image,
there are two trees.

124
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,320
I think they are palmyra palms.

125
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,880
I'll help look it up. Alright, temple…

126
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,240
I'll help Thua look it up too.
It might be faster.

127
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,160
No.

128
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,720
You go and do what you need to do.

129
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,080
Huh?

130
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,840
I don't want you to help me when
you're still worried about your parents.

131
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,160
Do me a favor.

132
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,240
As a mother whose son is missing,

133
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,400
I hope you'll open your heart

134
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,320
and go back to your parents.

135
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,000
Someone said they'd seen Arm
around this temple.

136
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,840
Hey! That's Arm!

137
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,880
You go that way! Go!

138
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,640
- Hey!
- Hmm?

139
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,760
- Here, I found it!
- Let me see.

140
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,560
Orange and gray flag.

141
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,840
- That's it.
- Then your son must be at this temple.

142
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,520
Thua.

143
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,880
Shall we go find him, Granny?

144
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,840
Oh…

145
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,360
Arm.

146
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,640
Is it really you, Arm?

147
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,840
Mom.

148
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,920
It's me, Arm.

149
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,880
- It's your mom.
- Mom!

150
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,320
Mom.

151
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,840
Arm.

152
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,680
‪Mom.

153
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,520
Mom, how did you find me?

154
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,240
Why are you dressed like this?

155
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,960
And who are those two?

156
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,120
Arm, you were tricked
by a human trafficking gang, right?

157
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,360
- Yeah.
- You're okay now, Arm!

158
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,160
My baby.

159
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,600
Thua. Finally, Granny's found her son.

160
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
I'm happy for her.

161
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,080
What are you looking at?

162
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,240
Someone sent us a video on the page.
Let me see.

163
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,160
My baby.

164
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,840
Granny.

165
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,240
- Granny.
- Huh?

166
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,840
Someone sent us a video.

167
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,720
What video?

168
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,240
It's a video of Arm.

169
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,280
Actually, Arm isn't the victim,

170
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,000
he's one of them.

171
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,720
What does this mean?

172
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,960
Mom, hear me out.

173
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,920
Are you gonna tell me this isn't you?

174
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,240
Well,

175
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,760
it's me, Mom. But hear me out.

176
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,000
I have my reasons.

177
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,440
Guys, let's go.

178
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,160
We don't need to help bad people.

179
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,760
Mom.

180
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,840
Mom, hear me out!

181
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,000
Arm.

182
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,920
Arm!

183
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,840
Why are those freaks here?

184
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,600
Go. Quickly.

185
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
Follow them.

186
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,920
- There's a car.
- A car!

187
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,600
Taxi!

188
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,400
Get in. Get in now.

189
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,360
He got shot. Take us to the hospital.

190
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,160
Dammit!

191
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,080
Mom.

192
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,280
Your mom has left.

193
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,080
I can see that.

194
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,400
My mom left the hospital,

195
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,160
but she didn't even think of telling me.

196
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,080
I guess she really can't accept it.

197
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,280
You're pregnant.

198
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,160
Don't be stressed. Don't overthink things.

199
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,600
Your mom left a letter for you.

200
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,200
Is it good or bad?

201
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,280
Read it yourself.

202
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,160
Is it bad?

203
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,280
Why did she write this?

204
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,760
Bung's parents, can we talk?

205
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,240
It's not convenient for me.

206
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,880
Sorry, please excuse us.

207
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,880
Uh, please wait.
Please let me ask just one question.

208
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,280
How old were you two…

209
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,280
when Phakbung was born?

210
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,800
If I had to guess from you age,

211
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,200
I'd say you had Phakbung
when you're still young.

212
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,560
So what? That's not a reason
why I should let Bung have a baby now.

213
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,120
Having a baby when you're not ready,
unemployed, and with no money.

214
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,480
You've never been through it.
You have no idea how hard it is.

215
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,600
But we've managed to pull through.

216
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,800
My dad?

217
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,160
That's right.

218
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,320
Your dad believes in you.

219
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,040
With the two of them helping you,

220
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,120
I'm sure everything will be okay for you.

221
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,440
And my mom,

222
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,000
what did she say?

223
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,680
No, I'm not okay with it.

224
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,960
I want her to have a good education,

225
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,400
a good job,

226
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,000
and a high salary,
so she can have a good life.

227
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,080
What's the purpose of having
all those things? So she can be happy?

228
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,920
Of course!

229
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,200
A good job with a high salary
that you mentioned.

230
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,400
Are you sure it'll make Bung happy?

231
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,480
But isn't it better?

232
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,960
What if Bung's happiness is her baby?

233
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,160
Just like how she's our happiness.

234
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,080
After that, your mom asked me
to give you the letter.

235
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,040
COME BACK TO OUR HOME, BUNG - MOM

236
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,080
Working with those bad guys,

237
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,360
you must have your reasons, right?

238
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,200
Wake up and tell me, okay?

239
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,280
Tell me why you did it.

240
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,240
How is Arm doing?

241
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,320
He hasn't woken up yet.

242
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,320
Granny,

243
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,440
about Arm,

244
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
there could be something more
than what's in the video.

245
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,200
Don't overthink it.

246
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,520
Maybe he didn't mean to do it.

247
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,600
What if he did?

248
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,520
- Why haven't you got the flash drive yet?
- Sorry, sir.

249
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,720
There are always people guarding it.
We can't get in.

250
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,080
I don't care.

251
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,600
Do what you have to
and return it to me, understood?

252
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,320
Yes, sir.

253
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,200
Granny, I bought
deep fried bananas for you.

254
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,320
Good. I'm hungry. Give it to me.

255
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,840
Thank you.

256
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,280
Yeah.

257
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,120
Granny, have some.

258
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,920
Arm is waking up.

259
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,520
Huh? Arm's awake?

260
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,400
How are you feeling?

261
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,960
Mom.

262
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,920
Phoon, go get him some water.

263
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,120
Arm.

264
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,120
Arm, tell me.

265
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,280
Why were you with those scumbags?

266
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,120
Uh, Granny.

267
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,280
Easy there. He just woke up.
Let me handle this, okay?

268
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Arm.

269
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,040
They're trying to kill you.

270
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,160
Is it because you know their secret?

271
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,160
I…

272
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,640
What do you have to say, Arm?

273
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,640
I can't remember.

274
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,840
What?

275
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,240
I can't remember anything.

276
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,880
Arm. What's wrong?

277
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,400
Arm.

278
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,480
Are you sure?

279
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,920
Okay.

280
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,560
Mom.

281
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,920
How's it going?

282
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,760
If you're talking about the one
who stole the info, don't worry.

283
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,480
He has amnesia now.

284
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,080
And you're happy with just that?

285
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,960
What if his memories come back?
What will you do?

286
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,640
Then, I'll find where he hid it.

287
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,480
I guess I expect too much from you,
hoping you can replace me.

288
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,160
You probably want me
to live my life for you.

289
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,280
What will you get from complaining?

290
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,200
You promised me you'd do it for me.

291
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,960
NO FUTURE
MP PETHAI GIVEN LIFETIME POLITICAL BAN

292
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,960
What was that? What did you say, Peem?

293
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,000
Mom.

294
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,600
I know what I want to do
in the future now.

295
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,400
I want to be an animator.
I want to create animations, Mom.

296
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,800
That's absurd, honey.

297
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,080
What you should create is something
that will improve this country.

298
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,400
You should study law or political science

299
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,840
and carry on my political legacy.

300
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,520
Can you do that?
Can you do that much for me, Peem?

301
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,560
Yes, I will do it for you, Mom.

302
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,080
Don't worry, Mom.

303
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,320
I will do it for you.
I'll be the person you want me to be.

304
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,680
So, deal with that guy once and for all.
Don't let him come back to hurt you.

305
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,360
Yes, Mom.

306
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,440
Next week, you'll
have to start campaigning.

307
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,000
What you need to do quickly
is to build your popularity.

308
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,200
Mom, I've been doing just that.

309
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,600
You did it poorly. That's why
I'm standing here talking to you.

310
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,280
People here

311
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,080
love those freaks more than they love you.
Do you see how pathetic it is?

312
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,680
I'm sorry, Mom.

313
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,600
Do not disappoint me, Peem.

314
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,760
Okay.

315
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,560
I have a job for you.

316
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,840
- Are you gonna pay or not?
- Bro.

317
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,040
Are you gonna pay or not?
Are you gonna pay?

318
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,160
- Are you gonna pay or not?
- Hey, stop it.

319
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,680
You are the "Please be generous" heroes!
Why are you doing this to him?

320
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,560
It's none of your business.

321
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,760
This kid doesn't pay his debt.
He deserves it.

322
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,520
What debt? I told you.

323
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,080
I didn't borrow money from anyone.

324
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,520
How shameless!

325
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,400
- Take this!
- Ow!

326
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,240
Gosh, what kind of gang is this?
Can't you guys just talk it out?

327
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,800
You meddling idiots,
you’ll get what's coming to you too.

328
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,880
I know you worked with Peem to try
to catch the "Please be generous" heroes.

329
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,200
How did you know?

330
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,000
It doesn't matter how I knew. What matters

331
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,200
is the fact that you're on the wrong side.
"Please be generous" heroes are good guys.

332
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,320
Kam.

333
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,600
Stop being a fool!

334
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,840
The "Please be generous" gang
is a group of scammers.

335
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,000
I told you they are not.

336
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,360
But they changed you.
They made you lie to me.

337
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,000
I know

338
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,440
you didn't go to the hospital
with Bung the other day.

339
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,000
You went to Thua's place.

340
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,280
They're leading you to the wrong path.

341
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,080
What are you trying to say?

342
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,240
Don't act dumb.

343
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,720
I know everything. I know Thua

344
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,520
is part of the "Please be generous" gang.

345
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,960
Peem even found his red bandana.

346
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,200
Huh? Peem was the one
who found the bandana?

347
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,560
Yes.

348
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,800
Ow!

349
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,040
Sir, it hurts.

350
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,040
Seng, what's wrong with you?

351
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,080
It's the "Please be generous" gang.

352
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,400
"Please be generous" gang?
That's impossible.

353
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,840
How is it impossible?

354
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,480
Lately, the "Please be generous" gang

355
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,720
has been beating up people around here.

356
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:23,200
DEBTOR WILL GET BEATEN UP
BY "PLEASE BE GENEROUS" HEROES

357
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,800
What is this?

358
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,280
Seng said they've been beating
people in the neighborhood,

359
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,200
saying they're
the "Please be generous" gang.

360
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,240
From the looks of it, I think
they're trying to make people hate us.

361
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,200
You're right. People are starting to hate
the "Please be generous" heroes now.

362
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,160
I think it's Peem's doing.

363
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,760
Why do you think that?

364
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,960
Dad said they found the red bandana
of "Please be generous" at your place.

365
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,120
And now, my dad fully believes that

366
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,800
the "Please be generous" gang
is a group of scammers.

367
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,600
Speak of the devil.

368
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,720
DAD

369
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,080
Why didn't you pick up?

370
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,680
I don't want to lie.

371
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,160
And if I tell my dad I'm with you,
his blood pressure is gonna skyrocket.

372
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,920
I'm sorry, Ms. Kam.

373
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
It's

374
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,720
my fault for being incompetent.

375
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,400
I've caused you trouble.

376
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,240
But don't worry.

377
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,880
I'll try to make things better.

378
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,160
Jeez, my dad just won't stop.

379
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,960
Oh, it's not mine.

380
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,680
I guess it's mine.

381
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,720
Ah is calling me.

382
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,960
Don't pick up.

383
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,040
Hello, Ah.

384
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,440
Thua, stay away from my daughter!

385
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,040
I can't.

386
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,160
I'll prove to you that I'm not a scammer.

387
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,440
And…

388
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,240
I'll be good enough for Ms. Kam.

389
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,480
Also,

390
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,600
I'll prove myself trustworthy to you.

391
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,400
I didn't ask you to do that! What I want

392
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,920
is for you to stay away from my daughter.
And let my daughter

393
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,800
come to me. Thua, you--

394
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,760
I believe the two of us
can get through this.

395
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,800
One day, my dad and everyone
will understand you.

396
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,720
And understand the real
"Please be generous" heroes.

397
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,920
Huh? Fake "Please be generous" heroes?

398
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,560
- That's right.
- Whoa.

399
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,240
We got a lot of messages telling us off.

400
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,200
What should we do next, Thua?

401
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,800
I wonder that too.

402
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,320
Just don't tell Granny for now.

403
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,680
She's worried about Arm.

404
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,920
Arm.

405
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,480
Eat some fruit.

406
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,560
Mom.

407
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,320
Are you mad at me…

408
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,800
for not remembering anything?

409
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,280
I'm not mad at you.

410
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,560
I'm just worried.

411
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,320
No mother

412
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,840
wants to see her child
becoming a bad person.

413
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,800
If I really had done something bad,

414
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,360
would you hate me?

415
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,880
The bond between mother and child
is lifelong.

416
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,560
It can't be severed.

417
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,960
If you really feel sorry for what you did,

418
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,680
don't be afraid that I'll be mad.

419
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,200
I will forgive you.

420
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,640
Thank you, Mom.

421
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,800
Eat some fruit.

422
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,920
Oh dear!

423
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,960
We don't have enough wardens.
What are you going to do?

424
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,560
Boss, you don't have enough men?

425
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,800
Let me help you.

426
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,520
I can supervise them as they work for you.

427
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,760
You're planning to run?

428
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,240
Lock him up and starve him.

429
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,280
If he's gonna die, let him die.

430
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,280
Yes, boss.

431
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,200
Now, go. Go!

432
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,400
‪Go!

433
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,720
Arm. Arm, honey.

434
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,600
What's wrong?

435
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,080
Arm!

436
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,440
Mom.

437
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,960
I remember now.

438
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,760
I was really one of them.

439
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,000
I helped them hurt people, Mom.

440
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,120
Arm.

441
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,480
But I had a reason.

442
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,920
Please don't hurt me.

443
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,160
Please don't hurt me. I'm scared.

444
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,240
Here. Eat this.
And don't tell anyone I gave it to you.

445
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,440
I want to run away too.

446
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,600
But I'm trying to find a way
for all of us to escape.

447
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,520
Eat it. Come on.

448
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,440
I was trying to find a way,

449
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,280
then I realized there's info about
illegal labor practices on a flash drive,

450
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,880
so I stole it.

451
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,960
- Is it Boss's order?
- Yeah.

452
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,960
Keep it down, will you? If they all die,

453
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,159
no one's gonna work for you.

454
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,280
I'll just find more.
There are a lot of fools out there.

455
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,239
They're not just for us to use.
We need some to sell too.

456
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,960
- Here's the newbies. Take care of them.
- Yes, sir.

457
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,320
And then I ran.

458
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,880
Their boss…

459
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,640
is probably a politician…

460
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,320
named…

461
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,840
I've sent the work to you, Mr. Peem.
Everything is perfect.

462
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,640
There's nothing for you to worry about.

463
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,800
We surely have enough money
for your election campaign.

464
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,480
…Peem.

465
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,160
Peem?

466
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,240
Yes.

467
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,760
I heard it myself.

468
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,520
I want to catch that man Peem.

469
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,240
Even if I get arrested for siding
with them, I'll still do it.

470
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,080
I just need the flash drive back.

471
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,360
I'm sure we'll have enough evidence
to get Peem arrested.

472
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,280
Arm.

473
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,800
Mom.

474
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,920
I'm so happy…

475
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,520
you didn't do anything wrong.

476
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,240
You did it because
you wanted to help others.

477
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,720
I'm so happy. I'm so, so happy!

478
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,680
Hey.

479
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,280
Don't worry.

480
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,440
I'll help you catch Peem.

481
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,880
Okay, Mom.

482
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,040
It's time to pay back
the money you borrowed.

483
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,640
I didn't borrow money from anyone.

484
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,680
Since you're shameless,

485
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,640
take this "Please be generous" fist.

486
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,680
Whoa.

487
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,080
- Hey, look at him!
- Hey! Hey, stop it!

488
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,280
You used to help people.

489
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,680
Why are you doing horrible things now?

490
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,200
Should I do horrible things
to you too, huh?

491
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,880
Stop it!

492
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,760
If you don't stop,

493
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,240
every one of you will end up in jail.
The police are coming.

494
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,440
"Please be generous" gang, let's go.

495
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,280
Peem is so cool, isn't he?

496
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,240
He chased
the "Please be generous" gang away.

497
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,320
They're getting worse every day.

498
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,440
The other day, they asked for donations.

499
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,360
They said they'd help those
whose homes were burned down.

500
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,880
But no one ever got the money.

501
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,080
You're the only one

502
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,720
who asked for donations
and really used it to help the poor.

503
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,080
Thank you very much. Right, everyone?

504
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,800
It's alright. I'm glad you all are safe.

505
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,080
I'll take care of everything else.

506
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,800
Please stay with us for a long time
and keep helping us.

507
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,800
Alright, guys, put it up.

508
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,840
Put it up everywhere. Make people see.

509
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,480
They're scumbags.

510
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,080
Let people know how horrible
the "Please be generous" gang is

511
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,040
- Put it up.
- Scumbags.

512
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,400
- Put it up.
- Get out!

513
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,480
Up there too.

514
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,840
I can't put it up high.

515
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,640
- These horrible scumbags.
- They're the worst.

516
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,240
- Well done. There too.
- Here too.

517
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,160
Good. Good job.

518
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,320
Oh, hey. Put this up
in front of your house.

519
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,360
Let's chase the "Please be generous" gang
out of our community.

520
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,200
- Take it.
- I don't believe that they're bad.

521
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,320
So, no, thanks.

522
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,640
You're siding with that horrible group?

523
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,920
Uncle, we're not siding with them.
I'll put all of these up

524
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,560
on the wall, in front of my house.

525
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,920
- Good.
- They're bad people.

526
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Bro,

527
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,320
keep this. If you run into them,
you can use it to protect yourself.

528
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,080
Good. I'll give it
to my family members too.

529
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,520
The only way to deal with these people
is to kill them.

530
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,080
Let's go.

531
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,040
Many victims gathered and claimed

532
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,360
that they were harmed
by the "Please be generous" heroes.

533
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,480
They reported to the police
and would like to press charges.

534
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,040
And demanded that the police
expose the identities

535
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,960
of the fake heroes
and bring them to justice.

536
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,600
Now, the police have accepted the case.

537
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,480
They're in the process of investigation

538
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,440
in order to hunt down
the "Please be generous" heroes

539
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,680
and prosecute them.

540
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,640
What do we do?

541
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,160
If we don't turn ourselves in,
the police will come get us.

542
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,280
But we didn't do it.
If the police follow their leads,

543
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,240
they might get our copycats instead.

544
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,240
I'll help the police hunt down
the "Please be generous" gang.

545
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,280
Those bad guys behind masks…

546
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,440
- It's clear now.
- acting like heroes,

547
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,000
- Just like Kam said. Peem is behind this.
- harming our people, must be eliminated.

548
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,920
And I've given the culprits' address
to the police.

549
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,320
Are the police coming for us?

550
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,520
We need to pack our stuff and run
as soon as possible.

551
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,360
Take the costumes too. Don't forget.

552
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,560
Don't leave any evidence.

553
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,440
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

554
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,320
They're faster than I thought.

555
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,320
From what you said, we need to get
the flash drive first. Where is it?

556
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,240
I was afraid they'd catch me,
so I hid it before I left.

557
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,880
Jeez. How can we find it?

558
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,560
‪Go!

559
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,480
There's a bomb hidden in here.

560
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,840
And it will explode in 30 minutes.

561
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,240
‪NEXT EPISODE

562
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,760
- Ms. Kam, why didn't you get off?
- I'll stay with you.

563
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,320
- Kam!
- Ms. Kam!
