00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,120
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,160
Hey!

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,360
Today, you’re not running off anywhere.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,800
This cloth is the same as what
the "Please be generous" gang uses.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,760
There is a kid, a pregnant woman,
and an elderly person.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,320
Why didn’t I notice?

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,720
Keep an eye on them for now.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,840
We’re looking for this girl.

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,040
Please open the door.

10
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,400
These are Phakbung’s clothes!

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,440
Take him away.

12
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,960
Where did you hide my daughter?

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,880
Tell me now!

14
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,680
She's pregnant.
The baby doesn't have a father,

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,120
so she ran away from home.
Then she had an accident.

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,800
- Hey, dear!
- Oh my goodness!

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,840
Mom!

18
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,800
Bung, you should go out for now.

19
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,120
Our page is getting flooded with insults.

20
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,680
They say we didn’t really
want to help people.

21
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,400
Well, our powers aren’t working right now.

22
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,040
They’re upset

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,640
because someone else
is handling things for us.

24
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,360
Who did it for us?

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,920
Peem.

26
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,680
Here, this case, this case,
and this one too,

27
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,080
all of which sent us messages.

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,080
They're all the same cases.

29
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,400
And look at the post.

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,640
"I never ignore others' troubles."

31
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,280
This one feels like he's criticizing us.

32
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,920
It’s good that Peem helps people,

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,920
but it’s strange
that all the cases are the same.

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,360
I think it’s intentional.

35
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,640
It can’t be a coincidence. For sure.

36
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,560
For what?

37
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
Well…

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,080
For what?

39
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,920
- How would I know? I’m not him.
- Jeez.

40
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,360
But now, there has been
a lot of strange things lately.

41
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,360
Like how someone’s been following us

42
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,040
and how Thua's mask disappeared.

43
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,960
When did his mask disappear?

44
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,680
The day Thua was arrested.

45
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,960
That morning, we were all busy.

46
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,280
We washed the hero suits
and hung them out to dry,

47
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,600
and suddenly,
Peem brought the police to our house.

48
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,920
Don’t tell me.

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,240
Did he take it?

50
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,360
And the one who’s been following us
is his person too?

51
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,720
Does Peem know our secret now?

52
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,640
VISION OF THE HOSPITAL

53
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,800
I’m sorry.

54
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,840
I didn’t think
it would turn out like this.

55
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,720
It’s okay.

56
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,720
It’s not your fault.

57
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
Should I…

58
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,079
find a chance to talk to them about it?

59
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,720
No need.

60
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,040
I’ve already seen
that my mom can’t accept me.

61
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,360
I just want to do
what I originally planned,

62
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,680
which is to raise this child
as best as I can,

63
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,720
on my own.

64
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,520
But…

65
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,080
if there’s anything I can help with,

66
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,280
just let me know.

67
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,200
I really care about you.

68
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,680
Think of me as a friend.

69
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,960
Thank you.

70
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,080
But I think I should go back now.

71
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,880
Uh…

72
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,280
Should I give you a ride?

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,840
Go ahead.

74
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,680
"Due to the 'Please be generous' heroes'
involvement in important tasks,

75
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,800
including a major confidential case,

76
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,840
we're unable to assist everyone

77
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,320
who has messaged us.

78
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,320
The 'Please be generous' heroes
deeply regret this.

79
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,920
We are working hard

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,680
to resolve all issues
as quickly as possible

81
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,320
and will return to help everyone soon."

82
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,640
It sounds like an excuse,
but it’s probably the best we can do.

83
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,040
How about adding one more thing?

84
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,960
Say, "We hope everyone

85
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,560
continues to trust us."

86
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,680
- Is that okay?
- Sure.

87
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,440
Can we really do this?

88
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,080
We need to find a way
to get our powers back to normal.

89
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,120
But if Peem's man continue to follow us,

90
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,080
how can we pray to the sacred things?

91
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,280
Hey, Bung's here!

92
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,480
Huh? Why's the doctor here?

93
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,280
Bung, how are you?

94
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,520
I met my mom.

95
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,400
But everything’s over now.

96
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,080
I’m going to rest now. I’m really tired.

97
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,560
Her dad kicked her out of the room.

98
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,560
Oh dear, that's so sad.

99
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,920
She likely hasn't accepted it yet.

100
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,400
Mom!

101
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,120
Bung, you should go out for now.

102
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,080
Why are you all here? I want to sleep.

103
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,480
I don't believe you. Looking like this,

104
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,960
you can’t sleep even for money.

105
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,440
It's okay, Bung.

106
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,360
I’ve told you before,

107
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,840
no matter what happens,

108
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,360
you’re never alone.

109
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,680
That’s right. You have us.

110
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,240
Though we haven’t known each other long,

111
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,760
I see you as my real younger sister.

112
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,040
How about this? From now on,

113
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,640
you can stay with me and my mom. Okay?

114
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,679
- Is that okay?
- Sure.

115
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
How about staying with me instead?

116
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,960
Okay? I’ll talk to my dad for you.

117
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,400
Wait, why move out?
You’ve been here so long,

118
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,520
why not stay here?

119
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,680
Well, when she gives birth,
can you help take care of her?

120
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,400
Hey, I’m here too.
What’s there to worry about?

121
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,120
Bung, do you trust me?

122
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,280
I trust you, Granny.

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,200
Alright, come on.

124
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,760
We’re all one family here.

125
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,400
Remember that. No matter what happens,

126
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,480
we’ll never abandon each other.

127
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,080
Don’t be sad anymore,
soon-to-be great mom!

128
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,360
Granny, Bung, Phoon, are you asleep?

129
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,480
- Not yet.
- Not yet.

130
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,760
- What is it, Thua?
- Guess what? We got some info!

131
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,360
Someone from our page messaged

132
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,080
about finding an escaped illegal worker
from human traffickers.

133
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,280
They even sent a picture.

134
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,960
- Really?
- Here! Look!

135
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,280
Arm!

136
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,440
- Is that Arm?
- Wait, is it really him?

137
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,360
Arm.

138
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,400
- Granny!
- Hey!

139
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,960
Where are you going?

140
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,040
I’m going to save him.
I have to help my son!

141
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,400
Granny.

142
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,440
But none of us
can use our powers right now!

143
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,520
So what?
Are we just going to leave him like this?

144
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,920
This is Arm, Granny's son
we've been searching for!

145
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,600
Should we report it to the police?

146
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,880
If it were that easy,

147
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,160
Arm would’ve gone to the police
himself by now.

148
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,320
True, good point.

149
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,320
That means he’s probably hiding
from someone who’s after him.

150
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,680
Hey!

151
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,440
- Then I definitely need to go help my son!
- Granny!

152
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,000
Calm down!

153
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,520
We’re going to help him,

154
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,840
but we need to get our powers back first.

155
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,040
Here’s the plan.
Tomorrow morning, we’ll go find him.

156
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,280
Granny, we promise

157
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,720
we’ll all work together to find him.

158
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,760
Please stay calm for now.

159
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,880
ROOM AVAILABLE, TEL: 099 2585192

160
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,640
8 KH 6592 BANGKOK

161
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,400
Sir, they’ve gone out.

162
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,520
Got it I’ll make sure
not to lose sight of them.

163
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,280
Hey, man.
That car following us back there,

164
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,640
are they your friends?

165
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,000
They’ve been tailing us for a while.

166
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,880
Whoa, someone really is following us!

167
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,000
Don’t tell me it’s some creep
or scammer trailing you.

168
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,040
You can help us, right?

169
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,280
My stomach hurts!

170
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,640
My baby, you’ll be okay, sweetheart.

171
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,720
Uncle Taxi will surely help us!

172
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,680
Ouch.

173
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,760
Sure!

174
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,280
I used to be scared of this,

175
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,800
but following
the "Please be generous" page

176
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,840
taught me society needs heroes.

177
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,400
The "Please be generous" page?

178
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,640
That’s right. Hold on tight, guys.

179
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,200
I’m about to show off some skills!

180
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,720
8 KH 6592 BANGKOK

181
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,120
Sorry, sir.

182
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,600
They caught on to us and got away.

183
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,640
Okay. Hey, stop here!

184
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,240
Hey.

185
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,520
Thank you.

186
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,040
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

187
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,520
- Thank you.
- Yes.

188
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,720
This feeling of pride

189
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,280
from being someone’s idol…

190
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,960
So, this is what it feels like.

191
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
Come on.
If you want to stay proud, hurry up!

192
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,000
- Let’s go!
- Let’s go!

193
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,720
Hurrying to make our wishes,

194
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,920
so the heroes can be back in action.

195
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,400
Arm, wait for me, my child.

196
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,440
Oh sacred being,
please restore powers to Phakbung,

197
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,040
Typhoon, and Granny Cheuy.

198
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,560
I’d like to ask for power
to help Granny find her child.

199
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,640
The powers you grant

200
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,840
are so important to us,
especially to Granny Cheuy.

201
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,640
I’d like to ask for power

202
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,600
to use for myself, just this once.

203
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,120
- Sadhu.
- Sadhu.

204
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,800
So, how’s everyone feeling?
Can you sense it?

205
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,280
I feel it.

206
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,440
Huh?

207
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,760
You feel like your power is back?

208
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,440
I feel hungry.

209
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,800
Oh, come on, Typhoon!
Is this really the time?

210
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,280
How about we try using our powers

211
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,600
to see if they're back?

212
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,360
But last time I used my power,
it gave me the creeps.

213
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,680
Alright, let’s start with me.

214
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,520
Earlier, when we were rushing here,

215
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,280
I tripped over a tree stump

216
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,040
and got a little cut.

217
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,720
THE SHRINE OF TIGER GOD

218
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,280
Whoa!

219
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,360
Alright, here goes…

220
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
Try it.

221
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,960
Oh dear, the wound hasn’t healed.
It looks worse now!

222
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,680
Typhoon, you try!

223
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,760
Lift Thua and see if it works.

224
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,320
Oh no, I can’t move my body anymore.

225
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,800
What should we do now?

226
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,720
Well, that just leaves you, Granny.

227
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,160
Alright, I’ll try.

228
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,200
Hold me.

229
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,480
Um…

230
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,360
Hey!

231
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,560
I can't. If my power is unstable

232
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,280
and stops time, what if it doesn’t resume?

233
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,240
What will happen to everyone?

234
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,760
No!

235
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,560
Hey. I think

236
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
we should go ask Peem for help.

237
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,079
No way, Granny.

238
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,040
Even if it’s tough, Granny,

239
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,839
I won't ask someone like him for help.

240
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,920
Uh…

241
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,839
- Bung.
- Ugh.

242
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,680
Then we’ll have to fight

243
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,040
without any powers.

244
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,119
- Ouch.
- Oh.

245
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,040
What do you think, Typhoon?

246
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,200
- Ow.
- Be careful.

247
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,760
Ouch.

248
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,120
- Let’s go.
- Let's go.

249
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,080
Alright then.

250
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,440
- Fight!
- Fight!

251
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,040
Thua.

252
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,640
Ms. Kam.

253
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,520
We're about to go help Arm.

254
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,560
We know where he is now.

255
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,200
But could you stay here with Phakbung?

256
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,760
Her belly is really big right now,
and I don’t want her to be at risk.

257
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,000
I told you I can go!
Why don’t you believe me?

258
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,440
Can’t you send someone else instead?

259
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,640
Bung told me that no one can use
their powers right now.

260
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,680
I don’t want anyone to be at risk.

261
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,240
This is something important we need to do.

262
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,360
Then, can you wait at home for a bit?
I’ll hurry and meet you there.

263
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,640
Ms. Kam said we should wait here.

264
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,040
She will probably stop us from going.

265
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,920
Let’s go quickly, before she shows up.

266
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,880
- Put your clothes on the right way!
- Hurry up and get dressed.

267
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,520
My eyes hurt watching you.

268
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,360
Go for it!

269
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,800
Let me check.

270
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,320
Thank you, like a cartoon,
for sending the news.

271
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,520
Please don't inform anyone yet
that we've found the illegal worker.

272
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,040
We're rushing to the warehouse.

273
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,360
Typhoon, here. Put it on.

274
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,400
If you see anything bad,
blow the whistle, okay?

275
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,840
At least

276
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,200
the thieves will get scared.

277
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,320
- Granny, here’s yours.
- Hmm?

278
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,760
Oh, you really know what I need.
Thank you so much.

279
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,480
- As for Thua…
- Don’t worry.

280
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,480
My brain is the best weapon I have.

281
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,120
- Let’s go. Before Ms. Kam can stop us.
- Let's go.

282
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Let’s go.

283
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,760
Wait! I think it’s too late now!

284
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,560
Wow.

285
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,200
Can I ask for something?

286
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,360
If you want to come, that's not possible.

287
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,760
I know everyone’s powers are unstable.

288
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,040
I won't follow if I can't help
and will just be a burden.

289
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,160
Then, what is it you want, Ms. Kam?

290
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,520
Your birthdate.
I got it from your job application.

291
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,800
Ms. Kam.

292
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,960
I want to celebrate
your birthday with you,

293
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,720
both mine and yours.

294
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,680
Alright.

295
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,480
I’ll make sure to wait
for this birthday properly.

296
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,160
You’re my hero.

297
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,280
Yes.

298
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,400
Where’s the good citizen?
I don’t see anyone around.

299
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,480
Wait. I’ll message them quickly.

300
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,280
Page…

301
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,840
Hey, This is
the "Please be generous" gang, right?

302
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,840
Wha has it got to do with us?

303
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,040
Let them go. These people

304
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,240
have superpowers.

305
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,400
That’s right. We have powers.

306
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,920
A gun won’t do anything to us.

307
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,520
Now, tell us

308
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,440
where the person who ran off is
and what you’ve done to him.

309
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,440
Do heroes have to meddle in everything?

310
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,400
Calm down.

311
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,000
I don’t care who you guys are.

312
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm looking for that guy too.

313
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,320
If you want to meddle,

314
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,640
then go ask him in hell.

315
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,160
Power of destruction!

316
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,800
Hey!

317
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,280
It hit me!

318
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,000
- Hey!
- Hey!

319
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,240
Warp power!

320
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,520
Hey!

321
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,960
Ouch!

322
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,160
Granny.

323
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,360
What power is that? They're running away.

324
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
Go after them. Catch them.

325
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,520
Hey, stop!

326
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,160
Oh.

327
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,840
Are we going to make it, Thua?

328
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,840
I’m praying for it too.

329
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,600
I can't take it.

330
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,040
- What’s wrong, Granny?
- The hat.

331
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,040
The hat?

332
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,000
This cap…

333
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,840
Hey!

334
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,440
Arm, dear!

335
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,880
You forgot your cap.

336
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,880
It looks like Arm’s cap.

337
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,320
If this is Arm’s cap,

338
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,800
then Arm must be involved
in something really dangerous.

339
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,120
Arm.

340
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,200
Hey.

341
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,640
Hey, Granny, what are you doing?

342
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,840
- Don't do it.
- Don't, Granny.

343
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,960
- Granny!
- Granny!

344
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,760
Hey, this isn’t time travel.
What’s happening?

345
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,680
- Hey, Granny!
- Granny!

346
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,280
- Granny!
- Wait, Granny!

347
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,680
Granny!

348
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,280
- Granny!
- Granny!

349
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,160
- Granny, wait!
- Granny!

350
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,840
- Ugh.
- Hey!

351
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,760
- Granny!
- Granny!

352
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,640
Granny!

353
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
MINIBUS

354
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,320
Ugh.

355
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,720
Is this fuel or gold?
The price keeps going up every day.

356
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,680
Water bills are high,
electricity bills are high,

357
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,240
and now my daughter Kam

358
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,880
has gone missing again.

359
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,360
Ugh, my head is about to explode.

360
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,040
Ugh.

361
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,800
Should I ask someone to help?

362
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,320
My daughter doesn’t even care,

363
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,520
so who’s going to help?

364
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,240
Well, your son-in-law Thua, of course.

365
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,640
Talking like that,

366
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,440
do you want to die or something, Seng?

367
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,400
I’m just joking.

368
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,480
Hey!

369
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,040
Hello.

370
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,640
Oh, Peem!

371
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,160
I haven’t seen you in a while.

372
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,200
I need to see you.

373
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,440
I have something urgent to tell you.

374
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,480
Urgent news?

375
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,320
I hope it’s good news,

376
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,800
like Kam and you

377
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,440
making up or something.

378
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,800
It’s not that.

379
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,600
I suspect that Thua might be a scammer,

380
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,080
and I'm worried
he might try to deceive Kam.

381
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,360
Scammer?

382
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,400
Here you go, Bung.

383
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,240
Thank you so much, Kam!

384
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,520
Honestly, you don’t have to
take care of me this much.

385
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,880
I haven't moved at all.
I'm completely stiff.

386
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,720
I have to, though. Thua told me to.

387
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,200
Since when do you care
about what Thua says?

388
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,200
Hello.

389
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,040
Oh, Dr. Korn!

390
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,720
Come on in!

391
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,440
Hello.

392
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,080
Sorry for coming in without asking.

393
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,720
I saw the door was open,

394
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,400
so I rushed in,
just in case something happened.

395
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,320
Oh, I must have forgotten
to close the door.

396
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,160
Thank you so much, Doctor.

397
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,160
So, you came to…

398
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,520
I brought some supplements for Bung.

399
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,320
Thank you!

400
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,920
Bung, take a lot of them.
They're really good.

401
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,960
My friend brought them for me
from overseas.

402
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,080
I didn’t know

403
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,040
you had time
to take care of patients at home.

404
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,000
We’re friends, Kam. We’re friends.

405
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,360
Oh, so this is how friendships develop?

406
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,400
Oh no.

407
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,240
It's my dad calling. What should I do?

408
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,960
Hello, Dad?

409
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,840
Where are you, Kam?

410
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,280
Well…

411
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,920
I’m at the hospital, Dad.

412
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,480
Bung has a stomachache,
so I came to stay with her.

413
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,440
Oh, you're at the hospital?

414
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,880
Uh.

415
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,760
Queue 12345, please pick up your medicine
at counter three.

416
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,080
Okay, bye, Dad.
I have to go pick up the medicine.

417
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,960
ROOM AVAILABLE, TEL: 099 2585192

418
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,880
Hey. Why

419
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,680
do you have to lie to your dad, though?

420
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,320
You’re here with Bung, right?

421
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,040
If he finds out I’m staying
at Thua’s house with Bung,

422
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,840
he’ll kill me for sure.

423
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,320
I never taught my child to lie.

424
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,200
Come on. At least Kam is with Phakbung.

425
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,080
Lying is lying.

426
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,360
So what if she’s with Bung?
This is Thua’s house.

427
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,280
I can't stand it anymore.

428
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,680
- Wait!
- Oh!

429
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,040
- Hold on, Ah!
- Wait!

430
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,040
He’ll charge you for trespassing.

431
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,040
I’ll report him for abducting a minor.

432
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,720
But Kam isn’t a minor.

433
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,680
Take it easy, please.

434
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,680
Trust me. I have a plan to help her.

435
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,560
If you have a plan, tell me.

436
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,280
I’ll handle everything to expose Thua

437
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,160
and separate him from Kam for good.

438
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,200
FAMILY MEMBERS, PLEASE WAIT OUTSIDE

439
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,920
Get up.

440
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,920
How is Granny?

441
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,120
She's safe now.
We’ll move her to a room shortly.

442
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,920
Thank you.

443
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,120
You’re welcome.

444
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,160
She's safe now. Now we can send the news.

445
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,280
Thua called and said Granny is okay.

446
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,200
Without powers,
everything is so difficult.

447
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,080
Why do you look so worried?

448
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,560
Without powers,
we can’t help Arm on our own.

449
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,480
I don’t want anyone to get hurt again.

450
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,640
So, what should we do?

451
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,040
We can't even report it to the police.

452
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,440
If we can’t solve it with tricks,
we’ll have to use strategy.

453
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,400
Dr. Korn.

454
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,880
Could you please take care of Bung for me?

455
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,800
Sure.

456
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,400
Where are you going?

457
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,680
Sorry, Bung, but something urgent came up.

458
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,880
Using strategy instead of tricks?

459
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,840
It’s about Arm, isn’t it?

460
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,160
Doctor, could you leave now?

461
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,240
I have something to take care of.

462
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,720
But I’m worried…

463
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,040
I promise, Doctor,
I won’t put myself in danger

464
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,960
because it will affect the baby.
Please trust me.

465
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,480
Go back now, Doctor.

466
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,960
Go quickly, quickly.

467
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
Go.

468
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Right now, Nutty is meeting with the media

469
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,840
to ask for support for your social work.

470
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,080
I made the right choice
choosing her for the job.

471
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,040
But about Ms. Kam…

472
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,280
I chose Nutty for the job,

473
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,680
but as for Kam,
it's not something I chose to do.

474
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,160
It's something I had to do.

475
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,520
Now that we have Ah on our side,

476
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,280
everything should be easier, right?

477
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,360
Yes.

478
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,600
I’m going to expose all of them

479
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,120
and turn their supporters
into my base of power.

480
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,360
The stolen things won't last long.

481
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,720
Mom!

482
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,840
The polls will go from first

483
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,080
to second, then fail.

484
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,000
Social media
is the only thing that's strong.

485
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,040
You want to be an MP through social media,
but are you failing in real life?

486
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,920
POLITICAL POPULARITY POLL

487
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,760
You’re wasting time helping people
through social media,

488
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,440
building a hero politician trend,

489
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,440
but you're not reaching
the vote collectors.

490
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,960
Don’t you know how important that is?

491
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,840
Why do I still have to teach you?

492
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,720
I know, Mom.

493
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,360
I’ve tried doing that,

494
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,960
reaching out to community leaders.

495
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,400
You saw it yourself. Nothing changed.

496
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,040
But that's stable!

497
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,040
It's not about chasing social media
trends. Look at where that leads.

498
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,880
I know what I'm doing, Mom.

499
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,560
Good, because if you didn’t know,

500
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,200
you wouldn’t deserve to be my child.

501
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,320
Hello.

502
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,080
- Peem.
- Not now.

503
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,520
I’m not in the mood to talk!

504
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,200
Ms. Kam is here to see you.

505
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,280
Kam is here?

506
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,200
I'm here today

507
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,520
as a regular person seeking help from you.

508
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,400
Are you in the right place?

509
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,680
Why don’t you go
to the "Please be generous" gang instead?

510
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,200
If you're not available, that's okay.

511
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
Wait, Kam.

512
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,120
I’ve helped others.

513
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,960
Why wouldn’t I help you,

514
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,600
someone I used to date?

515
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,320
What do you need help with?

516
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,199
Someone messaged the page,

517
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,040
saying they found a worker who escaped
from human traffickers.

518
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,000
He managed to escape,

519
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,080
but he's hiding
and won’t go to the police.

520
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,480
It's Granny Cheuy's child.

521
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,080
I want you to help me find him.

522
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,960
He escaped,
but won't report it to the police?

523
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,520
Did he do something wrong?

524
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,159
I want you to help me find the truth.

525
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,920
If he's wrong,
he'll face the consequences.

526
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,320
I just want him to be safe.

527
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,239
Can you help me, Peem?

528
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,040
And what do I get?

529
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,080
What you wanted from me from the start.

530
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,600
I’ll support you in the election

531
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,960
and help with your campaign.

532
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,800
Alright,

533
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,120
I can’t refuse then.

534
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,200
I’ll go now.

535
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,880
I have something urgent to handle.

536
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,000
I found him again,

537
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,840
the fishing worker who escaped.

538
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,680
WHERE'S HE?

539
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,240
Thua, is something wrong?

540
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,480
The good citizen sent me a message saying

541
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,000
they found Granny's son at the same place.

542
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,640
Huh?

543
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,800
I think I'll go look for him.

544
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,920
But there are bad guys involved.

545
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,360
By now, they're probably gone.

546
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,920
Don't go, Thua.

547
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,440
I've already asked Peem
to help with Granny's son.

548
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,880
But when Granny asked for Peem's help,

549
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,560
Thua said

550
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,360
there’s no way he'd ask
someone like him for help.

551
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,920
I did it because
I’m worried about everyone.

552
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,680
Right now, no one has powers,
and Granny is like this.

553
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,280
If we find her son, she might get better.

554
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,560
If he was really a good guy,

555
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,080
he wouldn’t have done that to you.

556
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,160
Also, he might be setting us up
for something.

557
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,360
And he’s the one
who brought Bung's parents to arrest Thua.

558
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,760
Sorry, I didn’t think about that.

559
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,280
I’ll go with you then.

560
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,680
And you don’t have to worry.

561
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,320
Neither of us has powers,

562
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,760
so we have to go together.

563
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,240
What about me?

564
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,920
You stay and watch over Granny and Bung.

565
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,240
What about Bung?

566
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,240
Don’t worry, Bung is with Dr. Korn.

567
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,840
You can stop here. It's fine.

568
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,000
But this isn't at the hospital yet.

569
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,640
- Here, please.
- Uh, okay.

570
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,360
THE SHRINE OF TIGER GOD

571
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,600
You said that Arm is hiding
in the same place.

572
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,760
Don't you find it strange
that he came back to hide there

573
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,920
instead of running far away?

574
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,240
I do find it strange,
but we have no choice.

575
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,320
I think he doesn't have
any choice either, like us.

576
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,200
Anyway, the good citizen informed us
that Arm is hiding behind there.

577
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Let's go check it out.

578
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,680
And who is this mysterious good citizen?

579
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,360
I had the "Please be generous" page hacked
to lure the scammers.

580
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,400
Using someone's life or death

581
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,600
to bait the scammers to show up,

582
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,760
isn't that a bit too extreme, Peem?

583
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,160
We're doing this to help everyone,

584
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,240
especially Kam.

585
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,280
If Thua is really part
of the "Please be generous" gang,

586
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,560
we can't let him keep doing this.

587
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,640
Either way, I won't allow these scammers

588
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,520
to fool my daughter anymore.

589
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,400
Please help my mom and Granny.

590
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,240
THE SHRINE OF TIGER GOD

591
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,040
It's me, Arm.

592
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,160
- It's your mom.
- Mom!

593
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,960
‪NEXT EPISODE

594
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,440
Actually, Arm isn't the victim,
he's one of them.

595
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,440
‪You gonna pay?

596
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,000
You are the "Please be generous" heroes!

597
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,840
Why are you doing this to him?

598
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,120
You meddling idiots,
you’ll get what's coming to you too.

599
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,760
