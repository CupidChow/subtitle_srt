1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Why did you suddenly
want to come here, Bung?

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,080
I’m curious about the power
and what it really means.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,280
And why does using it
seem to backfire on us?

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,160
‪PREVIOUSLY

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,360
‪SAMRONG 2 SANAM LUANG

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,000
I must survive. My baby must survive.
I have to protect my baby.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,160
Mom, I don't want to die.
Why am I so weak like this?

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,600
No, I can't die yet.

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,080
I need to find my son.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,280
Our powers

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,400
came from our wishes.

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,400
As for me,

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,960
I didn’t wish for anything.

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,040
I get it now.

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,560
Well, things have reached this point.

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,280
I think we shouldn’t force it anymore.
It’s dangerous.

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,600
What about the page we’ve been running?

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,120
I was the one who wanted to open the page.

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,880
I’ll take responsibility for it.

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,160
Are you sure, Thua?
You don’t have any special powers.

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,600
This one is difficult.

22
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,000
This one. "Find a marble."

23
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,880
This also seems difficult.

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,760
Why do we only have difficult cases?

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,320
What can a normal person like me do?

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,160
A marble?

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,600
You can't do it

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,920
if you want to solve it alone.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,360
Ms. Kam.

30
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,840
I'm angry, you know?

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,920
How could you forget me?
You still have me.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,640
I didn't forget you.
I just didn't want to trouble you.

33
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,240
From now on,

34
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,880
things will probably get harder.

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,800
So what? You think I asked
to join the team for fun?

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,720
I'm doing it for my ideals.

37
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,440
No matter how hard it is, I'll do it.

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,200
Thank you, Ms. Kam,

39
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,480
for not leaving me.

40
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,880
I'm not leaving anyone who's in trouble.

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,960
Okay.

42
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,880
Hey, are you hearing this?

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,280
- Yeah.
- Sounds like a cat.

44
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,960
I don't think so.

45
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,080
- But--
- Let's go check it out.

46
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,880
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

47
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,080
- Meow, meow.
- Hey, be quiet.

48
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,040
Oh, it's a baby.

49
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,680
Oh!

50
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,040
Where's the baby?

51
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,800
With the nurse.

52
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,960
Where did you find the baby?

53
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,560
We found it on the side of the road,
among the trees.

54
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,200
Well,

55
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,040
the two of us didn't touch anything.

56
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,000
So, what do we have to do next?

57
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,960
The foundation will take it from here.

58
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,000
Anyway, thank you very much.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,920
Officer, please come with me.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,160
Sure.

61
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,720
How could someone be so mean?

62
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,240
Left like that, the baby could have died.

63
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,560
Thua, why are you crying?

64
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,880
Here. Wipe your tears.

65
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,880
Can you tell me what's wrong with you now?

66
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,440
You scared me.

67
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,320
It's like I saw myself.

68
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,080
When I was a baby,

69
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,320
I was abandoned like that too.

70
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,560
Someone found me in a cardboard box
next to a trash can.

71
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,200
If they hadn't found me,
I might have been dead.

72
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
It makes me feel like

73
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,760
my life is worthless.

74
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,600
No one wants me.

75
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,520
That's not true, Thua.

76
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,040
Being abandoned by your mother
is one thing,

77
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,960
but it doesn't have anything to do
with your worth.

78
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,240
A person's worth

79
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,040
lies in their actions, not their origin.

80
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,360
You're a very good person.
And you're very generous.

81
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,520
That's your worth.

82
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,360
Thank you, Ms. Kam.

83
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,400
I only told you the truth.

84
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,560
Do you want to find your mother?

85
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,720
No.

86
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,600
I used to think…

87
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,200
I wanted to see her just once.
I wanted to ask how she's doing

88
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,760
and why she left me.

89
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,720
But on second thought,

90
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,440
why would you want to find someone
who doesn't love you?

91
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,720
All I want

92
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,680
is someone who understands me.

93
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,440
Someone who sees my worth.

94
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,840
Someone who loves me.

95
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,000
Who won't leave me again.

96
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,160
Is this the reason why you became a hero?

97
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
To be honest,

98
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,120
I'm not as good a person as you are.
I'm not fighting for my ideals.

99
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,640
I'm just trying to act cool.

100
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,960
There's nothing wrong with that.

101
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,280
You do good things.

102
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,320
The reason doesn't matter.

103
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,600
Even if you do it 'cause it's cool.

104
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,000
You do look cool, though.

105
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,240
So, let's do this.

106
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,039
Let's keep going together.

107
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,880
Okay?

108
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,039
We can do it!

109
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,000
Come on.

110
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,840
- We can do it.
- We can do it.

111
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,760
Thank you for cheering me up.

112
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,520
Hey, stop thanking me.
If you say it again, I'll charge you.

113
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,960
Smile more.

114
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,080
Smile widely.

115
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,040
Yeah, like that.

116
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,200
See you tomorrow.

117
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,240
Bye-bye.

118
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,320
I'm gonna have sweet dreams tonight.

119
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,120
Yeah, Ms. Kam and Thua.

120
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,960
When did they get that close, huh?

121
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,600
How are you feeling, Bung?

122
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,200
Does your tummy still hurt? Better now?

123
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,440
I feel better now.

124
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,400
How about you?

125
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,840
Huh?

126
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,520
I mean, the side effect of the power.

127
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,680
Well, my memory is bad.

128
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,160
It takes me so long to think.

129
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Mine is bad too. I got my height measured.

130
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,640
It's still the same as last year.

131
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,840
- Huh?
- Huh?

132
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,640
How come?

133
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,360
At your age, you should be growing.

134
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,320
Maybe it's the side effect of his power.

135
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Oh, come on. I don't want to stay
this short for the rest of my life.

136
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,440
Our powers came from our wishes,

137
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,440
so we should finish what we asked for.

138
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,320
If so, we should do what
we should have done in the first place.

139
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,440
I don't have any other number
for Typhoon's mother.

140
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,360
But I can tell you where she works.

141
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,200
I think it's here.

142
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,240
Shall we split up to look for her?

143
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,400
It might be faster.

144
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,560
I'll go this way.

145
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,920
Phoon and I will go that way.

146
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,120
- Alright. See you later.
- Let's go.

147
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,640
Excuse me. Do you know
a worker named Duangjai?

148
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,200
There's no one with that name here.

149
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,800
Duang!

150
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,160
Stop doing laundry. Run now!

151
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,400
Someone is asking around about you again.

152
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,360
Not paying, huh?

153
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,120
Okay, here! This is all I have.

154
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,200
Next time, if you don't pay up,

155
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,560
I will not only destroy your stuff,

156
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,680
I'll beat you up!

157
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,960
So? Have you seen her?

158
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,960
Where's my mom?

159
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,960
Calm down.

160
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,760
We haven't looked everywhere yet.

161
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,920
- Let's go look over there. Come on.
- Let's go.

162
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,120
- Let's go.
- Okay.

163
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,960
Careful.

164
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,560
You evil spirit. You evil spirit, get out!
You evil spirit, get out!

165
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,280
Get out, you evil spirit.

166
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,280
What should we do?

167
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,640
If it goes on like this,
the woman will be in trouble.

168
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,120
I called the police. They'll be here soon.

169
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,040
How soon?

170
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,480
You evil spirit, get out!
Hey, you evil spirit, get out!

171
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,560
You evil spirit!

172
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,760
I think it will be too late.

173
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,680
Thua!

174
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,920
- You evil spirit, get out!
- Hey, this way!

175
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,400
You evil spirit!

176
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,960
You're gonna die!

177
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,800
Thua!

178
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
You evil spirit!

179
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,880
Evil spirit!

180
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,680
Jeez.

181
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,000
Thua, you okay?

182
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,200
I'm okay.

183
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,920
It took so long to clear things up,
don't you think?

184
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,280
It's only normal
because we have no superpowers.

185
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,080
Luckily we still have
the police to depend on.

186
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,680
The "Please be generous" heroes
haven't shown up lately.

187
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,160
Right.

188
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,120
Just now, I thought they'd come,
but they didn't.

189
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,560
I guess we can't count on them now.

190
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,760
I messaged them on the page,
but they never replied.

191
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,200
Right.

192
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,880
How is everyone?

193
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,680
Well,

194
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,560
they leave the house every day.

195
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,360
I never ask where they go, though.

196
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,760
You guys don't talk much?

197
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,640
I don't want to make them
feel uncomfortable.

198
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,880
Granny!

199
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,880
Have you found my mom?

200
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,280
No.

201
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,120
- Bung.
- Ow!

202
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,320
Does you tummy hurt?

203
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,160
Yes. I guess I walked too much.

204
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't think walking around like this
is working. It'll be bad for us.

205
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,960
I think

206
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,800
I should take us back in time.

207
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Are you sure? What if

208
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,640
you forget something again?

209
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,920
Well,

210
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,040
then, Bung and Phoon,
you can remind me. It's alright.

211
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,240
I haven't used my power
to time travel in a long time.

212
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,520
I guess it'll be fine.

213
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,080
It'll be alright.

214
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,200
We'll use the power to time travel
and find your mom.

215
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,920
It matches with our wish. Okay?

216
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,680
Do you know

217
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,680
when we should go back to?

218
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,000
I'll focus on Phoon's mother
as much as possible.

219
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,720
Come on.

220
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,840
Granny, why are we here again?

221
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,600
Right.

222
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,800
We looked here,
but we couldn't find my mom.

223
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,920
But I did focus on her.

224
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,320
Did I fail?

225
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,640
My power has been glitching lately.

226
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,640
It's okay, Granny.

227
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,480
Let's take a look around
since we're already here.

228
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,280
- Let's look again, okay?
- Let's go.

229
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,160
Catch him. Don't let him get away.

230
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,840
Let's check it out.

231
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,200
- Come on. Be careful, Granny.
- Quickly.

232
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,440
You owe me money and you try to run?

233
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,440
Huh?

234
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,240
That's my stepdad.

235
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,359
See you in three days. If you can't pay
both the loan and interest, you're dead.

236
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,000
- Okay, okay.
- Got it?

237
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,200
Okay.

238
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,839
Oh, honey.

239
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,800
That's my mom.

240
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,960
You dared to ask?

241
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,560
Didn't I tell you to find me money, huh?

242
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,920
Stop!

243
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,280
Why are we back here?
Granny, take me back there.

244
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,880
I need to help my mom.

245
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,040
Wait, Phoon.

246
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,280
Granny's condition is worsening!

247
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,160
What is this place?

248
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,920
I don't think we can
travel back in time like this.

249
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,400
Let's take Granny back home now.

250
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,400
- Oh, jeez.
- Come on.

251
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,520
Granny, let's go home.

252
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,920
Let's take Granny home first.

253
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,920
- Fine, let's go.
- Go where?

254
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,400
Granny, how are you?
Are you feeling better?

255
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,080
I should ask you, Bung.
Why don't you sit down?

256
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,760
Your tummy will hurt again.

257
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,960
That's a relief.

258
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,640
You still remember me.

259
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,920
Thua isn't back yet?

260
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,640
Since we separated,

261
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,160
he's been out working on cases
with Kam every day.

262
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,640
Those two don't have powers.

263
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,480
Can they handle it?

264
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,480
Right. I wonder how they're doing.

265
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,600
It's here, Thua. We got a report
that there are women locked up here.

266
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,800
It does look suspicious.

267
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Have you called the police?

268
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,520
I called them before we left the market.

269
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,160
Why aren't they here yet?

270
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,280
Is it because

271
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,960
the evidence we have
isn't interesting enough?

272
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,240
Maybe the police ignored it.

273
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,680
You might be right.

274
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,360
Maybe messages from the page
weren't enough.

275
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,040
The police probably thought
it was just trolling messages.

276
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,720
I think we have to find more evidence.

277
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,120
Let's take a look around.

278
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,040
There's nothing outside.
We have to get inside.

279
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,160
You're right. Then, I'll get in first.

280
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,440
Ms. Kam, how did you get in?

281
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,040
The door is over there.

282
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,080
The door.

283
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,440
You make me look bad again.

284
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,040
Ms. Kam.

285
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,960
It's dangerous.

286
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,720
- I'm scared. Don't do it! I'm scared.
- The sound came from that way.

287
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,080
Who's that?

288
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,000
Oh no.

289
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,840
Ms. Kam, run. Let's go.

290
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,720
You got a head start, I see.

291
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,440
Hey, I'm here.

292
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,480
Look at my moves. Come down if you dare.

293
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,920
You can't catch me.

294
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,480
You guys, go get him!

295
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,040
Oh my.

296
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,200
Why isn't he here yet?

297
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,960
Did he get caught?

298
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,880
Gosh, what should I do now?

299
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,760
Ms. Kam.

300
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,160
Thua.

301
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,560
You're okay.

302
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,640
Yeah.

303
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,560
I'm okay. But now,

304
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,160
it's kinda hard to breathe.

305
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,360
Sorry.

306
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,640
I got a bit too excited.

307
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,360
Were you worried about me?

308
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,760
Of course, I was. We're a team.

309
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,440
But we should get out of here now.

310
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,960
They might catch up.

311
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,960
Come on.

312
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,880
Oh, okay.

313
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,720
Thua.

314
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,320
I don't think we can handle this alone.

315
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,240
I agree.

316
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,520
We didn't manage to film it,
and now they know.

317
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,320
They probably ran away.

318
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,520
Will those women be okay?

319
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,360
Will they kill them?

320
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,840
No, I don't think so.

321
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,960
How do we tell the police?

322
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,760
We don't have any evidence.

323
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,200
Thua, we need to ask them for help.

324
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,000
We can't.

325
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,320
I don't want to put them in danger again.

326
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,480
They shouldn't use their powers
for something

327
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,320
that has nothing to do with them.

328
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,280
You're right.

329
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,640
They've helped us a lot.

330
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,800
I think we should try
to find a way ourselves.

331
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,320
Okay.

332
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,480
Well, I should go home now.

333
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,520
If I go in and see them,

334
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,920
I'm afraid I might slip
and ask for their help.

335
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,680
Okay, let me walk with you.

336
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,960
Let's go.

337
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,760
Thua and Kam are having trouble
handling a case?

338
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,640
Yes.

339
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,320
And I think it's very dangerous.

340
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,520
I knew this would happen.

341
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,200
Those two don't have any powers.

342
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,000
So, you're going to help Thua and Kam?

343
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,400
Yes.

344
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,040
Granny.

345
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,120
What about the side effects?

346
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,520
I don't want to be mean,
but you know what it's like.

347
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,800
There are only two of us.

348
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,240
I think one of us has to lure them out.

349
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,480
The other goes in, takes a video,
and sends it to the police.

350
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,200
Okay, I'll lure them out.

351
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,800
Hey, wait, Ms. Kam.

352
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,720
You can't.

353
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,920
If you run to lure them out and they
catch you, what are we going to do?

354
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,720
Then you lure them out.
I'll go in to take a video.

355
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,600
Hey.

356
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,400
- What now?
- You can't.

357
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,800
What if they're still inside
when you go in?

358
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,840
You'll be in trouble.

359
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,680
Then what do we do?
There are only two of us.

360
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,160
Who said there are only two of you?

361
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,600
Did you forget us? I'm sad, you know?

362
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,000
Granny, Bung, Phoon, how did you get here?

363
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,200
You two are in trouble.
How can we sit still?

364
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,160
But the side effects…

365
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,840
If something happens to us,

366
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,240
you just help us then. Okay?

367
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,360
Well, what are we waiting for?

368
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,640
Come on in.

369
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,040
Or I'll change my mind.

370
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,680
- Let's split up.
- I'll stay downstairs.

371
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,200
Granny and I will go upstairs.

372
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,320
- There's nothing here.
- Oh my.

373
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,160
Oh. Hey, guys.
There's another room upstairs.

374
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,240
Huh?

375
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,600
Phoon.

376
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,880
Oh.

377
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,080
Open it.

378
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,960
I told you to open it, not destroy it.

379
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,000
Oh.

380
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,880
What should we do next?

381
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,400
Mom!

382
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,480
- Huh?
- Huh?

383
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,840
Granny, are you okay?

384
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,560
- Granny!
- Are you okay?

385
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,040
- Are you okay?
- Must be the side effect of the power.

386
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,120
Granny, are you okay?

387
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,280
Why is my mom here?

388
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,760
We should hurry and take photos.
Then take Phoon's mom to the police.

389
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,880
- Okay. Take care of her.
- Phoon.

390
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,040
- You okay?
- Yes.

391
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,280
How's Typhoon's mom?

392
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,360
The doctor hasn't come out yet.

393
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,680
Your mom is with the doctor now.
Don't worry.

394
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,520
So, what happened at the house?
Did you manage to help everyone?

395
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,560
Those bad guys all ran away.

396
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,840
- Huh?
- Huh?

397
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,040
The victims were gone too.

398
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,400
- Huh?
- Huh?

399
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,040
Excuse me.

400
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,560
How is it going?

401
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,960
Where are the victims?

402
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,240
You two called us, right?

403
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,040
Yes, I did.

404
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,880
Be careful, or you might be charged
with false accusations.

405
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,160
- Huh?
- Huh?

406
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,800
I looked everywhere in the house.
I didn't find anyone.

407
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,360
That doesn't seem right.

408
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,480
We saw it with our own eyes.

409
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,680
Here.

410
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,200
If you took this, how did you get out?

411
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,800
Be careful.

412
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,320
You could get one more charge,
creating false evidence.

413
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,440
Are you okay?

414
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,320
Doctor.

415
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,280
Are you not feeling well?

416
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,360
Are you having contractions again?

417
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,720
My baby is just moving around.

418
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,160
I'm fine. I came here for my relative.

419
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,640
Oh.

420
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,760
That's good.

421
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,240
Well, where are you going?
Want me to walk you somewhere?

422
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,560
I'm going to the bathroom.

423
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,120
The ladies' room.

424
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,320
The patient is safe now.

425
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,480
But there are bruises on her body,
so I put her on IV fluid.

426
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:29,840
Tomorrow, I'll order her a CT scan
for a more thorough check-up.

427
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,360
So, can I go see my mom?

428
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,880
Well,

429
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,600
the patient woke up once
and passed out again.

430
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,880
I think she's still unconscious right now.

431
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,480
In that case,

432
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,600
we should let her rest, okay?

433
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,120
Okay. I'll come here first thing tomorrow.

434
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,960
Sure.

435
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,480
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

436
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,400
I love it when you're dressed up.

437
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,920
I'm good-looking like you, Mom.

438
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,120
Here.

439
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,360
For you to recharge.
Then we can go to the school event.

440
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,440
Guys, are you ready?
I'm ready to see my mom.

441
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,760
Ms. Duangjai has run away.

442
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,480
- Run away?
- Run away?

443
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,720
That's right.

444
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,240
I went to take her blood pressure
in the morning,

445
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,360
but she wasn't there.

446
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,400
After we checked the surveillance footage,

447
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,920
we found that she left at 4 a.m.

448
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,800
Please excuse me then.

449
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,760
Where did my mom run off to again?

450
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,240
She didn't mean to run away from you.

451
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,640
She didn't know it's you who helped her.

452
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,920
She's probably worried about the bills,

453
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,640
so she ran away.
I've seen a lot of people who did it.

454
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,600
Don't worry about it, Phoon.

455
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,040
I'll help you. Let's go.

456
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,520
- Granny.
- Hey, Granny.

457
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,800
Wait a sec, Granny.
What about the side effect?

458
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,640
The way I see it,

459
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,000
each of us can't just use
the power we received

460
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:33,680
to solve our own problems.
We have to help each other.

461
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,840
Come on. Ready?

462
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,800
Oh, it's 4 a.m.

463
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,800
This is the time the nurse said

464
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,720
- Phoon's mom left.
- Yeah.

465
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,080
Hey, Phoon's mom is coming.

466
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,679
- Mom.
- Hey.

467
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,719
You can't change the past.
It's the rule of time.

468
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,120
Yeah.

469
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,120
Hey.

470
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,320
Coming.

471
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,120
Duangjai!

472
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,880
Why are you back?

473
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,600
So, she came back to him.

474
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,480
That's why she never looked for me.

475
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,000
Maybe she's just here to get her stuff.

476
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,680
Don't jump to conclusions.
Typhoon, calm down, okay?

477
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,840
- I--
- I asked why you're back

478
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,800
- Huh?
- Duangjai.

479
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,680
You're back?

480
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,920
Yesterday, he told me you moved in
with your relatives in another province.

481
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,960
Well, they're not home,
so she came back here.

482
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,880
Right, Duangjai?

483
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,720
That's right.

484
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,480
That's good. A husband and wife
expecting a child should live together.

485
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,000
When is your baby due?

486
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,240
I'm just four months in.

487
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,640
I see. Four months, huh?

488
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,440
Here.

489
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,360
It's for you.

490
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,320
My fortune teller told me I should
do something nice for a pregnant woman.

491
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,880
If you need anything, let me know.

492
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,880
Thank you so much, ma'am.

493
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,200
I'll get going.

494
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,160
Thank you, ma'am.

495
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,320
I don't want to be with my mom anymore.

496
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,520
I guess Typhoon's shocked
that his mom is having a new baby.

497
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,680
He probably can't accept the fact

498
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,040
that his mother, who he's been protecting,

499
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,080
chose to be with someone who hurts her.

500
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,920
And they're building a new family
without him too.

501
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,120
He must feel like he's been abandoned
again and again.

502
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,800
Typhoon is more mature than his age.

503
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,160
I think we should give him some time
and he'll realize

504
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,120
that he still has us.

505
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,840
Yeah. Then,

506
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,240
I'll make him some hot chocolate
before bed.

507
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,320
Thua, you should take Ms. Kam home.
She must be tired.

508
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,720
Yeah?

509
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,000
Okay.

510
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,160
Do you really think Typhoon's okay?

511
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,600
He's not.

512
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm sure he's not okay. His mother
left him and is having a new baby.

513
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,640
But even though he's not okay now,
he'll be fine eventually.

514
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,360
Because Typhoon has me,

515
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,360
Granny, and Phakbung.

516
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,800
I'll make sure
Typhoon isn't abandoned again.

517
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,520
You missed one person.

518
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,640
Who did I miss?

519
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,120
Me, Granny,

520
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,640
Bung. That's three.

521
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,120
Me too.

522
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,400
Oh, right.

523
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,920
You too. Then it's four.

524
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,080
Oh, Ah, hello.

525
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,520
Why are you standing here?
Why don't you come inside?

526
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,040
They're not just talking
outside the house.

527
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,280
These two

528
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,040
have been out together all day.

529
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,120
Seng,

530
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,880
that was loud. No need to whisper.
I heard every word clearly.

531
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,480
Since you heard it, answer.
Where have you been?

532
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,880
You should leave now. Go check on Typhoon.

533
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,640
Let me deal with this.

534
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,720
I'll get going then.

535
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,400
Goodbye, Ah. Goodbye, Seng.

536
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,160
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

537
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,920
Why did you do that to my friend?

538
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,280
Your friend, huh?

539
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,240
What kind of friend? They seem very close.

540
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,840
I heard that.

541
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,880
So, what kind of friend? Tell me.

542
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,640
I swear on these carps.

543
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,920
Right now, we're just friends.

544
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,880
I'm getting inside. I'm tired.

545
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,040
So, they're just friends.

546
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,000
I'm relieved.

547
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,680
But her word choice was kinda weird.

548
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,400
Right now, they're just friends.

549
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,920
Later,

550
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,400
they won't be just friends, I think.

551
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,960
Later, they won't be just friends?
Then what?

552
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,920
Kam, what will you become later,
if not friends?

553
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,080
If not friends, what will it be?
What will happen in the next episode?

554
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,720
Good morning, Typhoon!

555
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,360
Come eat your favorite dishes.

556
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,800
Fried chicken is ready.

557
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,400
Fried pork is also ready.

558
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,320
Soft sticky rice too.

559
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,400
Hey, Granny, Typhoon isn't upstairs.

560
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,880
- Huh?
- Huh?

561
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,400
Typhoon is missing?

562
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,240
I still want to see my mom
and protect her.

563
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,240
Will you shut up?

564
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,080
Stop!

565
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,280
‪NEXT EPISODE

566
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,360
Typhoon!

567
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,000
"My daughter is missing.

568
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,160
Her name is Phakbung."

569
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,960
Don't reply to my mom's message.

570
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,240
Or I'll run away from here,
and no one will ever find me again.

571
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,920
Granny, your son

572
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,160
is dead.

573
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,440
