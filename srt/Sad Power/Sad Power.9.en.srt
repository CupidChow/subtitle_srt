1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,640
Someone claimed to work for you
collecting protection fees.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,720
I want to catch whoever
is throwing my name around.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,120
Especially those who used my name
to hurt my granddaughter and son-in-law.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,800
I know someone
who can deal with this stuff.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,880
‪PREVIOUSLY

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,440
- Who?
- Have you ever heard of this name?

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,440
The "Please be generous" gang.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,120
You've been caught.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,040
- Hey!
- Stop time!

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,680
- Ow!
- Granny, are you okay?

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,960
- What is this? Wait.
- Go!

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,040
- Sir.
- Go.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,600
I thank you for the fact

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,680
that no matter how hard life

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,960
has been for you,

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,840
you've never done anything untoward.

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,200
And you've raised Kam so well.

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,840
And now, I've gained one more idol.

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,080
Please be my girlfriend.

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,960
Yes, I'll be your girlfriend.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,840
<i>Dear viewers, thanks</i>

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,200
We’ve gained
thousands of followers, Granny!

28
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,560
Oh, wow!

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,280
Thua, are you happy?
Our page is getting so much attention!

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,240
If they’re not the right people,
it doesn’t matter, Granny.

31
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,080
He's heartbroken over Kam.

32
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,640
I heard she’s getting close to Peem.

33
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,760
Why are you rubbing salt
in my wound? I’m leaving.

34
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,200
Where are you going?

35
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,760
Hey!

36
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,760
There are tons of messages on the page

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,680
asking for our help.

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,680
Aren’t you going to read them?

39
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,120
Not in the mood.

40
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,480
- I’m leaving.
- Thua, I know you’re upset,

41
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,120
but there are people counting on us.

42
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,400
You started this page to help others.

43
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,800
Maybe it’s time to stop focusing on Kam

44
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,720
and start focusing on those who need us.

45
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,160
It might help you feel better.

46
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,160
If I’m not focusing on Ms. Kam,

47
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,080
I don’t want to focus on anything.

48
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,680
Ugh!

49
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,840
So, you start the page when
you feel like it, and then you abandon it?

50
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,120
No sense of responsibility!

51
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,720
Calm down.

52
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,600
Thua, don’t take her words too seriously.

53
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,520
Her hormones are all over the place
because she’s pregnant.

54
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,120
It’s not hormones, Granny. I’m serious.

55
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,520
I can see why Thua started the hero page.
It was all to impress Ms. Kam.

56
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,240
Now that she’s not looking his way,

57
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,600
he doesn’t want to do it anymore.

58
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,560
That’s why Ms. Kam chose Mr. Peem,
and she made the right choice.

59
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,160
He genuinely helps people.

60
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,640
Thua, you’re just fake.

61
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,920
Fine, I’m fake. I’m no good at anything.

62
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,280
Oh.

63
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,520
Whoa, Bung, why the harsh words?

64
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,080
It has to be harsh, otherwise, how can it
motivate someone like him to fight again?

65
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,960
I’m just worried it might be too harsh,

66
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,920
and he won’t wake up from it.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,280
Trust me, Granny.
Someone like him needs it this way.

68
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,320
How to…

69
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,280
HOW TO BE SUCCESSFUL

70
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,080
Aunt, I’ll have the chicken basil
with a sunny side up egg, please.

71
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Okay.

72
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,920
I’m Kongfah.

73
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,280
The test results for Boonchuay, the dog
hit by a car the other night, are out.

74
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,800
The poor thing
has both of its legs broken,

75
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,280
and the doctor also found
that it has cancer.

76
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,560
It's really sad.

77
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,680
I’d like to invite everyone

78
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,760
to help Boonchuay.

79
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,720
<i>Please donate as much as you can.</i>

80
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,640
<i>Every baht</i>

81
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,200
<i>will go towards Boonchuay’s treatment.</i>

82
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,640
<i>Let’s help out together.</i>

83
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,360
Here’s the money for you, Boonchuay.
Get well soon!

84
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,760
Wow, what a saint you are!

85
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,160
Thua, do you want your egg sunny side up?

86
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,600
- Oh…
- Hey, Thua!

87
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,120
Come sit with me!

88
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,840
Thua, do you want your egg cooked?

89
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,200
Yes, please.

90
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,560
Please be my girlfriend.

91
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,760
Yes, I'll be your girlfriend.

92
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
Oh, Kam!

93
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,920
Can I ask you something?

94
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,440
Sure, go ahead!

95
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,480
- So, you and… uh…
- My dear!

96
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,200
Yes, my dear. What do you want to eat?
I’ll order for you.

97
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,920
I’ll have whatever you're having.

98
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,400
May I sit with you?

99
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,160
Feel free. I'm about to leave anyway.

100
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,640
Aren’t you eating, Thua?

101
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,120
You wanted to ask me something?

102
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,200
I don’t need to ask anymore.
I’ve figured it out.

103
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,000
I have some urgent business, so I’ll go.

104
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,200
Aunt, please change it to to-go.

105
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,520
Where could he be? It’s so late,
and he still hasn’t come back.

106
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,280
Typhoon!

107
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,320
Have you seen my phone?

108
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,880
Here it is. My phone’s out of battery,

109
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,240
so I’m using yours.
The dog is sick. It’s so sad.

110
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,960
I saw it on Kongfah’s livestream.
Can I have some money to donate?

111
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,400
Wait a minute. Let me call Thua first.
He still hasn’t come back.

112
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,320
<i>It is not possible</i>
<i>to reach the number at this time.</i>

113
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,840
I can’t get through.

114
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,120
Let’s go look for him.

115
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,760
Oh, Granny, you don’t need
to go look for him.

116
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,400
He's an adult.
He can take care of himself.

117
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,600
He’s just sulking. He’ll be back.
It’s just a little scolding.

118
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,120
People’s hearts are fragile.

119
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Everyone handles criticism differently.

120
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,000
You might see it as something small,
but for him,

121
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,480
it might be a big deal.

122
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,120
That’s why they say,

123
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,520
"The speaker forgets,
but the listener never does."

124
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,000
So, you stay here and watch the house.

125
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,840
I’ll go look for him. Let's go!

126
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,800
It’s okay, Granny. I’ll go with you.

127
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,840
Let's go!

128
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,280
- Thua!
- Thua!

129
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,320
- Thua!
- Thua!

130
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,280
Ugh!

131
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,160
- Where is he? Thua!
- Thua!

132
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,680
Hey, there! There he is!

133
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,680
Thua!

134
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,320
Is that really him, Granny?

135
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,120
Granny, have you seen my mom?

136
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,040
No, I haven’t seen her.

137
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,200
Uh…

138
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,680
This is Noy, Granny.

139
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,480
She’s the one who always
buys grilled chicken for the stray dogs.

140
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,480
Oh, yes. You've a good memory.

141
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,400
I can't forget her.

142
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,360
Noy, when she buys chicken,

143
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,800
she always takes the bones out
and only gives the meat to the dogs.

144
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,600
She says the bones can give
the dogs a stomach ache.

145
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,440
Yes, my mom really loves dogs.

146
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,160
How did your mom disappear?

147
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,000
She ran away from home.

148
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,400
She threatened to kill herself,

149
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,880
but I thought she was just joking.

150
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,120
But now,

151
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,240
she still hasn’t come back.

152
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,720
If something really happens to her,

153
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,160
I don’t know what I’ll do.

154
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,520
Calm down. We’ll help you look for her.

155
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,120
- Just stay calm, okay?
- Do you remember when she disappeared?

156
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,080
She disappeared after
having an argument with me.

157
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,600
Granny, are we in the right place?

158
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,720
Non, can you stop bothering me?

159
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,400
It must be here.

160
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,400
Mom, wait a second.

161
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,840
Mom!

162
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,440
How can I stop bothering you?

163
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,360
You took all the savings
from the house to help those dogs.

164
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,000
Do you know

165
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,800
that I had to borrow money
just to buy vegetables to sell?

166
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,800
We don’t even have anything
to eat now, Mom.

167
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,160
We may not have food now,
but we can still get it later.

168
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,040
The dogs can’t find food on their own.
I have to help them.

169
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,400
Mom, I understand helping,

170
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,360
but not to the point
where we’re left with nothing.

171
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,640
I’m telling you,

172
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,720
don’t donate any more money to the dogs.

173
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,760
Non, don’t force me. If you keep
controlling me, I'll kill myself!

174
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,760
Mom, stop saying that!

175
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,880
I’m the one who’s been paying your debts,
and it’s killing me!

176
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,640
Where are you going now, Mom?

177
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,800
I'm going to kill myself!

178
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,840
Mom!

179
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,160
Oh.

180
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,400
Oh.

181
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,960
- Hurry, follow her!
- Let's go.

182
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,640
She really loves dogs.

183
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,480
- Oh? Hey, let’s go quickly!
- Oh!

184
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,000
Hey, she’s already in the truck taxi!

185
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,760
What should we do?

186
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,960
Granny, let’s follow her.

187
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,000
Follow her.

188
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,160
Excuse me. What were you talking about
with the lady earlier?

189
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,720
She asked if the truck taxi that passed
went by the pond behind the market.

190
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,320
Got it. Thank you so much.

191
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,920
- The pond behind the market?
- Granny.

192
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,360
Wait! Could she be going
to jump into the water?

193
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,640
Oh.

194
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,800
So, should we go back to the present

195
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,720
and wait for her there?

196
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,480
Yeah, yeah.

197
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,080
We still don’t see Noy anywhere.

198
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,080
- Hey!
- What?

199
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,720
What if she already jumped into the water?

200
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,000
- Oh!
- Hey!

201
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,160
Should we call rescue services?

202
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,800
But we don’t even know

203
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,800
if Non’s mom really jumped into the water.

204
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
People jump in here quite often.

205
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,520
But today, I didn’t see anyone jump in.

206
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,480
I just saw a person
standing around looking.

207
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,640
Huh?

208
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,760
But they didn't jump in.

209
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,640
And…

210
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,640
Was it…

211
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,200
this woman?

212
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,880
Yeah, that’s her.

213
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,600
I saw her walking that way.

214
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,800
- Hey!
- Huh?

215
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,960
Noy is still alive!

216
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,080
I’ll call Non right now.

217
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,600
Hello, Non! We’ve got a lead on your mom!

218
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,600
Come to the pond
behind the market right away.

219
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Okay. Let's go, Granny.

220
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,800
Let's go.

221
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,520
I will be great.

222
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,280
I will be famous.

223
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,800
I will be rich.

224
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
Don’t get married yet, Ms. Kam.

225
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,880
Please don’t get married yet.

226
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,120
Young man.

227
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,400
Young man, wake up.

228
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,760
- Huh? It’s dark.
- Yeah.

229
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,760
Are you a vegetable seller?

230
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,080
Yeah, yeah. And you sell Laab, right?

231
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,880
Why are you lying down here?

232
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,440
- I didn’t mean to lie down.
- Oh.

233
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,080
Well,

234
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,720
I was reading about
how to be successful in three months.

235
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,680
But I only got to read for three minutes…

236
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,680
You succeeded?

237
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,640
I fell asleep. It’s dark now.

238
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,760
Oh!

239
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,960
If I keep going like this,
when will I succeed?

240
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,640
Hmm, you’ll succeed eventually.

241
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,840
But do you have anything
that you’re good at?

242
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,200
Why not do something you’re good at?

243
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,160
Do you have anything?

244
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,440
Finally, our page
is going to be recognized!

245
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,640
If anyone is in trouble,
or if you know of anyone who is,

246
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,800
let me know.

247
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,440
- Really?
- Yes, really.

248
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,440
Well, if anything happens,
I’ll contact you right away.

249
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,640
No problem.
I’ll contact the admin shortly.

250
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,040
Stop! Drop your weapon!

251
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,280
- Sir.
- Go.

252
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,000
The joy of helping someone

253
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,520
is a hero's reward, right, guys?

254
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,440
<i>Many people are now highly interested</i>
<i>in the "Please be generous" page,</i>

255
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,640
<i>which has gained tens</i>
<i>of thousands of followers.</i>

256
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,520
We’ve gained
thousands of followers, Granny!

257
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,240
Thua, are you happy?
Our page is getting so much attention!

258
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,200
Well, there is something.

259
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,600
See? Then let's focus on doing
what we're good at.

260
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,800
Keep doing it,
and success will come eventually.

261
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,000
You're right! Okay.

262
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,720
I'll keep going.

263
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,200
Yeah.

264
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,160
Good, good.

265
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,120
By the way,

266
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,800
I have some rice here.
But it’s behind you.

267
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,400
- Really?
- Excuse me.

268
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,960
Oh.

269
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,440
Uh…

270
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,360
Here, take it.

271
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,000
- For me?
- Yes.

272
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,480
Aren't you hungry?

273
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,520
I'm not hungry at all.

274
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,680
And also, it's really late.

275
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,080
I might get acid reflux.

276
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,960
- It's very late. You should eat it.
- Oh.

277
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,040
Thank you.

278
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,960
Then I'll share it with my child.
I'm going now.

279
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,520
- Thanks again!
- You're welcome.

280
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,280
Is one lunch box enough for a child also?

281
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,480
Hmm, is it tasty, dear?

282
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,280
Go ahead. Eat up.

283
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,400
Wow!

284
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,920
You're not going to save
some for yourself?

285
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,520
Oh, I'm fine. Let it eat.

286
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,800
I feel sorry for it.

287
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,800
You're doing all this for the dog,

288
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,320
so you must really love them, right?

289
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,360
Yeah, that's right.

290
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,120
These dogs have made me happy.

291
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,600
Since I was young,
when my parents passed away,

292
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,640
these dogs have always been there

293
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,800
to keep me company.

294
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,960
When I grew up and my husband left,

295
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,000
it was these dogs

296
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,080
who comforted me.

297
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,320
Later, when my child grew up
and started working,

298
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,760
these dogs were still there,

299
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,080
helping me cope with loneliness.

300
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,520
My life today, everything I have,
I owe it to these dogs.

301
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,960
That's really great.

302
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,000
It's great, isn't it?

303
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,760
Well, even you think it's great.

304
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,480
Then, why doesn't my son understand me?

305
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,240
Thua!

306
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,560
How did you guys get here?

307
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,040
Mom!

308
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,000
Mom, let's go home, please.

309
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,400
So, you're going to force me again?

310
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,000
- Mom.
- Isn't it because I make you tired, Non?

311
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,520
Why do you keep bothering me?

312
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,480
I don’t want to stop caring
about you, Mom.

313
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,120
I just want you to ease up a bit
on the things you’re doing.

314
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,400
If you force me again,
I'll show you, I’ll die

315
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,960
- Mom! No, Mom!
- Hey!

316
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,560
- I'll kill myself!
- Please, don't do that!

317
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,680
- Mom!
- Calm down.

318
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,240
- Let go of me!
- Mom!

319
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,560
- Why are you forcing me again?
- Mom, please calm down!

320
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,600
Why are you forcing me? I love the dogs.
Why are you forcing me?

321
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,360
Mom!

322
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,360
Mom! Mom!

323
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,400
Come on. Sit down. Sit down.

324
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,480
Mom!

325
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,720
Mom!

326
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,560
If my mom wants to help dogs,

327
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,400
I’m not against it,

328
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,440
as long as it doesn’t
cause trouble for anyone.

329
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,080
Normally,

330
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,800
she’s been into helping dogs
since I was little.

331
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,520
But in the last year or two,

332
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,960
she’s changed.
Everything she has goes to the dogs,

333
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,960
ever since she started liking
that page, "Let's Help Sick Dogs".

334
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,160
Oh, is that Kongfah’s page?

335
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
Kongfah?

336
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,120
Oh, yeah! I’ve seen Kam watch it before.

337
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,440
Isn't he the guy who livestreams
for dog treatment donations?

338
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,160
Exactly. Kongfah's the one

339
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,440
my mom wired all her money to.

340
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,760
Your mom wired the money
because she loves dogs.

341
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,720
No. My mom was scammed.

342
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,560
- Huh?
- Huh?

343
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,240
Kongfah uses the pity for dogs

344
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,560
to scam money from everyone.

345
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,960
Be careful making accusations
without proof, or you might get sued.

346
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,840
Let him sue me. I’ve seen it myself.

347
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,240
Kongfah keeps posting pictures
of the same dog,

348
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,280
and it never seems to get better.

349
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,360
He does it to keep the donations coming.

350
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,840
I even messaged him asking
for my mom’s money back,

351
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,880
and he blocked me.

352
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,680
He's not a good person.

353
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,840
My mom has been tricked
out of all her money.

354
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,960
We have nothing left,

355
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,120
only debt.

356
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,360
Noy.

357
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,440
I never wanted Non to struggle, Thua.

358
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,000
I really just wanted to help the dogs.

359
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,680
But you helped the dogs a bit too much.

360
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,280
I think you should help your son too.

361
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,520
I know.

362
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,000
I know I shouldn’t
have given him all the money.

363
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,560
But I just feel sorry for the dogs.

364
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,240
Hey, Kongfah,

365
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,880
he livestreams every day
to raise money for them.

366
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,560
That’s why I wanted to help.

367
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,600
And he didn’t trick me, okay?

368
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,280
Non misunderstood.

369
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,680
Kongfah really loves dogs.
He’s a good person.

370
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,240
Then how about this?

371
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,440
Do you want to prove whether Kongfah

372
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,520
is truly a good person?

373
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,480
Of course I do.

374
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,960
Then you have to work with me.

375
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,440
Contact the "Please be generous" page.

376
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,320
They’ll find a way to investigate

377
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,240
if Kongfah's page is really a scam,
like you suspect.

378
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,000
If Kongfah turns out to be a scammer,

379
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,800
I’ll stop donating

380
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,040
and demand every penny back!

381
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,400
Why did you have Non
contact "Please be generous"?

382
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,120
Yeah.

383
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,320
Why are you suddenly giving us work to do?

384
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,280
Because I’m going
to do this work with you.

385
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,120
- Huh?
- Huh?

386
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,600
Well, once we’re done with this task,

387
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,000
we’ll help Granny search
for her son. Right?

388
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,120
Thua's not crazy anymore!

389
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,960
Wow, Typhoon, crazy?
Maybe just one hit would be better.

390
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,360
Be careful.

391
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,000
But why do you suddenly
want to continue with the page?

392
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,960
Since I was born,

393
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,800
the one thing I’ve done best

394
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,400
is the "Please be generous" page.

395
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,480
Then, let’s finish this mission together.

396
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,720
- Yes!
- Yay!

397
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,400
Thua's not crazy!

398
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,680
Thua's not crazy!

399
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,960
I’m thinking of building
new bathrooms for this temple.

400
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,640
The old ones are in bad shape. I feel bad
for the monks and the villagers here.

401
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,160
That’s a great idea, Peem!

402
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,280
But if I do it alone,
it might be too much.

403
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,480
Could I invite Chief Khachon and Ah

404
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,800
to join as co-hosts?

405
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,160
I don’t think there’ll be an issue.

406
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,160
My dad and grandpa
love doing merit-making.

407
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,560
I’ll talk to them about it.

408
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,280
Thank you, sweetheart.

409
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,840
Peem!

410
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,360
How are you doing? Everything good?

411
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,240
I’m doing well.

412
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,960
Are you two friends?

413
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,520
I just watched your livestream recently!
You’re such a good person.

414
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,880
Thank you for always helping the dogs.

415
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,000
You're welcome.

416
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,680
I’m glad Peem and you are friends.

417
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,120
We’ve worked together before.

418
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,800
And I’d still like to work with you, Peem.

419
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,240
How about joining me
on a livestream sometime?

420
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,600
If you join, more people
might want to help the dogs.

421
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,240
That’s a good idea, Peem!

422
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,880
Um…

423
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,200
I’m not comfortable
with livestreaming. I’m sorry.

424
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,720
I’m leaving.

425
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,040
Let’s go, Kam.

426
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,080
Wait, Peem.

427
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,680
Why aren’t you helping Kongfah?

428
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,360
I’ve already told you
I don’t like livestreaming.

429
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,680
But I’ve seen you livestream before
when helping the villagers.

430
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,200
You intentionally avoided Kongfah.

431
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,760
Why?

432
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,160
Okay, fine, I admit it.
I’ve been avoiding him.

433
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,320
But there are people out there
who profit from animals, Kam.

434
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,680
Don’t just believe everything you see.

435
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,880
If you’re saying this, you need proof.

436
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,440
Without it,
it could harm Kongfah’s reputation.

437
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,080
I don’t have any proof, Kam,
but my instincts are telling me something.

438
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,720
Trust me.

439
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,400
You should avoid someone like Kongfah.

440
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,440
- But--
- No buts. We're late.

441
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,160
Let’s discuss the bathroom project
with the monk.

442
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,320
<i>Hello, I'm Kongfah.</i>

443
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,560
<i>Today, we have a case</i>
<i>of a dog hit by a car,</i>

444
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,480
<i>and it's in critical condition.</i>

445
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,440
<i>I would like to ask everyone</i>
<i>to donate as much as possible,</i>

446
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,560
<i>so the dog can recover quickly.</i>

447
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,280
Here's Laab Itthirit
and sticky rice for you.

448
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,920
Thank you! Just put it down.

449
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,080
<i>The dog is in a lot of pain.</i>

450
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,040
<i>The vet said it needs surgery immediately,</i>

451
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,960
<i>but the medical expenses are still short.</i>

452
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,040
<i>Please help this poor dog,</i>

453
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,400
<i>so it can get strong again.</i>

454
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,520
Hey, Kam! Hold on!
Don’t transfer money to him just yet!

455
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,840
Why not?

456
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,240
Don’t tell anyone.

457
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,080
I overheard that
the "Please be generous" webpage

458
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,960
is investigating Kongfah.

459
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,480
There are complaints that

460
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,240
Kongfah doesn't really rescue dogs.
He scams people.

461
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,240
There're people out there
who profit from animals, Kam.

462
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,480
Trust me.

463
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,560
You should avoid someone like Kongfah.

464
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,720
Peem just told me the same thing,
that he’s not trustworthy.

465
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,160
I’ve donated to him so many times already.

466
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,520
Is Kongfah really not a good person?

467
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,680
I don’t think we can say for sure

468
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,400
until we have evidence.

469
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,640
Well, I’ll help look for proof.
I really want to know

470
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,360
what kind of person Kongfah really is.

471
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,080
Hey.

472
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,000
Kam's also suspicious about Kongfah now.

473
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,640
How far have we gotten
with the investigation?

474
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,640
Look, on the page,

475
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,520
he’s reposting the same pictures
and asking for donations frequently,

476
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,680
just like Non said.

477
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,560
Hey! Here, here!

478
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,920
I found a picture of a dog named Tongnun,

479
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,480
the one he said was sick.

480
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,760
It shows up in other pictures too.

481
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,880
Hey! If that’s true,
this is solid evidence. Show me.

482
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,000
Here, Tongnun's here

483
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,360
and also here.

484
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,520
The picture is so blurry.
How can we be sure about this?

485
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,760
Jeez. I told you,

486
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,520
the dogs look so similar.

487
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,200
It might be another dog.

488
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,240
Just checking the page
won’t get us anywhere. I think

489
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,080
we should investigate his house directly.

490
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,720
I’d like to do that too.

491
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,360
But I can’t find
Kongfah’s address anywhere.

492
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,960
I don’t even know
where he lives or what he does.

493
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,520
All we have is his account number
for donations.

494
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
Right.

495
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,880
When I asked Noy,

496
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,000
she said Kongfah always

497
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,480
collects donations outside,
never at his house.

498
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,320
I know now
how we can find Kongfah’s house!

499
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,520
How?

500
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,240
Today, I have a case of a dog
with Alzheimer's

501
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,960
asking for help.

502
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,800
<i>Because the owner</i>
<i>can't afford the medication,</i>

503
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,200
<i>I ask for everyone's help.</i>

504
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,840
The dog is sick, and we need to help.

505
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,480
"I want to help so much.
Can I pay in cash?"

506
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,520
Oh, I prefer bank transfers.

507
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,000
The account number,

508
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,640
it's pinned below.
Feel free to transfer right away.

509
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,600
What should we do now?

510
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,240
I’ll type it out myself.

511
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,640
I’d love to…

512
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,600
"I’d rather meet you in person

513
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,840
since I’ve been a fan for so long.

514
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,360
I don’t want to transfer a million baht."

515
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,160
Then, here's the deal, everyone.

516
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,840
For the survival
of all the dogs in the world,

517
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,880
<i>I’ll go meet Cherdchai myself.</i>

518
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,920
He took the bait.

519
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,840
I'm really happy to meet someone
as kind as you, Cherdchai.

520
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,480
Yes.

521
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,320
I must thank you on behalf
of all the dogs in the world

522
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,920
for being so compassionate.

523
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,280
You're welcome.

524
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,000
Well, if there's nothing else,
may I accept the donation?

525
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,680
I have to go check
on the dogs at the clinic.

526
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,960
Oh, sure!

527
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,040
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

528
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,160
Spirit money?

529
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,760
Right.

530
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,840
Please use it for a memorial offering

531
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,720
to the dogs that have passed away.

532
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,560
Are you messing with me?

533
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,920
What?

534
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,240
Hey, ma'am.

535
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,240
You're here.

536
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,080
I've been looking for you for a while.

537
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,680
Who are you?

538
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,560
I'm the one who takes care of you.

539
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,200
I'm sorry. Has she done anything to you?

540
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,680
Her mind isn’t all there.
She’s a bit forgetful.

541
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:59,400
- Oh my, you're so handsome.
- Hey!

542
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,400
Enough!

543
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,280
How could you let her wander?
It’s a waste of time.

544
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,520
I'm sorry.

545
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,400
- Wow!
- Granny.

546
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,639
He was really angry.
I thought he was going to hit me.

547
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,080
Probably disappointed
that he didn't get any money, Granny.

548
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,679
Should we go check on him?

549
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,960
Let's go!

550
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,320
Hurry up, Granny!

551
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,199
- Huh?
- What’s that smell, Granny?

552
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,800
Oh, it’s probably
the smell of pandanus leaf.

553
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,280
They use it to mask odors.

554
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,240
What does it mask, Granny?
I’m about to throw up!

555
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,720
- Hurry up, we’re going to be late!
- Ugh!

556
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,000
Ugh!

557
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,760
Alright, how about this? Bung, you go home
and rest. We’ll handle things here.

558
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,680
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, it’ll be fine.

559
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,720
Okay, okay. Good luck, everyone!

560
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,600
- Ugh!
- Yeah, good luck. Be careful.

561
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,680
Go now. Go!

562
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,040
Take it easy, dear, okay?

563
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,320
Hey, Bung, is Thua around?

564
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,520
Oh, he's not here.

565
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,040
Hey!

566
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,680
Kongfah's webpage info?

567
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,120
- Oh!
- Huh?

568
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,280
Or is this "Please be generous"'s?

569
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,280
It's Thua's, Kam.

570
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,800
He said that
you were suspicious of Kongfah,

571
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,000
so he tried to gather some information.

572
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,880
So, I'm helping look into it too.

573
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,040
I thought it was the "Please be generous"
team doing the research.

574
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:23,880
Oh, Kam, they’re being all mysterious.
They wouldn’t come here.

575
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,000
You’re right.

576
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,800
By the way, where is everyone else?

577
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,080
They went to catch…

578
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,520
a dog!

579
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,760
Apparently, a dog got loose at the end of
the alley, so they’re helping to catch it.

580
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,600
Got it.

581
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,040
Then, Bung, come with me.

582
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,680
Uh, where to?

583
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,920
To the animal clinic.

584
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,920
Kongfah just posted that
Lucky had to go to the clinic twice.

585
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,480
Let’s go check it out
and see what the truth is.

586
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,120
Uh…

587
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,240
He said he was going to check
on the dog at the clinic.

588
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,920
Why is he back home?

589
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,960
Stop barking! You’re really noisy!

590
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,880
Whoa, he just insulted the dog!

591
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,880
Right!

592
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,720
Does he really love dogs?

593
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,280
- Let’s go investigate.
- How are we going to investigate?

594
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,480
The easiest way is…

595
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,760
Let us do a little search.

596
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,000
Whoa, so many fancy things!

597
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,360
You must be a big spender.
Looks like you're rich.

598
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,600
Stop admiring his wealth

599
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,280
and go find the evidence quickly!

600
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,640
If I stop for too long, I'll start
getting confused and forgetful again.

601
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,960
Let’s separate for now.

602
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,200
Well,

603
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,240
looking around, there doesn't seem
to be anything suspicious,

604
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,360
except he has more money than I thought.

605
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,440
Whoa, Granny! There are pictures of him
helping dogs everywhere!

606
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,520
Let me see.

607
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,440
Yeah, that's right.

608
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,720
Maybe Kongfah is just
a generous guy after all.

609
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,320
Ugh!

610
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,480
Are you okay, Granny?

611
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,080
I don't know. Suddenly,

612
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,720
I feel dizzy and confused.

613
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,080
Ugh!

614
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,800
I think I’ve used too much energy.

615
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,760
Typhoon, tell Thua we have to go now. Go!

616
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,800
Alright, you stay here. I'll go get Thua.

617
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,920
Okay.

618
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,040
Oh no.

619
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,080
Ouch!

620
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,960
There's nothing.

621
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,000
Hurry up!
Thua, Granny can't handle it anymore.

622
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,920
Oh, okay. Let's go.

623
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,680
But we haven't got anything yet. Fine!

624
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,640
Ouch!

625
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,760
What’s this box?

626
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,200
Ugh!

627
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,560
Granny!

628
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,040
Huh? Where’s Thua?

629
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,000
Hey, he's not coming!

630
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,240
Ugh!

631
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,920
Granny, stop using your power right now.

632
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,080
What about Thua?

633
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,160
Granny, don’t worry about him.

634
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,040
If you lose your memory,

635
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,280
how will you find your son?

636
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,320
Stop using your power, please.

637
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,720
Okay, okay, I’ll stop.

638
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,880
"Sending Boonchuay to heaven."

639
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,200
Wait!

640
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,800
This is Boonchuay, the dog with cancer.

641
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,240
DIED ON 02/04/22

642
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,640
It died last year.

643
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,320
Yesterday, he just started
asking for donations.

644
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,920
Wow, this is so clear.
He's really scamming people.

645
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,200
You're getting arrested, Kongfah.

646
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,400
MS. KAM

647
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,400
Why is she calling me? Time's frozen here.

648
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,400
Wait. Time is actually moving now!

649
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,320
Then I’ll expose everything about you,

650
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,840
from the past until now,
and what you've done.

651
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,160
Are you threatening me?

Hit him! Why did you hit me?

- Are you crazy?
- What the hell?
