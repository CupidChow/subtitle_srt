00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,840
<i>Hello. I'm Kongfah.</i>

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,960
<i>Today, we have a case</i>
<i>of a dog hit by a car,</i>

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,160
<i>and it's in critical condition.</i>

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,920
<i>I would like to ask everyone</i>
<i>to donate as much as possible.</i>

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,440
How are you doing? Everything good?

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,360
‪PREVIOUSLY

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,320
I’m doing well.

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,440
Are you two friends?

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,800
I’d still like to work with you, Peem.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,240
How about joining me
on a livestream sometime?

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,960
He's not a good person.

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,160
My mom has been tricked
out of all her money.

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,280
We have nothing left.

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,640
"Please be generous" page
is investigating Kongfah.

15
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,400
I’ll help look for proof.

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,120
Let us do a little search.

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,680
So many fancy things!

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,320
Are you okay, Granny?

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,240
Suddenly, I feel dizzy

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,840
and confused.

21
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,680
It died last year.

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,440
He's really scamming people.

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,880
‪DIED ON 02/04/22

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,400
Stop using your power, please.

25
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,880
Okay, okay, I’ll stop.

26
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,800
You're getting arrested, Kongfah.

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,080
MS. KAM

28
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,320
Why is she calling me? Time's frozen here.

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,560
Wait. Time is actually moving now!

30
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,960
Thua's not picking up.
And he turned off his phone.

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,800
He's probably doing
something important, Kam.

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,280
We don't need to bother Thua.

33
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,600
But this is very important.

34
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,480
We got the evidence that Lucky
recovered after the first treatment.

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,720
But Kongfah's page
is still asking for donations.

36
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,000
He's clearly scamming people.

37
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,600
I'll have Thua tell "Please be generous".

38
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,160
You can just leave a message
in their inbox. It's the same thing.

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,760
How is that the same thing?

40
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,760
Uh, it's the same thing,

41
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,240
as in either you tell Thua

42
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,520
or leave a message in their inbox.

43
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,680
They will be informed all the same.

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,080
You're right. I'll send a message now.

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,880
Okay.

46
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,320
What the hell?

47
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,040
Where are you?

48
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,160
Who's there?

49
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,080
What were you doing?
What took you so long?

50
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,200
I wanted to run, but I couldn't until now.

51
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,200
What about Phoon?

52
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,400
- Guys, let's go!
- Huh?

53
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,200
"Boonchuay died a long time ago.

54
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,600
Lucky's fully recovered.

55
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,920
Kongfah's not rescuing dogs.
He's spending the money on himself.

56
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,560
This is the evidence."

57
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,600
That's what I'm talking about.

58
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,280
Let's leave a like.

59
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,000
Peem,

60
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,720
check out Kongfah's page.

61
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,800
He's exploiting animals
just like you said.

62
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,880
He's exposed now.

63
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,600
<i>Is this true?</i>

64
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,960
<i>Fake hero.</i>

65
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,960
<i>People call him a good guy?</i>
<i>He's clearly a scammer.</i>

66
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,320
<i>What an asshole. Exploiting sick animals.</i>

67
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,560
<i>Give me back my money.</i>

68
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Do you believe me now that he's a fraud?

69
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,720
What do I do now?

70
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,800
Why the hell is Peem not picking up?

71
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,960
Dammit.

72
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,120
- Nutch?
- <i>Yes, it's me.</i>

73
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,840
Have you seen the post?

74
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,280
<i>I have.</i>

75
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,560
<i>I'm calling you about that.</i>

76
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,960
Nutch,

77
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,440
I'm being framed.

78
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,720
<i>Really?</i>

79
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,400
Really.

80
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,560
<i>I figured as much.</i>

81
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,120
<i>Someone like you would never do that.</i>

82
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,160
Thank you very much

83
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,960
for still trusting me.

84
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,320
So, please hurry and contact our people

85
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,120
to help me with something.

86
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,800
<i>Of course. I'll contact everyone for you.</i>

87
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,880
Thank you.

88
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,040
<i>Sure.</i>

89
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,000
<i>Guys, it's completely not true.</i>

90
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,440
<i>I swear.</i>

91
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,280
<i>I've never scammed anyone.</i>

92
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,080
<i>I've never deceived anyone.</i>

93
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,960
<i>Everything I've done</i>
<i>is really to rescue dogs.</i>

94
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,320
<i>Since I started running this page,</i>

95
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,480
<i>I've never spent the money on myself.</i>

96
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,200
Those photos must have been
doctored to frame me.

97
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,040
You guys know

98
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,280
how amazing technology is these days.

99
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,080
There are incredible programs
and awesome AIs.

100
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,800
<i>Fake videos can be made, guys.</i>

101
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,680
<i>But I think I know why this happened.</i>

102
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,600
A few days ago,

103
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,360
"Please be generous" page
sent a message to my inbox.

104
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,960
They asked for a cut
from the donations I'd received.

105
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,520
<i>But I refused because it was wrong.</i>

106
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,360
<i>And I suspect</i>

107
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,720
<i>they hold a grudge.</i>

108
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,240
Impossible. I don't believe that.

109
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,840
We can't jump to conclusions

110
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,800
because we don't know
which side is telling the truth.

111
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,840
<i>I figured you were framed.</i>

112
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,080
<i>Kongfah's a good man.</i>
<i>I believe you. I'm rooting for you.</i>

113
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,720
<i>Who dares framing good people like you?</i>

114
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,880
<i>Let's attack them.</i>

115
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,480
His fans are so gullible.

116
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,720
KONGFAH

117
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,240
"Why don't you verify the evidence
before exposing anyone?"

118
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,560
"How dare you frame Mr. Kongfah?"

119
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,560
"Jealous he's more famous, aren't you?
Wannabes."

120
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,720
- Whoa.
- Hey.

121
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,120
"You're fame parasites.
Don't think I don't know."

122
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,520
"Prepare to be taken to court."

123
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,520
"Keep reporting this page
until it's banned."

124
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,800
- Whoa.
- Hey.

125
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,360
How is this possible? We told the truth.

126
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,960
"Your page is temporarily banned."

127
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,040
The worst of the worst.

128
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,920
<i>What would you like?</i>

129
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,600
One non-spicy pork Laab,

130
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,480
papaya salad with crab,
and two sticky rice.

131
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,760
One non-spicy pork Laab,
one papaya salad with crab,

132
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,000
and two sticky rice.

133
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,600
- A moment, please.
- Yes.

134
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,080
Here's your water.

135
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,520
Hey, have you heard the drama
about "Please be generous" page?

136
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,200
I have.

137
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,200
Framing that dog rescue page, right?

138
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,280
How dare they.

139
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,640
Ugh, they're heroes with super powers,

140
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,440
but in the end, they're jealous.

141
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,720
Even if it was unintentional,

142
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,280
they should have verified first
if the tips were fake.

143
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,920
Their recklessness
tainted a good man's reputation.

144
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,080
They should be called sloppy heroes.

145
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,520
I've had it!

146
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,640
They're not wannabes.

147
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,920
The heroes of "Please be generous"

148
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,880
do everything with good intentions.

149
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,600
How do you know?

150
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,680
You know them?

151
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,440
No.

152
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,400
But if you use
your brains a little, you'll see.

153
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,680
If they're wannabes,
why are they covering their faces?

154
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,520
And if they want money,

155
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,320
let me ask you,
have they ever asked for money?

156
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,120
Even if I wanted to wire them money,

157
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,160
I wouldn't know how because they never
published their bank account number.

158
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,560
What about them asking
for Mr. Kongfah's money?

159
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,040
Kongfah lied.

160
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,320
He accused them without proof.
He could be sued for libel.

161
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,880
What about them accusing Mr. Kongfah?

162
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,680
They had proof.

163
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,920
You guy will see.

164
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,800
So annoying.
I'm not eating here. Let's go.

165
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,640
Ms. Kam.

166
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,440
Oops, I'm sorry.
I chased away your customers.

167
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,920
- Sit down. Please. Here.
- Never mind that. Please.

168
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,120
Sit here.

169
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,240
Today,

170
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,480
your meal's on me.

171
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,920
Oh, you love Laab.

172
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,720
I'll make you one. A moment, please.

173
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,960
Ms. Kam, today is hot.

174
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,920
I'll make you a cold drink.
Wait here for just a second.

175
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,240
Are you sore? I'll give you a massage!

176
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,480
Why are you guys coddling me?

177
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,400
I guess we all have the same goal.

178
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,960
Because we trust the heroes
of "Please be generous" too.

179
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,480
Okay.

180
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,160
Harder.

181
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,520
Want some cold water?

182
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,360
Should I believe it or not?

183
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,280
Enough of this, Mom.

184
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,200
What if he's being framed?

185
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,440
What if Mr. Kongfah really didn't do it?

186
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,640
- Jeez, Mom--
- Hey.

187
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,360
- Are you Non?
- Yes.

188
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,760
Non!

189
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,600
I feel like I'm imposing.

190
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,320
You let me eat for free
and gave me food to feed the staff.

191
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,960
It's the least we can do, Ms. Kam.

192
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,760
Because what you said today

193
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,560
cheered us up so, so, so, so much.

194
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,240
How did I do that? When did I do that?

195
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,800
I didn't say anything about you guys.

196
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,720
When did I cheer you up?

197
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,960
Uh… Well,

198
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,960
when you said that

199
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,000
our Laab was super yummy.

200
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,600
Well, that cheered us up a lot.

201
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,800
You're treating me
to this much food for that?

202
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,960
Help!

203
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,520
He-- Oh, help me!

204
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,000
Non is getting beaten up.

205
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,720
Eh? Why are you telling us?
Call the police!

206
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,440
- Oh, just come on!
- Ms. Kam!

207
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,880
- Hurry!
- Ms. Kam!

208
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,120
Thua. No, not Thua, Phoon.

209
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,400
Phoon!

210
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,440
Over here. Come on. Thua, hurry.

211
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,760
Thua, come on.

212
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,640
Argh! Kam!

213
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,120
I've tried to tell you,

214
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,320
but you didn't listen.

215
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,320
I have poor eyesight.

216
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,800
What about Thua? Where's Thua?

217
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,200
- Where's Thua?
- Ms. Kam!

218
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,320
- How about that?
- Hey! Take this.

219
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,440
Stop!

220
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,600
Non, baby.

221
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,040
- Get up. Come on.
- Hey.

222
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,560
- Come on.
- Who's this?

223
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,200
There are laws in this country.

224
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,720
You can't go around
destroying things and beating up people.

225
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,200
You wanna get a beating too.

226
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,920
Put their stuff back in its place.

227
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,160
Right now!

228
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,720
Fine, you'll be
the first to be put in place.

229
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,400
Phoon, why aren't you here yet?

230
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,080
Relax, bro. Why don't we talk first?

231
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,200
I'm not talking.

232
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,440
He's not here yet?

233
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,960
- Wait a sec.
- You got it.

234
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,000
Why did you hit me?
Why didn't you hit him? Go!

235
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,280
Hit him!

236
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,560
You.

237
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,599
That's twice. Why didn't you hit him?

238
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,440
Why did you hit me? Are you crazy?

239
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,359
What the hell?

240
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,160
"Please be generous"!

241
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,760
If you want more beating, bring it on.

242
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,480
- What do we do?
- Let's run.

243
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,800
Jeez, I thought you guys were brave.

244
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,080
It doesn't hurt anymore.

245
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,200
Wow, thank you very much.

246
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,560
I admire you guys so much.

247
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,120
I always wanted to meet you.

248
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,400
How did you know we were in trouble?

249
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,360
Where are my manners? My name's Kam.

250
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,880
- Eh?
- Eh?

251
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,320
They vanished.

252
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,640
I didn't get to talk to them.

253
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,200
You're right, Ms. Kam. They're so cool.

254
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,800
I didn't get to ask for their autographs.

255
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,080
But someone else
must've needed their help.

256
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,200
- Let's talk to Non first.
- No pain.

257
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,520
Anyway, who were those guys?

258
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,800
Why did they beat you up?

259
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,200
Well, they're our creditors.

260
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,120
I haven't paid them back,

261
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,160
so they destroyed my shop.

262
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,520
Hey, I'm sorry, baby.

263
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,800
It's my fault

264
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,560
for donating all of our money.

265
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,560
Ask for your money back from Kongfah,

266
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,400
so I can settle our debt.

267
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,320
I can't do that.

268
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,000
That money was for dogs.

269
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,360
I can't do that.

270
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,400
Jeez, Mom,

271
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,440
after everything,

272
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,320
you still trust Kongfah?

273
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,120
I think

274
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,560
you should calm down.
Don't fight with each other.

275
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,840
"Please be generous" page
already exposed him.

276
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,440
Why do people still believe him?

277
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,440
<i>I believe in my favorite hero.</i>

278
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,360
<i>Mr. Kongfah sacrifices himself.</i>
<i>No way he's scamming people.</i>

279
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,200
<i>Let's open the books.</i>

280
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,600
<i>Don't listen to those wannabe losers.</i>

281
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,400
<i>I'm rooting for you, Mr. Kongfah.</i>

282
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,640
<i>Please keep rescuing dogs.</i>

283
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,160
<i>We'll support you, Mr. Kongfah.</i>

284
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,280
YOU RECEIVED NEW PAYMENTS

285
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,400
I got people to fight for me.

286
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
And new donations keep coming in.

287
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,000
No one can hurt me.

288
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,120
Eh?

289
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,320
They got their page back?

290
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,760
<i>Hello. Testing.</i>

291
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,480
Stop that. We're not testing.

292
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,960
Start the stream. Hey, and keep your cool.

293
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,800
Shall we?

294
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,800
If this stream doesn't go smoothly,

295
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,120
we apologize in advance.

296
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,680
This is our first time streaming live.

297
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,800
- That's right.
- Yes.

298
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,800
After we exposed Kongfah's
"Let's Help Sick Dogs" page,

299
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,960
our page was reported,
which resulted in a temporary ban.

300
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,320
But we're back with a new set of evidence.

301
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,200
We confirm that everything is true.

302
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,960
We've proved that

303
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,920
the photographic evidence we have

304
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,560
wasn't doctored.

305
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,840
We know that you guys

306
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,840
still trust Kongfah

307
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,400
<i>because he's been doing good deeds.</i>

308
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,160
<i>But today,</i>
<i>here's the other side of the truth</i>

309
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,640
<i>from the people involved. Please, Doctor.</i>

310
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,720
<i>Yes.</i>

311
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,080
I'm the doctor and owner
of the animal clinic mentioned.

312
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,600
I can confirm that Lucky really recovered.

313
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,240
<i>As for the other alleged cases,</i>
<i>they don't exist.</i>

314
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,360
<i>My clinic hasn't received</i>
<i>a single baht from Kongfah.</i>

315
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,840
<i>The authorities are welcome</i>
<i>to verify that at any time.</i>

316
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,280
<i>And these three</i>
<i>standing next to the doctor</i>

317
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,800
<i>are the owners of the dogs</i>
<i>whose photos were misused,</i>

318
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,520
<i>including Pom Pom, Yoshi,</i>

319
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,960
<i>Tang Tang, and Moo Ping.</i>

320
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,040
The dogs are doing fine.

321
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,520
We were unaware of the donations.

322
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,600
The photos may not be clear here.

323
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,520
We'll post all the information
on our page later.

324
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,280
Let me tell you.
We got a lot of information.

325
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,520
<i>More importantly,</i>
<i>the doctor and the dog owners</i>

326
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,920
<i>already pressed charges against Kongfah.</i>

327
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,520
How dare you.

328
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,320
What do I do?

329
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,200
<i>Whoa, the tables turned!</i>

330
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,440
<i>What exactly is going on?</i>

331
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,960
<i>Please clarify!</i>

332
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,880
<i>Catch him, officers!</i>

333
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,880
<i>If you're for real, come out and explain!</i>

334
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,200
- <i>That's right!</i>
- <i>True!</i>

335
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,480
<i>Speak!</i>

336
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,240
NUTCH, FAN

337
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,800
A reporter?

338
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,320
I'm not talking to reporters.

339
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,760
I'm not going on TV either. Bye.

340
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,800
Peem, you must help me.

341
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,720
Why would I?

342
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,840
We're friends, aren't we?

343
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,120
Are you misunderstanding something?
We were never friends.

344
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,480
- Peem!
- Don't contact me again.

345
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,840
You want it this way?

346
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,560
Fine! Then I’ll expose
everything about you,

347
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,400
from the past until now,
and what you've done.

348
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,720
So, people will stop trusting you.

349
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,160
What's this?

350
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,840
The US scholarship exam
is coming up next week

351
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,720
One of these three is expected to win.

352
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,480
Take care of it for me.

353
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,520
Do whatever it takes to make sure
these three don't make it to the exam.

354
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,120
Beat them up or cut their brake lines.

355
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,520
It's up to you.

356
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,200
Your family is filthy rich.

357
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,760
You can fly back and forth
dozens of times.

358
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,840
Why are you interested
in this scholarship exam?

359
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,680
It's about honor.

360
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,760
This scholarship will spruce up my resume.
People like you wouldn't understand.

361
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,480
You're right. I don't.

362
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,920
So, will you do it or not?

363
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,440
Of course I will.

364
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,440
That's all I wanted to hear.

365
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,240
Every time you hired me
to sabotage someone else,

366
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,440
I recorded your voice.

367
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,560
And not just once.

368
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,520
I have a lot more.

369
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,320
Imagine

370
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,800
if those audio files were to leak,

371
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,280
people will find out
you're nothing but a fraud.

372
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,520
And I know you want to be a politician.

373
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,080
You won't want your reputation damaged.

374
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,080
Are you threatening me?

375
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,680
It's just a warning.

376
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,000
Then let me give you a warning too.

377
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,920
I knew since the day I ran into you

378
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
that one day you'd come after me.

379
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,360
So, I had my people follow you

380
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,320
and filmed what you did.

381
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,080
And not just once.

382
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,800
Peem!

383
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,680
Or if videos aren't you thing,

384
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,000
I have plenty of your financial records.

385
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,320
So, don't waste time exposing me.
Think it through…

386
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,280
what you should do.

387
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,400
Why don't we go our separate ways?

388
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,400
Peem!

389
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,840
The attack on Kongfah's web is brutal.

390
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,480
Everyone finally knows the truth.

391
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,800
Oh, right, I have to thank you very much

392
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,880
for giving me the idea to share
the "Please be generous" page.

393
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,680
No big deal.

394
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,720
So, did the dogs and the doctor owners
really press charges?

395
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,120
You mean the doctor and the dog owners?

396
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,800
Yeah, that's it.

397
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,920
They did. I bet they did.

398
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,960
Good. So, the culprit
will finally be brought to justice.

399
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,240
Eh?

400
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,440
I can't access his page anymore.

401
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,480
You're right.

402
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,760
From the looks of it,
he must've closed his page and run away.

403
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,880
So typical. Scamming people,
getting exposed, closing the page, and…

404
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,920
- running away.
- Running away.

405
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,440
I can't stay here anymore.

406
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,280
I have to transfer the money first.

407
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,960
Why can't I transfer it?

408
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,880
Of course you can't.

409
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,760
You're wanted.
The police already seized your accounts.

410
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,040
That's right.

411
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,520
Give yourself up.

412
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,600
No way.

413
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,400
So stubborn. What should we do?

414
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,720
You think you can just run off? Huh?

415
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,600
Oh, he's reversing. Guys!

416
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,240
And…

417
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,760
Boo.

418
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,520
How the hell did I get here?

419
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,760
Who the hell are you?
How did you get here?

420
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,120
Eh? You look familiar.

421
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,240
Kongfah,

422
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,120
the suspect in the dog rescue fraud case.

423
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,640
Let me go, please.

424
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,120
I didn't do it.

425
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,120
PLEASE TAKE OVER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FROM THE HEROES OF "PLEASE BE GENEROUS"

426
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,720
"Please take over. Thank you very much.

427
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,200
From the heroes of 'Please be generous'."

428
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,760
This one is vile.

429
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,320
Truly vile.

430
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,080
<i>This time, the "Please be generous" heroes</i>
<i>opened our eyes to the truth</i>

431
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,240
<i>that Kongfah is, in fact, nothing but</i>

432
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,680
<i>a scammer who exploited poor animals.</i>

433
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,680
<i>This case is a great cautionary tale</i>
<i>that in this day and age,</i>

434
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,160
- <i>donating…</i>
- Without the "Please be generous" heroes,

435
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,880
we would've been fools for much longer.

436
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,320
That's right.
I feel safe with them around.

437
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,000
Jeez, you sang a totally
different tune yesterday.

438
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,120
Who were calling them wannabes?

439
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,680
We misunderstood yesterday.

440
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,360
But our eyes are wide open today.

441
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,320
The heroes of "Please be generous"
are the best!

442
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,280
The most capable! Smart, brave, skilled.

443
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,120
Right, girl?

444
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,560
- The best!
- Come on.

445
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,240
- Let's eat!
- That's enough.

446
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,200
- You two, come on.
- Yes, Granny. Come.

447
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,640
As for you guys,

448
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,760
please make yourself at home.

449
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,600
Enjoy your food. Thank you for coming.

450
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,760
Please enjoy.

451
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,840
- Yes.
- Yes.

452
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,280
‪Phoon, come here.

453
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,600
Even though Kongfah's been arrested,

454
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,600
I doubt his victims
will get their money back

455
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,840
because he spent it all.

456
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,440
Pretty much.

457
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,440
So, Non's still in trouble

458
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,440
because he can't pay his debt.

459
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,640
About that, Kam's on the case.

460
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,920
How?

461
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,680
Thank you very much,
Mr. Peem, for paying off our debt.

462
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,760
From now on, stay away from loan sharks.

463
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,480
I will.

464
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,640
I really had no choice at the time.

465
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,840
But I won't do that again.

466
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,440
And please don't be too charitable, Noy.

467
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,800
Practice moderation with donations.

468
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,320
I've forever learned my lesson, dear.

469
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,440
I won't get you in trouble again, Non.

470
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,880
As for the money,
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

471
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,720
Okay.

472
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,320
Thank you very much, Peem,

473
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,480
for helping Non out as I asked.

474
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,880
I thought you were too busy with work
to pay attention to me.

475
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,320
No way. But this case is an exception.

476
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,520
If you weren't my girlfriend,
I wouldn't have agreed.

477
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,720
Why not?

478
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,240
Kam, I'm not rich enough to help everyone.

479
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,280
I know that.

480
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,560
Please trust me

481
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,240
that everything that you've done
won't be in vain.

482
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,640
How?

483
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,920
When you run for office,

484
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,640
Non and Noy will definitely help
with your campaign.

485
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,760
Trust me.

486
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,920
You think ahead.

487
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,560
Oh, and thank you very much

488
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,520
for warning me about Kongfah.

489
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,800
If you didn't,

490
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,120
I would've wired him a lot of money.

491
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,120
I know that.

492
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,800
And have I told you

493
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,280
I met the heroes
of "Please be generous" in person?

494
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,080
In person?

495
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,520
Yes.

496
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,800
In person.

497
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,840
The real ones.

498
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,400
We were standing only this far apart.

499
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,400
They were so cool, Peem.

500
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,520
I was so excited.

501
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,960
They were super cool.

502
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,520
So satisfying.

503
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,160
About the likes, right?

504
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,200
It's nice and sour. Delicious.
Hurry and peel, Phoon.

505
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,960
Jeez, this is forced child labor.
And you're rushing me.

506
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,600
Who forced you?
You volunteered. Don't lie.

507
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,160
Hey, what's wrong, Phoon? I'll heal it.

508
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,560
Stop peeling. I'll peel the rest myself.

509
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,520
Bung,

510
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,640
from now on, be more careful
if you're going to heal someone.

511
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,120
Yes, Granny.

512
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,560
Why do you look so serious tonight?

513
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,360
I went to the market today.

514
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,520
You have any idea
how people are talking about us?

515
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,720
Hey, guys. I'm now a fan
of "Please be generous".

516
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,040
Me too.

517
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,080
Think about it.

518
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,320
They're helping people
without expecting anything in return.

519
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,840
But it's a shame.

520
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,440
They're doing good deeds.
Why hide their identities?

521
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,640
Duh, heroes don't reveal
their own identities.

522
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,880
But I want to know who they are.

523
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,480
That's a bad idea.

524
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,840
If the bad guys learn
their identities, it'll cause problems.

525
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,200
That's right.

526
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,560
If the bad guys learn their identities,
they'll get back at them.

527
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,080
Their families will be in trouble.

528
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,960
So, we have to be more careful
from now on, right, Granny?

529
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,199
And I think from now on,

530
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,719
we must have our suits
with us at all times.

531
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,880
And for our safety,
don't be careless ever again.

532
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,199
Yes, Granny.

533
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,040
Granny.

534
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,560
Where's the photo
of your son Arm? Can I borrow it?

535
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,920
When you think about it,
"Please be generous" looks familiar.

536
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,840
But I don't know from where.

537
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,440
From the news maybe.

538
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,159
Maybe.

539
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,239
Peem,

540
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,760
I got to help them on this case.

541
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,400
I'm the one
who sent the tips to their inbox.

542
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,920
And I told them
to give the police a lot of evidence

543
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,240
so that Kongfah will be prosecuted.

544
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,560
So, this is how it feels
to defeat bad guys and help good guys.

545
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,680
I want to help them again in the future.

546
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,760
Kam, you shouldn't trust them
completely just yet.

547
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,480
"Please be generous" may be doing all this
in exchange for something.

548
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,200
These people may end up being
just like Kongfah. Who knows.

549
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,440
Jeez, Peem, you're overthinking things.

550
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,120
It's called being careful.

551
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,320
If you want to do good deeds,
come help me work.

552
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,560
You'll get to help people and the public.
Plus, I'm trustworthy.

553
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,960
Even if you didn't ask,
I would've helped anyway.

554
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,960
Don't you worry.

555
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,480
"Missing Person. Someone
has informed us of this missing person.

556
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,560
If any of you have information
about the person in this photo,

557
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,840
or if you've seen him or have leads,

558
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,800
please tell us immediately."

559
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,280
How long have you been here?

560
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,840
Thank you for keeping your promise.

561
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,360
Of course, I keep my promises.

562
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,760
Our page has hundreds
of thousands of followers.

563
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,640
I'm sure we'll get a few leads.

564
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,760
Hundreds of thousands?

565
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:05,080
Ooh. Guys! Come see this!

566
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,760
Thua! Bung! Granny!

567
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,080
Here.

568
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,080
- Look. We've been sent so many leads.
- What?

569
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,080
Whoa. How can there be so many?

570
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,040
"Bang Na. Bang Kruay. Ekkamai.
Chatuchak. Bang Phli."

571
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,480
"Chiang Mai. Nakhon Sawan. Khorat. Phuket.

572
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,440
Nong Bua Lam Phu. Krabi."

573
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,600
Wait.

574
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,120
Arm told me he went to work overseas.

575
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,840
I already checked, Granny.
That job search company doesn't exist.

576
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,360
- Huh?
- And Arm's name wasn't on

577
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,680
any international flights
during that time.

578
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,680
How did you know?

579
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,200
I used our page
to ask the airlines to look for him.

580
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,000
They've been at it for a while.

581
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,360
Awesome. You can do good
when you want to, Thua.

582
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,000
- I'll get you.
- If his name wasn't on them,

583
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:59,200
that means he hasn't left.
Or he did, but illegally.

584
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,120
Or he's still in Thailand.

585
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,760
So, that means we have to check…

586
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,720
Bang Na, Bang Kruay,
Ekkamai, Chatuchak, Bang Phli,

587
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,000
Chiang Mai, Nakhon Sawan, Khorat?

588
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,240
They're just leads.

589
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,880
Some may be true, some may be false.

590
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,600
Granny's temporal power can teleport us.

591
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,680
Locations aren't a problem.

592
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,760
Granny, can you go back in time just a bit
but pick remote locations?

593
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,800
I think I can.

594
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,520
But we must be careful about your memory.

595
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,560
Don't worry.

596
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,600
I won't have Alzheimer's
before I find my son.

597
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,320
Okay then.

598
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,440
So, today, let's go find him. Come on.

599
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,200
- Go! Yeah!
- Yeah!

600
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,520
OYSTER OMELET

601
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,480
All right, guys. Drink some water.

602
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,880
Thank you.

603
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,600
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

604
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,920
Why don't we call it a day?

605
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,720
If you use too much power,
it's going to be a problem.

606
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,560
I'm sorry, Granny, for not finding him.

607
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,240
It's okay.

608
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,200
I believe that
as long as we do it together,

609
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,960
we'll find him one day.

610
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,360
I know it.

611
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,960
Sometimes I miss my mom.

612
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,520
I don't know if she's looking for me
like you're looking for Arm.

613
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,280
And you, Bung?
You don't talk about your family.

614
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,120
Don't you miss them?

615
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,760
Mom?

616
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,440
Bung, what's wrong?

617
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,480
- Eh, Bung? Hey, Bung.
- Bung! Come on.

618
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,000
Eh? Where are you going?

619
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,720
Bung?

620
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,840
Hey, Bung, wait! Bung!

621
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,000
Hey, wait!

622
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,640
- Let go!
- Talk to me.

623
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,200
- Let go, Thua. Let go.
- Bung.

624
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,560
Where are you going?

625
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,040
Wait, Bung! Be careful!

626
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,480
Bung!

627
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,880
Bung!

628
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,440
- Bung.
- My goodness.

629
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,600
Bung, dear.

630
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,600
- How is she?
- Bung?

631
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,320
- Bung, dear. How is she?
- Bung.

632
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,440
- Bung.
- Bung.

633
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,400
<i>Please help me.</i>

634
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,160
<i>Please kill her for me.</i>

635
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,080
She seems questionable, Granny.

636
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,560
Asking us to kill someone?

637
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,120
<i>Thua, I saw someone</i>
<i>bring a gun into a hospital.</i>

638
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,440
<i>It's showtime for "Please be generous".</i>
