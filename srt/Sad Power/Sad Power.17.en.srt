1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,200
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,360
Smile more. Smile widely.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,000
Yeah, Ms. Kam and Thua.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,160
When did they get that close, huh?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,720
It's here, Thua. We got a report
that there are women locked up here.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,760
Did you forget us? I'm sad, you know?

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,840
Well, what are we waiting for? Come on in.

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,840
Mom!

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,320
Ms. Duangjai has run away.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,840
- Run away?
- Run away?

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,440
She didn't mean to run away from you.

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,880
She didn't know it's you who helped her.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,560
She's probably worried about the bills,

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,240
so she ran away.
I've seen a lot of people who did it.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,560
A husband and wife
expecting a child should live together.

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,640
When is your baby due?

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,520
I'm just four months in.

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,440
I don't want to be with my mom anymore.

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,520
Hey, Granny, Typhoon isn't upstairs.

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,000
- Huh?
- Huh?

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,520
Typhoon is missing?

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,000
Or maybe Typhoon was so sad
that he ran away from us?

23
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,800
Oh, come on.

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,160
He's just a kid.
Where would he run off to?

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,040
How would he survive?

26
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,000
No, but I feel like

27
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,120
Typhoon isn’t far from here.

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,680
Maybe he went back home?

29
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,320
- That’s right, Granny.
- Bung.

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,200
Let’s go check on Typhoon at home.

31
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,600
Are you and Kam coming too?

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,840
I think I’ll sit here for a bit
and think things through.

33
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,240
- I’ll stay with him.
- Please take care of him.

34
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,200
I hope Phoon stays at home.

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,560
Do you feel guilty?
Are you blaming yourself right now?

36
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,640
No.

37
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,040
I just try to think that
if I were Typhoon,

38
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,520
where would I go?

39
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,800
- Or…
- Typhoon…

40
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,520
Typhoon.

41
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,280
Hey, don’t.

42
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,000
If it’s not Typhoon,

43
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,240
it could be a criminal
or a dangerous animal.

44
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,000
Did you bring this with you?

45
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,960
Of course. This is my weapon.

46
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,880
Come on.

47
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,960
What is that?

48
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,640
It's gone, Ms. Kam.

49
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,720
Did it really go away?

50
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,040
Yeah, it's really gone.

51
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,440
Who am I? I'm Thua the hero!

52
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,880
You don’t believe me?
I’ll show you the moves.

53
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,360
Jump, kick, hiyah!

54
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,360
You know this, right?

55
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Yeah.

56
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,480
You’re really something.

57
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,000
You still want to play around
at a time like this?

58
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,200
I just want to see you smile.

59
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,240
And…

60
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,200
do you carry a bus ticket
with you everywhere?

61
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,640
Oh, it’s nothing.

62
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,680
Uh…

63
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,560
Hmm?

64
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,920
Uh, it’s just a lucky number for me.

65
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,560
The number ten?

66
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,360
What number is that?
It’s the same as my birthday!

67
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,800
The number…

68
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,960
Number ten…

69
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,160
It’s just a coincidence, right?

70
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,080
So coincidental!

71
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,280
A coincidence, huh?
Then just throw it away.

72
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,640
No, no! Don’t!

73
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,760
Uh…

74
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,560
I like this number.

75
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,560
Like?

76
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,760
What do you like about it?

77
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,880
I… I like your birthday, Ms. Kam.

78
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,520
Huh?

79
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,440
Yeah, every year on your birthday,

80
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,080
Ah takes you to give food
and donations at the orphanage

81
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,960
and at the bus garage.

82
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,280
So, on your birthday,

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,920
I’m really happy.

84
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,400
I…

85
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,280
Be happy?

86
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,080
Oh, right! I just remembered.
The place where there's happiness.

87
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,360
I know now where Typhoon would go.
It must be a place where he's happy.

88
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,840
Let me call Granny first.

89
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,360
Granny. Granny. Wait a second. Okay.

90
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,560
Hello, Granny.
I know where Typhoon is now.

91
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,040
Even though
Mom doesn't want to see me anymore,

92
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,400
I still want to see my mom
and protect her.

93
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,640
Duangjai, you went and told Madam

94
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,320
to call the police
to threaten me, didn’t you?

95
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,480
That's why the police
came around to my place today.

96
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,800
- Oh!
- Hey!

97
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,200
If I were going to tell, I would’ve
told her when you sold me to those people.

98
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,840
Liar!

99
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,280
- Hey, tell me.
- Ouch.

100
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,200
- Ouch.
- Stop right now!

101
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,680
What crazy kid is this?
What are you going to do?

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,400
If you think about hurting her,

103
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,280
you're gonna regret it.

104
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,760
Fine, fine, I'm leaving.

105
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,440
Kid.

106
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,480
Why do you look like…

107
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,120
Typhoon! Ouch.

108
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,880
- Ow.
- Hey, Duangjai!

109
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,640
Duangjai, what's wrong?

110
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,960
Ma'am!

111
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,160
I feel like I saw my son.

112
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,120
How can that be?
You’re the one who told me

113
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,480
that your husband took your son to Phuket.

114
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,120
Well…

115
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,240
Yes, or maybe I just miss my son too much.

116
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,080
Hey, Duangjai,
you want to find your son, right?

117
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,600
Should I help you look for him?

118
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,560
Don’t stay with that man.
I know what you're going through.

119
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,200
I can't leave, ma'am. If I run away,

120
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,000
my husband will hurt Typhoon.

121
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,040
He’s the only one
who knows where Typhoon is.

122
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,240
Is that why you can't leave him?

123
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,800
You're afraid
you’ll never see your son again.

124
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,280
Duangjai, poor you…

125
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,520
Mom!

126
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,240
Everyone…

127
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,760
I've stopped time.

128
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,600
I’m sorry for running away
without telling everyone.

129
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,640
If you're not around,
how will Thua, Kam, Bung and I manage?

130
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,240
I just missed my mom.

131
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,000
You did one thing wrong, Phoon.

132
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,160
You didn't tell us.

133
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,400
But in a way, this turned out well.

134
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,800
Now we know that your mom
didn’t want to leave you.

135
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,000
But she was tricked by your stepfather.
This means you can go back to her.

136
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,600
No, I can’t. I asked for power
to protect my mom,

137
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,600
but if my stepfather is still around,
I won’t be able to protect her.

138
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,080
He even went as far as selling her.

139
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,200
He probably thinks
he can do anything to her.

140
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,760
Then we need to find a way
to deal with your stepfather.

141
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,280
That’s right. We need to take action.

142
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,800
- I have an idea!
- What?

143
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,360
What?

144
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,680
I saw a post from Dr. Korn’s page,

145
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,320
saying he takes requests
to visit and treat patients.

146
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,760
We can invite him
to the worker camp to do a health check.

147
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,640
I’ll volunteer to help

148
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,080
and get Phoon's mom's medical report
as evidence

149
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,760
that she’s been abused.

150
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,000
Oh! If we hold it at the camp,
Phoon's stepfather will come with her.

151
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,160
Then we can install cameras
in the lodging area.

152
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,440
Then we'll get the evidence to catch him.

153
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,200
I got it! Hurry up!

154
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,920
The cameras are all set up.

155
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,320
Are we really going
to let Typhoon's mom be hurt?

156
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,720
Not anymore. I'll stay here.

157
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,000
If he tries to hurt my mom,

158
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,600
I'll protect her myself.

159
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,440
We have to thank Phakbung's plan.

160
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,440
This time, your stepfather won't get away.

161

MOBILE VOLUNTEER MEDICAL HEALTH
CHECK-UP PROJECT

162
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,520
Thank you so much, Doctor,
for letting me and Granny help.

163
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,320
It's actually me who should thank you two.

164
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,240
Uh, yes.

165
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,960
Uh, so now, we're more
than just doctor and patient, right?

166
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,760
Uh…

167
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,200
Yes. We're friends.

168
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,720
Oh, yes.

169
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,520
Yes!

170
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,920
We're friends.

171
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,120
Where's Typhoon?

172
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,960
Why the hell are you crying so much?

173
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,400
It's annoying! Come here! Get up!

174
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,360
Get up!

175
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,280
I told you to be quiet.
You better shut up! Will you shut up?

176
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,720
Stop!

177
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,680
Typhoon!

178
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,040
So, it's you.

179
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,000
A crazy kid!

180
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,040
You want to die or what?

181
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,960
Huh? What the hell! Huh?

182
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,720
You want to die?

183
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,400
Don't! Don't hurt my son!

184
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,920
- You want to die, huh? Huh?
- No!

185
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,040
- Stop!
- No!

186
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,560
- This is the police! Put the gun down!
- Put the gun down!

187
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,800
Yes!

188
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,840
- Don't shoot me!
- Hands behind your back!

189
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,240
- Hands behind your back!
- Yes, sir!

190
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,440
Typhoon! Is that you, my child?

191
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,920
Typhoon!

192
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,440
Don't leave me again, my child.

193
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,920
My only wish would be to see you again

194
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,880
Don't leave me again, my child.

195
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,440
Go!

196
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,560
Duang, don’t forget to visit me, okay?

197
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,200
- Help bail me out.
- Walk.

198
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,680
Typhoon, I love you, my child.

199
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,400
The evidence from the cameras

200
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,120
is pretty clear.

201
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,240
But still, we may need you, Duangjai,
to give a statement at the station.

202
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,280
You’re safe now.

203
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,920
My department
will take care of everything.

204
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,560
Duangjai, you and your child
can go to our shelter.

205
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,080
After that, we’ll take care of everything,
including your health

206
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,200
and living arrangements.

207
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,960
You have me, Mom.
You don’t need to be afraid anymore.

208
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,560
Shall we go now?

209
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,360
Go, Phoon.

210
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,400
You've been waiting long, right?

211
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,560
Thank you, everyone.

212
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,880
- Thank you for taking care of my child.
- Oh, it's nothing.

213
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,440
Never thought today would come this fast.

214
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,360
But it’s a good day.

215
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,840
A day when Typhoon
won’t be abandoned anymore.

216
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,400
Let’s make sure
it becomes a truly good day.

217
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,960
Hey, that’s a great idea! It’s perfect!

218
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,120
Did everyone do this for me?

219
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Of course,
it’s a farewell party for our family!

220
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,640
You’re all more than family to me.
You’re my heroes.

221
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,480
At the shelter, they’ll help
take care of me and my mom

222
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,360
and also find us a place to stay.

223
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,560
Typhoon, you finally completed
your mission, huh?

224
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,800
- Great job!
- This calls…

225
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,320
Hello, Mom.

226
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,880
I’ll hurry over now.

227
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,480
It’s really time for me to leave now.

228
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,280
Go well, my dear.

229
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,480
Don’t forget to drink milk!

230
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,040
- Don’t stay up too late, Typhoon.
- Okay.

231
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,600
He's really going now, right?

232
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,320
Phoon must be so happy to be with his mom.

233
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,800
Granny.

234
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,440
I haven’t forgotten
the promise I made to you.

235
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,440
And now, I think it’s time.

236
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,560
Everyone.

237
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,000
Let’s help Granny
search for her son, okay?

238
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,720
Come on. Let’s power up together!

239
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,600
What to say?
"Please be generous", let’s go!

240
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,280
Granny.

241
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,080
Granny, are you overthinking?
I’ll stay and sleep with you.

242
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,760
Oh.

243
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,080
She's not in the kitchen.

244
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,080
She's not in the bathroom either.
She didn’t even take her phone.

245
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,920
Where did she go?

246
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,840
Granny.

247
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,960
- Granny.
- What?

248
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,840
So, you’re here!

249
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,160
Why didn’t you tell anyone
where you were going?

250
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,360
Granny.

251
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,600
We have

252
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,720
some important news to tell you.

253
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,560
Granny, your son…

254
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,200
is dead.

255
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:08,160
No!

256
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,400
No!

257
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,880
- Granny!
- Granny!

258
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,400
Are you okay? Granny!

259
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,800
Granny.

260
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,920
- What’s going on?
- Arm…

261
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,840
- Arm is dead, Thua!
- Huh?

262
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,160
Wait. How do you know this?

263
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,640
Well,

264
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,080
you two just came and told me.

265
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,000
Granny! I just found you.

266
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,600
I’ve been looking everywhere for you.

267
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,920
- Yeah, I heard you and ran here.
- Right.

268
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,080
Okay.

269
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,880
Oh, if that’s the case,
I must have just dreamed it.

270
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:06,360
You must have been stressed.
We haven’t heard about Arm yet.

271
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,560
Granny, don’t think of anything bad.

272
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,360
Tomorrow, we’ll help you
search for your son.

273
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,160
Let’s rest for tonight.

274
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,040
And take it easy.

275
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,280
Tonight, Thua and I will sleep with you,
so you won’t be lonely.

276
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,200
Come on. Let’s go to bed.

277
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,160
- Let's go.
- Come on.

278
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,960
- Granny.
- Huh?

279
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,200
What is Arm like as a person?

280
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,120
Arm?

281
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,960
He's a stubborn child.

282
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,920
Oh, Arm!

283
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,520
You're sick. Why aren't you resting?
You're still going to work?

284
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,120
I'm fine, Mom. I can work.

285
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,600
Oh my, you still have a fever,
and you're saying you're fine?

286
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,520
Just rest, dear.

287
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,000
If I don't go, I won't make money, Mom.

288
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,000
Can’t you take a break
from making money for just one day?

289
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,160
No, I don’t want to, Mom.
Being sick like this is nothing.

290
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,160
Don’t worry about me.

291
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,600
I’m tougher than a buffalo.

292
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,760
Look!

293
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,640
I'm leaving.

294
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,800
My son is really stubborn, isn't he?

295
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,720
If he were just a little less headstrong,

296
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,080
he wouldn't have insisted
on going abroad to work.

297
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,840
But honestly…

298
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,600
it's my fault.

299
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,680
I was such a burden

300
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,840
that Arm felt the need to struggle
to earn money to take care of me.

301
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,720
Granny, you and Arm
didn’t do anything wrong.

302
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,760
The ones to blame are those
human trafficking gangs.

303
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,520
That’s right.
Don’t blame yourself, Granny.

304
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,720
I can’t help but blame myself.

305
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,960
If only I’d been more decisive

306
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,240
and stronger that day,

307
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,600
I could have stopped Arm
from going to work overseas.

308
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,520
By now,

309
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,960
the two of us, mother and son,
could have been together.

310
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
As a mother,

311
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,480
all I want is to see my child happy,

312
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,240
living a good,

313
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,360
safe life.

314
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,520
Not disappearing

315
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,040
without a trace, like this.

316
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,160
Just thinking about

317
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,120
whether my son is alive or dead…

318
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,880
As a mother, it’s like dying inside.

319
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,440
It’s okay, Granny.

320
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,040
- We’ll help you find Arm.
- Um…

321
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,200
Thank you, dear.

322
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,160
Granny.

323
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,040
If you don’t eat,
you’re going to get sick.

324
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,160
I really can't eat, Thua.

325
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,840
Do all mothers feel the same as her

326
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,600
if they find out their child is missing?

327
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,160
No.

328
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,160
Not everyone’s lucky, you know?

329
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,520
You hear in the news
about mothers abandoning their kids,

330
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,320
even running away after giving birth.

331
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,920
Those with mothers like Granny
are actually the lucky ones.

332
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,680
Yes, Ms. Kam?

333
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,800
There’s an update
on the human trafficking gang.

334
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,400
Huh? An update
on the human trafficking gang?

335
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,080
Hold on. Granny!
There’s news about the gang.

336
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,600
What is it, Ms. Kam?

337
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,360
They say this gang
has lured in many female victims.

338
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,760
Wait, but Arm is a man.

339
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,040
Could it be a different gang?

340
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,520
Or maybe the gang has just shifted
its target to women?

341
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,600
That’s possible.

342
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,840
Many on the page
reported women close to them missing.

343
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,520
Let’s investigate it. I’ll come over
so we can have a meeting about it.

344
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,280
Okay.

345
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,200
Is anyone outside?

346
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,440
Dad, are you out there?
Open the door for me, please.

347
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,480
Why would I let you out to see Thua, huh?

348
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,640
Did you lock me in, Dad?

349
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,920
Let me out right now! I have something
important to discuss with him.

350
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,680
What could possibly be so important
that you need to go see him?

351
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,280
I can’t explain.

352
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,600
But it’s something crucial for humanity.

353
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,160
Seng, call an ambulance right now.

354
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,400
Uh, who’s hurt?

355
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,600
It's my daughter!

356
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,400
Take her to get her brain checked.
She’s been acting weird lately.

357
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,960
Are you saying I’m crazy, Dad?

358
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,120
What normal person talks
about humanity like that?

359
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,320
You must’ve picked up
this nonsense from Thua.

360
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,840
Either way, I’m not letting you out.

361
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,320
Dictator!

362
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,320
Thua.

363
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,400
Stop pacing, please.
You’re making me dizzy.

364
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,960
I’m just worried about Ms. Kam.

365
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,520
She said she'd be here by now, but she
is not and isn’t answering my calls.

366
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,280
Maybe she's annoyed with you.

367
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,120
Wow, Bung, why would you
say something so hurtful?

368
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,960
Oh, she's probably just caught up
with something.

369
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,400
- Calm down.
- Yeah, sit down.

370
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,520
Oh.

371
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
It’s all quiet now.

372
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,640
Maybe she really hates you.
Aren’t you going to make up with her?

373
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,280
If she hates me, so be it.

374
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,800
One day, she will understand

375
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,680
that I meant well.

376
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,480
Kam.

377
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,200
Don’t stay silent like this. Kam!

378
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,880
Kam, are you mad at me?

379
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,960
I’m coming in now. Kam!

380
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,480
I’m opening the door.

381
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,840
Kam? Where is she?

382
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,280
Huh?

383
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,000
Oh, she’s run off.

384
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,080
Kam!

385
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,720
Ms. Kam!

386
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,320
Sorry for making you all wait.

387
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,600
Ms. Kam, what have you been doing? Why…

388
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,840
I ran away from someone
with bad intentions.

389
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,800
Who’s talking behind my back?

390
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,400
Who dared to do that to you?

391
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,719
Tell me now! Give me the name, quick!

392
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,760
You can't handle this person.

393
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,719
Never mind.
Let’s just continue the meeting. Come on.

394
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,360
Why?

395
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,520
Why did Kam run away from me like this?

396
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,880
Why?

397
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,160
Hey! Boss.

398
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,600
She left you a letter.

399
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:14,000
"Dad, if you go after me to Thua’s house,

400
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,720
I'll really run away from you for good."

401
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,120
Accept it, boss.

402
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,240
She’s not attached to you.
She’s more attached to that guy.

403
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,320
I won’t give up!

404
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,760
I’m going to separate Kam from Thua,
no matter what.

405
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,680
But she’s really stuck to him.

406
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,680
I asked about
the human trafficking gang on the page,

407
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,640
and lots of people liked and shared it.
We’ll get new info soon.

408
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,040
Dear.

409
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,720
Dear.

410
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,120
Do you know the page "Please be generous"?

411
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,320
My friend said they’ve helped many people,

412
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,520
and right now, they’re assisting victims

413
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,320
of a human trafficking gang
tricked into forced labor.

414
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,280
I’m already stressed out
with my own child.

415
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,360
I don’t have time to focus on others.

416
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,080
But this might be related
to our child’s case.

417
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,160
Are you saying that the detective
couldn’t find Bung

418
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,200
because she was tricked by this gang?

419
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,360
It’s possible.

420
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,840
Should we ask this page
to help look for her?

421
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,760
Wow!

422
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,480
- So many messages coming in!
- Right.

423
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,320
They’re from parents looking
for their missing kids.

424
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,240
Hey!

425
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,960
What is it, Thua?
Did you find any leads on Arm?

426
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,120
Uh, no, but…

427
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,080
I found Bung.

428
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,360
"My daughter is missing.
Please help find her.

429
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,880
Her name is Phakbung,
Chatthida Barameevicha."

430
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,400
Don’t you tell her I’m here.

431
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,760
But your mom wants to see you.

432
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:24,040
I don’t want to see her.
And don’t reply to my mom’s messages.

433
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,680
Or I'll run away from here,
and no one will ever find me again.

434
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,280
Bung!

435
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,320
Please, try to understand.

436
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,200
I’m a mother too.

437
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,720
I know how painful it is
when my child is missing.

438
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,080
Why don’t you think about
how your mother feels, my dear?

439
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,200
I do care about how Mom feels, Granny.

440
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,680
That’s why I don’t want to go back.

441
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,360
Look at my belly.

442
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,360
I can’t go back to her like this.

443
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,640
She can’t accept it.

444
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,480
- Okay. Bye-bye. Drive carefully.
- See you.

445
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,120
I told you.

446
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,520
This is not the time for a boyfriend.
Your studies will suffer.

447
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,320
It’s not like that, Mom.

448
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,800
My boyfriend is smart too,
and we help each other study.

449
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,560
I’m sure he’ll help you
with other things too.

450
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,760
Have I ever disappointed you, Mom?

451
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,440
I was always class president,

452
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,120
student council president.
I’ve been top in my studies,

453
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,520
and I’ll get into university.

454
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,240
You don’t have to worry about me.

455
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,120
And I won’t let any guy fool me.

456
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,320
Don’t let it happen, Bung.

457
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,040
If your grades drop
because of a boyfriend, I won’t allow it.

458
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,080
Even if my grades drop
because of a boyfriend,

459
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,800
she wouldn't allow it.

460
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,000
If she knew I was pregnant,

461
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,440
she'd be shocked.

462
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,040
Uh, it’s okay. Don’t worry.
About the pregnancy,

463
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,240
I’ll talk to your mom.

464
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,920
If it were that easy,
I would’ve gone back long ago, Granny.

465
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,680
But I know what’ll happen if I do.

466
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,920
I know how disappointed Mom would be

467
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,120
when she sees me like this.

468
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,520
That’s why I can’t go back.

469
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,600
Excuse me. May I ask you something? Bung!

470

‪NEXT EPISODE

471
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,720
My mom came here
and found out that I’m pregnant.

472
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,560
- Huh?
- Here’s a picture of our daughter.

473
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,040
My wife suspects
they’ve made her pregnant too.

474
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,200
We’re looking for this girl.
Please open the door.

475
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,640
This cloth is the same as what
the "Please be generous" gang uses.

476
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,840
There is a kid, a pregnant woman,
and an elderly person.

477
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,200
Why didn’t I notice?
