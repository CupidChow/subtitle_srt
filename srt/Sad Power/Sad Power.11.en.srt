1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,440
I'm pregnant.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,680
Huh?

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,360
Who's pregnant?

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,520
My friend is, Mom.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,080
Don't hang out with friends like that.

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,720
<i>They'll drag you down.</i>

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,360
PREVIOUSLY

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,800
I got a scholarship to study
at a university in Chiang Mai!

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,440
That's amazing!

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,680
I'm so proud of you!

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,200
<i>If my mom finds out I lied</i>

12
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,440
<i>about getting into</i>
<i>a Chiang Mai university,</i>

13
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,640
<i>she won't stand it.</i>

14
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,160
If we're going to live together,
we need to work together.

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,080
What do you want us to do?

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,600
Open a Laab restaurant.

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,040
My Laab,

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,520
it's so delicious,
at the level of Shell Chuan Chim.

19
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,680
But! In return, Thua,

20
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,240
you'll have to help me find my child.

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
Deal, Granny!

22
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,320
That job search company doesn't exist.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,320
And Arm's name wasn't

24
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,160
on any international flights
during that time.

25
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,560
If his name wasn't on them,

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,440
that means he hasn't left.

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,800
So, today,

28
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,560
let's go find him. Come on.

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
Go!

30
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,320
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

31
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,640
Mom?

32
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,760
- Eh, Bung?
- Bung!

33
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,080
- Hey, Bung.
- Bung!

34
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,240
Where are you going?

35
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,400
Wait, Bung! Be careful!

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
Bung!

37
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,920
PREVIOUSLY

38
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,600
- Bung, dear.
- Bung?

39
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,520
- Bung?
- Bung?

40
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,640
She's with doctors now.

41
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,560
Bung's going to be okay. Don't worry.

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,960
It's not just Bung.

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,800
"It's not just Bung"? Who else?

44
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,240
Ms. Chatthida Barameevicha's relatives,
please come in.

45
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,160
Granny, come on. They need us.

46
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,880
- Let's go.
- Wait.

47
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,160
If it's not just Bung, then who else?
Tell me.

48
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,680
- No one.
- Speaking in a high-pitched voice?

49
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,840
Oh!

50
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,960
Bung… Uh, Ms. Kam,

51
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,520
Bung took a hard fall.

52
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
She's probably going to be admitted.

53
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,760
- Yes.
- So, would you mind--

54
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,800
Of course.

55
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,960
I'll stay. I want to know
what's wrong with her.

56
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,160
Would you mind buying
women stuff that she'll need?

57
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,360
Because we can't go right now.

58
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,720
You can come visit her tomorrow.

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,240
You got it.

60
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,400
- Thank you.
- Sure.

61
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,640
I almost slipped, guys.

62
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,840
Slipped what?

63
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,880
Slipped that Bung's pregnant.

64
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,440
Huh? Phakbung's pregnant?

65
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,680
- Ms. Kam.
- Ms. Kam.

66
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,240
Oh, you're awake.

67
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,560
How are you feeling?

68
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,840
- Granny.
- Yeah.

69
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,920
Thua.

70
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560
Typhoon.

71
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,720
The baby. My baby.

72
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,760
- Oh.
- Right.

73
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,520
The doctor said

74
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,520
you were exhausted,
so you fainted and fell.

75
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,880
But don't worry.

76
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,440
Both you and the baby are fine.

77
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,080
That's right.

78
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,520
Hey, don't try to get up. Lie down.

79
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,680
Since we're fine, I'm going home.

80
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,600
The doctor said you must rest,

81
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,080
get an IV fluid,

82
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,040
and start your prenatal care.

83
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,960
I'm okay, Granny.

84
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,240
I can take care of myself. I'm going home.

85
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,920
Jeez, Bung.

86
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,280
Look. Look at her. Look.

87
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,960
Get her to lie down
and tie her to the bed.

88
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,160
So stubborn.

89
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,040
Let's do it.

90
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,560
Hey. What's this?

91
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,240
This is bullying.

92
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,160
We agreed to use the powers
only when it's necessary.

93
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,640
This is the moment

94
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
the power matters the most.

95
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,880
What power, Ms. Kam?

96
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,160
The maternal power

97
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,760
to be brave for your child.

98
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,000
How did you know?

99
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,960
Wait here for a sec. I'll submit this.

100
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,040
Aren't you going to ask me?

101
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,360
You want me to ask them
for some self-care tips?

102
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,560
Sure. I never took care
of pregnant women. I'm curious too.

103
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,240
No. I mean…

104
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,000
Aren't you going to ask me
about my pregnancy?

105
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,600
If I'm going to ask,

106
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,240
my question would just be
if you wanted my help.

107
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,880
I grew up with a single dad.
I know it's hard.

108
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,680
If you ever need my help,

109
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,920
just tell me. I'm super ready to help you.

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,600
Thank you very much, Kam.

111
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,480
I'm going to submit this.

112
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,000
- Well?
- So relieved.

113
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,840
- Yes.
- I can eat a lot more.

114
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,400
You're such an eater.

115
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,960
Excuse me.

116
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,240
- Yes?
- You dropped your wallet.

117
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,560
Oh, yes.

118
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,120
It's really mine.

119
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,640
Thank you very much.

120
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,040
When did I drop it?

121
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,840
Thank you very much.

122
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,560
Is this your daughter?

123
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,720
Hey.

124
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,560
You're adorable.

125
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,200
My daughter is afraid of strangers.

126
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,200
Sure.

127
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,120
Be nice, baby.

128
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,640
- So, we're going.
- Okay.

129
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,080
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

130
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,320
Let's go. I said go.

131
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,240
That's strange.

132
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,560
How is that strange, Granny?

133
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,280
She's so cute.

134
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,920
Stop daydreaming.

135
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,400
Let's go see Bung.
She's probably done with the doctor.

136
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,000
Let's go wait for her.

137
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,000
Wrong direction again.

138
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,760
Ms. Chatthida Barameevicha.

139
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,320
Eighteen years old. Is that correct?

140
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,960
- The father's name is…
- No father.

141
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,520
- If that's the case--
- Then what?

142
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,000
If having one doesn't help,
isn't it better to do it alone?

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,560
I can take care of my baby.

144
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,440
That's good.

145
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,680
You have to take good care
of yourself and your baby like you say.

146
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,920
Because this fall

147
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,280
indicates that you didn't get enough rest.

148
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,360
I thought you'd criticize me.

149
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,080
Neither I nor anyone

150
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,320
has the right to judge you.

151
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,720
But the only thing I will tell you

152
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,760
is you must take good care of yourself

153
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,280
and get a lot of rest.

154
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,280
So your baby will come out healthy.

155
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,440
At your next appointment,

156
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,160
if you're still not healthy,

157
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,920
I will judge you.

158
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,760
Don't be mad at me if I admit you.

159
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,520
Wait here for the medications.

160
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,560
Thank you very much, Ms. Kam.

161
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,400
You've been very helpful.

162
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,240
You're very welcome.
You guys are like my family.

163
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,040
Yay!

164
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,080
I always wanted to have
a nice sister like you, Kam.

165
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,840
Be careful. How am I not nice?

166
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,360
Number 4578, please.

167
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,960
Bung,

168
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,080
can you tell us now

169
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,600
what you were running from when you fell?

170
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,280
Or…

171
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,160
do you still not see us as your family?

172
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,840
Please give me some time.

173
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,360
It's still too hard for me right now.

174
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,360
I got the medications. Let's go.

175
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,560
Let's go.

176
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,360
Be careful.

177
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,560
Honey, you must stay healthy,

178
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,520
so we can keep looking for Phakbung.

179
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,920
<i>Please help me.</i>

180
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,800
<i>Please kill her for me.</i>

181
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,920
<i>If you don't help me,</i>

182
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,480
<i>I will kill her myself.</i>

183
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,040
Granny, you brought this
for the wrong person.

184
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,680
Typhoon's over there.

185
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,800
I got it right.

186
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,560
This house has more than one kid.

187
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,040
I brought it for my grandchild.

188
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,400
Thank you, Granny.

189
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,720
Hey, Granny,

190
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,320
I'm applying to join Facebook group chats

191
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,840
for Thai people overseas

192
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,320
in case your son
emigrated later by himself.

193
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,880
Thua and Phoon are out there following up

194
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,120
on the leads our fans sent us.

195
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,840
Am I troubling everyone?

196
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,920
Granny,

197
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,120
we already agreed

198
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,840
that we'd be a family.

199
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,600
Anyway, has anyone sent us anything else?

200
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,960
Why didn't you reply to her?

201
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,400
She seems questionable, Granny.

202
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,920
Asking us to kill someone?

203
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,000
This is

204
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,240
my prenatal care doctor.

205
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
"Since your page

206
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,320
has a large number of followers,

207
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,240
I was wondering if you would mind
advertising a program

208
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,280
to educate teen moms."

209
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,480
He's serious about that.

210
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,520
He seems like a good person.

211
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Peem?

212
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,600
I'm at a restaurant near your office.

213
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,240
Want to have lunch with me?

214
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,760
Tied up with work?

215
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,280
It's okay.

216
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,640
PLEASE BE GENEROUS
INFORMATION FOR TEEN MOMS

217
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,000
"Information for teen moms.

218
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,040
Becoming a pro at a hospital."

219
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,560
"Hospital needs volunteers today."

220
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,760
Oh, yes. I'm going.

221
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,760
Is that a gun?

222
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,480
Peem. I have to tell Peem.

223
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,320
But he's busy.

224
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,440
Thua!

225
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,000
ID CARDS - REGISTRY

226
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,840
Yes, Ms. Kam?

227
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,960
Thua,

228
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,880
I saw someone bring a gun into a hospital.

229
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,440
I think she's looking for someone.

230
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,240
Call the police for me.

231
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,800
I'm going to keep taking photos.

232
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,400
And if she leaves,
I'll share her location.

233
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,200
Coordinate for me.

234
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,440
Ms. Kam,

235
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,400
I don't think you should follow her.

236
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,920
Tell the security guard.

237
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,280
I can't do that.

238
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,320
If she leaves and we lose her,
it's going to be bad.

239
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,800
I have to go. Do it.

240
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,520
Uh, wait!

241
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,400
- We have to go, Phoon.
- Helping Kam, right?

242
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,040
It's showtime for "Please be generous".

243
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,320
I'm telling you Laab restaurant's Thua
can't handle this one.

244
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,440
So fast. Where did you get it?

245
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,360
Duh. I brought it from home.

246
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,000
- Shall we go then? Let's go.
- Let's go.

247
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,680
- Granny!
- Huh?

248
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,040
- Granny!
- What?

249
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,360
Kam's in trouble. Let's go help her.

250
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,520
Wait. Let me turn off the stove.

251
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,640
- Let's go.
- Come.

252
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,400
Excuse me.

253
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,319
Excuse me.

254
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,360
Miss.

255
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,160
Have you seen this woman?

256
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,120
She's my younger sister.

257
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,320
Her phone battery died,
so we can't find each other.

258
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,920
This woman.

259
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,040
I saw her go down
to the parking lot over there.

260
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,320
Excuse me.

261
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,960
Have you seen this woman?

262
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,680
She was just asking
for her younger sister.

263
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,640
Younger sister?

264
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,480
Do you know where she is right now?

265
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,600
Probably the parking lot.

266
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,360
The parking lot? Thank you.

267
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,120
NURSE STATION

268
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,720
Hey, are you okay?

269
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,720
I'm okay.

270
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,600
How did "Please be generous" get here?

271
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,800
Don't ask questions. Let's follow her.

272
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,880
Come on.

273
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,960
Stop!

274
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,880
What the hell are you doing?

275
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
This will be the most justifying thing

276
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,800
I will ever do.

277
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,440
- Die!
- Stop! You're going to kill her!

278
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,560
Hey, wait!

279
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,280
Let go! I'm going to kill her!

280
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,640
- No!
- Don't shoot!

281
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,560
No!

282
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,520
Let me go!

283
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,680
There! Gun!

284
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,600
Get it!

285
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
Please calm down.

286
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,320
Let me go!

287
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Don't pretend to be heroes.

288
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,040
If you people are real heroes,

289
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,000
you wouldn't have ignored my request.

290
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,000
Request?

291
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,800
What request?

292
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,240
You people are fake heroes.

293
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,800
How could you do this to me?

294
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Did you know

295
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,440
my kid's life's is a living hell?

296
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,000
I have to kill her.

297
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,840
I'm going to kill her.

298
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,120
Hey,

299
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,040
but if you kill her, you'll go to jail.

300
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,640
What about the people you love?
How will they live?

301
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,600
Granny,

302
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,440
this woman…

303
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,840
What?

304
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,960
Hey. Guys.

305
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,680
I see.

306
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,600
You stopped time because this has
something to do with our page, right?

307
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,120
Yes. This woman

308
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,760
sent us a message,
asking us to kill someone.

309
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,040
I believe there's more to this
than meets the eye.

310
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,840
How will we find out the truth, Granny?

311
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,760
Either way,

312
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,760
we have to take her away for now

313
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,280
because the only people
who are aware and saw her face

314
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,320
are Ms. Kam and the other woman.

315
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,320
The,n let me deal with Ms. Kam.

316
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,600
All right.

317
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,440
Eh?

318
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,680
Miss? I think I heard a gunshot.

319
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,360
That's right. Well, just now…

320
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,760
Ms. Kam!

321
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,920
Ms. Kam, are you okay?

322
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,960
Jeez, Ms. Kam, that was very dangerous.

323
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,480
Yes.

324
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,760
And "Please be generous"
showed up all of a sudden.

325
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,640
And then they were gone
along with that woman.

326
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,680
But for me, I'm just glad you're safe.

327
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,960
This case is actually very dangerous.

328
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,240
It's better to let
"Please be generous" take care of it.

329
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,640
Fine.

330
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,200
So, should we leave? I'll see you home.

331
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,280
It's okay. I'm meeting up
with Peem for dinner.

332
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,480
Want to join us?

333
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,840
It's okay.

334
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,120
I actually…

335
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,560
Right, I have to buy stuff
for the Laab restaurant.

336
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,640
So, I'm going to go.

337
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,240
PRANG MODELING - KIDS AND MODEL
CHILD MODELING

338
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,280
SEEKING MODELS TO BE
AD PRESENTERS, SINGERS, ACTORS

339
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,640
What if it's something horrible
that's happening to the children?

340
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,880
How do you expect me to do nothing?

341
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,800
Dear.

342
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,760
Dear. You're awake. Dear.

343
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,240
How are you, dear?

344
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,960
How did I get here? And…

345
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,760
Who are you?

346
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,200
You made a scene at the hospital
and you passed out.

347
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,200
I took pity on you,

348
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,480
so I told them you were my deranged niece.

349
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,440
So, they released you to me.

350
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,160
Why did you help me?

351
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,880
Getting arrested might be a good idea,

352
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,280
so I can tell the reporters

353
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,200
what Prang did.

354
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,440
So, what horrible thing did she do

355
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,800
to push you to throw your life away?

356
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,240
She destroyed both my life

357
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,560
and my heart.

358
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,200
She runs a modeling agency as a front.

359
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,000
In reality,

360
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,000
she lured us to film pornography

361
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,640
and used it to blackmail us,

362
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,520
so we'd do whatever they wanted.

363
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,800
My daughter…

364
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,360
is one of the victims.

365
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,840
But she was too afraid to tell me

366
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,840
until…

367
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,560
Anya!

368
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,360
Baby!

369
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,840
Anya!

370
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,680
Anya!

371
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,080
Anya!

372
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,360
Anya.

373
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,240
Anya, why did you do that?

374
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,880
Anya.

375
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,880
Why did you do that

376
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,640
How could you leave me?

377
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,000
Anya?

378
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,720
- Anya.
- Mom.

379
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,120
I want to die.

380
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,960
Anya.

381
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,360
My baby.

382
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,000
<i>She's still breathing,</i>

383
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,160
<i>but she's already died inside.</i>

384
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,400
But Prang kept calling to get Anya

385
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,960
to entertain her clients.

386
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,960
And that made me realize

387
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,320
this whole thing was her fault.

388
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,920
At first, I begged her
to delete the videos of my daughter.

389
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,920
But she refused.

390
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,840
And she threatened me,

391
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,960
telling me not to expose her.

392
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,960
When I reported it to the police,

393
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,480
they threatened to kill me.

394
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,760
They must've been in her pocket.

395
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,320
I saw "Please be generous" help everyone.

396
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,560
But when I asked for their help,

397
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,400
they ignored me.

398
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,840
The only way to solve this problem

399
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,120
is that I kill her myself.

400
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,760
But if you kill her

401
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,720
and she's dead, you will go to jail.

402
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,080
Who would be there for your daughter?

403
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,200
I don't know either, Granny.

404
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,240
I don't know what to do.

405
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,360
How can I and my daughter go on living?

406
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,200
I really don't know.

407
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,920
I don't know.

408
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,400
I don't…

409
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,880
PLEASE BE GENEROUS

410
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,920
"We're sorry for the late reply.

411
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,640
We promise we'll help you.

412
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,200
But not by killing people.

413
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,800
Would you mind
giving us more information?"

414
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,200
What is it?

415
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,080
"Please be generous" replied

416
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
that they'd help me.

417
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,800
Really?

418
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,080
Where is your daughter now?

419
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,600
I left her with my neighbor, Granny.

420
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,120
If that's the case, sleep here tonight.

421
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,800
Calm your nerves.

422
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,560
Go see your daughter tomorrow.

423
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,320
"Please be generous"
already promised to help.

424
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,320
They'll see it through for sure.

425
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,520
Right?

426
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,320
How is she doing, Granny?

427
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,160
I fed her and made her rest.
She's sleeping now.

428
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,800
Granny, guys,

429
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,360
I'm sorry

430
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,960
for ignoring her message
when she was suffering so badly.

431
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,080
I think I understand her.

432
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,960
If it happened to my child,

433
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,840
I wouldn't be able to take it either.

434
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,720
I'm also at fault.

435
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,320
I ignored that little girl
when she was with the culprit,

436
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,720
<i>even though I knew something was off.</i>

437
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,120
<i>No child fears their own mom that much.</i>

438
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,680
We're all regular folks who make mistakes.

439
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,520
The only thing we haven't failed to do

440
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,960
is that we fix our mistakes
when we realize them.

441
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,920
Changed their names many times?

442
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,640
<i>Yes. Both the owner's</i>
<i>and the agency's names.</i>

443
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,240
<i>No fixed location.</i>

444
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,520
<i>Some of the parents tried to expose them,</i>

445
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,160
<i>but all the information</i>
<i>was purged from social media.</i>

446
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,400
<i>They must be really powerful. And NGOs</i>

447
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,640
<i>suspect they're connected</i>
<i>to iffy Chinese financiers.</i>

448
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,640
<i>Hey, why don't you ask</i>
<i>for your boyfriend's help?</i>

449
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,000
Peem's busy with work.
I don't want to bother him.

450
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,400
<i>So, what now?</i>

451
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,120
<i>You can't solve this one alone.</i>

452
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,560
I won't be doing it alone.

453
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,240
I'm counting on you.

454
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,640
- Thank you very much.
- Sure.

455
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,160
ROOM AVAILABLE, TEL: 099 2585192

456
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,600
What's going on?

457
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,920
Ms. Kam?

458
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,840
You said "Please be generous" page
would take over the case.

459
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,480
Why was the woman with the gun

460
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,400
from yesterday here?

461
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,960
My goodness!
Hey, that woman carries a gun?

462
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,680
Granny, calm down.

463
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,400
- It will pass.
- No, it's just…

464
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,640
I saw a dropped item,
so I called the owner,

465
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,120
and that woman came and picked it up.

466
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,040
Goodness,

467
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,960
she carries a gun.

468
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,200
Granny, calm down.

469
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,080
- Take a deep breath.
- Granny's so good.

470
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,840
She's like a real actress.

471
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,360
Keep it down.

472
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,200
What are the odds of that?

473
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,440
Like you showing up at this moment.

474
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,200
Right?

475
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,840
Oh, yes!

476
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,680
Phakbung has a doctor's appointment today.

477
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,040
Since you're here,

478
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,280
why don't you come with us?

479
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,320
- Phakbung has an appointment?
- Yes.

480
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,320
Then, I'm sorry. I'm going.

481
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,600
- Goodbye.
- Oh…

482
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,640
- Bye.
- Oh.

483
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,720
Why am I doing this?

484
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,720
Jeez.

485
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,600
Why did you say that?
I don't have an appointment.

486
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,680
I think

487
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,400
she must be still obsessed with this case.

488
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,440
I don't want her involved.

489
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,240
This case is too dangerous.

490
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,360
It is. More importantly,

491
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,360
we almost got exposed many times.

492
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,520
We cannot let Ms. Kam know

493
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,960
that we're "Please be generous"

494
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,840
or things will get more complicated.

495
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,000
- Understood?
- Understood.

496
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,400
You're right. We have more
important things to take care of.

497
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,000
Solving Ms. Rungfah's case

498
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,400
and finding Granny's son.

499
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,840
Are we going to do it today?

500
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,600
This hero is so ready for the mission,

501
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,440
he's shaking!

502
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,760
Look at the two of you.

503
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,960
We have to gather
as much information as we can.

504
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,240
Let's split up.

505
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,880
MS. KEWALI KASEMYING, AGE 17

506
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,440
I found so many casting photos.

507
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,160
FINANCIERS

508
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,160
This must be the list of their financiers.

509
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,720
And here's their hard disk.

510
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,920
We should take all of these.

511
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,360
Arm.

512
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,600
Arm.

513
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,960
Arm, baby.

514
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,239
Arm, where are you?

515
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,960
- Arm, baby.
- Granny!

516
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,880
Granny, come back. Granny.

517
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,080
I'm sorry.

518
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,360
She must be exhausted

519
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,560
since she got home.

520
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,679
Let her stop using her power.

521
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,800
This should be enough evidence.
Let's leave.

522
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,239
- Let's go, Granny.
- Granny.

523
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,719
Come on. I'll lead you.

524
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,440
Hey, where's everything?

525
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,480
The stuff here's gone too.

526
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,480
Eh? Where is it?

527
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,800
These people have super powers,
like the boss says.

528
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
They were here, ma'am.

529
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,800
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

530
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,960
- We have to hurry
- Yes.

531
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,520
because time's been resumed.
They'll realize soon.

532
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm sorry.

533
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,160
But wait. What do you mean
by "time's been resumed"?

534
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,840
And where are we rushing off to? Huh?

535
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,120
So, you're the heroes?
Thought you were better than this.

536
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,000
Phoon.

537
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,840
We're so outnumbered.

538
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,040
We can't fight them, even with our powers.

539
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,280
So, what are we going to do?

540
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,000
Take Granny and run. I'll stall them.

541
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,600
But you're the only one without power.

542
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
I just pretended to let Rungfah

543
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,880
have the information about our location

544
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,920
because I wanted to see what she'd do.

545
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,320
And she sent you guys?

546
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,520
Good. Nosy people asking for trouble.

547
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,840
Stop!

548
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,680
Miss!

549
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,760
You guys run.

550
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,320
There we go.

551
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,080
Incompetent.

552
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,720
Miss, how did you get here?

553
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,640
My friend found out they were hiding here.

554
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,640
Huh? And you came here by yourself?

555
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,440
Didn't you know it was dangerous?

556
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,560
I did.

557
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,440
I was just going to spy on them.

558
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,480
But I couldn't let them take you guys.

559
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,840
You help a lot of people.

560
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,680
I had to help you.

561
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,560
But why do you sound familiar?

562
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,240
I don't know
what circus show you people did

563
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,680
that allowed you to take these,

564
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,280
but I think playtime is over.

565
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,560
Since you guys are here,

566
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,200
let me see the faces of the nosy heroes.

567
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,320
Don't do it! No!

568
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,520
Don't!

569
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,560
No!

570
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,320
Granny.

571
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,400
Bung.

572
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,920
I'm okay now.

573
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,200
You're okay now?

574
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,600
Okay.

575
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,440
Stop!

576
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,160
Granny.

577
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,080
Granny.

578
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,360
That was close.

579
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,400
So true, Granny.

580
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,320
- Granny.
- Huh?

581
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,320
Let's get Thua, Kam, and Phoon
out of the time freeze.

582
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,440
If you get another headache,

583
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,120
we'll be screwed for real.

584
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,600
Let's do it.

585
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,840
Where are they?

586
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,200
- Go get them.
- Yes.

587
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,120
We can't go, ma'am.

588
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,600
Uh… Argh! Dammit!

589
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,480
Stop! Don't move!

590
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,680
You're all under arrest.
The police are coming.

591
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,240
Hold on, please.

592
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,360
How did we get out?

593
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,160
We were tied up just now.

594
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,000
You used super powers?

595
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,000
Something like that.

596
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,920
Please wait here until the police arrive.

597
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,840
Wait!

598
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,600
Do we know each other?

599
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,320
You're very familiar.

600
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,480
You're mistaking me for someone else.

601
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,960
We never met.

602
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,920
Please excuse me.

603
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,120
I have a big mission to get to.

604
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,640
Don't follow me. It's very dangerous.

605
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,080
Watch the column.

606
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,760
Thank you.

607
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,800
Sure.

608
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,640
I'm done.

609
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,520
All right.

610
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,400
I'm done too.

611
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,680
THE RINGLEADER

612
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,000
So, all the videos are in here.
You psychos.

613
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,760
EVIDENCE

614
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,840
All the evidence is in the warehouse.

615
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,960
Please take over the case, officers.

616
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,520
Why do these four look familiar?

617
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,040
We're going!

618
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,080
Hold on.

619
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,960
Catching bad guys is our job anyway.

620
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,000
But I need all of you to give
your statements at the station.

621
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,840
I'm afraid that's not possible.

622
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,080
Where have they gone?

623
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,680
Sergeant, let's go.

624
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,680
Yes, sir.

625
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,960
So cool, the heroes
of "Please be generous".

626
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,960
<i>Actually, both of us</i>

627
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,960
<i>were…</i>

628
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,040
How is it, Granny?

629
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,480
You used a lot of power today.
We'll help you relax with a massage.

630
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,880
Feel better, Granny?

631
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,000
A little harder.

632
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,280
I'll drink some milk

633
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,600
and use my power

634
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,480
- to give you an awesome massage.
- Hey, that's too much.

635
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,120
You'll break my bones.

636
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,640
Here's some water, Granny.

637
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,040
Thanks.

638
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,120
- Eh? They're reporting our case.
- Huh?

639
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,960
<i>The police raided</i>
<i>the hideout of the modeling agency</i>

640
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,360
<i>that was blackmailing children thanks</i>
<i>to the leads from "Please be generous".</i>

641
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,520
<i>When they arrived,</i>
<i>many suspected were found tied up.</i>

642
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,320
<i>But one of them managed to escape.</i>

643
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,120
<i>After the interrogations,</i>

644
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,720
<i>the police believe</i>
<i>the person who avoided capture</i>

645
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,000

646
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,520
<i>Right now, the police</i>

647
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,280

<i>to be arrested and prosecuted.</i>

649
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,680
We tied her up. How did Prang escape?

650
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,160
Yeah.

651
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,880
<i>Reveal your faces</i>
<i>or I'll leak the compromising pics</i>

652
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,680

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,760
<i>The reveal will be on a livestream!</i>

654
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,000
Thank you very much, my new assistant.

655
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,720
Who's next to your boyfriend?

656
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,200
I have to see it for myself.

657
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,680
NEXT EPISODE

658
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,120
This is crossing the line.

659
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,760
Ms. Kam!

660
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,200
<i>What's going on? Why did everything stop?</i>

661
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,080
Or are you one
of the "Please be generous" heroes?
