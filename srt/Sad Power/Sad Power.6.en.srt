1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,120
Stop?

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,280
Stop?

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,280
Stop it!

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,280
PREVIOUSLY

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,680
We won’t let you harm Thua and Title!

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,640
<i>Finally, the urgent mission to find Title,</i>

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,680
<i>who had gone missing, has been completed,</i>

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,240
<i>thanks to these people's efforts.</i>

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,000
We're "Please be generous" team.

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,920
And I would like to announce

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,440
that I will be awarding a prize
to this team, just as I promised.

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,400
<i>So, what can I help with, Ms. Kam?</i>

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,240
<i>It's not just me who wants help.</i>

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,360
<i>The villagers are really struggling.</i>

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,600
There’s nothing "Please be generous"
can’t do. They can help with anything.

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,800
Great! Could they help me get rid
of the ghost in that abandoned house?

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,720
Don’t tell me it’s true!

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,400
Don’t try to scare me.

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,600
Oh, really?

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,440
I'm so sorry, Tee.

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,120
Yes.

22
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,000
What's wrong? You look stressed out.

23
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,960
Did Mr. Tee want something?

24
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,000
He said he hadn't gotten his Laab.

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,080
But Bung went to deliver it a while back.

26
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,560
She did.

27
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,200
I'm going to call Bung.

28
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,640
<i>The number you dialed</i>
<i>cannot be reached at the moment.</i>

29
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,560
I can't reach her.

30
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,240
Where's Bung?

31
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,120
Granny, did we really have to look
for Bung in this alley?

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,560
This is the quickest shortcut
to Tee's house.

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,880
Bung must have come this way.

34
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,320
But there's a haunted
abandoned house on the way.

35
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,039
Don't be ridiculous. You're with an adult.
Ghosts won't haunt you.

36
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,560
You said ghosts wouldn't haunt us.

37
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,200
That was clearly a ghost's sound.

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,440
Wasn't it too clear?

39
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,600
This is broad daylight.
Can ghosts do that?

40
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,120
I told you they were really powerful.

41
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,120
- Hair clip!
- Huh?

42
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,360
This hair clip belongs to Phakbung.

43
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,160
- Wait a sec. Why is it here?
- Huh?

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,680
Is she in the abandoned house?

45
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,560
Huh? Bung was taken and eaten, Granny?

46
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,600
She might not be taken by a ghost,

47
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,520
but she might be taken by bad guys.

48
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
Boost your power.

49
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,880
We're going in there.

50
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,240
Hey, you damned ghost!
I won't let you eat me!

51
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,240
‪It's me!

52
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,400
Bung.

53
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,040
I'm sorry.
I didn't snap my fingers in time.

54
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,200
Wait. I'll help you. Come here, Phoon.

55
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,840
What's wrong?

56
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,080
Once I healed him,
I felt pain at the same place, Granny.

57
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,080
This means we can't use too much
of our powers. They'll backfire on us.

58
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,680
Okay, I'll remember that.

59
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,320
Anyway, Bung,

60
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,080
why did you disguise yourself
as a scary ghost in this house?

61
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,880
It's a long story, Granny.

62
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,840
But we now have a case to work on.

63
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,560
Sopha?

64
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
I bought you from a temple.

65
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,160
Please help me exorcize
the abandoned house's ghost.

66
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,840
Sadhu.

67
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,880
Thua, an exorcism isn't needed.
The abandoned house's ghost is here.

68
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,440
How could you say that, Phoon?
She's a person, not a ghost.

69
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,000
Just show him, Sopha.

70
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,480
It's really her.

71
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,320
She's the one disguising as a ghost there.

72
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,760
Of course, it's her.

73
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,200
Please stop. I believe you now.

74
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,440
Why did you disguise as a ghost?

75
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,880
It's time to tell the whole story, Sopha.

76
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,640
I had to make that scary ghost sound

77
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,480
to prevent people
from entering this house.

78
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,280
I can't let anyone know that I'm in here.

79
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,080
I'm begging you.
Please don't tell anyone that I'm in here.

80
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,920
If the police find out,
I'll end up in jail.

81
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,920
So, what did you do?

82
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,120
Did you kill someone?

83
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,360
I don't have it in me to kill anyone.

84
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,120
I can't even kill
mosquitos or ants. Please.

85
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,320
Please.

86
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,840
Please don't cry.

87
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,360
Don't cry.

88
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,600
So, what did you do
that made the police look for you?

89
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,240
I'm not Thai.

90
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,920
I planned on working in Thailand
with my husband,

91
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,440
but I was scammed by a labor broker.

92
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,880
Please don't tell anyone I'm in here.

93
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,039
I don't want to go to jail.
I can't go to jail.

94
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,080
Please.

95
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,040
How far along are you?

96
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,360
Five months.

97
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,440
They confiscated my passport

98
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,080
and wouldn't apply
for a legal work permit for me.

99
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,040
They forced me

100
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,840
to work overtime without paying me.

101
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,000
And they sexually assaulted me,

102
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,960
even though they knew I was pregnant.

103
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,280
My friend couldn't stand it,

104
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,920
so he helped me escape.

105
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,480
And my friend was…

106
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,040
captured by those people.

107
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,840
Granny.

108
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,800
Are you okay?

109
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,640
I…

110
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,680
thought of Arm.

111
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,320
My son also told me

112
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,520
he was going to work overseas,

113
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,960
then he disappeared.

114
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,880
I don't know
if he was scammed like you were.

115
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,680
Why don't we check it out?

116
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,720
If we can get
Sopha's passport back to her,

117
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,200
we might get a lead to help your son.

118
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,040
How are we going to do that?

119
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,480
Granny, I think this one should work.

120
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,440
- Do you think?
- Yeah.

121
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,640
We won't get caught, right, Granny?

122
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,640
Don't worry.

123
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,320
I'll lead. My acting's very convincing.

124
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,440
Did you study acting?

125
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,560
No. I watched <i>Likay</i> when I was little.

126
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,520
I learned from that.

127
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,080
But where has Thua gone?
Why isn't he here preparing?

128
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,600
Let me see. Try it on.

129
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,240
- No. The other one's better.
- Where is he?

130
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,040
- Where's the other one?
- Here.

131
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,880
Ms. Kam?

132
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Laab Itthirit is here.

133
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,720
Thank you. I'm starving.

134
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,920
I'll pay you. Just a sec.

135
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,920
Hey, no need. It's free of charge.

136
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,720
I noticed that you loved it,
so I brought it to you.

137
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,760
So, you're going to get me
all the food or everything I love?

138
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,000
That's right. Even if it's the moon
or a star, I'll get it for you.

139
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,480
I'm just joking.

140
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,120
Who would be crazy enough
to climb up there to get the moon?

141
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,560
I'm here to update you on the "Please
be generous" page, so I brought this too.

142
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,640
What's up with the page?

143
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,360
I talked to the admin.
They said they'd exorcized the ghost.

144
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,640
Wow. That's awesome. They're so good.

145
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,440
I want to meet them all in person.

146
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,400
That's going to be hard

147
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,600
because they're very mysterious.

148
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,720
But…

149
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,960
I can you tell you this.

150
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,000
What's that?

151
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,200
It's a big secret. It can't get out.

152
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,680
I heard a big project is coming up

153
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,520
to dismantle a human trafficking gang.
Illegal labor.

154
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,680
You mean illegal labor brokers?

155
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,520
I didn't speak loudly.
How could he hear it?

156
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,920
It's okay. You can trust Peem.

157
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,840
I hope you succeed.

158
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,960
Hello, Bung?

159
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,680
Okay, I'll be right back.
I'll run home. Okay?

160
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,440
I have to go.

161
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,840
You guys remember what happens
when we use too much of our powers?

162
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,120
I can't anymore.

163
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,760
I get exhausted.

164
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,440
What about you?

165
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,440
Whoa!

166
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,080
<i>I get confused and forgetful.</i>

167
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,320
That's right. Me too.

168
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,560
The harder I heal someone,
the more of their pain I feel.

169
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,520
So, we must use our powers
only when it's necessary

170
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,560
or our plan will fail.

171
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,200
- Hey!
- Hey!

172
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,840
PR WORKER COMPANY

173
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,200
IMPORTING AND SUPPLYING
FOREIGN LABOR AND OVERSEAS JOBS

174
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,880
Nailed it.

175
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,480
- Amazing.
- Go.

176
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,080
Hello. How can I help you?

177
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,960
I'm here to apply for a job maybe? Duh.

178
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,840
Of course, I'm here to find a housekeeper.

179
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,520
And I need one quickly. Ideally today.

180
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,120
Well?

181
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,440
- Oh.
- Can you find me one?

182
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,560
Of course, ma'am.

183
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,160
Are you just saying that?

184
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,520
I'm the owner.

185
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,040
I can't just say things.

186
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,400
I'll have my employee bring you
a catalog of good housekeepers

187
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,080
selected specially for you.

188
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,640
Please take a seat and relax.

189
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,520
- Please.
- That's what I call being capable.

190
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Sit down, baby.

191
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,480
Sit down. Scoot.

194
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,640
Hello, boss.

195
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,720
This one wants to work overseas.

196
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,240
What does one have to do?

197
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,120
Can you go? When will that heal?

198
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,400
Oh, that one's not going.
This one's going alone.

199
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,360
Wait there. There's a queue.

200
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,880
Just a moment, ma'am.

201
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,400
Grandma, my tummy hurts!
Take me to the bathroom.

202
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,920
Huh? Again?

203
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,240
It's coming!

204
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,640
Goodness me.

205
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,920
Hey!

206
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,800
Don't make a mess here.
There's a bathroom.

207
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,560
- Duly noted. No need to lecture me.
- Grandma,

208
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,800
- not now. Hurry.
- Hey,

209
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,920
my grandson needs a bathroom
for number two. Where's the bathroom?

210
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,840
This way, ma'am.

211
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,520
That way. Come on, baby. Come.

212
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,000
Hold it. This way, right?

213
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,200
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

214
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,480
Calm down.

215
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,839
Hey.

216
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,480
Hey,

217
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,839
the coast is clear, Granny.
No one's following us.

218
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,319
That's it. It's this way.

219
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,319
She said in the hallway
leading to the bathroom,

220
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,960
there's a door that says "Do not enter…"

221
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,599
"Without permission," right?

222
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,880
- How did you know?
- It's there.

223
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,440
"Document room.
Do not enter without permission."

224
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,120
That's right. This is it. Let's go.

225
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,520
Wait, Granny.

226
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,520
We can't.

227
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,480
Why not?

228
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,440
It's really coming.

229
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,320
You weren't acting earlier?

230
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,520
I was, but I was being too convincing.

231
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,400
It's really coming.

232
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,560
Yikes.

233
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,360
Granny, I need the bathroom ASAP.

234
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,960
Let's go. Hurry.

235
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,400
How was it? Are you ready?
Did you get it all out?

236
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,760
I emptied the tank.

237
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,800
- All right, let's go.
- Okay.

238
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,000
It's locked.

239
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,640
- I'll do it.
- Hold on.

240
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,880
How will you do it?

241
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,600
I'll break it down.

242
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,120
That would be loud. People would come.

243
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,800
Where should we drink tonight?

244
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,040
Anywhere is fine, bro, as long as you buy.

245
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,280
- Someone's coming.
- Yeah, I heard them.

246
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,600
Hurry and open it.

247
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,840
Gently. Like a cat. Gently.

248
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,720
Go!

249
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,080
- Same place then?
- Make it fast.

250
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,000
- They say that place was a real deal.
- We'll get the same room.

251
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,040
- It's a must.
- Yeah, let's try it. The girls are hot.

252
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,040
Are there special discounts?

253
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,160
- You bet.
- All right.

254
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,080
They're gone, Granny.

255
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,840
That was close.

256
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,720
Hurry. Let's find that passport.

257
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,440
Can we really find it, Granny?

258
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,320
With these many documents…

259
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,040
Here you go. Housekeepers
specially selected… Eh? Ma'am?

260
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,000
Where are they?

261
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,360
- Uh…
- What now?

262
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,440
- Plan B.
- She took him to use the bathroom.

263
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,600
What's with you?

264
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,440
What's wrong with you?

265
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,280
You're going abroad.
You're leaving me, aren't you?

266
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,880
- Huh?
- Aren't you?

267
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,000
You asshole!

268
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,040
- Boss, please help me.
- Asshole!

269
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,080
- Boss.
- I'll beat you to death here.

270
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,720
So you die here.

271
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,000
Get out of there.

272
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,040
- I'll kill you.
- Wait.

273
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,800
- No.
- Wait. Stop!

274
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,080
Stop fighting.

275
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,240
Don't die here.

276
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,280
Go die somewhere else. Okay?

277
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,920
Fine! I'll die somewhere else!

278
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,280
You're off the hook.

279
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,440
A wife like that.

280
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,200
You can find better ones abroad.

281
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,760
Go get those two.

282
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,760
Got it.

283
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,040
No, my love!

284
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,680
Please don't leave me!

285
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,600
How do I live without you?!

286
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,480
Baby!

287
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
Hey.

288
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,040
- He fainted.
- Oh, I'm getting a headache.

289
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,040
I shouldn't have picked a limping girl.

290
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,920
- Are you taking a vacation this year?
- Yes.

291
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,080
Where are you going?

292
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,680
I'll be with my family.

293
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,080
Yeah? I was thinking
about taking a vacation too.

294
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,560
Plan it then.

295
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,560
- Make someone do your shift.
- Right.

296
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,320
Don't make me sick now.

297
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,880
Work with me first.

298
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,240
Hello.

299
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,800
They won't work overtime?

300
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,040
Threaten them, boss. Tell them
you'll call the police on them.

301
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,560
Yeah. They won't fight back.
They're foreigners.

302
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,400
They're afraid of going to jail.

303
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,040
They don't have their passports.
They won't run.

304
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,040
If they refuse, send them back to me.

305
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,880
I'll teach them a lesson.

306
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,120
Okay.

307
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,480
How's it going, sir?
What can I do for you?

308
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,280
Huh?

309
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,520
Really, sir?

310
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,720
I'll deal with it right now.

311
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,320
Hey, someone sneaked in.

312
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,520
Find them. And get rid of them.

313
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,200
You must leave for now.

314
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,200
We're closed. Please leave right now.

315
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,640
Please leave.

316
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,440
I'm still not feeling well.
I'm still disoriented.

317
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,520
Hey, you guys, wait!

318
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,040

Was I not convincing?

323
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,040
Granny, was that a fire alarm?

324
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,160
But I don't smell anything burning.

325
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,080
Granny, do you hear
the sound of footsteps?

326
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,480
I do.

327
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,640
Very quietly.

328
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,080
It's getting louder.

329
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,840
You're right.

330
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,800
Loud, like it's around here.

331
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,920
It stopped.

332
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,960
I see.

333
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,640
That's why it stopped.

334
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,840
I'm going to go.

335
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,640
Here you are.

336
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,880
Go get them.

337
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,480
- Let's run.
- Jeez, Granny, this teen wants to fight.

338
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,320
- Just go.
- All right.

339
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,720
Come on.

340
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,480

We're still looking for the infiltrators.

343
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,600
Catch them as quickly as you can,

344
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,000
and take care of them.

345
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,600
Make it clean.

346
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,360
I love cleanliness.

347
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,280
Understood?

348
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Yes, boss. Let's go.

349
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,000
Yes. Thank you very much
for the tip-off, sir.

350
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,160
I'm cleaning this up.

351
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,840
Make sure you do that.

352
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,080
And don't give anyone an inkling
I'm involved with your company.

353
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,280
Who's there?

354
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,400
It's that guy's wife.
What are you doing here?

355
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,000
Or…

356
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,360
is she here to infiltrate?

357
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,440
Don't come any closer.

358
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,120
You're not really limping.

359
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,000
Don't come any closer.

360
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,160
Hey!

361
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,840
You think you can get away?

362
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,440
Get lost!

363
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,800
Come here!

364
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,640
Where are you going?

365
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,960
Sopha!

366
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,880
How did you get here?

367
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,640
I couldn't let you help me
all by yourselves.

368
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,600
I wanted to help you too.

369
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,640
Run, Sopha.

370
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,000
Please run, Sopha.

371
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,160
Sopha!

372
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,120
Sopha!

373
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,800
Sopha!

374
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,400
- Come here!
- Let go!

375
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,040
- Let go!
- Come here! I said come here.

376
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,560
Hey, Bung.

377
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,160
Bung! Phakbung!

378
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,440
- Sopha.
- Bung.

379
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,920
Sopha.

380
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,800
How are you, Bung?

381
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,560
I'm okay, Granny.

382
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,480
But Sopha…

383
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,800
Bung.

384
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,920
You said we can't use too much power.

385
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,240
I can't not do it, Granny.

386
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,400
I have to save Sopha and her baby.

387
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,640
Hey!

388
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,480
Bung, you're bleeding!

389
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,600
My goodness! Bung!

390
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,400
- Bung!
- Bung!

391
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,440
What do we do, Granny?

392
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,440
Thua.

393
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,160
Please be okay, Bung. Please be okay.

394
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,520
Bung.

395
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Granny, why was Bung bleeding suddenly?

396
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,280
- Is she going to die?
- Come on now.

397
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,440
Don't say that.

398
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,720
Bung's with the doctors now.
She's going to be okay.

399
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,160
Well, I'm scared.

400
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,080
Don't cry. Hang in there.

401
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,960
It's okay. Bung's going to be okay…

402
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,520
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

403
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,720
How's my sister doing?

404
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,760
And the other woman too.

405
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,120
They're fine.

406
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,960
Including their babies.

407
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,320
From now you, you have to
take extra good care of them.

408
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,160
Woohoo!

409
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,080
That's a relief.

410
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,840
Wait a minute.

411
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,880
Doctor, did you say "their babies"?

412
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,800
You mean,

413
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,520
they both are pregnant?

414
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,760
That's right.

415
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,440
Sopha, you sleep in Granny's room.

416
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,080
We'll talk more tomorrow.

417
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,120
What about my passport and my husband?

418
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,600
No matter what, we're going to find a way

419
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,000
to get them back.

420
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,320
But today, you should rest and recharge.

421
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,280
- All right.
- Okay, let's go.

422
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,680
Make yourself at home.

423
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,440
Granny.

424
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,800
- Bung…
- I'm going to get some sleep, Granny.

425
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,840
I'm exhausted.

426
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,560
It can't be helped.

427
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,400
Everyone will find out eventually

428
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,240
that your mother was a bad kid.

429
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,240
A disgraced girl.

430
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:18,320
ROOM AVAILABLE, TEL: 099 2585192

431
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,360
Stay strong.

432
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,280
You will get through this!

433
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,760
Bung. You're awake.

434
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,960
No more tummy ache, right?

435
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,200
Are you hungry?

436
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,160
I made porridge for you.

437
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,720
From now on, you have to eat good food,

438
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,320
so your baby stays healthy.

439
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,880
That's right. And what are you wearing?
It doesn't look very comfy.

440
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,040
- Right?
- Yeah.

441
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,080
We have something for you.

442
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,680
Ta-da! Here.

443
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,200
Guys.

444
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,440
- Go change. Come on. You'll feel better.
- Go on.

445
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,520
Go on.

446
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,640
Let's go.

447
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,240
It's quite pretty.

448
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,600
Thank you very much, guys.

449
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,520
At first, I thought I'd be yelled at.

450
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,280
Why would we do that?
You're just pregnant.

451
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,000
- You didn't kill anyone, right, Granny?
- Right.

452
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,920
But it still looks bad, right?

453
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,320
I just graduated high school.

454
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,240
You guys must have thought
that I was a slut.

455
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,880
People make mistakes.

456
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,320
It's water under the bridge.

457
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,000
What matters right now

458
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,560
is how we're going to fix the problem

459
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,440
and make our lives better.

460
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,960
So, this is why

461
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,920
you ran away from home, isn't it?

462
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,760
If there's something we can do,

463
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,640
you can always let us know, since we're

464
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,440
in the same boat now.

465
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,800
No matter what, you can always trust us.

466
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,520
That's right. Whatever you want
to talk about, you can vent away.

467
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,680
Yeah, I'm on your side.

468
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,040
So,

469
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,920
is there something you want to tell us?

470
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,920
I'm okay.

471
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,720
I think we should figure out how to help
Sopha with that bogus labor company first.

472
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,040
Okay.

473
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,520
Wait.

474
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,440
Do I really need to go to the police?

475
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,239
You said you'd find a way to help me.

476
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,560
This is how we help you.

477
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,560
Because yesterday,

478
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:19,199
we already tried, but we failed.

479
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,920
I think if we go back there,
our chance of success is slim.

480
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,239
Besides,

481
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,840
your husband's not
the only one in captivity.

482
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,600
Can the police really help?

483
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,440
Of course, they can.
Thai police are very good.

484
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,400
Wait.

485
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,080
Am I going to get arrested?

486
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,520
No. You didn't do anything wrong.
What would they arrest you for?

487
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,480
I think you should
tell them what you know.

488
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,120
The police should be able
to help you. Don't be afraid.

489
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,240
Okay.

490
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,200
This way.

491
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,040
But I still don't understand

492
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,120
why we have to go to the police.

493
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,240
Why don't we use our powers
and take care of it by ourselves?

494
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,640
We may be able to help
Sopha and her husband,

495
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,360
but how will we deal
with the illegal labor traffickers?

496
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,360
Threaten them.

497
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,880
Tell them not to do it again
or we'll beat them up.

498
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,120
These people work as a syndicate.

499
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,080
It's not just one group.

500
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,560
We can't fight all of them.

501
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,000
Besides, these people are usually…

502
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,840
How do you say it?
Backed by powerful people.

503
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,520
That's right.

504
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,160
Just report it to the police.

505
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,160
So they'll bring
everyone involved to justice.

506
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,840
You're right, Granny.

507
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,000
That's no fun.

508
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,360
That was close.

509
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,880
Be careful. Pork is expensive.

510
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,120
Hey, our powers really took a toll.

511
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,440
Yesterday, I bled

512
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,360
because I saved Sopha and her baby.

513
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,200
I was in so much pain.

514
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,880
It's like Sopha's pain
was transferred to me.

515
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,960
I forced myself
until I couldn't anymore, Granny.

516
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,600
You mean if you can't take it anymore,
we should stop, Bung?

517
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,240
I think so.

518
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,480
But the effect is probably
different for each of us.

519
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,960
You and Phoon have to notice yourselves
and be very careful.

520
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,400
And how's your tummy?

521
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,120
I'm perfectly fine, Granny.

522
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,560
All right.

523
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,520
Get back to work.

524
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,080
- Be careful.
- I forgot.

525
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,760
I'll keep wiping the plates.

526
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,480
Yes.

527
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,800
This is it, officers.

528
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,600
Inside, in the back is a warehouse

529
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,080
where they lock up the workers.

530
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,320
Huh?

531
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,720
"Permanently closed."

532
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,120
What the heck?

533
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,920
All the stuff… It's all gone.

534
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,520
Yeah.

535
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,040
What's going on exactly?

536
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,720
There's nothing here.

537
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,240
Go with the officer.

538
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,000
She'll coordinate with the embassy

539
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,360
and take you home.

540
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,240
What about my husband?

541
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,280
The police's working the case now.

542
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,760
I think soon, everyone

543
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,160
will be found, right?

544
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,720
Even if we wait here,
we won't be able to help.

545
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,480
That's right. Exactly.

546
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,320
Yes.

547
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,960
Thank you all very much.
I won't forget your kindness.

548
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,280
- You won't.
- Don't say that.

549
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,200
Good luck.

550
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,640
- Yes.
- Good luck.

551
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,080
- Good luck, Sopha.
- Yes.

552
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,280
Can the police really help?

553
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,560
Those guys are in the wind.

554
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,440
It was my fault.

555
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,600
I was too busy worrying
about Bung and Sopha

556
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,200
to realize that they'd run.

557
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,480
It was my fault too
for getting weak at the wrong time.

558
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,760
Don't do that. Don't blame yourself.

559
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,800
And by the time
the police track them down,

560
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,680
I don't know what state
the captives would be in.

561
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,920
We can't let this go on.

562
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,840
It’s time to unleash our power.

563
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,520
- You're so eager to use your power.
- Jeez.

564
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,720
"Jeez" what?

565
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,200
Yes. So…

566
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,520
let's go!

567
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,360
Everyone.

568
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,320
Ready?

569
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,960
"You just had a bleeding.
You don't have to come.

570
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,120
We can take care of it ourselves.

571
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,640
Get a lot of rest.

572
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,240
Eat up, so you get better soon."

573
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,880
Jeez. I'm not that weak.

574
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,720
<i>I admit that I actually had fun</i>

575
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,440
<i>and felt cool to be a part of the team.</i>

576
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,520
Granny!

577
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,600
<i>But if something happens to you guys,</i>

578
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,080
I'll feel guilty until I die.

579
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,880
So, we'll stop using our powers?

580
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,480
We won't be heroes anymore?

581
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,760
I'll never be a part of this wickedness.

582
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,280
Yeah? We'll see.

583
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,320
Hey!
