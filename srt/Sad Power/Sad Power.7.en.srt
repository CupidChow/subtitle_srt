1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,720
Please help me exorcize
the abandoned house's ghost.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,880
Thua, an exorcism isn't needed.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,320
The abandoned house's ghost is here.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,920
<i>I'm not Thai.</i>

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,720
But I was scammed by a labor broker.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,120
They confiscated my passport.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,960
My son also told me
he was going to work overseas.

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,040
I don't know
if he was scammed like you were.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,840
If we can get
Sopha's passport back to her,

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,640
we might get a lead to help your son.

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,480
- Hey!
- Hey!

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,000
<i>Someone sneaked in. Find them.</i>

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,000
Thank you very much for the tip-off, sir.

14
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,880
<i>And don't give anyone an inkling</i>
<i>I'm involved with your company.</i>

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,200
‪PREVIOUSLY

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,920
Bung, you're bleeding!

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,440
They're fine. Including their babies.

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,960
They both are pregnant?

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,200
That's right.

20
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,280
We can't let this go on.
It’s time to unleash our power.

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,600
Yes. So, let's go.

22
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,520
"You just had a bleeding.

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,760
You don't have to come.
We can take care of it ourselves."

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,480
Jeez. I'm not that weak.

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,160
Wow.

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,560
We picked the right time.
They're moving the workers.

27
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,800
Let's see if Sopha's husband
is one of them.

28
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,720
But what does he look like?

29
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,440
I think I'll recognize him
because she showed me the photos.

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,040
- There. The one in a blue T-shirt.
- Where?

31
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,560
Jeez, why are we looking for him?
We're rescuing everyone here anyway.

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,840
So? Shall I break the truck?

33
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,120
Hey, don't forget
that we can't change the past

34
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,640
because the consequences could be worse.

35
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,440
So, why did we go back in time?
What can we do?

36
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,680
I got it.

37
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,640
Where are they? Why aren't they back yet?

38
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,440
Why is it so quiet today?

39
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,240
Bung, two pork Laabs
without offal, extra spicy.

40
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,480
We're not open today, Kam.

41
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,560
Granny's out.

42
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,520
Oh?

43
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,480
Hey, you're wearing a dress today.
So cute.

44
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,320
What gives?

45
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,160
How is it, Kam? Does it look strange?

46
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,960
Not at all. These dresses are great.

47
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,280
I love them too. It doesn't show
our tummies when we eat.

48
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,240
- I like them too.
- Oh. I see.

49
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,480
We're closed, Kam.
Why don't you come back another day?

50
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,240
You can leave.

51
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,760
- Okay. I'll come back another day.
- Sure.

52
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,160
That's right.

53
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,480
- Yes?
- Did you see the news about

54
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,320
the abandoned house's ghost
"Please be generous" exorcized?

55
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,520
How did they do it?

56
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh! Yes, Kam. Well…

57
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
Uh…

58
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,960
I don't know either.

59
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,560
Why don't you ask them yourself?

60
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,440
How will I ask them?

61
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,480
I don't know who they are
or where they live.

62
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,960
Anyway, why don't you leave
and come back later? Okay?

63
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,880
Please. Come back for the food later.

64
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,400
- Okay? Okay!
- Okay.

65
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,920
- See you later.
- See you later.

66
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,880
I'm getting a headache.

67
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,720
- We're lucky you didn't come back sooner.
- Huh?

68
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,120
Ms. Kam was just here.

69
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,560
Huh? Ms. Kam was here? Where is she?

70
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,800
Wait. Let's talk about the mission first.

71
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,560
How was it? Did you find anything?

72
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,720
Of course.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,840
After we'd gone back in time,
we saw them move the workers.

74
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,880
<i>But we couldn't change the past,</i>
<i>so we hid in the truck instead.</i>

75
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,960
<i>Luckily, the truck was big enough for us.</i>
<i>There were a lot of stuff to hide behind.</i>

76
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,040
Go! Get in!

77
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,840
We don't have all night! Go! Get in!

78
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,720
- Hey, get it moving! Get out of there!
- Hurry!

79
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,080
Hurry up! Don't linger!

80
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,400
Jeez. Come on!

81
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,280
Here we go.

82
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,160
Let's share our location.

83
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,720
Mission accomplished.

84
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,040
What are we waiting for?
Let's tell the police.

85
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,280
- Mm. Let's go.
- Let's go.

86
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,720
Go. No, leave. Calm down.

87
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,840
But I'm really not lying, Lieutenant.

88
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,080
The workers are really kept there.

89
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,720
I'm not saying you lied.
I made a record of it.

90
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,120
Great. Now we have to rescue them
because they're waiting for your help.

91
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,200
It must be verified first.

92
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,960
No need. If you don't hurry,
it'll be too late, Lieutenant.

93
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,560
You took me to the wrong place once.

94
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,520
We have to verify it first.

95
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,440
Go on. Please leave.
I have a lot more work to do. Go.

96
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,520
But…

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,600
What now, Thua?

98
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,400
I think those guys are too fast.
We can't wait.

99
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,000
So, I guess it's up to us.

100
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,000
Hey, get up!

101
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,160
- Come on!
- Hurry!

102
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,440
Come on!

103
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,000
Get him here.

104
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,440
Come on.

105
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,200
- Take them.
- Come on. Get up!

106
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,280
- Get up! Go!
- Come on! Go!

107
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,080
- Get out.
- Don't try anything.

108
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,800
Go!

109
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,480
Let's go! Hurry up!

110
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,400
Time is money.

111
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,240
- Hey! Go!
- Go!

112
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,480
Yes, sir? Everything's in order.

113
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,280
A fishing boat needs workers.
No one will find them in the sea, sir.

114
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
Done, boss.

115
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,600
Let's go.

116
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,480
Close the door. Let's go!

117
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,680
- What's wrong?
- I don't know, boss.

118
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,000
Get out and check.

119
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,040
Hey! What are you?

120
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,680
I won't let you leave.

121
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,720
Hey!

122
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,040
- Let's go.
- Come on.

123
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,720
How's that possible?

124
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,840
Watch out!

125
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,360
Will this take long? I'm exhausted.

126
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,680
Oi, I'm exhausted too.

127
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,760
I got an idea. Don't unfreeze time yet.

128
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,720
What are you doing?

129
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,960
- That'll work.
- Yeah.

130
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,800
- Okay?
- Yeah.

131
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,200
- Boss?
- Where's my gun?

132
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,560
- Hey! Get them back here!
- Hey! Stop them!

133
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,160
Don't let them escape!

134
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,920
Stop! I said stop!

135
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,080
- Stop!
- Hey!

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,160
Bring it on if you dare.

137
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,320
I want to fight someone my size. Come on.

138
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,760
Come on if you dare.

139
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,120
Why is my power gone?

140
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,560
- Eh?
- Huh? Your power's gone?

141
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,480
Granny, freeze time!

142
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,360
- Granny!
- Granny!

143
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,880
Jeez!

144
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,400
Luckily, I have another gun.

145
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,800
Go get the workers.

146
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,320
Yes, boss.

147
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,360
Hey! Police!

148
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,200
- Wee-oo-wee-oo!
- You brat!

149
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,600
- Oi, it's a dead end.
- Oh!

150
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,120
Thua, we're screwed. What do we do?

151
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,160
There's nowhere else to go.

152
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,520
Hey, police!

153
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,680
Same ruse. Won't work on me.

154
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,920
Stop! Drop your weapon!

155
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,040
Drop it!

156
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,920
I said drop it!

157
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,440
Go.

158
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,800
Go.

159
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,920
Granny, you can't be
out of commission yet.

160
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,360
Focus, Granny. Granny?

161
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,360
Bung, the police are here.

162
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,680
Granny, let's go help the police.

163
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,040
She can't do anything right now.
Look at her.

164
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,160
What's wrong with her?

165
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,040
Since the police are here, let's leave.

166
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,840
- This is a critical moment.
- Granny?

167
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,400
- Where are we?
- Granny?

168
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,360
- Ow!
- Granny!

169
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,400
Granny!

170
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,400
- Granny!
- Granny!

171
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,080
Granny?

172
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,120
Granny?

173
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,800
- She's waking up.
- Granny!

174
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,120
- Granny?
- Granny, how are you?

175
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,520
Does it hurt anywhere?
Does your head still hurt?

176
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,480
Granny, do you remember us?

177
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,920
- Hey.
- Granny.

178
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,680
Why are you guys so shaken up? I'm fine.

179
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,280
Do you remember what happened?

180
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,440
Oh.

181
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,880
Weren't we trying to rescue the workers?

182
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,560
When did we get home?

183
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,600
You used too much power,
so you passed out.

184
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,680
Really? Did we rescue
Sopha's husband and the other workers?

185
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,240
<i>Yesterday, around 3 p.m., the police</i>

186
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,160
<i>received a tip-off about a labor</i>
<i>trafficking gang from a good Samaritan.</i>

187
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,680
<i>As a result,</i>
<i>the police raided the location</i>

188
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,520
<i>and found the traffickers were moving</i>
<i>the workers to evade capture,</i>

189
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,560
<i>leading to a shooting.</i>

190
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,520
<i>In the end, the police were able</i>

191
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,400
<i>to rescue all the workers.</i>

192
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,680
<i>But Mr. Phairot, the company's owner,</i>
<i>managed to escape.</i>

193
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,360
Ugh, I hope they'll bring him to justice!

194
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,880
What a parasite!

195
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,840
Someone like this must be punished!

196
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,880
Hey, hold on.

197
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,880
- Calm down, baby. Don't get carried away.
- Well, look at him, Dad!

198
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,320
Don't get carried away, baby.
Calm down. Focus.

199
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,560
- Dad! They--
- Calm down, baby.

200
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,600
Get yourself together.

201
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,000
Take a deep breath. There you go.

202
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,320
You have to help me. If I get arrested,
you won't get away either.

203
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,400
- Are you threatening me?
- <i>I'm telling the truth.</i>

204
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,760
If I get arrested, I'll be interrogated.

205
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,400
I don't know how long
I will be able to hold out.

206
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,360
What if I don't help you?

207
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,680
Mr. Peem, over the years,

208
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,520
how much work have I done for you?

209
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,360
The money you've spent on building
your reputation partly came from me.

210
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,320
Where are you now?

211
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,800
Sopha and her husband reunited.

212
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,080
The only one left is the boss.

213
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,800
I want to catch that guy too,
but to be honest,

214
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,760
I'm not sure if we'll be able
to use our powers again.

215
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,640
That's my concern too.

216
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,040
All of us saw what happened to Granny.

217
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,560
But she's okay now,
and Bung's fully recovered.

218
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,080
Is that just for now?
And what if she gets amnesia again?

219
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,760
Her amnesia will be permanent this time.

220
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,200
I admit that I actually had fun

221
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,280
and felt cool to be a part of the team.

222
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,200
But if something happens
to you guys, I think

223
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,320
I'll feel guilty until I die.

224
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,360
So, what do we do?

225
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,800
I don't mind it for myself.
I'm just worried about my baby.

226
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,240
And I don't want to get amnesia.

227
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,800
I haven't found my son.

228
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,720
Besides,

229
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,640
we don't know how it will affect Phoon.

230
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,200
He might get it worse than you two.

231
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,000
So, we'll stop using our powers?
We won't be heroes anymore?

232
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,640
What's the point of having powers
and not using them?

233
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,800
Phoon.

234
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,400
You adults are cowards.
It's not as scary as you think.

235
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,960
We don't know how it will affect Phoon.
He might get it worse than you two.

236
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,119
Then, let's prove it.

237
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,320
I'll buy a lot of milk and drink it
to see what my full power is like!

238
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,920
Ugh!

239
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,880
Thank you very much for saving Typhoon.

240
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,240
It was so dangerous,
running into traffic like that.

241
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,160
Yes.

242
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,040
I know it was risky,

243
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,880
but Typhoon was about to get hit by a car.
I couldn't not save him.

244
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,920
My legs ran off on their own.

245
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,320
If I thought too hard,
Typhoon would have been hit.

246
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,640
Thank you very much, Kam.

247
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,960
If it weren't for you,
I would've already been dead.

248
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,000
You're welcome. No big deal.

249
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,440
But I didn't risk myself mindlessly.

250
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,080
I knew I was a fast runner.

251
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,160
I was a track champion.

252
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,400
I feel so cool, like I got to be a hero.
Like the "Please be generous" heroes.

253
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,000
We have to know
the limits of our own abilities.

254
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,920
Well, I'm going.

255
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,280
We'll see you off then.

256
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,000
- Sure.
- Let's go.

257
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,440
- I'm off. Goodbye.
- Yes.

258
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,160
If we're scared, we won't do
what we're supposed to do.

259
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,640
So, we're going to keep helping people.

260
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,680
But we must do it mindfully
and know our own abilities.

261
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,120
Before, I'd never had a problem
with small injuries.

262
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,280
But when I saved Sopha, it was so severe
that it hurt me, but I kept going.

263
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,000
So, in your case, when it starts
to hurt you, you have to stop.

264
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,800
As for me, I'm okay
with freezing time once or twice,

265
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,400
but if it lasts too long,

266
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,800
or if I go back in time too often,
I get dizzy.

267
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,160
So, in your case, when you feel dizzy,
you have to stop using your power.

268
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,680
But it hasn't happened to me.

269
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,000
Oh, but there was one time
my power was gone.

270
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,920
I tried to drink milk,

271
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,240
but my power wouldn't come back.

272
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,480
So, in your case, you probably
can use your power only once a day.

273
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,840
So, that's settled.
We won't stop helping people,

274
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,800
but we have to protect ourselves too.

275
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,080
We, "Please be generous",

276
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,800
- go!
- Go!

277
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,480
You're here, right?

278
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,440
Phairot, give yourself up!

279
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,120
Stop! Drop the gun!

280
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,120
- Let go! Get off me!
- Drop the gun!

281
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,480
Don't take me! I said let go!

282
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,760
Stop!

283
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,920
No need.

284
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,160
- Huh?
- Huh?

285
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,480
"The labor trafficking fugitive

286
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,200
has been killed by the police
for resisting arrest.

287
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,000
The detail of the incident
will be reported later."

288
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,680
Why is it so quick? How did
the police get the lead on Phairot?

289
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,440
The news says
a good Samaritan tipped them off.

290
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,840
<i>Was it you?</i>

291
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,160
Was it you?

292
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,280
Why did you think it was me?

293
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,920
I didn't think. I was told.

294
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,520
I'm close to the inspector,
so I heard things.

295
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,920
I was following that case too.
I got some information.

296
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,880
But it wasn't a big deal.

297
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,200
That's not true. It was a very big deal.

298
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,440
You helped the police get rid
of bad people from our society.

299
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,920
You're super cool.

300
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,360
It's everyone's duty, Kam.

301
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,800
If we see problems

302
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,680
and don't overlook them,

303
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,000
our society will be a much better place.

304
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,680
The more you talk, the cooler you get.

305
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,640
Ooh.

306
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,040
How can you be real?

307
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,080
Handsome and capable.
With a great attitude.

308
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,240
Ooh.

309
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,960
Exactly what I'm looking for
in a son-in-law. Are you available?

310
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,880
Would you take my daughter
under consideration?

311
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,720
Dad! Stop talking. You're embarrassing me.

312
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,040
I was joking.

313
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,840
- But if it worked, then I'm serious.
- Dad.

314
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,880
Thank you very much. Come back again.

315
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,120
What?

316
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,920
Hello? Yes. What would you like?

317
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,160
One each?

318
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,800
You got it.

319
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,280
Granny, have some water.

320
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,240
Thanks so much, dear.

321
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,720
Are you tired?

322
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,280
No. What about you?
Do you still get morning sickness?

323
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,440
Oh, just mild nausea, but I'm used to it.

324
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,640
You have to eat lots of healthy food.

325
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,960
But I think the best thing
for you to do is get prenatal care.

326
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,760
You'll be safe in the doctors' hands.

327
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,320
I know, Granny, but…

328
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,520
can I take a little more time?
I'm not ready.

329
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,160
I understand.

330
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,600
You're afraid of how people
will look at you, right?

331
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,360
I knew what I would face

332
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,240
if I kept this baby,

333
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,680
but I'm still uncomfortable.

334
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,520
I'm probably still not strong enough.

335
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,720
Bung, my dear,

336
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,200
you can't avoid how people look at you

337
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,200
and judge you forever.

338
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,000
It's up to you.

339
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,480
Know yourself, understand yourself,

340
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,040
know what you are doing,
and why you're doing it.

341
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,200
Thank you, Granny. From now on,

342
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,480
I won't be swayed
by other people's opinions.

343
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,120
I don't care what they call me.

344
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,280
I'll protect my baby.

345
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,200
Great. Then take these…

346
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,080
to boost your protection.

347
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,640
What's this, Granny?

348
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,320
Milk and supplements.

349
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,480
I asked a pharmacist
what you should take for the baby.

350
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,600
So, they put these together.
But you must follow the instructions.

351
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,320
Thank you, Granny.

352
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,960
Talking to you like this
reminds me of my son.

353
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,240
When Arm had problems,

354
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,560
we cheered each other on like this.

355
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,000
You're okay, Granny?

356
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,960
Hey.

357
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,760
I forgot the order. My goodness.

358
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,880
Tom Saab and pork Laab.

359
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,640
Thua! There you are.

360
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,840
Why didn't you answer the phone?
I needed to talk.

361
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,040
Yeah, I needed to talk to you too. Bung,
I think our effort was in vain this time.

362
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,920
Someone took our credit.

363
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,280
Next time, we must take it more seriously.

364
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,560
- You got it. I'll--
- Good deeds should be credited.

365
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,000
And I won't let anyone take our credit.

366
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,800
- Okay, I'm going to--
- And mark my word, one day,

367
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,400
our "Please be generous" gang
will be famous.

368
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,760
We'll be a household name.
We'll be unmatched.

369
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,240
Okay, got it. Then--

370
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,320
I think we have to figure out
what to do next quickly. Let me think.

371
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,480
This is what I tried to tell you.

372
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,520
Let's help Granny find her son.

373
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,360
Where did she go to get Thua?
Why isn't she back yet?

374
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,040
Oh, I should check my phone.

375
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,800
I'm back!

376
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,480
It's time to eat.

377
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,120
- I'm starving.
- Hey, hold on.

378
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,920
Get Bung and Thua, so we can eat together.

379
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,040
I called them, but they didn't answer.

380
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,920
Can I not get them? I'm hungry.

381
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,040
I'll go.

382
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,000
I want to, but not now.

383
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,400
Why not?

384
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,520
We know nothing.

385
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,280
We have no information. We have no lead.

386
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
There's nothing.

387
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,480
Bung! Thua!

388
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:08,000
Do something then!
Leads won't come if you do nothing.

389
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,240
You did it for the other cases.

390
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,640
Why do you always have excuses
when it comes to her son?

391
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,440
It's not like that.

392
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,320
I have to solve cases
that are more important, more urgent.

393
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,560
How is her son not important?

394
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,880
I want to help the public first.
When we're more well-known,

395
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,640
our chance of finding her son
will be better.

396
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,120
Not true. Don't make excuses.

397
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,760
Finding her son won't get

398
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,440
you famous, won't matter, won't make
the news, so you're not interested.

399
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,200
That's not it.

400
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,880
Bung, Thua, pay attention to me.

401
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,040
Of course it is.
You pretend you want to help people,

402
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,000
but with Granny,

403
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,440
you never genuinely care about her.

404
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,240
- Don't say that.
- You're selfish.

405
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,320
I'm done with you two.

406
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,800
- How am I selfish?
- You never tried to find her son.

407
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,600
I never had to pay.

408
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,920
That was before. Now, you have to pay.

409
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,480
So boring. They keep fighting.

410
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,960
- What if I don't pay?
- Think it through.

411
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,120
You know who you're dealing with.

412
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,560
Who is fighting now?

413
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,760
If you don't pay,

414
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,400
your garage may get shut down.
Think it through.

415
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,000
I'll never be a part of this wickedness.

416
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,960
Yeah?

417
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,880
- We'll see.
- Hey.

418
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,640
Whoa, that's not good.

419
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,560
Hey.

420
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,400
Hey.

421
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,760
- Yes!
- Who's there?

422
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,160
Hey, did you have someone attack me?
Want to try me?

423
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,760
Whoa.

424
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,120
Drop it!

425
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,200
Or are you looking for trouble?

426
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,280
Who are you?

427
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,760
I'm an undercover police captain.

428
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,400
Huh?

429
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,000
You think I'm afraid?

430
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,000
You two can't do anything to me.

431
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,600
Try if you don't believe me.

432
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,120
Hey, I'm coming back.

433
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,720
Hey. You carry a gun these days?

434
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,600
Oh! What gun, boss?
I only had this. Buffalo horns.

435
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,360
To make fun of him.
"So stupid for believing that."

436
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,720
What are you doing here?

437
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,800
You're not laughing.

438
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,560
I came to look for Typhoon, but…

439
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,880
So, what happened earlier, boss?

440
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,800
Typhoon didn't come here today.
You can leave.

441
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,560
Hey, boss, what…

442
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,000
I didn't find the kid
or the answer I was looking for.

443
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,000
Ms. Kam?

444
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,160
You look stressed. Are you okay?

445
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,960
If you're uncomfortable,
you don't have to tell me.

446
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,160
I overheard my dad's phone conversation.

447
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,880
He was extorted for protection fees.

448
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,480
Pay or the garage would be closed.

449
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,000
Hey, Ms. Kam, this is very serious!

450
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,200
It is. I tried asking him about it,

451
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,680
but he tried to hide it.

452
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:36,000
I think Ah just didn't want you to worry.

453
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,480
But we're family.
We should confide in each other,

454
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,280
so we can figure it out together.

455
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,440
That's true. If he told you,
you might be able to help.

456
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,440
Like you telling me.
I figured it out right away.

457
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,040
Really? What did you figure out?

458
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,960
I figured out that we just won't pay them,

459
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,120
and we'll find a way to expose them.
We must remove bad people.

460
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,440
What can we do?

461
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,880
We don't even know who the collector is.
My dad wouldn't tell me.

462
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,640
Then we must ask for help.

463
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,040
Like the page "Please be gene--"

464
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,080
Just a sec.

465
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,240
Peem?

466
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,120
A meal?

467
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,040
Perfect. I wanted
your advice on something.

468
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,360
Thanks, Thua. I have to go see Peem.

469
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,640
Peem.

470
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,720
Here.

471
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,760
- It looks so yummy, Granny.
- Eat up.

472
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,880
Your omelet is the best in the world.

473
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
Really? He's a sweet talker.

474
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,360
You haven't eaten it.

475
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,080
Oh, Thua.

476
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,679
Typhoon's back.
Let's eat together. Sit down.

477
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,239
- Come on.
- Thua, sit down.

478
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:22,520
I believe now that pregnant women's
hormones are really violent.

479
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,480
It's not because of my hormones.
It's because of someone selfish.

480
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,480
Who's selfish now?

481
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,280
- You are!
- Wait.

482
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,159
For my sake,

483
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,120
please don't be mad at each other.
Please, guys.

484
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,719
I'd love to find your son.

485
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,000
If we get a chance, a lead,
or some information, I'll help right away.

486
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,320
But while we have nothing to go on,

487
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,960
if we come across someone in trouble,
can't we help them first?

488
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,320
If we focus on just our problems
and ignore other people,

489
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,760
won't we be seen as selfish?

490
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,360
I know. I can wait.

491
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,120
I trust you.

492
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,800
Phakbung,

493
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,920
I really appreciate your help.
I know you're worried about me.

494
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,000
I get it now.

495
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,680
I'm sorry.

496
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,560
I'm sorry too.

497
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,120
It was my fault for not

498
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,280
explaining it clearly.

499
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,920
Woohoo! You two made up.

500
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,720
So, I didn't have to run
and hide at the bus garage again.

501
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,880
Wait. That's right.

502
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,960
Ah's garage is in trouble.

503
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,720
- Huh?
- What trouble?

504
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,840
I overheard my dad's phone conversation,

505
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,680
that if he didn't pay protection fees,

506
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,520
his permit would be revoked.

507
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,680
Can you help me with that?

508
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,040
Don't worry, Kam.
I'll figure out a way to help you.

509
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,120
But first, we have to find out
who the collector is.

510
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,440
If they're that powerful,
then they're not regular folks.

511
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,080
Thank you very much, Peem.

512
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,320
Well, then I'm going to help you.

513
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,200
I'll try finding out from my dad.

514
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,920
If I find out who they are,
you'll be the first to know.

515
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,080
Okay.

516
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,520
So… I'm going to go.

517
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,000
- Sure.
- All right.

518
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,720
Find out who collects
protection fees from Ah's garage.

519
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,400
If they're that powerful,
we'll approach them.

520
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,520
Because right now, I need a new source
of money and power to back me.

521
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,400
We have to find the answer
before Peem does.

522
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,840
I won't let our credit get taken again.

523
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:02,440
If we find the answer first and post it
on our page, it'll all be over. That's it.

524
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,120
Whoa! Kam's here!

525
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,680
- Eh? Guys, hurry.
- Granny.

526
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,240
Ready?

527
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,760
That was close. Luckily, Granny
stopped time, so we could hide.

528
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,320
But what is Kam looking for?

529
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,320
She's probably also trying to find out
who the collector is.

530
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,880
There must be some proof.

531
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,720
Are you sure you really want to know?

532
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,600
Dad.

533
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,520
You knowing it won't help us.

534
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,600
You keep saying that.

535
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,120
Don't just assume that. Tell me

536
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,440
and I'll tell you if it will help.

537
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,520
The collector…

538
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,680
is Chief Khachon.

539
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
‪Chief Khachon?

540
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,880
Who's Chief Khachon?

541
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,400
Dad, I have to tell Peem to stop.

542
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,760
I asked him for help.

543
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,520
MS. KAM

544
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,000
You're just in time.

545
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,840
I was going to tell you
I found out who the collector was.

546
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,840
I'll take care of it.

547
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,280
You can't expose Chief Khachon.

548
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,720
What do you mean?

549
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,640
I'll be right there and explain it to you.

550
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,240
<i>All right.</i>

551
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,640
You understand me now, right?

552
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,040
Because it's Chief Khachon.

553
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,240
That's why I caved.

554
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,520
I'd rather close this garage…

555
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,400
than go against your grandfather.

556
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,080
- Huh? Grandfather?
- Huh?

557
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,400
<i>That's Chief Khachon.</i>
<i>What's in the sack his men are dragging?</i>

558
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,960
I took care of it.
But some people still resist.

559
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,320
Want me to deal with it?

560
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,320
<i>Don't tell me Chief Khachon will kill Ah.</i>

561
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,640
I want to have a father,
but I want my baby

562
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,280
to have a father too.

563
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,800
We must have Chief Khachon on our side

564
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,560
because he'll be crucial
to my political base.

565
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,000
NEXT EPISODE

566
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,120
Who are you guys?
