00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,960
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,600
Hey, are they all dead?

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,320
Hey, the wound's gone.

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,560
<i>Wow, I can stop time!</i>

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,760
<i>Thanks for lending me your space, Thua.</i>

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,360
Whoa. Where's her stuff?

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,480
Make way!

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,840
Hey! Did you hear Chong's house
was robbed last night?

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,120
Maybe they were the ones
who robbed my house.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,120
What do we do?

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,560
<i>Stop time, Granny.</i>
<i>Then we'll check out that house.</i>

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,360
<i>There may be leads.</i>

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,800
Hey! I got it!

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,440
Why would you snap your fingers?

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,280
Who's talking in there? Let's check.

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,600
Stop time.
Do it. Snap your fingers, Granny.

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,800
There's nothing, sir.

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,440
Make way!

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,280
Hey!

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,600
Did you hear Chong's house
was robbed last night?

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,160
Granny, it's the same as before.

22
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,920
Don't tell me…

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,120
Thua.

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,800
What just happened?

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,000
I should be asking you what happened.

26
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,440
Was your power broken, Granny?

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,720
Uh, it was probably just a little glitch.

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,600
But at least everything's normal now.

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,600
What's normal, Granny?

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,800
We were in the daytime just now,
but look, it's nighttime now!

31
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,880
Right.

32
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,520
Huh?

33
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,320
Huh? What?

34
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,760
The date is…

35
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,199
Hey!

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,520
This is yesterday, Granny!

37
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,560
Don't tell me.

38
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,240
You don't just stop time,
you can also turn it back?

39
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,720
Huh? Turn back time?

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,000
How can I turn back time?

41
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,800
Ugh! I don't know.

42
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,440
So, if we went back one day,

43
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,560
today should be the day…

44
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,200
The day before the lottery draw!

45
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,120
Hey, Thua!

46
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,920
Let's go buy lottery tickets!

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,920
We're going to win the first prize.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,600
Do you remember, though?

49
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,120
- What are the winning numbers?
- I think it ends with 642, Granny.

50
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,560
With 642?

51
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,480
No, Granny! We're following
a clue about the thief!

52
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,960
If we turned back one day,
then today must be the day…

53
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,200
- The thieves break into the house.
- See? You remembered, right?

54
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,240
- I didn't remember, but I saw it.
- Huh?

55
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,440
Eat, then break the door open.

56
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,360
No, I don't want to do it.

57
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,680
If you don't, your sister's going to die.

58
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,800
And don't mess with me.

59
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,840
Go, go.

60
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,520
Granny, that's the kid from the bus.

61
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,720
Yeah, yeah.

62
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,000
Hey, he has power like you!

63
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,840
That's right.

64
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,720
- Wait, wait, Thua.
- Huh?

65
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm going to stop time,
and we'll go help that kid.

66
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,960
Okay.

67
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,760
Granny, what's wrong?

68
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,440
Are you okay?

69
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,680
The air's cold. it feels like
I'm going to sneeze.

70
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,360
Granny, you can't sneeze! If you do,
the thieves will come. Hold it in!

71
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,000
Hey!

72
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,640
It's daytime already.

73
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,720
Granny, we're back in the present.

74
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Huh?

75
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,720
Do we travel through time
every time you sneeze?

76
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,200
Not just time travel,

77
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,680
I don't even know how we got home.

78
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,440
What's that sound?

79
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,360
Maybe…

80
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,080
Thua!

81
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,600
Should we call the police?

82
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,400
They're right here, Granny.
I need to catch them red-handed.

83
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,200
And get back at them
for making people think I am a thief.

84
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,120
But it's really dangerous.

85
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,600
What are we scared of, Granny?
It's the present now,

86
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,440
and we've got this, the hand to stop time.
All set, Granny.

87
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,360
Alright.

88
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,960
I couldn't snap in time.

89
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,440
Sorry.

90
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,320
Ouch, Granny. Ouch. Be gentle.

91
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,680
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

92
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,480
If you didn't mean to do this,

93
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,960
you could've been a national athlete
if you tried.

94
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,840
Please don't be mad at me, Granny.

95
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,080
Oh no, I'm not mad.

96
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,720
I'm praising you.

97
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,200
Modern women should have
a strong body and mind!

98
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,880
Two fingers up. Well done!

99
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,600
Ms. Kam, you can't do that.

100
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,320
I already said sorry. I didn't mean it.

101
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,680
I'm not talking about when you kicked me.

102
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,240
I mean, if I'd dodged it and countered,
what would I do?

103
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,400
You wouldn't have dodged in time.

104
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,760
Anyway, sorry for being rash.

105
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,840
I just wanted to come and make sure,

106
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,559
in case we find any clues or evidence
from the thieves.

107
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,440
I want to find something.

108
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,159
And I still want to trust you.

109
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,920
Well…

110
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,520
Kam, maybe you should go back for now.
If anything comes up, Thua will tell you.

111
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,480
- Okay, bye.
- Okay.

112
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,760
Thua, don't overthink it, son.

113
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,240
- Thua!
- Granny!

114
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,520
I'm going to do this
for Ms. Kam, for sure.

115
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Where did she go?

116
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,320
I saw you leave, thought you
were stressed, so I told her to go home.

117
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,840
Oh, no, Granny. I'm going to show
Ms. Kam that I'm also trying my best.

118
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,600
Oh. So, do you want me to call her back?

119
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,680
Do you think I look good?

120
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,560
You look good,

121
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,920
but don't let anyone else
see you like this.

122
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,160
Oh, come here. Sit down.
Your face is still red.

123
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,440
TEMPORARY SHELTER FOR FIRE VICTIMS
COMMUNITY SOI 12

124
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,400
Ah, just leave it here. Right here.

125
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,560
- Uncle Mern.
- Oh, Kam!

126
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,640
I'm here to update you
about the missing donations.

127
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,160
Right now…

128
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,640
It's okay.

129
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,880
Don't worry.

130
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,480
Peem's helping us with everything now.

131
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,760
Who's that?

132
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,840
Uncle, the donations are all set, right?

133
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,800
Yes, all done. Thanks a lot, Peem.

134
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,040
No problem.

135
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,400
So, who's this?

136
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,840
Oh, this is Kam, the one I told you about.

137
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,760
Kam, this is Peem,

138
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,680
the one who brought
all the donations to help us.

139
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,880
He's also finding
a place for all of us to stay.

140
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,200
Nice to meet you, Kam.

141
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,240
Uncle Mern said you've been
volunteering here for a long time.

142
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,880
I'm happy for everyone.

143
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,400
Anyway, please guide me along.

144
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,080
You…

145
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,600
Who are you?

146
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,880
Where are you from? How did you get here?

147
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,600
What have you done so far?
What's your purpose?

148
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,080
Are you trying to scam us?

149
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,400
Everyone here is struggling.

150
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,080
If you plan to do anything bad,

151
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,760
I won't let you get away with it.

152
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,080
Take it easy. Do I really
look like such a bad person?

153
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,000
Things like this can't be judged
by appearances.

154
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,280
I've trusted the wrong people before.

155
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,880
I won't make that mistake again.

156
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,440
Alright, if you don't trust me,

157
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,400
then just keep an eye on me.

158
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,680
What are you going to do?

159
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,520
And you still haven't answered
my questions.

160
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm just like you.

161
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,800
Uncle Mern said
when people are in trouble,

162
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,880
you always help them,
so I'm doing the same thing.

163
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,000
Wouldn't it be better to have someone else
help with serious issues?

164
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,520
Like that?

165
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,160
What's that about?

166
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,560
Mern said there's been a gathering
behind the temple.

167
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,840
He has reported it, but no progress yet.

168
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
A gathering?

169
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,240
This isn't related
to the recent robberies, right?

170
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,400
I'm not sure.

171
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,480
I've been trying to check
and gather more evidence.

172
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,840
But we need to hurry.

173
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,000
Because I heard a child's voice
behind the temple a few days ago.

174
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,720
A child?

175
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,600
- Let me go! I don't want to be a thief.
- Come!

176
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,520
- Let me go!
- Come on!

177
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,120
Ouch, I'll hit you!

178
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,040
Only people
with a heart of stone hurt children.

179
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,720
That's quite a mouth you have.

180
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,520
I hope you're not just all talk.

181
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,720
If you hurt me,

182
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,840
I'll die.

183
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,320
And if I die,

184
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,520
you won't get anything from us anymore.

185
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
Yeah.

186
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,960
When you become useless,
I won't keep you. Come.

187
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,840
- Ouch!
- Bung!

188
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,040
Hey!

189
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,280
If you don't work for us,

190
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,920
you and your sister
are useless. Want to try it now?

191
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,760
Come!

192
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,760
Typhoon!

193
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,080
It's okay, dear. It's okay.

194
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,000
All the sacred beings,

195
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,680
please send anyone to help us!

196
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,520
ROOM AVAILABLE, TEL: 099 2585192

197
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,440
Sadhu!

198
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,720
Next time, I want three
exact numbers. No combinations.

199
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,360
So I'll have money to use
when I'm with my son.

200
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,520
And I hope to reunite with my son soon.

201
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,680
- Granny, I know now. I know!
- Hm?

202
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,960
What?

203
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,880
I figured it out, Granny!

204
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,760
What did you figure out, Thua?

205
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,560
Even though we haven't located
the robbers,

206
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,440
we can look for that kid.

207
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,280
What kid?

208
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,000
The kid who has a power like you do.

209
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,520
When I locate the kid,
we'll locate the robbers.

210
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,320
And once we know where the robbers are,

211
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,640
we'll find the stuff they stole.

212
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,640
- Yeah!
- That way, Granny,

213
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,160
Kam will trust me again.

214
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,800
And where do we go to find that kid?

215
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,200
Hey!

216
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,960
Um, have you seen a kid this tall
around here?

217
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,280
- A little chubby.
- Yes, with messy hair.

218
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,320
Fair skin.

219
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,360
No, I haven't.

220
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,800
Excuse me. Have you seen this kid?

221
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,160
Oh, I haven't.

222
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,760
- Have you never seen him?
- Never.

223
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,800
Hey, ma'am, have you seen a small child
around here?

224
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,560
Fair skin,
probably around seven or eight years old?

225
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,680
I think they got on a bus a few days ago,
somewhere around here.

226
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,000
If you don't remember,
I can show you a picture.

227
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,560
Hey, what's going on?
Why is this taking so long?

228
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,360
Oh, nothing.
They're just looking for someone.

229
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,560
Yes, that's right. Um, young man,
have you seen a kid--

230
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,720
What kid?
There's no kid around here, okay?

231
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,480
- Understand? Go back home.
- Okay!

232
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,600
- Hurry up!
- Okay!

233
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,360
What kid are you talking about?

234
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,480
Did he get angry at us?

235
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,280
Let's take a break, Granny.

236
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,440
We've searched everywhere,

237
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,320
but we still haven't found anything.

238
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,400
Have you given up already?

239
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,680
Well, if we've been searching
for something for so long

240
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,960
and still haven't found it,

241
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,440
then it means…

242
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,680
It depends on how much you love them.

243
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,360
If you love them enough,

244
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,599
you'll keep searching until you find them.

245
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,560
Then, let's go to the house.

246
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,079
Huh?

247
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,680
The house that got robbed, remember?

248
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,680
If we go there,

249
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,000
we might find those robbers.

250
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,839
Or we might find that kid.

251
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,079
Alright, here's the plan.

252
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,800
When we get to that house,
please sneeze for me.

253
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,680
- Sure. Whatever happens, happens.
- Let's go!

254
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,600
Hey, Granny!

255
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,360
No sneezing!

256
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,000
If you sneeze right now,

257
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,280
who knows where we'll end up.

258
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,920
- Okay, focus.
- Focus!

259
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,880
Okay. That's right.

260
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,920
Granny, today's the 16th,

261
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,160
the day the bus crash happened.

262
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,520
We're looking for that kid,

263
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,080
so I was just thinking about
when we first met that kid,

264
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,560
which was…

265
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,960
Oh, wow, Granny, you're so smart!

266
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,840
- That kid!
- Miss!

267
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,920
Hey, wait for me! Miss!

268
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,880
That kid, and the girl!
Hey! Let's go, Thua.

269
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,800
Granny, no, we can't.

270
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,840
- What? Why?
- Have you ever heard of the Law of Time?

271
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,960
If we change the past,
it'll affect the future.

272
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,360
So, we can't mess with it.

273
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,040
I think we can only follow and see
how the kid ended up with the robbers.

274
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,480
Then we can help later.

275
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,040
- Oh, okay. Let's go.
- Let's go.

276
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,800
Oh!

277
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,080
- Let go. Ouch! No, let go!
- Let go!

278
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,280
- Let go! Ah! No, let go.
- Let us go!

279
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,040
- Ouch! Let us go!
- Ugh, come!

280
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,080
‪Come!

281
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,880
The robbers locked up those two kids here.

282
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,360
And they're probably being forced
to steal for them.

283
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,640
Yeah.

284
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,840
I think we need to do something.

285
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,720
Yeah, do whatever you need to do before…

286
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,720
Before what, Granny?

287
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,000
- Before…
- Before?

288
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,360
- Before…
- Before?

289
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,480
Granny!

290
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,160
- Granny, we're back in the present.
- Huh?

291
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,200
Yeah.

292
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,360
Wow, my nose is still irritated.

293
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,440
If I catch a cold, we'll be stuck
time-traveling all day and night.

294
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,120
You need to take medicine.

295
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,080
From now on, no getting sick,
no sneezing, okay?

296
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,040
This isn't just about
the robbers stealing stuff

297
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,600
or me making Ms. Kam angry

298
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,160
or even getting caught
by the police, Granny.

299
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,240
Right now, it's about the two kids
in the robbers' hands.

300
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,040
Hey, Thua, don't rush.

301
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,520
I think we should call the police.

302
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,840
We can't call the police, Granny.

303
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,240
If we tell them we time-traveled

304
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,840
and saw the robbers kidnap the kids,

305
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,120
or if we tell them we saw the robbers
forcing the kids to steal,

306
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,600
they won't believe us.

307
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,040
Right now,
the only thing we can trust is the power.

308
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,600
- Our power?
- It's yours, not ours.

309
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,720
Trust me, Officer.

310
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,080
You want me to believe your suspicion?

311
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,320
And you want to ask the court
for a search warrant?

312
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,840
I don't even need to go that far.
My boss will just yell at me.

313
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,080
This is about life and death.

314
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,160
Don't you understand?
We heard a child's voice!

315
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,280
Ms. Kam.

316
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,720
Please calm down.

317
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,680
Officer, if I find evidence,

318
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,320
could you issue a search warrant for me?

319
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,720
Well, if there's evidence, I might.

320
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,960
Alright.

321
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,440
I'll try to find it.

322
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,080
But do you know
that life and death can't wait?

323
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,320
If you find evidence before I do,

324
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,960
please notify me.

325
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,040
PHASATHORN PHONANKUN
PEEM

326
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,360
We're done here. You're free to go.

327
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,240
Why do we have to wait for a warrant?
Do we need to see a dead body first?

328
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,520
Calm down, Ms. Kam.

329
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,200
The law is there to protect the public.

330
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,120
If we could go around searching
people's houses without reason,

331
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,320
society would fall into chaos.

332
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,840
If we ask for permission to search,
we might be stirring up trouble.

333
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,760
So, what are you going to do?

334
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,760
Wait.

335
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,080
Who do they think they are,
making me report everything?

336
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,520
PHASATHORN PHONANKUN
PEEM

337
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,000
His last name is familiar. It's…

338
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,680
the last name of Pethai! Shit!

339
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,280
PRESIDENT
FORMER MP PETHAI PHONANKUN

340
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,600
<i>Pok</i> nine, double-deck!

341
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,520
‪Pay up!

342
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,080
- Oh, take it.
- Here.

343
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,600
- Hey, pay up!
- Give me.

344
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,880
Oh!

345
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,880
This is a robber's den.
There are so many of them here.

346
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,600
This is in the middle of the community.
How does no one know?

347
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,880
I think the stolen stuff

348
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,000
is definitely here.
They're guarding it heavily.

349
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,240
Then, where are those two kids?

350
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,760
Here!

351
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,000
The milk I hid, it's probably not much,

352
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,720
but it should be enough to help you
break down the door and fight the robbers.

353
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,560
Here's the plan. You need
to snap your fingers to stop time.

354
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,840
Once time is stopped,
we get in there and find the two kids.

355
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,520
When we do, we ask them
about the stolen stuff.

356
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,760
Got it.

357
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,920
Let's go!

358
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,960
- Hey, Granny!
- There they are!

359
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,040
Let's go!

360
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,600
Oh!

361
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,480
- The key!
- The key!

362
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,440
Hey!

363
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,920
Whoa!

364
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,160
Hey.

365
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,840
If I can, I'll call the police
to come and arrest them,

366
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,040
but we can't do it by ourselves.

367
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,800
What if there are four?

368
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,080
That might work.

369
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,560
How did you get here?

370
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,840
Is there an old robber?

371
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,840
Take it easy, take it easy.
We're not robbers.

372
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,840
You two might not recognize me and Thua.

373
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,120
But you two were on that bus.

374
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,240
That's right!

375
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,480
Now, I have a special power too.

376
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,280
I can stop time,
and that's how we got in here.

377
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,280
You can stop time?

378
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,720
Not just stop it,
she can reverse time as well.

379
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,120
Wow, Bung, that's awesome!

380
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,120
Can I even trust you?

381
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,400
Want to try trusting us?

382
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,080
- How?
- What will we do?

383
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,240
At first, I was going to help you escape,

384
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,360
but if we do that,
the robbers will follow us.

385
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,560
Plus, the secret about
your powers might get out.

386
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,120
So, I think there's only one option left.

387
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,320
Thank you for the ride.

388
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,280
I should be thanking you, Ms. Kam.
Like I said,

389
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,240
I just came back from abroad,
and I don't know many people here yet.

390
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,080
But I think other people
must know you well, Peem.

391
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,000
What do you mean?

392
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,920
Your last name is the same
as the ex-MP Pethai.

393
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,720
Oh, the ex-MP Pethai is my mother.

394
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,920
I see. Now I understand
what you're waiting for.

395
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,400
Once people know who you are,

396
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,080
they'll start moving on their own.

397
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,680
Uh, I didn't mean to use
my influence like that, Ms. Kam.

398
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,040
No need to explain. I'm not mad at you.

399
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,120
What happened

400
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,840
isn't because of you or your mother.

401
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,520
It's what the police, the government,
and everyone should do.

402
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,280
You're different from everyone I've met.

403
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,840
You really surprised me.

404
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,360
But I don't want to be different.

405
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,840
I want everyone to be equal.

406
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,600
That's why I do volunteer work.

407
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,600
Thank you. I'll remember that.

408
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,960
Well, thank you again for the ride.

409
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,640
My pleasure. I hope…

410
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,360
No.

411
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,520
We will meet again, right?

412
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,120
- I'll go now.
- Yes.

413
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,120
Did you hear it clearly, Phakbung?

414
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,480
<i>Yes, I heard it, Granny.</i>

415
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,560
I hope you hear it all the time.

416
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,520
We'll know where the robbers have been,

417
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,080
and we'll catch them red-handed!

418
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,480
Here they come, Bung.

419
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,560
Be careful.

420
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,960
Get up, now!

421
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,760
Come now!

422
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,560
Hey. Can I come with you?

423
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,200
Did I ever say you could come?

424
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,880
Guys! But this time, I have a feeling.

425
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,640
It's a bad feeling!

426
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,680
Or can you tell me
where you're going to rob?

427
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,000
I'll chant a prayer for you.

428
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,760
I'm worried about my brother.

429
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,000
Come on, guys.

430
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,080
You know that Typhoon
has special powers, right?

431
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,200
I have them too!

432
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,920
I can calculate

433
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,320
auspicious time for travel.

434
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,480
Huh?

435
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,160
If you guys don't tell us where
you're going to rob, I'm not going.

436
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,400
If Bung has a bad feeling like this,

437
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,200
I'm not going to go. It's too scary.

438
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,560
Yeah.

439
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,840
What should we do?

440
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,880
What if she actually has a special power?

441
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,560
Then calculate if today's
right for robbing…

442
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,440
<i>Then calculate if today's</i>
<i>right for robbing</i>

443
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,800
<i>Ah's house.</i>

444
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,680
Ah's house? That's Ms. Kam's house!

445
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,960
That's right. What should we do?

446
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,560
And Ah isn't home tonight!

447
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,040
Oh no. What do we do now?

448
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,320
Thua, quickly, call the police!

449
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,720
It's too late, Granny.

450
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,480
- I'll go to Ms. Kam. You call the police.
- Hey.

451
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,400
- I'm off!
- Wait! Thua!

452
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,360
What are you going to do?

453
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,440
You don't have any special power! Thua!

454
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,720
Oh! Ms. Kam!

455
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,760
Ms. Kam!

456
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,360
Oh, you think you're tough?
Well, here's what you get!

457
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,480
You traitor! Your sister's dead for sure!

458
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,880
What should we do, Thua?

459
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,640
We have to stop them!

460
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,520
If you think you can harm Ms. Kam,
you'll have to get through me first!

461
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,720
- Who's Kam?
- Two people, whoever.

462
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,240
If you're so tough, come at me!

463
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,040
- Follow him!
- Come here!

464
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,920
Much easier this way.

465
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,680
Wait, wait!

466
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,160
It was just a fluke!

467
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,800
Hurry up! Hurry! Ugh!

468
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,960
Enough. Enough for what?
Whoa, that didn't even hit you.

469
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,360
Hey, come here!

470
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,760
Come here!

471
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,600
Where are you going?

472
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,040
Where are you going?

473
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,160
You think just because Ah isn't here,

474
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,280
you can come and mess with us easily?

475
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,080
Seng! What about Ms. Kam?

476
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,480
Ms. Kam left earlier.
Someone picked her up.

477
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,360
Peem. Seng.

478
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,440
A police officer called me.

479
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,120
He said a good citizen reported that
robbers plan to rob your house tonight,

480
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,800
so I thought I should get you
out of here first.

481
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,080
And they told me to stay here
and wait for the police.

482
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,600
But I'm a fighter.

483
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,680
I'm not just going to hide like that.

484
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,360
So, who's Ms. Kam with?

485
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,200
Peem!

486
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,000
They're dealing with the robber's den
behind the temple.

487
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,600
Can you watch my brother?
I'll be back soon.

488
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,200
Please save Bung, Thua!

489
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,880
Don't worry.

490
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,960
I'm here. These guys are finished.

491
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,800
- Come here.
- Ouch!

492
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,120
Walk!

493
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,000
Walk! Go!

494
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,200
Ms. Kam, you're okay, right?

495
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,840
I'm upset to find out
your sister got kidnapped

496
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,560
and you didn't tell me anything.

497
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,200
No wonder your granny came.
You wanted to help your sister, right?

498
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,520
Sister?

499
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,200
- Well…
- Sister?

500
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,680
Um, Ms. Kam came with the police.

501
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,400
Once she helped Phakbung,
she called me to let me know.

502
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,960
- Oh.
- Right.

503
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,680
- Thank you so much, Ms. Kam.
- You're welcome.

504
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,160
How's Typhoon doing?

505
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,600
He's fine, Granny. I left him
with Seng at Ms. Kam's house.

506
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,360
You should thank Peem for this, Thua.

507
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,760
He helped us catch the robbers.

508
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,239
Kam, I actually want
to thank the good citizen

509
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,520
who called about the robbers.

510
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,000
Not only did we catch them,

511
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,679
but we also arrested the whole gang.

512
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,760
Peem!

513
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,719
I want to ask if you can tell the police

514
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,120
to help find the stolen donations
from Thua's house.

515
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,639
Of course. I'll take care of it.

516
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,639
Thank you.

517
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,960
Ms. Kam's safe. That's what matters.

518
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,960
Like a flower and a--

519
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,080
Wait, Thua!

520
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,440
What happened to your face?

521
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,440
Let me get you some medicine.

522
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,320
Heaven hasn't been too cruel to me.

523
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,240
Follow her. What are you waiting for?

524
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,840
Go, go, go!

525
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,080
Don't move!

526
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,560
What did you do to get
all beaten up like that?

527
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,880
If you treat the wound,

528
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,640
it's worth it.

529
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,800
Huh? What did you say?

530
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,600
I did it too roughly?

531
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,120
No, no, not at all.

532
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,680
Okay!

533
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,400
Ms. Kam, we checked everything.
No donations were found.

534
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,520
- Huh? None?
- Yes.

535
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,200
How's that possible?

536
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,960
Nothing.

537
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,880
It's not here either.

538
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,840
Jeez!

539
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,480
Nothing!

540
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,280
How's it going, Typhoon? Any pain?

541
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,120
- No wound.
- Good.

542
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,920
But…

543
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,440
What's up with Thua?
He keeps walking around in circles.

544
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,920
Ugh, nothing. It's gone!

545
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,440
Hey, Granny, I'm freaking out.

546
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,280
Ugh, my head hurts.

547
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,400
You keep walking around,
crawling in and out, back and forth.

548
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,800
The stuff's gone.

549
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,520
The donations are gone.

550
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,840
Let's stop looking for now.

551
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,960
It's too late, Granny.

552
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,680
If I don't find it today,
I'm going to jail.

553
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,040
‪Thua!

554
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,440
I promised Kam I'd take responsibility,

555
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,360
and if I can't find it,
I'll turn myself in.

556
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,080
Really? Is it that serious?

557
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,160
As a man, I have to keep my word.

558
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,840
If the robbers didn't take the donations,

559
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,560
then who did it?

560
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,400
I don't know.

561
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,160
But they're gone from my house.

562
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,000
I'll take responsibility for it.

563
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,320
You can call the police to arrest me.

564
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:22,280
If you're willing to go to jail,
it means you're admitting you took them.

565
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,720
Thua!

566
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,920
- I found them! They're here!
- Thua!

567
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,840
Thua, come here quickly!

568
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,320
Where's Thua going?
Come here and see this!

569
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,960
Hurry up! They're here!

570
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,320
What?

571
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,760
Hey, what's this? How did this happen?
Is this real?

572
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,160
The police said they didn't find anything.

573
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,200
They weren't there earlier,
but they're now.

574
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,440
It was covered with cloth.

575
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,160
When we lifted it, we found everything.
Such a mess.

576
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,600
- Yes, yes!
- Yes!

577
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,480
We found the donations!
So, you don't have to go to jail, right?

578
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,280
Exactly. Now I don't have
to take the fall for the thieves.

579
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,480
Yes!

580
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,480
Thua!

581
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,160
I'm sorry.

582
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,880
Because of me, you got fired.

583
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,200
If you still want to come back to work,

584
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,680
I'll talk to Dad for you.

585
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,320
Or if you want help finding a new job,

586
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,400
just let me know.

587
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,280
I really feel bad about this.

588
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,960
It's okay, Ms. Kam.

589
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,880
As long as you know
I'm not the one to blame,

590
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,440
that's enough for me.

591
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,680
No, I made a mistake,
and I have to make up for it.

592
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,080
Let me help you.

593
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,680
Well, how about this?

594
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,840
What do you want to do?

595
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,680
I can do anything.

596
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,120
As long as I can be close to you, Ms. Kam.

597
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,760
<i>Well, who can resist, right?</i>

598
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,080
<i>Peem is such a good guy.</i>

599
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,560
<i>I'm going to do better than Peem.</i>

600
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,880
<i>And this is our chance.</i>

601
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,600
<i>People like us can use our powers</i>
<i>to make society better.</i>

602

00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,320
What's the name of hero page?

"Please be generous!"
