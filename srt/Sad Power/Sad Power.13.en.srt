1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,880
Contact this woman.
She applied to be my assistant.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,120
I’ll interview her myself.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,000
What are you planning to do, Mr. Peem?

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,160
She's close with the media,
which could be useful for us.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,000
<i>I’ll help you, Peem.</i>

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,760
My dad is the head
of the TV news department.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,800
I’ll talk to him and get some reporters
to cover your story.

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,600
Thank you very much,

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,680
my new assistant.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,640
PREVIOUSLY

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,200
Who's next to your boyfriend?

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,920
I have to see it for myself.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,040
Ms. Kam!

14
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,880
This is crossing the line.

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,400
‪-Argh!
‪-Ms. Kam!

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,240
What's going on? Why did everything stop?

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,120
Even the watch’s stopped ticking.

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,680
Can you stop time, Granny?

19
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,800
Or are you one
of the "Please be generous" heroes?

20
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,080
<i>We’re the real</i>
<i>"Please be generous" heroes.</i>

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,600
<i>But please don’t be mad.</i>

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,880
<i>We had to keep it a secret for a reason.</i>

23
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,320
<i>Oh, I’m so excited!</i>

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,360
Tonight, I’ll definitely
have sweet dreams.

25
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,200
From now on, if you ever need our help,
just let us know.

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,240
We’re ready to use our powers
to help you, Kam.

27
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,280
Let me take a photo too.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,240
Thank you.

29
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,400
Look at the camera and smile, please.
One, two, three.

30
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,240
- It's done.
- Thank you very much.

31
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,720
You're welcome.

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,720
- Be careful while you walk.
- Take your time.

33
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,360
It's very hot. Don't make me
do this again next month.

34
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,080
Make them come get it at the foundation.

35
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,800
That's not a good idea, Wit.

36
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,440
They have disabilities.
It's more difficult for them to travel.

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,280
If it's too tiring for you,
you don't have to come.

38
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,560
Chitra and I will take care of it.

39
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,360
There's only three households left now.
I'll give it to them myself.

40
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,000
Thank you, Pong.

41
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,520
Okay.

42
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,360
Oh, Mr. Wit. What a coincidence.

43
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,560
- Hello.
- Hello.

44
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,680
This is Mr. Wit, manager
of the San Karun Foundation.

45
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,240
Wit, this is Mr. Peem, a prospective MP.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,040
I'm just a candidate, Nutty.

47
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,640
Hello, Mr. Wit.

48
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,480
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Peem.

49
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,640
They mainly help people with disabilities,

50
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,480
giving out food and other necessities.

51
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,160
They also have
vocational training programs.

52
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,960
That's very good.

53
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,760
They're part of our society,
and we shouldn't leave them out.

54
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,920
Let's work together
when an opportunity arises.

55
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,920
I'm sure that day will come.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,440
Tomorrow, we are holding
an art auction to raise additional funds.

57
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,920
So, please take these brochures.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,160
Sure.

59
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,960
If you have time,
you're invited, Mr. Peem.

60
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,520
- Sure.
- Then, please excuse us.

61
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,720
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

62
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,120
I'm booked tomorrow.

63
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,440
Is it important?

64
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,000
If not, you should go to this event.

65
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,520
This event will create
a good image for you.

66
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,960
Trust me.

67
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,400
DONATE VIA QR CODE

68
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,960
DONATE TO SAN KARUN FOUNDATION

69
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,720
Over a million?

70
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,480
Whoa. Superb.

71
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,800
What are you doing?

72
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,120
Oh.

73
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,920
I just donated some money
to the San Karun Foundation.

74
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,560
My daughter is all dressed up
and pretty today.

75
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,880
What happened? But don't tell me.

76
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,760
It's because I did a good deed.

77
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,880
That's why the good karma
makes my daughter instantly pretty.

78
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,120
Come on, Dad.

79
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,480
Where are you going?

80
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,840
Are you going on a date with Peem?

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,760
You know me too well.

82
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,320
You're here, Peem?

83
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,200
<i>Kam, I can't go see you today.</i>

84
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,160
What?

85
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,480
My mother and I need to take care
of something. I'm sorry, Kam.

86
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,560
That's too bad. We haven't got
to spend much time together lately.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,320
What is it that you need to do?
Can I help? That way, we can meet too.

88
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,640
I don't think it's a good idea.

89
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,440
It's not very convenient.

90
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,840
How come?

91
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's talk later, Kam. I gotta go.

92
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,360
Peem?

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,560
Hello? Peem.

94
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,720
Peem went with his mom.

95
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,120
Ah.

96
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,760
Peem went with his mom.

97
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,320
I shouldn't be upset.

98
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,640
She doesn't seem well.
And she said she didn't need our help?

99
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,160
Guys, let's make Ms. Kam feel better.
Come on.

100
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,280
Kam, this is the info about that woman.

101
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,840
Her father is an editor at a news agency.
He's in charge of politics.

102
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,840
She's a graduate from
the Faculty of Communication Arts.

103
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,200
Peem is probably close with her

104
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,000
because of work. I don't think
there's anything more going on.

105
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,440
What's going on?

106
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,120
You seemed to be worried,

107
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,720
so we wanted to help.

108
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,720
But it's a shame that's all we can do.

109
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,160
But if there's anything we can do,

110
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,640
we'll do it immediately.

111
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,000
Right.

112
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,760
Thank you.

113
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,000
I feel so much better now.

114
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,720
At least someone cares about me.

115
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,880
Of course, someone cares.
Especially Thua--

116
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,720
You've helped us many times, Ms. Kam.

117
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,440
We want to help you too. This is nothing.

118
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,240
Alright, I'll stop worrying.

119
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,600
That's good.

120
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,040
Do you want to go anywhere or do anything?

121
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,720
We'll go with you.

122
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,640
If you have something to do,
you won't have time to overthink things.

123
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,520
Wanna go?

124
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,880
What should we do?

125
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,360
My nose is about to fall off.

126
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,919
<i>Today's auction attracted many</i>
<i>important people. Even Mr. Peem is here.</i>

127
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,039
Peem?

128
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,080
He said he was with his mother!

129
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,680
SAN KARUN FOUNDATION ART AUCTION

130
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,960
Please stay calm, Ms. Kam.

131
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,600
Maybe it's nothing.

132
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,080
Lovers should trust each other.

133
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,640
Just talk it out nicely.

134
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,640
Okay.

135
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,240
I'll stay calm

136
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,200
if his reason is good enough.

137
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,880
Let me talk to him privately.

138
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,440
Okay. We'll wait around here then.

139
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Thank you, Mr. Peem, for joining.

140
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,600
Your mother has changed a lot, Peem.

141
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,640
Kam.

142
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,560
Kam, come here.

143
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,160
Kam, how did you get here?

144
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,280
Why did you lie to me?

145
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,680
I'm really here for work. I didn't lie.

146
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,240
Then, where's your mother?
I'll go say hello.

147
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,040
She left.

148
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,080
I called your mother before I got here.

149
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,920
She's overseas.
She'll come back next week.

150
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,800
If there's really nothing between you
and Nutty, why did you lie to me?

151
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,520
Hey.

152
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,360
Kam, don't ruin my image
in front of others.

153
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,720
If you don't respect me as your boyfriend

154
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,840
and keep finding fault with me,

155
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,600
I don't think we can talk this through.

156
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,560
I'm here to apologize.

157
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,200
I thought you stopped talking to me.

158
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,400
Why would I do that?

159
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,440
Let's make up.

160
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,880
I can forgive you, Peem,

161
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,880
if your reason is good enough.

162
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,200
Kam,

163
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,120
no one is as important to me as you are.

164
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,400
Because I'm important,

165
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,120
so you lied to me?

166
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,960
That's a weird reason.

167
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,280
But it's alright. I understand.

168
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,320
Just…

169
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,520
give me some time.

170
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,360
Time? For what?

171
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,280
To be honest, I don't like
how I've been lately.

172
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,040
Let's give each other some space,

173
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,800
so I can reflect on things.

174
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,200
Guys, if Ms. Kam drops by today,

175
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,200
don't mention Peem. Got it?

176
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,680
I don't want her to feel bad. Okay?

177
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,480
Okay. What about you, Thua? You okay?

178
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,080
Why wouldn't I be okay?

179
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,480
Well, you like Kam.

180
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,560
It has nothing to do with me.

181
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,520
If Peem and Kam break up,

182
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,000
you should be happy.

183
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,800
Hey, don't say that.

184
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,640
I just want the person I like to be happy.

185
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,160
I don't want to see her miserable.

186
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,960
Are we on the same page here?

187
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,480
Wow, you're a true gentleman.

188
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,600
Alright, okay.

189
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,120
Then let's lighten up Kam's mood today.

190
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,920
Great.

191
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,560
By the way,

192
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,120
don't we have to look into Nutty anymore?

193
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,280
No, you don't.

194
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,760
Everything is clear now. There's no need.

195
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,440
- Kam.
- Kam.

196
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,360
Ms. Kam, when did you come in?

197
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,320
Well, since…

198
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,240
"Let's lighten up Ms. Kam's mood."

199
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,360
That's a relief.

200
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,840
I don't want to overthink anymore.

201
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,440
I want to reflect on things.

202
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,000
That's why I asked Peem for some space.

203
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,560
We haven't broken up yet.

204
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,800
Don't make that face.

205
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,040
And I'm fine.

206
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,720
Your eyes are not swollen,
and your nose isn't red.

207
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,000
Plus, your makeup looks even prettier
than yesterday.

208
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,760
No matter how bad it gets, you shouldn't
forget to love yourself, right?

209
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,760
That's how it should be, Ms. Kam.

210
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,800
No matter what you decide,

211
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,080
every one of us will always
be by your side.

212
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,560
Thank you.

213
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,880
But I didn't come here today
to talk about this.

214
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,520
I'd like to ask you a favor.

215
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,800
All done.

216
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,840
You're now the second admin
of the "Please be generous" page.

217
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,520
Whoa.

218
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,600
I'll be in your care. I will work hard.

219
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,720
Sure.

220
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,680
Since you're our latest member,

221
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,160
please respect your seniors.

222
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,000
This junior will buy you snacks every day.

223
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,000
Brilliant.

224
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,520
So, what does my costume look like?

225
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,280
Oh, you don't need a costume.

226
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,040
You don't have powers.
You don't have to go fight with us.

227
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,720
Thua doesn't have powers either.
How come he can go with you?

228
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,720
Come on, Ms. Kam.

229
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,440
I'm a man.

230
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,000
I've been through many fights
and many falls.

231
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,680
If you come with us,
we'll be worried about you.

232
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,080
That's right.

233
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
Heroes need good backup.

234
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,320
It's like a soccer team
that needs a good manager.

235
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,840
I think you should stay here, Kam.

236
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,360
It's the best option.

237
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,520
Okay.

238
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,040
Alright, let's do it.

239
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,480
Our new admin is really energetic.

240
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,440
Someone asked for help.

241
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,560
Hmm?

242
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,040
The San Karun Foundation has a problem.

243
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,080
Something is up.

244
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,160
THE SAN KARUN FOUNDATION'S
BANK ACCOUNT GOT HACKED

245
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,280
THE SCAMMERS STOLE ALL THEIR MONEY

246
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,200
"The San Karun Foundation's
bank account got hacked.

247
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,520
The scammers stole all their money."

248
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,880
What? What about the money I donated?

249
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,880
They stole it too.

250
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,680
So, what does the news say?
How much was stolen?

251
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,680
Six million.

252
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,920
Six million? Whoa.

253
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,560
Hey.

254
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,040
How much did you donate?

255
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,080
Two thousand.

256
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,840
- That's a relief.
- They're horrible.

257
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,600
These scammers even stole
from a foundation.

258
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,560
Then, what will happen
to the disabled people they're helping?

259
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,840
They can no longer help them
'cause they have no money.

260
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,400
It's not just the disabled people.

261
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,359
The foundation itself
is gonna have a problem.

262
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,480
They have to pay water
and electricity bills, rent, and stuff.

263
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,319
I guess the employees won't even get paid.

264
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,800
Gosh.

265
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,440
This is a big problem.

266
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,720
You're right.

267
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,800
<i>This is urgent.</i>

268
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,200
We must find the culprit and return
the money to the foundation.

269
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,560
Granny, what should we do?

270
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,920
Hacking is not something
my little brain can handle.

271
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,960
Don't be discouraged.

272
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,800
We're heroes. There must be a way.

273
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,880
The newbie is burning with passion.

274
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,520
What do we do now?

275
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,720
To find the culprit, we need to know
how they took the money.

276
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,240
Are you ready, everyone?

277
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,360
I've been ready since yesterday.

278
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,760
Let's go.

279
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,200
Wait. Hey.

280
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,040
Can you wait a bit?

281
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,480
Stay and help.

282
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,480
Hey, guys.

283
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,440
No, we're not staying.

284
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,680
Can't you stay and help for now? Please?

285
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,360
Don't go yet.

286
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
Just let them go.

287
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,960
If they don't want to help, let them go.

288
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,240
What's going on?

289
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,680
Since the foundation have no money,

290
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,640
all the volunteers and staff quit.

291
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,320
You can't really blame them, Wit.

292
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,240
Money is essential for everyone.
They probably needed to do it.

293
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,640
So, apart from

294
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,760
Mr. Wit and Ms. Chit,

295
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,840
everyone else has quit?
How can the foundation continue like this?

296
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,200
Actually, there's one more left.

297
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,240
Oh, Pong is over there.

298
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,280
As soon as we heard the news,
we rushed here.

299
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,880
Maybe we can help with something.

300
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,680
Thank you very much.

301
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,280
But we haven't opened
a new bank account yet.

302
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,760
If you would like to donate money,

303
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,240
it has to be in cash.

304
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,120
Well, we mean, we can volunteer.

305
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,120
Perfect. We're selling things
to pay electricity bills.

306
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,640
If you all can help,
we should be able to sell a lot.

307
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,880
I think

308
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,880
the culprit must be one of these three.

309
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,960
Don't you think it's the typical scammers,
like call center gangs?

310
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,000
Then, shall we do this?
Let's split up to investigate.

311
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,520
Ms. Kam, you go with Pong.

312
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,480
Granny, you go with Mr. Wit.

313
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
I'll go with Ms. Chitra.

314
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,840
Good idea. Let's stick with them
one-on-one to gain info.

315
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,800
Get them to talk a lot.
Don't make them suspicious.

316
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,080
Okay.

317
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,040
Ready?

318
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,120
- Let's go.
- Okay.

319
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,960
Didn't they say we're the fighting team?
Why do we have to wait at home?

320
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,840
Gosh.

321
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,600
Put that down, Phoon.

322
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,160
Don't use your power for nothing.
We'll be doomed when we need it.

323
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,640
I'm bored.

324
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,120
- But this job is not suitable for us.
- Tsk.

325
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,440
You're bored?

326
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,600
Should I give you a math problem?

327
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,520
Let's solve math problems.

328
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,240
- What?
- I'm not bored anymore.

329
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,000
You still have to do it.

330
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,560
Stop!

331
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,920
Sit down.

332
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,080
What about you, Bung?

333
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,960
You're not feeling nauseous today?
Have you taken your supplements?

334
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,080
Dr. Korn will scold you.

335
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,320
- There, there. Bye-bye.
- Don't change the subject. Give it to me.

336
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,800
Jeez, Phoon.

337
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,080
I wonder how Thua is doing right now.

338
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,200
Any progress?

339
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,880
Please help buy
from the San Karun Foundation.

340
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,600
- You get to help disabled people too.
- This way, mister.

341
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,920
Sure, which would you like?

342
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,960
How much is it?

343
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,840
Sixty baht, sir.

344
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,640
Which would you like? Feel free to choose.

345
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,000
I'll take this. Sixty baht.

346
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,520
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

347
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,640
- Thank you.
- Here, keep it.

348
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,880
Hey, I'm glad you're here to help me.

349
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,640
If I was here alone,
I wouldn't be able to sell anything.

350
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,360
So, what did the police say
about the bank account?

351
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,080
The police said the money
was transferred only once.

352
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,600
All the money was withdrawn in one go.

353
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,520
After that, the account was closed.

354
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,160
Only once?

355
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,480
Yes.

356
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,080
Uh…

357
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,760
- Is something wrong?
- Yeah?

358
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,360
Oh. Uh, no.

359
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,720
I don't get to see
good-looking men very often.

360
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,280
Well, about the stolen money…

361
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,000
Hello?

362
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,600
Delivery?

363
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,280
You're in front of the foundation now?

364
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,040
Yes.

365
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,080
Uh, how much again?

366
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,040
Okay, I'll wire it to you. Just a sec.

367
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,200
There's only about 300 baht
left in his account.

368
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,120
He's definitely not the culprit.

369
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,680
Yes. I've wired it to you. Please check.

370
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,600
Okay, thank you.

371
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,120
You won't get paid.
Why are you still working here?

372
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,960
I can't quit this job.
Do you know what's sad

373
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,680
about disabled people?

374
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,080
Of course, I know.

375
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,280
If you're missing body parts,
it's difficult to live.

376
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,720
That's not all.

377
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,720
They want to live a good life like others.

378
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,200
And they try very hard,

379
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,400
but they don't get much opportunity.

380
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,000
The foundation gives them opportunities,
help, and teaches them vocational skills.

381
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,600
That's still not enough.

382
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,720
Because there are many groups
that haven't received any help.

383
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,040
Plus, those who have everything
take advantage of them too.

384
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,080
How's it? Is it enough
to pay electricity bills?

385
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,320
It's just over a thousand baht.

386
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,840
Have you discussed
what you're going to do next?

387
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,360
First of all, I have to open
a new account for the foundation,

388
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,640
so we can have a real income.

389
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,600
This time, when we have the money,

390
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,640
please spend it on the right things.

391
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,200
Watch your mouth, Pong.

392
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,440
Stop it.

393
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,680
We have enough to worry about.

394
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,040
Both of you,

395
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,240
stop fighting.

396
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,880
Are they fighting about something?

397
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,880
Always.

398
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,160
They never agree on anything.
They fight all the time.

399
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,520
What a bummer. My power can't help anyone.

400
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,880
We can't help the disabled people.

401
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,960
If we could help,

402
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,760
so many people wouldn't have gotten hurt.

403
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,640
Why did we receive the powers though?

404
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,600
And how? I'm starting to wonder.

405
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,320
Right.

406
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,120
I'm wondering about that too.

407
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,840
Why did we get them?

408
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,720
That's a lot of money!

409
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,400
I'm sorry.

410
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,240
- Let me help.
- No. It's okay.

411
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,680
It's okay.

412
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,640
So, you spent all day investigating

413
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,600
but got nothing.

414
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,440
We just started.

415
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,600
We all know this case is difficult.

416
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,400
It's alright, guys.
Let's try again tomorrow.

417
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,240
Huh? That means

418
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,920
I have to stay home again tomorrow?

419
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,880
That's no fun.

420
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,600
I want to go out and beat up bad guys.

421
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,480
You only use force.

422
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,080
There's not only one way
to solve a problem.

423
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,800
Sometimes you have to use this.

424
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,040
Use what?

425
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,440
Your brain, of course.

426
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,080
Well, I'm not good with that.

427
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,040
That's why you must
go to school next year.

428
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,080
The cases can come in all forms.

429
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,000
If we want to help people,
we have to be able to do everything.

430
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,080
Even though it's hard, we have to do it.

431
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,560
For our great ideals.

432
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,680
For the society, for everyone,
for justice.

433
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,320
That's right, Ms. Kam. I totally agree.

434
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,040
The first and the second admins
seem to get along very well.

435
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,520
You come to us every day.

436
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,320
You can't work at the garage.

437
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,680
Is Ah okay with it?

438
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,000
It's okay. I can work
on the documents at night.

439
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,640
Huh? At night?

440
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,440
Don't tell me you'll keep working
after you get there.

441
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,200
Are you getting enough sleep?

442
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,920
Take care of your health.

443
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,920
Thanks.

444
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,000
And thank you so much
for letting me join your team.

445
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,240
I'm very happy.

446
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,160
If you're happy,

447
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,760
I'm happy.

448
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,720
Do you feel better now?

449
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,720
About Peem?

450
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,120
I'm not trying to pry or anything,

451
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,880
but I really worry about you.

452
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,240
Thanks.

453
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,520
I don’t know why,
but I feel so at ease when I’m with you.

454
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,280
What's wrong?

455
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,640
Something got in my eye.

456
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,440
Don't rub it. It can cut your cornea.

457
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,680
Stay still. Let me take a look.

458
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,440
Oh, it's a lash.

459
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,120
Wait a sec. I'll get it out for you.

460
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,040
Good morning, Dad. I'm off.

461
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,120
Where are you going?

462
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,000
You haven't been helping me
with work lately.

463
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,680
I'm helping The San Karun Foundation.

464
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,440
Don't worry. All the money you donated
won't be in vain.

465
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,840
I love you, Dad.

466
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,480
What's got into her?

467
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,880
Oh, you're not leaving?

468
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,760
Dad, help me with something.

469
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,120
What?

470
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,680
Tell Peem I'm not here.

471
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,920
What? Peem is here?

472
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,600
- Where is he?
- His car's parked over there.

473
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,280
Please, Dad. Help me.

474
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,080
Please.

475
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,960
Alright.

476
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,640
Peem.

477
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,560
Let's talk later, Nutty.

478
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,280
I'm not in the mood to talk now.

479
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,320
But I think you should see this video
as soon as possible.

480
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,920
Don't you think these two look familiar?

481
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,000
Kam.

482
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,840
The foundation's account wasn't hacked?

483
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,840
That's right.

484
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,640
- Thua, Kam, the police are here.
- Are there any leads?

485
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,040
Uh, any updates, Mr. Wit?

486
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,040
Yes.

487
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,800
The police told me
the account wasn't hacked.

488
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,400
- Huh?
- What?

489
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,960
How did you know it wasn't hacked?

490
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,280
The foundation's account
is a legal entity's account.

491
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,680
To transfer money,
you have to enter two passwords.

492
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,000
Chitra should enter the first one.

493
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,760
And I'm the one to enter
the second to approve.

494
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,560
These two passwords are different.

495
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,840
I don't know Chitra's password,
and she doesn't know mine.

496
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,760
We found that

497
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,440
both passwords were entered correctly,

498
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,360
without failed attempts,
and without using any software.

499
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,720
That means the culprit
knows both passwords.

500
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,400
How? Have you and Chitra
told anyone the passwords?

501
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,480
No.

502
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:09,120
Because I know
this is the highest level of security.

503
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,280
But wait.

504
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,880
Uh, Thua, let's follow them.

505
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,120
Where is it? Not this one.

506
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,480
It's light blue.

507
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,360
Here it is.

508
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,760
Here.

509
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,080
My password is in here.

510
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,440
But you said Chitra
doesn't have your password?

511
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,520
There's this one time

512
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,440
when we had to transfer money urgently.

513
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,840
I had no internet back then,

514
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,920
so I had to tell Chitra the password.

515
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,960
But she promised to delete it.

516
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,000
Why did she write it down?

517
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,800
Dammit.

518
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,159
I don't wanna wait anymore.

519
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,159
Bung, let's go to the foundation.

520
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,400
No, we shouldn't.

521
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,560
We promised Thua that we'll wait here.

522
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,920
If we go there, the plan will be ruined.

523
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,920
It won't. Let's go.

524
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,480
No.

525
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,840
Please. Can we please go?

526
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,880
We're not going.

527
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,679
Bung.

528
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,440
- Can we go? I want to go.
- No.

529
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,120
Phoon, what are you doing?

530
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,760
Phoon, put me down,

531
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,320
- or I'll get really mad.
- So, can we go or not?

532
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,560
Fine, let's go.

533
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,160
You scared me.

534
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,440
- Come on, Bung, quickly. Hurry.
- Okay, go.

535
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,000
Ms. Chitra, you've been accused
of embezzlement.

536
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,240
Please come to the station
to give a statement.

537
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,800
No, I don't know anything.
It's not me. I didn't do it.

538
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,280
Don't try to act innocent.

539
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,600
I trusted you.

540
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,720
Where did you keep the money?

541
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,640
I don't know. I didn't take it, really.

542
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,320
We have clear evidence
and you're still lying?

543
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,520
What evidence?

544
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,600
I didn't do it. I didn't take it.

545
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,000
I swear.

546
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
Calm down, Mr. Wit.

547
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,960
Chitra is just a suspect now.

548
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,160
That's right. Let the police
interrogate her first, then we can decide.

549
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,280
He's right. If she did take the money,
the police will surely

550
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,720
be able to return it to the foundation.

551
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,240
I didn't take it!

552
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,280
I didn't do it!

553
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,760
- Oh, be careful.
- Ma'am.

554
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,080
Ma'am.

555
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,560
Ma'am.

556
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,760
Shouldn't you be investigating things?
Why are you sitting here?

557
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,400
The police have caught the culprit.

558
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,760
So, who did it?

559
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,480
Chitra,

560
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,880
the foundation's accountant.

561
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,680
But I think there's
something fishy about it.

562
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,960
It doesn't feel right.

563
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,920
I agree. From the looks of it,

564
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,800
I don't think Chitra did it.

565
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,000
If she had done it,
would she have left such clear evidence?

566
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,960
You're right.

567
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,880
If she'd taken the money,

568
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,000
she'd have run away with it.

569
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,720
- Why would she risk getting caught? Right?
- Right?

570
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,000
It doesn't make any sense.

571
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,840
Mmm.

572
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,880
So, who do you think actually did it?

573
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,200
Don't tell me

574
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,440
that you know.

575
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,640
I need to go.

576
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,680
I need to use the bathroom.

577
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,480
Hey, Pong. You're leaving?

578
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,240
Yeah, I need to do something.

579
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,480
That's a lot of money!

580
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,000
I'm sorry.

581
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,880
- Thua, yesterday, you said
- Yeah?

582
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,040
the foundation didn't have money
to pay their staff,

583
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,440
so everyone quit, right?

584
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,120
Yeah, that's right.

585
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,920
Then, follow that guy.

586
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,600
- Come on.
- Huh?

587
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,400
- Quickly.
- What about Granny?

588
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,720
Later, I guess.

589
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,080
What's going on, Bung?

590
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,240
What's wrong with Pong?

591
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,560
I bumped into him yesterday.

592
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,160
Phoon, do you remember
the guy who dropped a lot of money?

593
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,680
Oh, I remember!

594
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,440
If he didn't get paid,
where did he get that much money?

595
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,280
Then we have find him.

596
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,040
Hey, he's over there.

597
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,480
Why did you shout and let him know?

598
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,960
Granny, stop the time.

599
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,680
How? She isn't here.

600
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,320
Oh, right. So, run.

601
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,360
Come on.

602
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,320
- Pong, wait up. Pong!
- Stop.

603
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,120
Wait up. Pong!

604
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,160
Bung, you okay?

605
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,600
You go ahead. I can't. My tummy hurts.

606
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,680
- Pong!
- Go ahead.

607
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,680
Phoon, don't do that. People will see.

608
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,000
Go check on Phakbung.
I'll take care of this.

609
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,720
Pong! Come back.

610
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,080
Pong! Stop!

611
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,320
- Ms. Kam, you okay?
- Hurry up!

612
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,760
Uh! Pong!

613
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,760
- <i>The person who stole the money is…</i>
- Pong.

614
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,720
How did you know?

615
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,400
NEXT EPISODE

616
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,680
Breaking into a police station
is kinda exciting.

617
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,600
We need to talk.

618
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,280
How could you do that?

619
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,400
Stop it, Peem.

620
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,360
<i>I can't believe I used to love</i>
<i>someone like you.</i>
