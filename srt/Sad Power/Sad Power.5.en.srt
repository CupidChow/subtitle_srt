1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,560
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,600
How could you do that?

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,600
Hey!

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,840
- If you know, you can't tell anyone!
- Why?

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,800
If the wrong people find out,
it could get messy.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,040
Help me! Help!

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,920
<i>If we find the kid,</i>
<i>we could get a million baht!</i>

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,440
Title is with you?

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,000
<i>Three million, in cash, unmarked bills,</i>

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,400
in exchange for your son’s life.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,280
<i>Got it?</i>

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,960
Those plainclothes cops
have been inside for a while, boss.

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,320
<i>Looks like that kid’s dad</i>
<i>is pretty influential.</i>

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,480
If I find out there are still cops,

15
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,240
what you’ll be getting back is a corpse!

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,080
Title! Don’t do anything to Title!

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,760
<i>I’m giving you a chance.</i>
<i>Get all the cops out of here.</i>

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,280
Title, hello? Hello?

19
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,720
Uh…

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Torpob!

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,800
Go! Get everyone out of here.

22
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,720
Uh, please leave first.

23
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,760
I just eavesdropped.

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,520
I'll summarize what I heard.

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,040
Right now, at Torpob's house, there’s
a thief network reporting the situation.

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,240
Here’s the first thief, who reports
the situation to the second thief,

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,800
the one who kidnapped Title.

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,440
- Oh.
- Granny, I think

29
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,520
the thieves must be around here.

30
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,000
If you stop time, we can go find them.

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,120
If we find and follow them,

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,200
we might be able to find out
where Title is.

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,640
If that’s the case, I’ll stop time.

34
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,480
Wait a minute.
What about Typhoon and Bung?

35
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,720
I’ll stay here. You and Thua,
if you find out where the criminals are,

36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,240
let me know right away.

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,480
I’ll call people and get the cops to help.

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,960
But this time, we can’t reveal ourselves.

39
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,920
Otherwise, we risk being mistaken
for the thieves.

40
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,560
So, I guess
I won’t be the hero of Ms. Kam, huh?

41
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,160
You’ll have plenty of time to be a hero.

42
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,960
I’m still here.

43
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,880
Me too!

44
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,040
I’ll also… Okay, we’ll trade roles.

45
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,600
Alright, let’s go.

46
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,200
- Ready?
- Ready!

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,400
Hey!

48
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,360
Let's go!

49
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,480
I'll stop time.

50
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,120
Granny and Thua are gone.

51
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,440
They took their phones with them.

52
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,040
In that case,
we’ll check out the area first.

53
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,400
- Yes.
- Let's go!

54
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,640
- Wait a second!
- What?

55
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,360
I’m hungry.

56
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,520
Hey!

57
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,160
Oh, look at that!

58
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,000
He's acting all sneaky and weird.

59
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,840
- Is that a thief? I think it is.
- Huh?

60
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,480
We should hurry and follow him.

61
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,480
Let's go!

62
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,400
Let's go!

63
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,600
Wow, Granny, it’s a good thing
we can stop time.

64
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,920
- Otherwise, we’d never catch up.
- Right.

65
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,840
Well, but…

66
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,840
He has a motorcycle.

67
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,040
If we let time run,
how are we going to catch up with him?

68
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,040
Wait a minute, Granny.
I think I recognize him.

69
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,560
Hey!

70
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,840
- It’s Neng!
- Huh? Do you know him?

71
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,920
Of course, Granny. Everyone knows him.
He’s from that gaming gang.

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,360
We can’t waste time.
Let’s hurry and save Title!

73
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,560
Let's go!

74
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,280
Oh, hey.

75
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,080
I’ve been around here for a while,
but I’ve never been inside this place.

76
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,040
This is Cherry's shop, Granny.
It’s a hangout for all the troubled kids.

77
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,120
Alright, here’s the plan.
Granny, stop time.

78
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,840
I’ll go inside and check it out, okay?

79
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,680
I’ll go with you.
I’ll never leave you behind.

80
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,040
Good. Let’s go, Granny.

81
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,960
There is only a small space here.
Where could they hide the kids?

82
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,240
- Hey!
- Did you find something?

83
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,920
This is the game I used to play
when I was a kid.

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,280
I can't believe kids
are still playing it today.

85
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,520
Thua, is this really the time for this?

86
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,080
He reads my mind. I’m sure this kid

87
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,960
is going to grow up to be a good person.

88
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,160
- Hey! Title!
- Huh?

89
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,800
Title?

90
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,800
Yeah, that’s him!

91
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,840
Wait. Don’t tell me
Title came here willingly?

92
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,480
What? I’m confused.

93
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,840
- Here’s the plan, Granny.
- Huh?

94
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,440
Let’s hide first,

95
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,200
let time resume,
and then we’ll see what happens next.

96
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,520
Alright, okay.

97
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,960
I’ll take a picture to keep as evidence.

98
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,520
- Come on!
- My phone!

99
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,000
I’ll silence my phone.

100
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,800
Hold on. Let me turn off the sound.

101
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,520
Over there!

102
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,000
Hey, send someone to pick up the money.

103
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,720
I told you I can pay off the debt.

104
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,840
As for the guy who brought the money,

105
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,920
you can keep him or do whatever
you want with him, it’s up to you.

106
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,600
That kid?

107
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,040
I’ll send him to the border today.

108
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,880
You want to make him a beggar
or sell his kidney, it’s up to you.

109
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,720
Either way, he’s not worth much to you.

110
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,120
Hey! What was that sound?

111
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,720
Okay, I’ll talk to you later.

112
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,720
Who’s there?

113
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,440
It's me.

114
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,679
Ah…

115
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,440
What the hell are you doing here, Jack?

116
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,840
I just spoke to the van drivers.
They'll pick up the kid tonight.

117
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,880
Alright, come talk to me about the kid.
Let’s go.

118
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,040
The phone breaks so easily nowadays.

119
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,320
A small drop and it's done for.
Look at this.

120
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,280
You can use mine.

121
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,880
Hey, the battery’s dead.

122
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,280
What should we do now?

123
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,960
Should we go back
and get help from the others?

124
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,840
We can’t do that, Granny.
What if Title gets moved in the meantime?

125
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,840
Right!

126
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,000
Here!

127
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,160
Hey, thanks! Just in time.

128
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,880
You’re here to help that kid, right?
Make sure you help him

129
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,480
and don’t pressure him
into running away from home again.

130
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,600
Wait. What’s going on here?

131
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,520
You’re the one who kidnapped Title,
and now you’re helping us?

132
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,120
I took him because I thought
his parents were abusing him.

133
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,960
I didn’t mean for him to be sold.

134
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,240
I didn’t think things would get this bad.

135
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,680
The batch of kids to be sent
to the border is a big one.

136
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,160
The people helping out,
make sure they do it right.

137
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,680
I have to go now. If Cherry finds out,
I’ll be in deep trouble.

138
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,600
Thank you. Thanks.

139
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,280
- Selling kids…
- A big batch!

140
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,320
Wait!

141
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,320
Typhoon, you need to act
super hungry, okay? Got it?

142
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,280
- Got it!
- That way, we can ask for food easily

143
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
and save up energy.

144
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,120
We’ll need strength to help everyone.

145
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,920
No problem.
I’m actually really hungry right now.

146
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,120
Let’s go.

147
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,000
I’m starving!
Do you have any food? I’m hungry!

148
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh, sorry,
I’m sorry for making you hungry.

149
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,320
Let’s sit down first.
I’ll find something for you.

150
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,520
- Thank you.
- Sit, sit.

151
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,480
Here, eat this for now to hold you over.

152
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,240
Thank you.

153
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,600
Thank you.
You’re much kinder than Title said.

154
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,880
Really? So, what did Title say about me?

155
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,800
He said he didn’t get first place on
his exam, so he was too afraid to go home.

156
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,640
But Title still loves you.

157
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,800
I’m a bad person.
And Title still loves me?

158
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,040
Of course! Title said

159
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,560
he didn’t get first place,
so he didn’t want you to be disappointed.

160
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,960
Don’t worry.

161
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,680
There’s plenty of delicious food here.
How could he not come back?

162
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,000
I’d do anything to have Title back home.

163
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,960
If you’re still hungry, feel free to grab
something from the fridge. Help yourself.

164
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,920
Thank you so much.

165
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,720
- Hey!
- Hmm?

166
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,640
Hey!

167
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,440
But he must not tell the police?

168
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,160
Right now,
that’s a different matter, Ms. Kam.

169
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,640
The money Torpob is going to give is
with another group waiting to receive it.

170
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,600
As for Title, he’s with another group
waiting to be sold.

171
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Let’s hurry, Kam.
We need to go save everyone!

172
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,040
What should we do? I have power now,

173
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,080
but if we go help others…
What if they recognize us?

174
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,280
What should we do?

175
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,600
Well, since we met,
no one has changed clothes, right?

176
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,000
So, I brought these for you all.

177
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,440
Whoa, winter jacket!

178
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,200
Socks.

179
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,840
And boots too!

180
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,400
They won’t recognize us.

181
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,160
Because we’re going as hero page
"Please be generous"!

182
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,920
What’s that?

183
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,720
- Let's go!
- Go where?

184
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,360
Just go. Let’s go first.

185
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,720
He's here!

186
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,400
Hey, has your guy shown up yet? They're
about to take the kid to the bus station.

187
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,800
Huh?

188
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,360
Hey! What should we do, Granny? Stop time?
We need to stop time.

189
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,560
No, we can’t. If we stop time,
the police won’t be able to get here.

190
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,800
What are you talking about?

191
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,760
So, it’s you, you traitor!

192
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,840
Jack!

193
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,600
Beat them up!

194
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,080
Hey, hey! Don’t hurt us!

195
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,200
What should we do, Granny?
They’ve caught us already.

196
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
Should we run?

197
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,480
We can’t, Granny.
If we run, they’ll take Title.

198
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,440
Wait a second.

199
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,200
How about this?

200
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,960
Granny, you go find a safe place first.

201
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,440
Or you can go find Phakbung.

202
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,080
Then I’ll follow them quietly
and send updates.

203
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,880
Alright, as soon as I leave,
I’ll snap my fingers

204
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,080
- to resume time.
- Yeah.

205
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,680
- Okay, Granny.
- Thua, you have to hide well.

206
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,640
Got it, Granny.

207
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,960
Okay!

208
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,560
Hey!

209
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,120
- Hey!
- Huh?

210
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,560
Where did they go?

211
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,440
Jack!

212
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,240
I’m not involved! You saw me.
I’ve been right here the whole time.

213
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,000
They’re gone.

214
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,480
They must’ve escaped already.

215
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,920
Who would want to get themselves
into trouble for someone else?

216
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,280
I think we should take the kid
and go, quickly.

217
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,240
Hey, everyone!

218
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,160
Hey, Granny, how did you get here?

219
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,640
Where's Thua?

220
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,640
Thua’s in danger. He's following Title.

221
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,040
- Huh?
- Right now,

222
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,760
even though we have to reveal our powers,
we must do it.

223
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,080
We have to help!

224
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,680
Who says we're going to reveal ourselves?

225
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,600
Huh?

226
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,840
Wait!

227
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,800
Here! Heroes need costumes,
like in the movies.

228
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,520
Hurry up!

229
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,240
Hey, hurry up!

230
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,920
Be quiet!

231
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,160
Faster!

232
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,760
Hurry up! Hey!

233
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,000
Where are the police?

234
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,240
Damn, they’re about to leave!

235
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,760
What should I do?

236
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,400
Go!

237
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,800
Hey!

238
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,000
Get in!

239
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,760
Stop!

240
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,120
Hey!

241
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,120
Where did you go earlier?

242
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,200
- You still owe me!
- Stop!

243
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,600
Hey, it's working!

244
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,480
What do you mean?

245
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,440
- Stop?
- Why…

246
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,280
Stop?

247
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,040
Hey, hold on tight!

248
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,520
Stop?

249
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,880
Stop it!

250
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,120
What the heck are you doing?

251
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,800
Got it. Thank you so much.

252
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,680
The police said they've helped Torpob,
and the money is safe now.

253
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,960
But they still haven't caught the thieves
and haven’t found Title yet.

254
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,560
So, what Thua said is true.
We have to hurry and help him, Peem.

255
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,000
If you go through the alley ahead,
you’ll reach the bus station.

256
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,240
But you two shouldn't go there.
It's too dangerous right now.

257
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,400
No, I have to go.

258
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,440
Stay close to me.

259
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,240
Let's go. Lead us there.

260
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,600
We won’t let you harm Thua and Title!

261
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,680
Right, Bu--

262
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,320
What are you on, huh?

263
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,400
Fatty! Are you high on meth or laxatives?

264
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,280
- Hey!
- Stop!

265
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,640
Title!

266
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,920
Title! Kids!

267
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,360
Are you alright?

268
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,240
Title!

269
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,320
Title! Everyone, okay?

270
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,360
Where’s Title?

271
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,160
- Title, my son!
- Dad!

272
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,040
How are you, son?

273
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,120
Oh my.

274
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,280
Or you…

275
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,560
Or maybe…

276
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,720
This person is the one
who helped send the news,

277
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,840
which is why we were able
to save the kids in time.

278
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,120
So, who are you all?

279
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,400
You guys…

280
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,920
- Alright, done.
- How could you do that?

281
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,480
What’s wrong, son? What happened?

282
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,480
You guys are…

283
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,920
If you know, you can't tell anyone!
This has to stay a secret.

284
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,360
Why?

285
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,680
I just don't want to get into trouble.

286
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,600
If the wrong people find out,
it could get messy.

287
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
<i>Why?</i>

288
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,760
The ones who helped me, Dad.

289
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,960
REGULATIONS FOR VISITING DETAINEES
AT BANGSRI MUEANG POLICE STATION

290
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,960
BANGSRI MUEANG POLICE STATION

291
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,600
Thank you very much for your cooperation.

292
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,040
No one has testified about the gambling
or child trafficking gangs yet,

293
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,560
but we will continue the investigation.

294
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,440
Actually, we should thank those three
for being heroes.

295
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,120
Do you happen to know who they are?

296
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,880
Oh, I…

297
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,920
I’ve never met them before.

298
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,920
How did you know where Title was?

299
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,040
Uh, well…

300
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,600
Here’s the thing. It’s Jack. Yeah, Jack.

301
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,840
Jack was the one who helped Title as well.

302
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,720
Uh. So…

303
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,680
Is there a chance we could ask
the police to reduce his sentence?

304
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,280
I'm sorry, Dad,

305
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,080
for not getting first place
and for missing so many days of school.

306
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,120
It’s okay, son.

307
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,760
I’m the one who should apologize to you.

308
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,400
From now on,

309
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,720
I won’t pressure you anymore.

310
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,080
If you want anything, just tell me,
and I’ll get it for you.

311
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,480
All I want is for you to understand
and not scold me. That's enough.

312
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,600
Okay, son. Okay.

313
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,760
Hey, son!

314
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,120
It’s late now. Get some rest.

315
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,440
Yes.

316
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,160
Let's go to sleep.

317
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,880
Sleep well, my son.

318
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,080
Hey!

319
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,600
It's your gang!

320
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,600
Thank you for keeping the secret.

321
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,520
How did you guys get here?

322
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,520
Well,

323
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,600
we had Granny stop time,
and then we just walked right in.

324
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,280
We also came to check if you were safe.

325
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,320
I'm safe.

326
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,520
I promise I won't reveal the secret.

327
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,560
Everyone will get to be heroes
and continue helping society.

328
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,280
You both are so adorable, father and son.

329
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,280
We promise to use the money
to help everyone.

330
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,280
And we promise

331
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,960
we’ll be heroes and keep helping everyone.

332
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,120
- Come on. Let's high-five
- Combine our strength!

333
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,800
Hey!

334
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,480
- We’ll be going now.
- Yes.

335
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,160
Come on.

336
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,800
Let's go.

337
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,200
Hey.

338
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,800
Typhoon.

339
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,680
Let's go.

340
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,000
That was awesome! So cool!

341
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,880
Let's celebrate our success!

342
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,120
Yay!

343
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,600
Can I join the celebration?

344
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,000
- Ms. Kam!
- Ms. Kam!

345
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,120
Um…

346
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,440
Actually, I just remembered

347
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,800
that I haven't apologized to everyone
for being suspected,

348
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,240
and I haven't thanked you all
for coming to help.

349
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,920
Well, what do you mean?
Actually, the real hero is…

350
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,800
"Please be generous", not me.

351
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,080
Who says that?
If you hadn't sacrificed yourself,

352
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,080
no one would have found Title,
including that hero gang.

353
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,440
Actually, it's just you, Ms. Kam,

354
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,600
who saw me do something good.
I’m happy already.

355
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,480
Alright, let's eat!

356
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,560
- Let's celebrate!
- Yeah.

357
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,480
- Kam!
- Ms. Kam, please sit here.

358
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,040
- Plates, plates!
- I’ll handle it.

359
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,920
- Please, sit down.
- Come on in!

360
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,920
Sit down, please.

361
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,880
- Come on in.
- Go ahead.

362
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,400
Finally, the urgent mission

363
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,120
to find Title, who had gone missing,
has been completed,

364
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,840
thanks to these people's efforts.

365
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,200
PLEASE BE GENEROUS - THE PAGE CONTRIBUTES
TO GATHERING USEFUL INFO FOR SOCIETY

366
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,240
<i>We're "Please be generous" team.</i>

367
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,160
<i>And I would like to announce</i>

368
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,560
<i>that I will be awarding a prize</i>
<i>to this team, just as I promised.</i>

369
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,880
PLEASE BE GENEROUS

370
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,600
Granny, Bung, Typhoon! Look at this!

371
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,120
- We haven't finished yet, Thua.
- Hurry!

372
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,160
- What?
- What's wrong?

373
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,280
- What?
- Hurry up. Come quick!

374
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,360
- What?
- Hurry up!

375
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,160
PLEASE BE GENEROUS
7,300 LIKES, 12,000 FOLLOWERS

376
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,880
Finally, our page
is going to be recognized!

377
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,440
Why are you the admin
of the "Please be generous" page?

378
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,720
Well…

379
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,920
Why are you using the name
"Please be generous"? Who are you?

380
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,120
What is your connection
to the "Please be generous" team?

381
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,400
Did you create the page for personal gain?

382
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,720
Oh, hold on a second. Wait, wait!

383
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,880
Who should I answer first?

384
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,080
- Oh?
- Huh?

385
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,040
Let me hold this.

386
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,000
Whoa, there's a lot!

387
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,760
Alright.

388
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,480
I'm the admin
of the "Please be generous" page.

389
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:59,040
I have to tell you,
I can't reveal who the heroes are

390
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,320
because everyone's information
is confidential.

391
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,200
However, what’s not a secret is…

392
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,360
LAAB ITTHIRIT RESTAURANT

393
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,400
…me and everyone in "Please be generous"

394
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,440
agree that

395
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,800
we will help everyone who is in need.

396
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,240
For anyone who has a complaint,
please line up,

397
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,920
and we’ll help as much as we can.

398
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,240
I’ll make sure to sign for everyone.
Come on!

399
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,960
- Hey! What’s this?
- Wake up, Thua!

400
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,520
Stop dreaming about being the admin
of the page and telling others about it.

401
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,080
You have to keep it a secret
or we’ll all be in trouble.

402
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,680
I know,

403
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,040
but I’m sad! We’re famous
and rich, but we can’t tell anyone.

404
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,280
Hey! Here!

405
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,240
Look! The money's in the account.

406
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,240
We’ve got a million now!

407
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,200
You’re going to give me a lot, right?

408
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,640
Of course, I’ll give you a nice salary.

409
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,760
If you spend like this,
you’ll be poor again soon.

410
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,760
If you’re not careful,
you’ll be back to square one in a month.

411
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,680
But it's a million! What should I do?

412
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,120
You need to manage the accounts
and divide the money.

413
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,760
Some for emergencies,

414
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,080
some for the house,

415
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,680
some for the Laab restaurant,

416
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,520
some for our salaries,
and some for yourself.

417
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,080
Right! So smart.

418
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,000
It’s normal. Everyone can figure this out.

419
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,200
You’re an adult now.

420
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,760
Why didn’t I think of that?

421
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,960
Maybe you’re not smart.

422
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,680
What? Not smart? Come here!

423
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,040
See?

424
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,520
Thua!

425
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,760
Yes?

426
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,720
Kam is here, waiting outside.

427
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,240
- Huh? Ms. Kam came to see me?
- Yes.

428
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,840
Whoa, this is my golden year!

429
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,680
Ms. Kam came to see me!

430
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,560
<i>Finally, the urgent mission to find Title,</i>
<i>who had gone missing, has been completed,</i>

431
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,400
<i>thanks to these people's efforts.</i>

432
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,400
<i>We're</i>

433
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,040
<i>"Please be generous" team.</i>

434
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,680
Oh, Ms. Kam. What are you watching?

435
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,760
The "Please be generous" team.
They’re really amazing, right?

436
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,200
Yeah, they’re really cool.

437
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,240
I bet the real ones are even cooler.

438
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,000
- Do you know them?
- Yes, I do.

439
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,600
Uh, no, I don’t.

440
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,120
Well, I’ve contacted the admin
during the Title issue,

441
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,720
so we might be kind of close.

442
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,800
That’s good. So, do you feel like
this team looks familiar?

443
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,200
Familiar? How?

444
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,520
There’s one kid, two women.

445
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,480
One of the women is older,
close to Granny Cheuy’s age.

446
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,320
The kid is chubby, like Typhoon,

447
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,240
and the other woman
looks like Bung, right?

448
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,400
Hey, no way, Ms. Kam. These three
are always at the Laab restaurant.

449
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,640
And besides, they’re really weak.
How could they help anyone?

450
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,520
But they look so similar!

451
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,360
No, they don’t.

452
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,200
- Come on.
- Never mind.

453
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,000
Let’s talk about us.
I’ve got something important to discuss.

454
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,640
What’s our issue?

455
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,160
You can tell me, Ms. Kam.

456
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,880
Hello, Thua.

457
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,400
The important thing is

458
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,720
about Peem. He wants to talk to you.

459
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,080
Yes.

460
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,280
I’m sorry for the past.

461
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,800
If I’d known you were trying
to do good deeds for society,

462
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,320
I wouldn’t have interfered.

463
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,480
Alright. Here.

464
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,160
Please take this.
Just a little something from me.

465
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,520
Take it.

466
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,320
Peem has been stressed for days
after realizing he misunderstood you.

467
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,560
Don't blame someone for not knowing.

468
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,680
I won’t hold it against him.

469
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,520
Thank you.

470
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,960
- Thank you, Kam, for handling this.
- You're welcome.

471
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,960
Alright, we’re done here.

472
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,080
Let’s go, Peem.

473
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,280
Let's go, Kam.

474
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,160
Done?

475
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,920
Ugh, my heart hurts.

476
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,960
I really want to know who
the "Please be generous" team is,

477
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,880
the ones who came together
to create this page to help people.

478
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,400
They’re so cool, right, Peem?

479
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,200
The villagers are all so impressed,

480
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,160
they're liking the page a lot.

481
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,760
If it seems too good to be true,
don't trust it right away.

482
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,400
The fact that this team is staying
anonymous, not showing their faces,

483
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,800
there has to be something behind it.

484
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,760
If that's the case, that's too bad.

485
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,920
Hey, isn't he leaving yet?

486
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,360
Kam, your eyebrows are furrowed.

487
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,520
I’m not saying this to stress you out.

488
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,520
No one wants to see the person
they like feeling stressed.

489
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,400
Hmm? What do you mean by that?

490
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,720
I mean you, Kam.

491
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,520
You’re the one I like.

492
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,560
Oh, Thua!

493
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,720
Why are you standing in the doorway?

494
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,000
Well, I…

495
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,120
Uh, no. Ms. Kam, you left your wallet,

496
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,320
so I brought it back to you.

497
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,120
Thank you.

498
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,360
Hey, but if I leave now,

499
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,160
I'll definitely lose Kam.

500
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,720
I can’t let that happen.

501
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,960
Lose what?

502
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,440
- What?
- Ms. Kam.

503
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I just contacted

504
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,960
the admin of "Please be generous".

505
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,880
I heard they’re currently looking
for a case

506
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,239
to win over…

507
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,920
Win over what?

508
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,040
They’re trying to defeat bad people.

509
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,880
They’re probably looking
for a new case to take on.

510
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,639
If anyone is in trouble,
or if you know anyone who is,

511
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,719
let me know.

512
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,360
- Really?
- Yes, really.

513
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,440
Well, if anything happens,
I’ll contact you right away.

514
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,840
Thank you so much!

515
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,040
No problem.
I’ll contact the admin shortly.

516
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,080
Who should I help?

517
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,199
It has to be something grand and cool,

518
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,239
something that will melt Ms. Kam’s heart.

519
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,240
<i>I’m really in trouble right now.</i>
<i>Can you transfer me 200 baht?</i>

520
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,280
Hmm?

521
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,520
Is this a scam?

522
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,280
<i>I’m in a lot of trouble right now.</i>

523
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,080
<i>I don’t have money to divorce my wife.</i>
<i>Can I borrow 200,000?</i>

524
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,520
Asking to borrow money again?
I’m a hero, not an ATM.

525
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,280
Hey, is this Naowjai
from the fried banana shop?

526
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,880
What’s going on?

527
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,240
<i>Lately, the villagers</i>
<i>are really struggling.</i>

528
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,640
<i>They’re scared to walk past</i>
<i>the abandoned house at night.</i>

529
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,760
<i>They’ve been hearing</i>
<i>a female ghost wailing.</i>

530
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,920
<i>It’s giving everyone chills. Can you help?</i>

531
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,840
What, you want me to fight a ghost?
Are you crazy?

532
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,400
<i>It’s this house right here. It’s haunted.</i>

533
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,840
Clear as day. The same house.

534
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,680
Even clearer now!

535
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,720
- Ghost, ghost, Granny! I saw a ghost!
- Ghost?

536
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,080
Where? Did you chase it away?

537
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,960
Don’t let it come in. Go away!

538
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,320
- Go away!
- Oh, Granny, stop, stop!

539
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,240
The ghost didn’t come.
It's at the abandoned house.

540
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,960
Oh.

541
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,160
If it were me,
I wouldn’t follow it either.

542
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,360
Hey, Thua, did you see a real ghost?

543
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,960
Kind of, but I don’t want to see one.

544
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,280
Even just hearing it gives me the chills.

545
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,480
And the villagers want us
to go fight the ghost?

546
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,520
- No way. Dream on.
- Wait a second.

547
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,760
It’s broad daylight.

548
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,680
How can a ghost appear?

549
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,000
- Oh.
- Jeez.

550
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,440
Granny, you don’t know anything!
When I went to the market,

551
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,560
they were all talking
about the haunted abandoned house.

552
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,480
They said it’s a pregnant ghost.

553
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,440
And in broad daylight,

554
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,400
it cries because it misses its baby.

555
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,920
But at night? It’s even worse!

556
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,480
Oh! You guys are so easily scared.

557
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,160
That’s why you believe
in all these ghost stories. Ridiculous.

558
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,680
Hmm, but why does it smell like this?

559
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,080
What?

560
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,640
Does the grape smell bad?

561
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,880
- Really?
- Where does it smell bad?

562
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,960
- Here, try it.
- Does it smell bad?

563
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,200
- How is it?
- Well, no, it actually tastes good.

564
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,640
- Yeah.
- Want another one?

565
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,000
Can you not make me
feel nauseous right now?

566
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,520
We can't let anyone know
about our situation yet.

567
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,760
Let's work together for now, okay?

568
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,560
Hey, Granny.

569
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,960
Bung.

570
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,160
You can tell me anything, you know.

571
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,440
I'm here for you, for everything.

572
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,800
I'm fine, Granny. I just don't like
this type of grape, that's all.

573
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,320
I used to not like weird foods
or strange smells, just like you.

574
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,880
When I was pregnant.

575
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,120
Bung,

576
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,480
I'm asking you seriously.

577
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,560
Are you pregnant?

578
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,560
Huh? Are you pregnant?

579
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,400
Huh? Pregnant?

580
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,360
I'm not!

581
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,320
But you look like
you've gained a lot of weight.

582
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,960
Hey, don't bully me.

583
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,000
I just gained weight, that's all.

584
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,640
I swear.

585
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,240
Hey!

586
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,640
It's time to deliver Laab to Tee.

587
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,400
I'll go deliver it myself. See you!

588
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,520
Hello, Ms. Kam.
Is there anything I can help with?

589
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,000
Oh no, what’s going on now?

590
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,400
So, what can I help with, Ms. Kam?

591
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,720
It's not just me who wants help.

592
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,920
The villagers are really struggling

593
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,240
and want the "Please be generous" team
to help out.

594
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,280
Just tell me, and I’ll pass it on
to the "Please be generous" admin.

595
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,600
You’re that close with them?
Can I get to know them too?

596
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,040
Hey, no, I can't.

597
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,560
If they find out, they won’t help.

598
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,880
It's a big secret.

599
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,760
Okay, fine. But this is kind of tricky.

600
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,160
I’m not sure they can help.

601
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,720
I don’t want to brag,

602
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,040
but there’s nothing
"Please be generous" can’t do.

603
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,800
They can help with anything.

604
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,360
Great! Could they help me get rid
of the ghost in that abandoned house?

605
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,280
What do you think, Thua? Can they help?

606
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,040
Of course, they can. No problem at all.

607
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,000
Thanks so much! That’s a huge relief.

608
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,320
Ms. Kam, there you are!

609
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,640
You should hurry home.
Ah is waiting for dinner.

610
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,520
Okay, I’m going now.
Thanks, Thua, take care!

611
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,240
Right. Yes.

612
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,760
Ms. Kam, how did you end up here?

613
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,320
If I didn’t have a motorcycle,
I wouldn’t dare come.

614
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,680
This place is haunted. Let’s go.

615
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,160
Take care, Thua!

616
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,520
Why would Ms. Kam ask me
to get rid of ghosts?

617
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,680
Why not tell the monk?
What am I supposed to do?

618
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,280
Oh!

619
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,320
What’s that sound?

620
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,440
This is the abandoned house.

621
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,320
<i>…the haunted abandoned house.</i>

622
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,360

<i>And in broad daylight, it cries</i>

624
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,320
Don’t tell me it’s true!

625
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,000
Sorry,

626
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,920
but don’t try to scare me.

627
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,800
<i>I’m here to update you</i>
<i>about the "Please be generous" page.</i>

628
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,440
