1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,880
<i>In the end, the police were able</i>

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,280
<i>to rescue all the workers.</i>

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,680
- <i>But Mr. Phairot,</i>
- Stop!

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,560
- <i>the company's owner, managed to escape.</i>
- Drop your weapon!

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,280
You have to help me.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,080
If I get arrested,
you won't get away either.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,760
Where are you now?

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,120
<i>"The labor trafficking fugitive</i>

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,320
has been killed by the police

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,040
for resisting arrest."

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,360
How did the police
get the lead on Phairot?

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,680
The news says
a good Samaritan tipped them off.

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,480
I was following that case too.
I got some information.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,120
But it wasn't a big deal.

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,320
Exactly what
I'm looking for in a son-in-law.

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,280
Are you available? Would you take

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,800
my daughter under consideration?

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,200
Dad! Stop talking.

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,400
<i>I think our effort was in vain this time.</i>

20
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,840
<i>Someone took our credit.</i>

21
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,160
Next time, we must take it more seriously.

22
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,080
If you don't pay,
your garage may get shut down.

23
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,280
Think it through.

24
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,920
We must remove bad people's space.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,640
What can we do?

26
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,480
We don't even know who the collector is.

27
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,000
Are you sure you really want to know?

28
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,560
Dad.

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,680
The collector…

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,160
is Chief Khachon.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,840
Chief Khachon?

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,880
I'd sooner close this garage

33
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,880
than go against your grandfather.

34
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,560
- Huh? Grandfather?
- Huh?

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,960
PREVIOUSLY

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,560
Whoa. For real?

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,720
Doesn't sound like
someone of his statue, right?

38
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,920
The text is too small.
I can't read. I have to enlarge it.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,880
Oi, read the room, Granny.

40
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,040
Come on now. I don't have to read
to guess the situation.

41
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,200
Chief Khachon has always been famous.

42
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,160
They say he's an honest civil servant.

43
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,640
Honest my butt.

44
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,240
Honest men won't collect protection fees
from their own son-in-law.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,240
So, what do we do?

46
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,200
If the garage's closed,
people will lose their jobs.

47
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,960
If we expose Chief Khachon,
Kam will be heartbroken.

48
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,000
We don't do this job
to help only Ms. Kam and Ah.

49
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,920
We also do it to help other people
and, more importantly, this country.

50
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,000
So, no matter what,

51
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,120
we have to find evidence
to expose Chief Khachon.

52
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,120
Even if it means being hated by Ms. Kam?

53
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,080
On this specific issue, Granny,
I really can't be selfish.

54
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,720
That's my hero.

55
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,160
You mean that?

56
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,920
Guys.

57
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,280
Come on.

58
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,440
- Please be generous! Go!
- Please be generous! Go!

59
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,640
You're really
Chief Khachon's granddaughter?

60
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,800
He asked to raise me,
but I chose to stay with my dad.

61
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,520
But still, I can't hurt my grandfather.

62
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,600
I really hate saying this.

63
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,760
I'm ashamed of myself.

64
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,440
But can you not expose my grandfather?

65
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,720
Don't worry, Kam. I'll do my best.

66
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,200
Thank you very much for understanding.

67
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,480
Then, I'm going to go see my dad.

68
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,280
He worries me.
He seems very stressed lately.

69
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,480
Want me to give you a lift?

70
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,880
It's okay. Seng's waiting to take me back.

71
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,720
Okay.

72
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,440
- I'm going to go.
- Sure.

73
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,080
Give Chief Khachon a big tribute.

74
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,240
Tell him it's from Peem, MP Pethai's son.

75
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,120
I'll cover Ah's garage's protection fees.

76
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,320
Do whatever it takes to get
Chief Khachon's endorsement.

77
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,959
But don't let Ah and Kam know

78
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,440
that I'm playing both ends.

79
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,520
Thank you, Kam.
You really are my goddess of luck.

80
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,040
Wow. Chief Khachon's salary
afforded him this huge mansion?

81
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,560
If it were enough,
he wouldn't be collecting protection fees.

82
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,800
You're right.

83
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,800
But be honest with me.
Are we sure we shouldn't be

84
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,480
in our superhero suits?

85
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,840
Oi, Thua,

86
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,000
heroism is in the heart.

87
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,240
Jeez.

88
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,400
It's in the heart or they didn't dry
in time after washing?

89
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,880
But since when did you become
a complainer like me?

90
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,200
You're aware of that.

91
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,600
Hey, hide quickly!

92
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,480
Easy. Be careful.

93
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,040
That's Chief Khachon.
What's in the sack his men are dragging?

94
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,680
- Bung. Start recording.
- Yes?

95
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
Sure.

96
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,880
All beings on earth
live according to their karma.

97
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,680
May you rest in peace.

98
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,320
Sir.

99
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,240
I took care of it.

100
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,400
But some people still resist.

101
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,400
Want me to deal with it?

102
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,760
Thanks a lot.

103
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,200
Ever since I got you as my secretary,

104
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,400
you've made my job a lot easier.

105
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,520
Without you,

106
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,200
I wouldn't have come this far, sir.

107
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,920
Let's go.

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,160
We have a meeting later, right?

109
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,760
Yes, sir. This way, sir.

110
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,960
Oh no.

111
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,680
Hey, don't tell me

112
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,320
Chief Khachon will kill Ah.

113
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,680
- Yeah.
- That's right.

114
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,760
Cruel to the point of planning murders
and burying bodies on his own property.

115
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,440
We can't let it go on.
We must deal with this quickly.

116
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,600
Then we should hurry.

117
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,240
We'll have Granny stop time.

118
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,960
- Yeah, come on. Grab me.
- Let's go.

119
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,560
- I'll stop time.
- Yes.

120
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,480
Let's go.

121
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,200
Here's the plan. Split up and search.

122
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,160
Got it.

123
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,880
I'll check this room, Granny.

124
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,880
Guys, this one's an office.

125
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,320
- Whoa, an office. Bung.
- Come on.

126
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,200
- Granny, read these.
- Yeah.

127
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,880
- Found it!
- You found evidence?

128
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,560
I found lots of cookies. Can I have one?

129
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,560
Typhoon, watch out.

130
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,280
Food in a room of someone like this
might be poisoned.

131
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,320
But there must be something in the safe.

132
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,680
I'll try opening it.

133
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,240
Ooh, there are toys.

134
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,840
This is… Granny?

135
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,000
- Huh?
- It's a picture of Chief Khachon with…

136
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,160
- Where?
- Ms. Kam's mom?

137
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,960
- Where? Let me see.
- They look alike.

138
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,760
You're right.

139
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,960
Which year is this from?

140
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,880
Granny!

141
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,680
- Gran… Gran…
- Granny!

142
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,360
We're in Chief Khachon's garden.

143
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,760
- Yeah.
- Or we didn't go back in time?

144
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,400
Hey, hold on a minute.

145
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,200
That's Chief Khachon's daughter.

146
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,360
Koy! Stop right now.

147
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,320
I won't let you imprison me anymore.

148
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,360
I'm going to live with Ah.

149
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,840
Move.

150
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,600
Sir, this guy climbed the wall to get in.

151
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,600
Sir.

152
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,600
Please let her go.

153
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,760
Don't imprison her. Don't hurt her.

154
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,520
I'll leave.

155
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,680
No.

156
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,080
Don't leave me. I'm coming with you.

157
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,560
Koy.

158
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,040
- You ungrateful child!
- Sir!

159
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,200
I won't hurt you.

160
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,200
But if you choose to go with Ah,

161
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,480
you and I will no longer be family!

162
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,920
That's too mean.

163
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,200
- Hey, I… I can't hold it.
- What's wrong, Granny?

164
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,680
- What's wrong, Granny?
- Granny!

165
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,160
Granny, you can't
time jump randomly like this.

166
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,720
Now we don't know where we are.

167
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,840
Jeez, the weather's unpredictable.

168
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,760
I can't help it.

169
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,320
- Where are we?
- So…

170
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,840
- this is…
- Buses?

171
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,440
- You're back, Ah?
- Where are we?

172
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,360
- Hide. Quick. Hide, Granny.
- Let's go.

173
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,080
If it wasn't Ah,

174
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,200
whose voice was that?

175
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,960
Hey, we're still in the past?

176
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,600
Koy?

177
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,360
Sorry.

178
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,880
I supervised the repair.

179
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,120
I want our garage's first bus
to be ready quickly.

180
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,960
Ice pop, your favorite flavor.

181
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,720
- Ah, I know I can't help around much,
- Hmm?

182
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,240
but please let me
take care of you with little things.

183
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,960
Just you choosing me

184
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,960
has given me the push to keep fighting.

185
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,000
Don't worry, Koy.

186
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,920
I won't be a nobody much longer.

187
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,040
I will be better.

188
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,480
For you.

189
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,800
I'm going to the market.
Do you want anything?

190
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,640
No. Do you want me to give you a lift?

191
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,840
It's okay. It's not far. See you at home.

192
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,440
Mm. All right.

193
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,400
Looks like
Ms. Koy's worried about something.

194
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
Should we follow her?

195
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,680
- Well?
- Let's do that.

196
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,080
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

197
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,200
Hide.

198
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,880
You don't have to hide.

199
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,320
She saw us?

200
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,400
What do we do, Granny?

201
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,440
If we go out there,
will we change the past?

202
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,800
I just wanted to see how far

203
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,760
a stubborn child like you could go.

204
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,560
In the end,

205
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,080
you threw your life away
for this lousy bus garage.

206
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,200
So what?

207
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,760
You want me to come back?

208
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,240
If you ask me,

209
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,920
I might give you a chance.

210
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,560
I want to have a father.

211
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,120
But I want my baby

212
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
to have a father too.

213
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,960
Koy.

214
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,560
Can you accept us?

215
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,560
But if you can't,

216
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,920
will you please let us go?

217
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,360
I know you and your people

218
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,760
have been harassing Ah.

219
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,160
Fine.

220
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,200
I'll let you go.

221
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,320
Dad.

222
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,880
But from now on,

223
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,280
we're out of each other's lives!

224
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,400
Dad.

225
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,520
This is why Chief Khachon
hates Ah so much.

226
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,000
But no matter the reason,
whether it's personal or his selfishness,

227
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,720
what Chief Khachon does is unacceptable.

228
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,600
All the more reason to help Ah.

229
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,080
Then we should go back, Granny.

230
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,440
To look for evidence?

231
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,800
I have to go number two.

232
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,800
All right. Let me focus.

233
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,000
PRESENT DAY

234
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,480
Good thing I came back for that in time.

235
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,760
What are you guys doing?

236
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,240
I think we've looked
for evidence everywhere,

237
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,840
but we found nothing untoward.

238
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,800
The only place left is in there.

239
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,960
Oh. Have Granny go back in time

240
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,680
to watch him punch in the code.

241
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,760
No. She's already used
a lot of power today.

242
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
Look at her. She's already confused.

243
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,200
- Yeah.
- Mm, let's keep going.

244
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,960
So, Typhoon,

245
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,840
try using your power on the safe.

246
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,240
Good thing I have this on me.

247
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,400
I heard something.

248
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,520
- Come on.
- Give it a try.

249
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,440
Let's do it. All gone.

250
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,240
Come on.

251
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,640
Who are you guys?

252
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,000
Granny. Granny, stop time.

253
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,320
I'm not going to Ayutthaya.

254
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,360
Who are you guys?

255
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,080
How dare you break into my office?

256
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,800
I… No, we…

257
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,600
We're Kam's friends.

258
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,200
Kam?

259
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,960
That's right. Kam, Ah's daughter.

260
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,560
I hope you know her.

261
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,760
What do we do?
What if we got Ah and Kam in trouble?

262
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,840
Who are you to Kam?

263
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,280
Someone who can't stand
seeing her in trouble

264
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,040
because of the revenge
by her own grandfather

265
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,880
who's using his power
and position to commit crimes.

266
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Nonsense. With a smart mouth like that,

267
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,960
you must be a bunch of frauds.

268
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,920
Let's talk at the police station.

269
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,960
Hey, wait. Stop.

270
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,280
No, you can't take us.

271
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,480
Because the evidence
that says you're a bad person

272
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,560
is in that safe.

273
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,760
Go on, Thua.

274
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,440
You're screwed.

275
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,040
This is not evidence.

276
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,000
Those are photos of Koy, my daughter.

277
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,480
Damn.

278
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,440
You're both good-looking.

279
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,240
- Granny.
- Hm?

280
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,400
Have you recovered? So we can escape.

281
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,480
How would that work?

282
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,120
Our faces are exposed.

283
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,160
They'll find us eventually.

284
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,600
There's nothing wrong with me.

285
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,360
Why? What happened earlier?

286
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,600
- It's bad this time.
- You're not fully recovered.

287
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,120
Eh?

288
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,320
But wait.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

289
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,320
I have a weird feeling that
we might misunderstand something.

290
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,400
Just seeing him keep old photos

291
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,840
turns you into a softy?

292
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,400
No. We looked for evidence
for a long time, right?

293
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,080
But we haven't found anything
that indicates he's a bad person. Right?

294
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,840
We're so screwed.

295
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
You guys really are Kam's friends.

296
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,360
And you used to be
a bus ticket taker at the garage.

297
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,120
I was, sir. That's right.

298
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,920
Then, let me ask you this.

299
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,840
When you talked
about Kam being in trouble,

300
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,000
my revenge,

301
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,800
and me abusing my power and position,

302
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,400
what were you referring to?

303
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,240
I saw with my own eyes that someone
tried to collect protection fees from Ah.

304
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,880
If you don't pay,
your garage may get shut down.

305
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,160
Think it through.

306
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,680
The collector…

307
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,040
is Chief Khachon.

308
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,960
I heard it myself that the collector

309
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,000
was you, Chief Khachon.

310
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,920
That's not true.
I serve the public with honesty.

311
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,120
The only thing I'm at fault

312
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,360
is I wronged Koy.
Everything else isn't worth mentioning.

313
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,240
- Eh?
- Eh?

314
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,480
What does that mean, old man?
You're really not lying to us?

315
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,440
But you have no reason to lie to us.

316
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,200
Because if you wanted us gone,

317
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,560
you could've put us in those sacks

318
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,920
and buried us in your backyard
like you did earlier.

319
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,080
Nonsense.

320
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,520
What I put in that sack and buried
was just a dead stray dog.

321
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,120
- Eh?
- Eh?

322
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,480
What about when you said,

323
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,640
"If they resisted,

324
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,120
then deal with it." What was that, sir?

325
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,920
I had my people put up
a food bank before I got permission.

326
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,200
If the people in the area resist,
then deal with it by packing up.

327
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,160
So, that means

328
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
we misunderstood everything?

329
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,280
All right.

330
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,160
Tell me everything you guys know.

331
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,040
I want to catch whoever
is throwing my name around.

332
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,960
Especially those who used my name

333
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,160
to hurt my granddaughter and son-in-law.

334
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,880
So, you're not mad at Ah anymore?

335
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,120
You know about me and Ah?

336
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,720
- Oh, well,
- Uh…

337
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,800
we saw the photos and the letter.

338
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,360
That's right.

339
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,320
I wrote a letter to apologize to Koy.

340
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,800
And I thought someday,

341
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,360
I'd get to apologize
to Ah and Kam in person.

342
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,800
I think that day has come.

343
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,400
Here's the thing, sir.

344
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,960
Someone claimed…

345
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,560
to work for you
collecting protection fees.

346
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,920
Who dared make such a claim?

347
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,720
And why haven't I been informed?

348
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,760
It might be someone closer to you

349
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,720
than you think, sir.

350
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,040
Thanks a lot.

351
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,960
I have an idea

352
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,400
who that person might be.

353
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,400
I'll look into this myself.

354
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,800
But you should clear this up
with Ah and Ms. Kam first.

355
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,880
As for catching the culprit,

356
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,360
why don't you let us help?

357
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,400
It's okay.
These things could be dangerous.

358
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,520
I don't want you guys to get in trouble.

359
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,960
It's no trouble.

360
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,680
I know someone

361
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,240
who can deal with this stuff.

362
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,240
Who?

363
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,160
Have you ever heard of this name?

364
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,720
The "Please be generous" gang.

365
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,880
Yes, sir.

366
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,760
I'll send the "Please be generous" heroes
to the scene right away.

367
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,840
Let's go, guys. Let's do this.

368
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,760
Mm-hm.

369
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,360
- Bung.
- Yes?

370
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,640
Stay close to me.
Don't overextend yourself.

371
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,320
Remember you have
another life to take care of.

372
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,120
Yes, Granny.

373
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,240
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

374
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,760
<i>Mr. Peem, I'm taking</i>
<i>the money to Chief Khachon.</i>

375
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
Very good.

376
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,320
If he wants anything, just tell me.

377
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,160
We must have Chief Khachon on our side

378
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,960
because he'll be crucial
to my political base.

379
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,000
<i>Yes.</i>

380
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,760
Mom,

381
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,120
I'll show you

382
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,520
that I can do it and I can do it well.

383
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,080
Hey, what do you need?

384
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,000
<i>Peem, it's me, Kam.</i>

385
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,800
Sorry, Kam, I thought
you were one of my people.

386
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,280
It's okay.

387
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,360
I called you right away because I'm happy.

388
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,040
My grandfather just told me

389
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,880
that he wasn't the collector.

390
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,280
Someone's using his name,

391
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,480
and he's about to catch the culprit.

392
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,440
Huh?

393
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,440
I have to go. I'll call you back.

394
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,760
Damn it.

395
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,920
CHAIRMAN OF THE SPECIAL
MASS TRANSIT SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT COMMITTEE

396
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,400
Sir.

397
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,040
You're Chief Khachon's secretary.

398
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,040
He has me oversee everything.

399
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,320
Anyway, can you tell me now
who you're working for?

400
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,080
This is the money
requested by Chief Khachon.

401
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,480
In exchange for--

402
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,080
Hey! What are you doing?!

403
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,280
How did he get here?

404
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,040
Let's go and catch them.

405
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,080
You've been caught.

406
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,240
We've surrounded this place.

407
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,200
Who are these people?

408
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,840
- Hey!
- Stop time! Ow!

409
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,080
Granny, are you okay?

410
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,200
Mighty One, follow the secretary.

411
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,120
I'll follow the briber.

412
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,280
- You got it.
- Let's go.

413
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,200
Hey, that way!

414
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,040
Mr. Peem, are you okay?

415
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,800
None of your business!

416
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,560
Let's just go.

417
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,240
Hey.

418
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,800
- I got him, Granny.
- Hurry.

419
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,840
Sir.

420
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,240
You won a government scholarship
to study overseas.

421
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,960
Instead of repaying your country,

422
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,400
you use the opportunity
you're given to commit fraud

423
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,240
because you think I trust you.

424
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,040
You've never been poor.

425
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,440
You'd never understand!

426
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,560
I've never been poor,
but I've known poor people.

427
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,320
Poor people who work honest jobs,

428
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,680
who work hard until they're successful!

429
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,840
- What is this? Wait.
- Go!

430
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,320
- Sir.
- Go.

431
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,280
Go.

432
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,160
- We should go.
- Come on.

433
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,920
You're useless.

434
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,040
So, what happened, boss?

435
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,680
We read the whole thing wrong!

436
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,120
That secretary used Chief Khachon's name.

437
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,800
Chief Khachon isn't corrupted.

438
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,640
We're screwed.

439
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,280
Luckily, I stopped it in time.

440
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,760
Otherwise, those freaks
would've realized my mode of operation.

441
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,040
So, what do we do now, boss?

442
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,360
You lay low for now. Don't worry about me.

443
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,760
There are many more pawns I can move.

444
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,080
Go.

445
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,960
And Chief Khachon insists that

446
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,640
he was unaware and not involved

447
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,560
in his secretary Chanon's scheme

448
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,240
to collect protection fees on his behalf.

449
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,120
<i>Chief Khachon also says he's ready</i>

450
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,960
<i>to cooperate with the authorities</i>

451
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,840
<i>to verify everything.</i>

452
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,840
<i>This is one more mission</i>

453
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,040
<i>the heroes of "Please be generous"</i>

454
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,400
<i>have accomplished to help the public.</i>

455
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,880
It's a shame they didn't catch the briber.

456
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,640
That would've helped
further the investigation.

457
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,880
You already helped us a great deal, sir.

458
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,360
Please accept my sincere gratitude.

459
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,320
I'm the one who owes you my thanks

460
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,080
and apologies.

461
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,280
Sir.

462
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,120
Chanon, my secretary, is a capable man,

463
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,240
but he is corrupted.

464
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,720
He used my name to commit crimes.

465
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,320
I thank you for the fact that

466
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,960
no matter how hard life

467
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,600
has been for you,

468
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,240
you've never done anything untoward.

469
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,000
And you've raised Kam so well.

470
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,480
I apologize

471
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,440
for letting my ego blind me

472
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,320
and getting you all in trouble.

473
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,480
The joy of helping someone

474
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,640
is a hero's reward, right, guys?

475
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,400
Mm.

476
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,400
I feel that way too.

477
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,360
Yes.

478
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,440
And now, I've gained one more idol.

479
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,280
Boss?

480
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,640
How are you wiping these?
The chairs still aren't clean?

481
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,680
And have you mopped the floor?

482
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,600
Not yet, boss.

483
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,520
- You haven't mopped the floor?
- No.

484
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,520
You haven't, but the water's this dirty.

485
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,240
Get new water and mop the floor.

486
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,080
- Yes, boss. I'll do that right away.
- This guy.

487
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,960
- Boss!
- What?

488
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,080
Boss.

489
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,960
I bought you an ice pop.
Your favorite flavor.

490
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,960
Oh.

491
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,560
Thanks, Thua.

492
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,760
Wow.

493
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,400
I was craving this flavor.

494
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,800
This reminds me of Koy.

495
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,120
Kam's mother.

496
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:22,320
Her name was Koy. Hey, I'm not bragging.

497
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,840
My wife was a knockout.

498
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,360
Yes.

499
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,040
Wait.

500
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,639
Thua, how did you know

501
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,040
that I loved this flavor?

502
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,120
Ms. Kam told me once.

503
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,920
I see.

504
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,679
Brain freeze.

505
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,520
Please take care of her.

506
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,840
Take care?

507
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,360
- Take care in what way?
- My father-in-law.

508
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,400
I mean Chief Khachon. He told me

509
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,680
you and your relatives

510
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,520
broke into his house to help Kam.

511
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,280
Thank you all for worrying about Kam.

512
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,880
Please take care of her.

513
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,480
Even though Kam's fearlessly bold,

514
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,280
her heart is gentle.

515
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,920
That's why she's easily duped.

516
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,400
You got it, boss. Don't you worry.

517
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,360
I'll take great care of Ms. Kam.

518
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,520
I'm relieved she has good friends.

519
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,120
- Boss.
- Hm?

520
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,320
Chief Khachon also said that
you used to be a bus ticket taker

521
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,360
before you became successful
because of love.

522
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,880
Do you know that you're my idol?

523
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,400
- Really?
- Yes.

524
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,000
Thanks.

525
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,120
Then again, back in the day,

526
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,920
I was a reckless man.

527
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,240
But since I became a father,

528
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,680
I realized and understood Chief Khachon.

529
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,040
No one knows what awaits

530
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,480
in their future.

531
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,360
True, boss. True.

532
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,760
Success

533
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,120
doesn't come easily.

534
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,760
If it's up to me, I want my daughter

535
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,040
to marry someone rich and decent

536
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,000
so she doesn't struggle.

537
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,400
Like…

538
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,480
Mr. Peem. What do you think?

539
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,680
Right?

540
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,560
He's the best one out there.

541
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,320
What are you reading, Kam?

542
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,400
Peem.

543
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,040
How are you feeling? Still hurt somewhere?

544
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,960
I'm okay now.

545
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,680
Just seeing that you care
makes me feel better.

546
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,200
Oh, the photos
of my grandfather and my mom.

547
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,800
And his letter to her.

548
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,680
It's a shame.

549
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,480
If my mom were still alive,
she would've been so happy

550
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,760
to see those she loved reconcile.

551
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,800
She still is.

552
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,520
Your mom's always in your heart.

553
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,400
She must've sensed it.

554
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,000
Thank you very much, Peem.

555
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,080
You make me feel loved like--

556
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,800
Don't say,

557
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,880
"Like having my mom by my side."

558
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,920
No.

559
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,720
I feel like I can smile every day.

560
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,640
You've always been there for me

561
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,760
and fixed all my problems.

562
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,760
I'd love to make you smile
every day in an official capacity.

563
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,440
Huh?

564
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,760
Please be my girlfriend.

565
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,680
Isn't that too fast?

566
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,840
After I heard about Chief Khachon
and your family, I've realized that

567
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,360
I should tell you
how I feel before it's too late.

568
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,400
If I keep waiting,

569
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,160
we'll have less and less time together.

570
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Or am I not good enough in your eyes?

571
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,360
Yes, I'll be your girlfriend.

572
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,160
I love you, Kam.

573
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,560
Kongfah's the one
my mom wired all her money to.

574
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,400
<i>Your mom wired the money</i>
<i>because she loves dogs.</i>

575
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,320
No. My mom was scammed.

576
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,440
NEXT EPISODE

<i>"Please be generous" webpage</i>
<i>is investigating Kongfah.</i>

578
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,760
<i>There are complaints that</i>

579
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,480
<i>Kongfah doesn't really rescue dogs.</i>
<i>He scams people.</i>

580
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,280
<i>Kongfah's webpage info?</i>
<i>Or is this Please be generous's?</i>

581
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,400
If you keep controlling me,
I'll kill myself!

582
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,360
- Mom! No, Mom!
- I'll kill myself!
