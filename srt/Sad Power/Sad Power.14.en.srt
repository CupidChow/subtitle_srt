1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Your mother has changed a lot, Peem.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,960
PREVIOUSLY

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,320
Let's give each other some space,

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,240
so I can reflect on things.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,960
- Ouch!
- What's wrong?

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,320
Something got in my eye.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,400
<i>Don't rub it. It can cut your cornea.</i>

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,880
"The San Karun Foundation's
bank account got hacked."

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,720
This is urgent.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,160
We must find the culprit and return
the money to the foundation.

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,640
<i>To find the culprit,</i>

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,080
<i>we need to know how they took the money.</i>

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,560
<i>I think the culprit</i>
<i>must be one of these three.</i>

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,080
Here! My password is in here.

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,720
You've been accused of embezzlement.

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,480
I didn't do it.

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,160
We have clear evidence,
and you're still lying?

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,080
What evidence?
I didn't do it. I didn't take it.

19
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,000
That's a lot of money!

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,040
If he didn't get paid,
where did he get that much money?

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,520
Then, we have to find him.

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,880
Hey, he's over there.

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,920
Pong! Stop!

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,560
Are you okay, Ms. Kam?

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,240
I’m fine, thanks, Thua.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Are you hurt?

27
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,160
I’m fine too.

28
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,320
But Ponk got away.

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,680
You mean Pong, right?

30
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,560
Yes, Pong.

31
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Thank you, Phakbung.

32
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,360
No problem at all, Kam.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,240
Thua, are you hurt anywhere?

34
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,080
No, I’m fine. Forget about me.
Just take care of Ms. Kam.

35
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,000
But don’t forget,
if you overuse your powers,

36
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,160
you’ll get weaker,
and it could affect the baby.

37
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,400
Yeah.

38
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,400
And now, Pong’s gotten away,

39
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,760
what do we do next?

40
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,960
If Chitra isn’t the culprit,
then she’s been falsely accused.

41
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,080
I think we need to help her first.

42
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,400
- Mr. Peem!
- Mr. Peem is here.

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How did you get here, Mr. Peem?

44
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,280
I can’t stand by
and let anyone defraud the foundation,

45
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,800
which is meant to be a refuge
for those in need.

46
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,720
- Will you handle this personally?
- That's correct.

47
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,320
What you’re doing isn’t right.

48
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,600
Kam.

49
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,320
The police haven’t concluded
their investigation.

50
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,560
Taking action at this stage
could unjustly label

51
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,720
someone as guilty.

52
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,440
What if the suspect turns out
to be innocent?

53
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,360
What will you do?

54
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,200
She has a point.

55
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,880
Hmm.

56
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,160
Why do we have to ask Kam
to cause a scene?

57
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,120
If we let Granny use her powers

58
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,320
and she ends up with memory loss,
we're all going to be in trouble.

59
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,960
Yeah, we need to think carefully
before using our powers.

60
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,400
- Let's go quickly.
- Let's go.

61
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,480
Breaking into a police station
is kinda exciting.

62
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,760
Let's go!

63
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,880
I don’t know. I didn’t see.
I didn’t do anything, Officer.

64
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,640
- Wait, calm down.
- I didn't do it!

65
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,960
Let’s take it slow.

66
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,760
Please wait for a moment.

67
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,520
Oh no, Chitra is in bad shape!

68
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,080
What should we do?

69
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,920
- Granny!
- Stop time, quickly!

70
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,040
Hold on!

71
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,160
Bung has to do it, I think.

72
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,840
- Bung, help her!
- Got it.

73
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,480
- Hey, Bung!
- Oh. Ugh.

74
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,560
- Bung!
- Hey, Bung!

75
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,040
Bung!

76
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,200
I think it’s because Bung used her powers
to heal Ms. Kam today.

77
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,640
I’ll carry her to the hospital myself.

78
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,120
No, you’ve already used your power today.

79
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,000
Why does being a hero have to come
with limited powers?

80
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,960
Even if our powers are limited,

81
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,160
we still have our strength
as ordinary people, right?

82
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,240
That's right.

83
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,080
- Come on. Are you okay?
- Okay.

84
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,120
I’ll snap my fingers to resume time.

85
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,120
We’ll yell for the police to help.

86
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,600
Got it, Granny.

87
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,720
- Bung, are you okay? Let's do this.
- Yes. I'm fine.

88
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,680
- Help!
- Help!

89
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,520
- Help!
- Help!

90
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,920
- What's going on?
- Help!

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,960
- Go check inside.
- Help!

92
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,840
Kam, come here!

93
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,680
- No, I’m going inside!
- Come here first. We need to talk.

94
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,760
Come here now.

95
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,520
I told you to come here. Go inside.

96
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
Go inside.

97
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,240
LOCATION

98
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,160
How could you do this?

99
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,680
No, I’m the one who should ask.
How could you do this, Peem?

100
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,840
You’re just trying to create a scene
for yourself without knowing the truth.

101
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,560
Where has the Peem
who used to help others gone?

102
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,960
It isn’t just about this, Kam.

103
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,160
I can accept that you embarrass me,

104
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,080
but how could you betray me?

105
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,240
Thua and I are friends.

106
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,400
There’s nothing more to it.

107
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,400
If you were thinking clearly,
you’d realize

108
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,600
it was just an angle designed
to make it look misleading.

109
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,160
But from what I see,
you’re losing everything now,

110
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
your composure, your goodness.

111
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,480
Kam, let's talk first.

112
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,360
- We have things to clear up, Kam.
- We have nothing to talk about.

113
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,040
- Let me go.
- Kam!

114
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,240
Are you okay? Hey, you're all red!

115
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,960
Ugh!

116
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
Stop it, Peem.

117
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,680
You say there's nothing going on,
but you're protecting him?

118
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,840
Because you hurt my friend!

119
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,840
And what about when he hit me?

120
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,440
That's because you hurt me!

121
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,320
I can't believe

122
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,600
I used to love someone like you.

123
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
Dammit!

124
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,040
Are you really okay, Ms. Kam?

125
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,280
Was it because of me that you two fought?

126
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,760
You're hurt because of me,

127
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,080
and you're still worried about me?

128
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,320
But you're really okay, right?

129
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,040
Should I apologize to Peem for you?

130
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,560
If anyone needs to apologize,

131
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,320
it should be me.

132
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,760
I've caused you so much trouble

133
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,640
and hurt you countless times.

134
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,560
But I'm glad

135
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,920
I could do something for you.

136
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,760
Why are you so kind to me?

137
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,520
What about Peem, though?
Is everything really okay with him?

138
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,680
Hmm.

139
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,240
If you keep asking,
you're going to get another injury.

140
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,160
Want that?

141
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,920
- No, no.
- Want that?

142
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,600
I give up.

143
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,920
PEEM

144
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
PEEM - MISSED CALL

145
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,080
<i>Thank you so much, Peem.</i>

146
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,120
You make me feel loved like…

147
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,920
Don't say,
"Like having my mom by my side."

148
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,920
No.

149
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,760
I feel like I can smile every day.

150
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,960
PEEM

151
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,680
THUA

152
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,400
<i>Yes, Ms. Kam?</i>

153
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,040
Have you reached home yet?

154
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,760
I’ve got some information
related to the San Karun Foundation.

155
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,360
<i>Last night, the suspect</i>

156
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,720
<i>in the San Karun Foundation</i>
<i>embezzlement case</i>

157
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,000
<i>experienced persistently</i>
<i>high blood pressure,</i>

158
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,280
<i>likely due to stress,</i>

159
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,720
<i>which almost led to seizures.</i>

160
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,000
<i>Fortunately, the police managed to rush</i>
<i>the suspect to the hospital in time.</i>

161
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,240
Luckily, when we called the police,

162
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,680
I stopped time with a snap,
and we managed to get out in time.

163
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,160
Instead of getting information,

164
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,280
we ended up sending someone
to the hospital.

165
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,760
I wonder how Chitra is doing now.

166
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,200
I called the police station this morning.

167
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,480
They said someone posted bail for her,

168
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,160
but she’ll need to stay
in the hospital longer.

169
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,000
I have a check-up tomorrow.
I’ll check on her then.

170
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,840
I'll go with you.

171
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,920
Wait, Kam, is that really a good idea?

172
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,120
Considering what happened yesterday,

173
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,800
I think he's probably watching you.

174
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,640
Watching? Who’s watching?

175
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,520
Peem. He’s probably trying to get back
at me for embarrassing him

176
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,080
by successfully creating a buzz.

177
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,960
If he can watch us,

178
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,080
we can watch him, too.

179
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,080
That means
you must have some kind of plan.

180
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,200
Of course!
Know your enemy and know yourself,

181
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,080
then you don't need to fear the result
of a hundred or a thousand battles.

182
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,920
Looks like you’ve read a lot of novels.

183
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,160
Nutty, why haven't there been any news
about me lately?

184
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,560
Well, you left me last night.

185
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,840
Nutty!

186
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,560
I'm really sorry.

187
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,520
I was so angry with Kam last night
that I went to yell at her.

188
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,880
Even though I showed you that video,

189
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,440
you haven't cut ties with her.

190
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,200
Nutty.

191
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,320
It's a crucial time before the election.
Everything is volatile right now.

192
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,760
I don't want the party
to think badly of me.

193
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,440
And as I’ve told you before,
my mom is supporting Kam

194
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,680
because she’s a volunteer and has
supporters in the community.

195
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,280
Okay. Well, I'll show your mom

196
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,640
that I can help you more than she can.

197
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,560
How about we start
by doing a news segment about me?

198
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,080
Since we can't create a story
about catching criminals,

199
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,840
let's create a heroic narrative
where I save the foundation.

200
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,240
A politician as a savior,

201
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,840
coming in to rescue the foundation
for people with disabilities.

202
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,000
How does a segment like that sound?

203
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,120
Okay. I'll do it for you, Peem.

204
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,960
I have a segment for you to work on.
Prepare the information, and get ready.

205
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,200
So, how are things?
What do we know about him?

206
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,200
Got a lot of leads, Granny.

207
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,720
First, Peem will make up
a story about a thief

208
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,240
to stir up attention.

209
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,240
- Huh?
- Second…

210
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,720
Peem really does have a mistress.

211
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,240
Oh.

212
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Poor Kam.

213
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,280
Peem is really careful.

214
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,120
I'm worried that Granny
and Typhoon might get caught.

215
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,200
Don't worry.

216
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,720
Remember, Granny and Typhoon
have special powers.

217
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,560
Good. If we can find evidence
that he has a mistress,

218
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,200
I'll break up with him for good.

219
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,680
Are you really going

220
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,200
to break up with him?

221
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,040
Not really.

222
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,200
Deep down, I hope Peem will change.

223
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,720
If I can prove that Chitra is innocent,

224
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,640
I hope he'll understand

225
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,840
that what he did was wrong.

226
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,840
I’ll help you prove it.

227
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,640
I have to apologize.

228
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,720
I can’t give you
any information about Pong.

229
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,000
Why not? We really need it.

230
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,120
Then tell me what you’re planning to do
with the information about him.

231
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,640
Just tell him.
We have no way of finding Pong now.

232
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,160
Well, my sister saw Pong
carry a lot of money,

233
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,960
even though the foundation
couldn’t pay the staff.

234
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,160
We wanted to ask him about it,
but he ran away.

235
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,800
And he acted like he was running
from some kind of wrongdoing.

236
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,880
Don’t tell me the real culprit is…

237
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,880
Well, we don’t want to jump
to conclusions yet.

238
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,360
That’s why we want to find Pong.

239
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,080
Yes, so we want you to help, Mr. Wit.

240
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,200
Actually, I want to help,

241
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,160
but I’ve been trying
to find information about Pong

242
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,240
ever since you first called,

243
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,640
and I still haven’t found anything.

244
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,680
Huh?

245
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,080
Jeez, Pong.

246
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,680
Bung!

247
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,640
Wow, you're really persistent.

248
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,320
I told you to go with Granny.
No need to come with me.

249
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,400
No, I’m just worried
about my younger sibling.

250
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,360
Be honest.

251
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,920
The snacks at the hospital
are really good.

252
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,800
Jeez! Oh, but right now,

253
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,440
the police brought Ms. Chitra here
for treatment.

254
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,200
We need to help find her first,

255
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,760
then I'll go for the check-up later.

256
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,800
Okay. Let's go.

257
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,920
I’ve been waiting since this morning,
but Kam still hasn’t shown up.

258
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,280
I think she’s ignoring you
out of jealousy.

259
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,720
She probably isn’t making
a big deal of it.

260
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,160
I’m giving you a chance
to make things right.

261
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,160
Do whatever it takes to keep me
from looking foolish to the press.

262
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,640
I need to be a hero
in the case of the San Karun Foundation.

263
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,960
I’ll show you, Kam, that you're wrong,

264
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,440
and no one can stop me.

265
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,280
Do you know which room?

266
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,680
- No idea.
- Huh?

267
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,720
Let’s walk around and find it.

268
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,680
Where is it?

269
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,800
Right here.

270
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,040
Hey, wait a minute.

271
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,520
What are you doing, Bung?

272
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,560
I’m going in to investigate about Chitra.

273
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,120
Let’s talk first about how to tell her.

274
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,240
- Just tell her we’re superhe--
- Hey!

275
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,720
We’re good citizens,

276
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,600
giving clues
to the "Please be generous" team. Okay?

277
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,840
Okay, okay. Let’s go!

278
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,040
- Hey.
- Oh!

279
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,280
- Hello.
- Hello.

280
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,960
Come in, dear.

281
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,520
Okay.

282
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,680
Thank you.

283
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,200
You're still a suspect.
No one is guarding you.

284
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,840
Aren’t the police afraid you’ll escape?

285
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,120
The lawyer used my inherited land

286
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,360
to bail me out already.

287
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,200
Wait, is that all you came

288
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,600
to ask me about?

289
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,480
Well, Thua and Kam asked me to tell you

290
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,880
that they found out
that the person who stole the money

291
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,720
from the foundation is…

292
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,640
Pong.

293
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,600
How did you know?

294
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,320
<i>Chitra, listen to me.</i>

295
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,320
I'm sorry.
I was the one who took the money.

296
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,320
Pong!

297
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,480
I’ll find a way to give this money

298
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,880
to the disabled,

299
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,480
and then I’ll turn myself in.

300
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,440
Why did you do this, Pong?

301
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,880
Chitra.

302
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,120
It’s the only way I could think of.

303
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,440
<i>I’m really sorry.</i>

304
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,000
He had to steal from the foundation

305
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,040
in order to help the disabled.

306
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,640
Hooray!

307
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,320
So, the case is solved now, right?

308
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,360
I won’t let Pong turn himself in.

309
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,600
- Huh?
- Huh?

310
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,200
I talked to the lawyer.

311
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,000
He said that if I take the full blame

312
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,520
and repay all the damages,

313
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,240
the sentence will be reduced.

314
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,280
So, does this mean

315
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,320
you're going to take
all the blame for this?

316
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,760
It might be the best option

317
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,680
because I still consider Pong
to be my little brother.

318
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,200
You can’t do that.

319
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
If you do, Pong will take advantage of it.

320
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,800
I’ve been disappointed
from thinking of you as a thief,

321
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,280
but now, I’m even more disappointed

322
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,920
that you’re protecting a criminal!

323
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,320
I’m not protecting Pong!

324
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,640
I’m protecting you!

325
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,400
Protecting me?

326
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,080
Yes!

327
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,680
It's because of who

328
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,200
that Pong became a thief,
if not because of you?

329
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,440
Think about it. All this time,

330
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,840
you kept asking to share the budget,
increase the budget, change the computers,

331
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,760
change the curtains, change the floor,

332
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,560
until Pong couldn’t take it anymore.

333
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,120
He couldn’t take it?

334
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,120
So, he became a thief?

335
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,320
Yes, he became a thief

336
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,680
to steal money

337
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,480
to help the disabled.

338
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,400
- Huh?
- Huh?

339
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,520
Phoon, I think we should head back.

340
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,560
We still have a lot to do.

341
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,320
Huh? Aren’t you going to…

342
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,640
Are you done with your business?

343
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,240
Then you can go for your check-up now.

344
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,720
Oh, hello, Doctor.

345
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,880
- Hello.
- Hello.

346
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,240
You haven't forgotten
about your check-up, right?

347
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,320
- She forgot. She totally forgot.
- Hey.

348
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,000
She was about to take me home.

349
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,120
Typhoon!

350
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,080
It's just that
there was a small issue. That's why…

351
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,120
I saw you here at the hospital,

352
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,120
but you stopped by to be the good citizen

353
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,720
in the inpatient ward
while you had a check-up scheduled.

354
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,880
Do you know which room?

355
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,040
- No idea.
- Huh?

356
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,200
Let's find it.

357
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,040
I got a queue ticket for you,
so you won’t have to wait long.

358
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,200
You can get checked today,

359
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,320
so you and the baby
won’t have to come back and forth.

360
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,720
I already told you to rest more, right?

361
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,600
Thank you.

362
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,120
In that case, I’ll quickly make a call.

363
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,480
Okay, don’t run off, okay?
See you in the exam room.

364
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,320
Doctor Korn is nice.
He doesn’t want you to wait long,

365
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,080
so he got the queue ticket for you.

366
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,600
Oh my!

367
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,480
What?

368
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,600
Call Thua about Pong. Hurry!

369
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,160
Let's go.

370
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,440
Here’s the Laab Itthirit. Go ahead.

371
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,360
We’ve arrived.

372
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,400
- Please, go ahead.
- Please, just a moment.

373
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,040
There's a free table inside.
Please come in.

374
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,720
We’ve arrived, Uncle. The seat’s here.

375
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,680
Please take your time to sit.

376
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,240
Yes.

377
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,360
What would you like to have?

378
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,560
I’ll have two Laab
and four sticky rice, please.

379
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,080
Two Laab and four sticky rice. Got it.

380
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,000
- To-go? Alright.
- Yeah.

381
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,400
Uncle, please wait here a moment.
I’ll go buy some items.

382
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,120
Granny.

383
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,680
Mr. Wit has no information on Pong.

384
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,800
How are we supposed to find him?

385
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,720
Well, to be honest,

386
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,520
Pong doesn't look like a criminal
based on his appearance.

387
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
- Right?
- Yeah.

388
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,200
I think he seems happy doing his work.

389
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,600
- Right.
- He truly wants to help the disabled.

390
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,880
Um… Is the Pong you're talking about

391
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,320
from the San Karun Foundation?

392
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,560
You know him?

393
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,240
Yes. Tell me.

394
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,760
Has Pong done anything wrong?

395
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,880
Did he steal the money

396
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,920
meant to help everyone?

397
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,800
Hello, Bung.

398
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,480
Thua! Pong used the money
to help people with disabilities.

399
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,320
I think I know.

400
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,040
I'm Pong's friend.

401
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,800
Pong's friend. Pong.

402
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,720
He's been bringing us food and essentials,

403
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,680
sometimes money, for years.

404
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,920
But recently,

405
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
it's been less.

406
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,560
He said the budget

407
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,360
was divided, but soon enough,

408
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,960
he brought more again.

409
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,360
Well…

410
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,960
Why didn't you register properly
for disability benefits?

411
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,760
Why wait for Pong?

412
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,960
What registration?

413
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,560
I don’t even have an ID card.

414
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,200
Most people here

415
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,920
are blind, can't walk,

416
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,840
is mute or deaf.

417
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,720
If we could register, we would have.

418
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,840
I guess this is why

419
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,680
Chitra took the blame for Pong.

420
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,040
It's a tough situation.
A thief who’s not really a thief.

421
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,320
If they catch Pong,

422
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,760
they can take me instead.

423
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,920
If he’s not around,
the disabled people will suffer.

424
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,600
But even if Pong did it for a good cause,

425
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,920
it’s still wrong.

426
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,360
Is this all you wanted to show me?

427
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,840
I have an appointment, so I'm leaving.

428
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,760
It's because of who

429
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,080
that Pong became a thief,
if not because of you?

430
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,800
All this time, you kept asking
to share the budget,

431
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,800
increase the budget, change the computers,

432
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,720
change the curtains, change the floor,

433
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,520
until Pong couldn’t take it anymore.

434
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,280
Go ahead.

435
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,080
Go ahead.

436
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,200
Hello, Mr. Wit.

437
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,280
- Hello.
- Hello. Please, take a seat.

438
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,160
How's the case going?

439
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,520
Feel free to tell me. I'm happy to help.

440
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,960
I want this case to be a model example,

441
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,120
so that no one else
will exploit the foundation.

442
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,480
I apologize to you.

443
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,280
But can we put this case aside for now?

444
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,400
I’ve just found out that Chitra
wasn’t the one who took the money,

445
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,160
but one of our employees did.

446
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,840
I'm currently trying to persuade him
to turn himself in.

447
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,480
I truly apologize.

448
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,840
NATIONAL MUNICIPAL ASSOCIATION

449
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,360
If the real criminal turns himself in,

450
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,120
then I’ll be at a loss.

451
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,120
I’ve been asking the press
to do news segments about you,

452
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,480
track the criminal case,
but turns out she's fake.

453
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,200
Hey.

454
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,400
It’s me who’ll lose.

455
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,440
How will the press view me, Nutty?

456
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,080
You really messed things up.

457
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,440
Hey, why are you blaming me?

458
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,920
It’s you who couldn’t catch the criminal.

459
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,600
Right.

460
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,200
If I had caught the criminal,
I’d be a hero again.

461
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,960
What are you planning to do?

462
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,520
It’s not hard to find that coworker,

463
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,840
but I have to find him. I’ll catch
the criminal before he turns himself in.

464
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,000
You’re right, Peem.

465
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,680
This time, I’ll make sure
it’s all over the front pages!

466
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,000
I just dropped off Ms. Kam
and was about to head back.

467
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,160
Granny, you need to tell Phoon
to save me some food.

468
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,840
What if I don’t have anything to eat?

469
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,600
Hey!

470
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,760
- Be quiet!
- <i>Thua!</i>

471
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,080
<i>What's going on?</i>

472
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,680
Hang up!

473
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,800
What did you talk about
with Duang and everyone?

474
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,240
I told them not to take the blame for you.

475
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,760
You didn’t know, right? Chitra

476
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,640
and Duang volunteered to take the blame.

477
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,000
Everyone knows

478
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,840
you took the money to help the disabled.

479
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,520
The knife was fake.

480
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,680
See? You’re not a bad person.

481
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,320
No.

482
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,520
I’m a bad person because I did it.

483
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,240
You would really be a bad person

484
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,120
if you let others take the blame for you.

485
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,080
Oh no. Why didn't you catch Pong?

486
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,680
He's going to run away again.

487
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,720
But Pong said he's going
to visit Duang tomorrow,

488
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,880
and he asked for help

489
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,680
to bring Chitra and Wit with him.

490
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,520
He wants to apologize to everyone
before he turns himself in.

491
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,760
Is Pong really going to go?

492
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,240
Let's try believing in the good in people

493
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,480
for once, Granny.

494
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,280
Yes, Ms. Kam?

495
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,800
<i>Thua, Seng said he saw Peem’s car</i>

496
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,680
<i>near my house. Did he do anything to you?</i>

497
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,160
He didn’t do anything to me.

498
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,560
Or maybe he met Pong.

499
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,560
- Huh?
- Huh?

500
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,520
Yeah, yeah.

501
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,480
- This way, everyone.
- Yes.

502
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,320
I'll take you to catch the real thief

503
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,360
who stole money
from the San Karun Foundation.

504
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,679
- Yes.
- Go ahead.

505
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,920
ROOM AVAILABLE

506
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,880
- Be careful.
- In this room, officers.

507
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,920
Hurry.

508
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,800
Open the door quickly. We’re the police.

509
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,719
If you don’t open it,
we’ll break it down. One!

510
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,800
Two! Three!

511
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,880
So, where’s the culprit?

512
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,680
What’s going on?

513
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,760
Fortunately, we managed
to help Pong in time.

514
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,240
You…

515
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,000
You need to go see Duang today

516
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,400
and turn yourself in tomorrow morning.

517
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,160
Why? What happened?

518
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,200
If you're caught, there won’t be
any chance to reduce your sentence.

519
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,680
Trust me.

520
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,720
So, this doesn’t count
as helping the wrong person, right?

521
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,200
Thua already said it. It's about
having faith in the good in people.

522
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,280
I’ve come to say goodbye to everyone.
I’m going to turn myself in.

523
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,240
As for the money,
I’ll leave it with you to keep.

524
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,680
Pong.

525
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,520
Disabled people are like everyone else.

526
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,920
They have dignity too.

527
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,200
I’d rather go hungry

528
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,320
than take stolen money.

529
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,280
I'm sorry.

530
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,320
This is all I could think of.

531
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,120
I was wrong.

532
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,680
I know I made a mistake, and I messed up.

533
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,640
But from now on, I promise you,

534
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,600
I’ll take care of the disabled people

535
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,480
and won’t use the money for anything else.

536
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,760
I’m really sorry.

537
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,160
We’ll wait for you to come back.

538
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,040
I’m leaving this money with you

539
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,280
to do good deeds with.

540
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,480
So, this is what they mean

541
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,400
by "the right thing at the right time".

542
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,480
The "Please be generous" team

543
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,120
has done it again!

544
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,000
Wait. Where’s Ms. Kam?

545
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,720
- Oh.
- Oh, right?

546
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,480
I heard she said

547
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,840
she was going to sort things out
to make it right.

548
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,280
I was chasing that thief myself.
How could he suddenly disappear?

549
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,040
I don’t know if the reporters
will cover this anymore.

550
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,760
I really don’t understand what happened.

551
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,400
Maybe it’s because of what’s right
that happened.

552
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,680
Kam.

553
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,600
Don’t tell me it was you again.

554
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,120
What did you do?

555
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,440
It’s you who did something.

556
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,840
You waited for me, secretly followed Thua,

557
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,000
tried to catch someone who was
already about to turn themselves in.

558
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,440
That’s nonsense, Kam.

559
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,440
When I see a thief, I have to catch them.
It’s my duty as a good citizen.

560
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,920
Well then, go ahead
and be a good citizen your way, alone.

561
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,960
Why, Kam? What are you going to do?

562
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,360
We’re breaking up, Peem.

563
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,960
That is to help Tonkla,
a 14-year-old child with autism,

564
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,120
<i>who is regularly bullied</i>
<i>by his classmates.</i>

565
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,640
Ready to go
to the Somboonpoon Sukjai School?

566
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,680
- Ready!
- Ready!

567
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,480
Why is everyone getting sick
at the same time?

568
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,880
<i>I think this school might have</i>
<i>more than just bullying issues.</i>

569
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,800
- Bung!
- Bung!

570
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,800
<i>And then we all got powers.</i>
<i>Except for me. It's kind of bad, right?</i>

571
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,880
<i>Who says that’s bad? You’re special, Thua.</i>

572
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,880
<i>You don’t need superpowers to help others.</i>
<i>That’s so cool!</i>

573
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,840
