00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,470
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,710
I'm going to Seoul.

3
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,120
I won't be back within the next few years.

4
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,990
Why are you suddenly going to Seoul? Tell me.

5
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,300
You said you liked this place before.

6
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,500
I told you... everything will change.

7
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:08,350
I want to go because I've been admitted to a good university.

8
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,260
Can't you just stay here?

9
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,950
I'll do nothing and just stay by your side, okay?

10
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,550
Are you going to Seoul to avoid me?

11
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,530
Do you hate me that much?

12
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,810
I apologized to you and told you I won't do it again.

13
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,400
It's not your problem.

14
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,910
It's my problem.

15
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,710
Let me hug you one more time.

16
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,990
Don't get hurt.

17
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,930
I can't apply ointment for you anymore.

18
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,080
Bye.

19
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,790
Go Hotae.

20
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,380
Why are you back so late?

21
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,159
I can't believe you just asked me that.

22
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,480
Don't you know why?

23
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,970
So you were looking for me.

24
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,880
I won't be here anymore.

25
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,960
Why?

26
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,390
Why won't you be here?

27
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,780
Why did you leave me?

28
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,820
Didn't you promise to be with me forever?

29
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,710
You lied to me.

30
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,500
Because many things will change.

31
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,970
I've changed too.

32
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,970
Darn it.

33
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,900
How do you know you'll change?

34
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,020
I won't change.

00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,890
Auntie.

38
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,240
Looks like your business isn't doing very well.

39
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,300
Since you're calling me at this hour.

[Kim Donghee]

41
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,930
Didn't I tell you not to get hurt?

42
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,870
You only called me

43
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,580
after I broke my leg.

44
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,010
Hey, Kim Donghee.

45
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,380
Is it that fun in Seoul?

46
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,690
Yes.

47
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,250
Leaving me behind, are you that happy?

48
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,660
You don't need to be so serious.

49
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,690
Does it hurt?

50
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,820
Of course it hurts. My leg is broken.

51
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,660
The doctor said I can't swim anymore. Isn't that funny?

52
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,960
You should smile.

53
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,700
I like to see you smile.

54
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,090
I never smiled that much.

55
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,390
I just realized you don't seem to know yourself very well.

56
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,780
You've always been a gentle guy who likes to smile.

57
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,440
You've been like this since you were little.

58
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,820
You always like to smile, and you're gentle.

59
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,400
Even so, how can I smile now?

60
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,760
I'm not a crazy man.

61
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,210
I haven't smiled for a long time. It's nice to smile like this.

62
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,390
I'm really fine.

63
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,280
You know I'm very tough.

64
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,170
I know.

65
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,070
Go Hotae.

66

Hello.

70
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,780
The commercial area here is good,

71
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,040
but the situation varies significantly with the seasons.

72
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,330
Call me when you decide.

73
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,290
Okay. Thank you.

74
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,540
Go Hotae.

Yes.

77
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,990
Hey, Kim Donghee, come here.
