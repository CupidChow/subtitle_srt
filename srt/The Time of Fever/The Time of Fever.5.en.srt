1
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,040
I don't think I can be a doctor.

2
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,300
Why not?

3
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,270
I'm not qualified.

4
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,990
What kind of qualifications do you need to get into med school?

5
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,040
I've decided to go to a university in Seoul.

6
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,970
This way, everyone will be happy.

7
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,100
Won't you regret it?

8
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,280
I'll definitely... regret it a lot.

9
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,460
It's freezing out here. Why didn't you go home?

10
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,400
It's been a while since I've spent time with you.

11
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,930
Besides, there's nothing for me to do at home.

12
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,690
Oh, come on. Don't think I don't know

13
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,860
you came here just to help me.

14
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,900
Hey.

15
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,670
When you were born...

16
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,690
My friend had a baby boy,

17
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,000
and I thought he was so cute.

18
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,810
Chubby, soft, and so sweet.

19
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,250
He was adorable when eating. Even when he pooped too.

20
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,270
Living is not easy.

21
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,020
But I thought, at the very least, I hope he doesn't get sick.

22
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,750
It'd be nice if he could live a life full of smiles.

23
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,250
That's what I wished for.

24
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,610
Whenever I see your smile,

25
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,560
I forget how tired I am.

26
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:47,190
Because of your smile, I've owed a lot of favors.

27
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,660
So no matter what you do,

28
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,850
I could never hate you.

29
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,920
Well...

30
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,050
You care for me so much.

31
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,250
But... you might not see me anymore.

32
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,420
Why?

33
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,100
I got into a university in Seoul, so I'll be going there.

34
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,590
Don't worry about me.

35
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:40,190
That's ridiculous. How can I not worry about you?

36
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,280
How long do you plan to avoid me?

37
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,590
Sitting here in the dark—what are you doing?

38
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,800
Because you only come home when the lights are off.

39
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,340
Let's go inside. You'll catch a cold.

40
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,960
Forgive me, okay?

41
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,870
I won't do it again.

42
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,680
I'm sorry.

43
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,910
If I stop liking you, it'll be better for everyone.

44
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,860
But I just don't know how to stop.

45
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,550
[Go Hotae, come outside with me. I'm waiting at the café you always go to]

46
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,680
What?

47
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,270
You put trash in my water bottle?

48
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,040
It wasn't trash.

49
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,150
I bought it.

50
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,630
Thank you. It's pretty.

51
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,730
So, you've forgiven me?

52
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,290
Stop messing around. Call me brother, and I'll forgive you.

53
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,070
Still not answering?

54
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,890
That's not happening.

55
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,210
Name something else, and I'll do it.

56
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,000
It's cold.

57
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,050
Let's find a place to sit inside, okay?

58
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,840
Let's keep walking a bit longer.

59
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,700
Come on, didn't you say you'd listen to me?

60
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,010
We'll walk to the end, then take a picture.

61
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,310
Fine.

62
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,600
Wait for me.

63
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,280
Do we really have to take a picture here?

64
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,960
Yes.

65
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,160
They put this here because it's the most photogenic spot.

66
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,480
We're not tourists.

67
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,580
Can't you hurry up and take it?

68
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,250
Move a bit to the right.

69
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,850
A bit more.

70
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,510
Am I standing in the center?

71
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,450
Where are you going to stand?

72
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,890
Did you take the photo already?

73
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,550
I pressed the wrong button.

74
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,340
Move to the left.

75
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,790
A little more to the left.

76
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,960
A little more.

77
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:56,960
Aren't we back where we started?

78
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,300
It's the angle, okay?

79
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,000
Hey.

80
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,110
Well...

81
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,100
You dropped this.

82
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,710
Thank you.

83
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,260
Bye.

84
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,340
Are you a thug? Stop frowning.

85
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,470
Do I look like a thug to you?

86
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,670
No.

87
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,270
Then we're good.

88
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,720
[Chun Hyemin: When are we going on a date? Contact me, please. :(]

89
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,900
[Phone off]

90
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,950
[Phone off]

91
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,020
Why are you packing like you're moving out?

92
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,060
The exams are over.

93
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,100
You can sleep here.

94
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,890
Really?

95
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,580
Yes.

96
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,010
Let's chat and sleep together.

97
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,070
You can't back out.

98
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,470
Hey, dry your hair or you'll catch a cold.

99
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,770
It's too much trouble.

100
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,680
Why is your phone off?

101
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,550
I don't want to be bothered.

102
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,530
What?

103
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,570
Sit up straight.

104
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,180
We don't have many days left to go to school together.

105
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,280
It's going to be boring.

106
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,550
Can I wait for you tomorrow after school? Let's go home together.

107
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,150
Not answering means yes, right?

108
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,369
What are you doing here?

109
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,470
I'm going to Seoul.

110
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,730
I won't be back for years.

111
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,170
Why are you suddenly going to Seoul? Tell me.

112
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,920
You used to say you liked it here.

113
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:38,230
I told you, everything changes.

114
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,220
I got into a good school, so I'm going.

115
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,600
Can't you stay here?

116
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,450
I won't do anything, just stay by your side.

117
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,460
Are you going to Seoul to avoid me?

118
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,450
Do you really hate me that much?

119
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,000
I already apologized and promised it wouldn't happen again.

120
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,490
It's not about you. It's me.

121
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,940
Let me hug you one last time.

122
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,540
Don't get hurt.

123
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,080
I won't be around to bandage you anymore.

124
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,360
I'm leaving.

125
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,290
[Epilogue]
