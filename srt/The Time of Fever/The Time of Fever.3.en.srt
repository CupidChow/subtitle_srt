No, why?

4
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:44,840
Sure.

I thought something happened to you.

21
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,590
So you were worried about me?

22
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,590
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

23

Don't you think you sent too many of them?

We said we'd go out and have fun. Why are we seeing the ocean?

98

This is the most fun place for me.

99

It's so cold that we can't swim. What's fun about it?

100

When I was little, I used to come here with my parents every birthday.

101

We'd have delicious food together

102
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,520

116
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,470
Okay.

117
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,300
Well, I can't beat your mom.

118
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,500
What about you?

119
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,070
I'll just go home and cook instant noodles.

120
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,200
What's the big deal?

121
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,160
Let's go.

122
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,660
Let's walk there to the end.

123
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,950
Auntie is waiting.

124
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,780
Let's go.

125
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,200
Donghee went home for seaweed soup, right?

126
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,310
He should be back by now, right?

127
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,590
He will come back.

128
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:07,120
He's already a senior high school student. Why should you worry? That he'll be abducted?

129
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,270
Was it your dad again?

130
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,120
No wonder I feel so uneasy.

131
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,060
Happy birthday to you.

132

Don't ask.

Oh my. Oh my.

139
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,480
Are you going after him again?

140
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,770
Don't cause me any more trouble.

141
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,980
Just put some ointment on him.

142
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,160
Darn it.

143
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,340
Bastard.

144
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,680
If I catch him,

145
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,430
I'll kill him.

146
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,430
Don't be like this.

147
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,710
He's probably more hurt than me.

148
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,730
Did you beat him up?

149
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,319
Idiot. Do you have to see blood to judge if someone is hurt?

150
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,140
That's why you asked your ex-girlfriends to punch you

151
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,069
when you broke up with them, right?

152
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,430
What's hurt more was actually the heart.

153
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,470
Well, they all thought they got a good chance,

154
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,800
and they beat me up good.

155
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:41,000
After all, if they didn't take the opportunity to punch you, they wouldn't know what else to do.

156
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,250
That's why they punched you without hesitation.

157
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,710
Do you think they'd really love to do that?

158
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,050
By the way, why do you keep defending that bastard who beat you?

159
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,030
It really pisses me off.

160
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:56,920
Ah.

161
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,290
Stay still,

162
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,510
or you'll bleed.

163
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,640

167
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,440
How do you feel?

168
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,520
I don't know.

169
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,200
It's a bit... Weird.

170

Now that you know, stop getting beaten up.

171
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,090

Ah.

Oh, does it hurt?

00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,040
I'm sorry.

[Epilogue]

182
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,770
You asked me to recommend ointment last time,

183
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,180
and now, you suddenly started learning how to apply it.

184
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,910
Someone gets hurt all the time,

185
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,420
and I have to help him heal every time.

186
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,690
I need to cure him with my own hands.

187
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,470
What does he do?

188
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,350
He's an athlete.

189
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,330
So you're going to medical school?

190
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,040
That's what I thought.

191
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,700
I've already told our homeroom teacher that

192
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,180
I want to go to the nearest medical school.

193
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,080
What's going on?

194
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,740
Did you suddenly have a dream?

195
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,780
What? You're even giggling.

196
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,600
It's not like you at all, Kim Donghee.

197
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,050
I just had nothing to giggle about before.

198
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,590
Alright. Fine.

199
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,420
No matter what, I love seeing you happy.

200
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,420
Now that you're laughing, you finally look like a senior high school student.
