1
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,720
Does it hurt?

2
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,360
Sorry.

3
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,060
What's wrong? Are you crying?

4
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,190
[Kim Donghee]

5
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,180
I almost couldn't see him.

6
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:46,180
I'm crazy. What am I doing sneakily?

7
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,340
Hey. You're so mean. You went to school alone.

8
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,870
You'll follow me, right?

9
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,400
So I don't need to ask you to go to school with me.

10
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,460
What do you mean? Am I a stalker to you?

11
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,820
What happened?

12
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,850
Your classroom is over here. Where are you going?

13
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:26,790
To the infirmary.

14
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,920
What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?

15
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,860
No, I mean you.

16
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,220
Me? I'm not hurt.

17
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,250
You'll get hurt soon.

18
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,280
Bye.

19
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,650
I knew this would happen.

20
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,579
Why are they together?

21
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,850
-Darn it!
-Darn it!

22
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,660
You actually left me behind.

23
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,700
Should I stay and get beaten up with you?

24
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,680
I'm afraid everyone in the school will know.

25
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,940
I don't care... what others say about me.

26
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,820
I can't believe you said you don't care.

27
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,760
Are you sure he's here?

28
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,180
I told you I saw him go in.

29
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,850
It's locked.

30
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,220
Hey, trust me.

31
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,320
This is just a piece of cake!

32
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,490
[Pull]

33
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,870
-Why should I hide too?
-Shush.

34
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,950
Where is he?

35
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,190
Hotae, where are you?

36
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,909
Hotae.

37
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,920
What is this?

38
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,690
Where is he hiding?

39
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,270
Hey, Go Hotae!

40
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,180
I'll teach you a lesson if I catch you!

41
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Step aside.

42
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,740
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

43
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,590
Kim Donghee.

44
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,250
Have you ever kissed?

45
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,690
What?

46
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,090
I asked... if you have ever kissed.

47
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,600
What do you want?

48
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:10,940
I just... want to kiss for the first time.

49
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,720
I want to kiss my new lover.

50
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,650
Then just kiss.

51
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,910
I'm serious this time.

52
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,660
So?

53
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,440
Answer me.

54
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,320
What?

55
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,860
Have you ever kissed?

56
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,440
Yes.

57
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,580
Yes?

58
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,290
What's with that reaction?

59
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,080
When? With whom?

60
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,340
Why do you want to know?

61
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:56,730
Then... teach me.

62
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,020
I've never kissed. But I don't want to make it obvious.

63
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,340
How am I supposed to teach you that?

64
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,020
Just try it on me.

65
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,670
Are you crazy?

66
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,330
Stop talking nonsense.

67
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,140
What?

68
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,990
Just think of me as a doorframe.

69
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,150
Will your lips get hurt by rubbing against a doorframe?

70
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,950
You said I can ask you if there's anything I don't understand, right?

71
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,240
Then call me Brother.

72
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,490
-You can't make such a joke.
-Brother Donghee.

73
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,420
Please teach me...

74
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,480
how to... kiss.

75
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,490
Teach me.

76
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,590
It scared me.

77
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,760
Don't run away. Go back to class.

78
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,880
I was so nervous that my heart almost exploded.

79
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,420
I rubbed my lips against a doorframe

80
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,640
and was hurt by splinters.

81
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,010
It's not like I didn't expect the result, but it really hurts.

82
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,660
The phone you're calling is powered off. You'll be connected to the voice mail...

83
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,720
Darn it.

84
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,540
Are you avoiding me?

85
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,350
Why would I avoid you?

86
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,760
Why did you switch off your phone?

87
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,180
I need to think about a lot of things, so...

88
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,740
Are you avoiding me... because we kissed?

89
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,880
Are you crazy? It was no big deal.

90
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,340
I heard you left early. What did you do during this period?

91
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,060
Why should I tell you?

92
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,640
Why can't you tell me?

93
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,700
What should I do before you tell me what you did?

94
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,280
What should I do?

95
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,340
Tell me. I'll listen to you.

96
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,200
What should I do?

97
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,510
Take my bag and follow me. Let's go home.

98
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,890
What should I do to make myself qualified to hear that?

99
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,340
Nothing. Just get along like this.

100
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,300
If we get along like this,

101
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,870
I can ask anything I want, right?

102
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,820
I can also follow you if I feel bored, right?

103
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,750
Whatever.

104
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,640
Then... can I also play with you in decades?

105
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,860
Do you plan to waste your time by doing nothing before that?

106
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,440
Darn it. That's not what I meant.

107
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,410
Just tell me if I can.

108
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,670
Of course. Why did you even ask?

109
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,360
We will be inseparable like this and won't go anywhere, right?

110
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,950
Do you have separation anxiety disorder?

111
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,290
What is that?

112
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,440
Forget it.

113
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,580
Answer me.

114
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,460
I have nowhere to go even if I want to go, okay?

115
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,710
Oh, this is great.

116
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,740
Why is it so dark here today?

117
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,170
It's creepy.

118
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,280
I'm here.

119
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,500
You're the one I fear the most.

120
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Why?

121
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,840
How could this happen?

122
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,300
Impressive.

123
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,900
You actually didn't get a single guess right.

124
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:00,560
Usually, even with random guessing, we can answer at least one question correctly.

125
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,960
Darn it. I don't want to do it anymore.

126
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,210
Well, which university do you plan to attend?

127
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,120
Me?

128
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,350
A medical university.

129
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,980
Oh, you want to be a doctor, right?

130
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,460
Do you plan to attend a university in Seoul?

131
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,060
No, I like this place.

132
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,350
So I submitted my application to a university nearby.

133
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,410
Really?

134
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,420
Of course.

135
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,890
Looks like I should study hard too.

136
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,810
I can't understand this.

137
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,650
Be careful.

138
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,640
Can you teach me one more time?

139
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,130
Go Hotae.

140
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,260
Try it one more time.

141
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,480
Just one more time, okay?

142
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,000
Enough!

143
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:45,970
[Go Hotae: I'm really sorry. I've truly reflected on myself. Maybe I'm really crazy.]

[Seohun University]

145
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,740
Didn't you say you submitted your application to a medical university?

146
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,510
I don't think I can become a doctor.

147
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,590
Why?

148
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,410
I'm not qualified.

149
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,350
What qualification do you need to attend a medical university?

150
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,410
I've decided to attend a university in Seoul.

151
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,420
Only in this way can everyone be happy.

152
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,350
Won't you regret it?

153
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,660
I think I'll... regret it very much.
