00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,430
Hotae,

2
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,450
like you did in Seoul, do you need to get a trainer,

3
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,400
to help you with your workouts?

4
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,230
Mom, you gave me such great genes.

5
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,600
I don't need to waste money on that.

6
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,280
You're such a sweet talker.

7
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,500
Keep practicing!

8
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,890
Where are you off to?

9
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,410
School?

10
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,510
Just going for a walk

11
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,780
and getting some fresh air.

12
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,240
I will finish the side dishes before I head to the store.

13
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,590
Make sure you come back for dinner tonight.

14
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,250
Your side dishes are the best.

15
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,390
I make these dishes just to hear you say that.

16
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,660
Alright, I'm off.

17
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,970
Bye.

18
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,900
Crazy bastard.

19
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,360
Did you stalk me?

20
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,660
What are you talking about?

21
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,780
Wow, what is this place?

22
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,810
Just because you're the student council president,

23
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,410
you can book an entire classroom for yourself?

24
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,360
It's empty anyway.

25
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,190
It's good.

26
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,000
Very quiet.

27
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,010
Why can't you just behave?

28
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,760
Who said I was going to read it?

29
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,680
Even if you begged me, I wouldn't.

30
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,000
Either sit quietly or leave.

31
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,730
I need to study.

32
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,290
[变形记]

33
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,950
One morning,

34
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,850
I woke up to find myself transformed into a giant insect,

35
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,970
lying in bed...

36
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,970
What is this?

37
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,260
A story about a guy turning into a bug?

38
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,970
If I turned into a bug one day,

39
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,370
would I still be Kim Donghee

40
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,590
or just a bug?

41
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,589
Ah.

42
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:21,060
You're giving me that distant feeling again.

43
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,260
What are you even talking about?

44
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,930
You're like this because you keep reading all that philosophical nonsense.

45
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,400
Of course, you'd still be Kim Donghee. Who else would you be?

46
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,180
Whether you turn into a bug or a pile of grass,

47
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,510
I'd still know it's you.

48
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,550
What else could I think?

49
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,680
What on earth are you rambling about?

50
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,590
What?

51
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,100
You just left without waking me?

52
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,070
Ah! This feels amazing!

53
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,870
You should try it!

54
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,980
Ah!

55
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,430
Ah.

56
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,220
Doesn't it feel awesome?

57
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,930
Hey.

58
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,600
Don't you have any sportsmanship?

59
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,840
No.

60
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,240
What's the problem?

61
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,260
Dang it.

62
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,720
You're having too much fun, huh?

63
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,100
When we were kids,

64
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,520
I got scolded so many times because of playing in the rain with you.

65
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,350
You're the one who dragged me around everywhere,

66
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,610
and yet I was the only one who got scolded.

67
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,350
Hey.

68
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,030
Why don't you call me brother anymore?

69
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,480
My my.

70
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,270
Goodness.

71
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,830
Snap out of it.

72
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,100
You loser!

73
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,210
Deny it!

74
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,390
Tell me you're not sick!

75
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,720
Come on,

76
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,730
deny it!

77
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,600
Are you cold or scared?

78
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,590
Just sleep already.

79
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,220
If you want to sleep next to me, no way!

80
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,380
Do you have a screw loose?

81
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,600
I don't want to sleep next to you either.

82
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:53,160
I just… when it rains, it makes my insomnia worse.

83
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,520
You have that problem?

84
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,210
Well, it's senior year, after all.

85
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,630
Darn it.

86
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,410
This is driving me crazy.

87
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,290
Hey, scoot over.

88
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,500
It's so hot.

89
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,110
You're already being generous, why not let me lean on you a bit?

90
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,650
Fine, whatever.

91
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,960
We're both guys, after all.

92
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,160
When did

93
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,970
your insomnia start?

94
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,350
You weren't like this before.

95
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,350
Things change.

96
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,710
I guess I just changed too.

97
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,010
You're reading too many books.

98
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,940
Dang it, I'm seriously losing it.

99
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,380
Eat up.

100
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,920
It's hot.

101
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,770
Feels cool to me. Why are you always saying it's hot?

102
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,030
Why don't you have a girlfriend?

103
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,900
Why are you asking?

104
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:24,760
I'm just...

105
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,020
curious.

106
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,700
You've got a lot of curiosity.

107
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,530
What about you?

108
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,000
I just want to focus on sports.

109
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,270
That's great.

110
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,560
You think it's great

111
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,700
I don't have a girlfriend?

112
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,150
Yeah, I feel like it'd just be a hassle.

113
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,090
Why would it be a hassle?

114
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,920
If you two fought, you'd come whining to me.

115
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,200
You think I'm a kid?

116
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,570
You are a kid.

117
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,210
Hey!

118
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,680
Darn it.

119
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,550
This tastes awful.

120
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,760
You think it's great

121
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,240
I don't have a girlfriend?

122
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,800
Yeah, it'd just be a hassle.

123
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,080
Go Hotae.

124
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,040
Hello.

125
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,980
I saw you go into the swimming pool earlier,

126
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,940
so I waited for you to come out.

127
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,260
Why wait for me?

128
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,780
I like you.

129
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,690
Do you want to go out with me?

130
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,730
Sure.

131
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,220
Oh no.

132
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:27,650
Go Hotae.

133
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,600
How's swimming going?

134
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
See you next time.

135
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,860
Hey.

136
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,320
Go home by yourself today.

137
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,690
It's heavy.

138
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,910
Take your arm away.

139
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,270
No.

140
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,170
Hey, Go Hotae!

141
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,010
You said you were going to focus on sports.

142
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,000
Ignore her.

143
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,790
Hey, let's grab something to eat before we go back.

144
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,180
[Don't forget to buy eggs on your way back. We're out of eggs]

145
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,380
Don't forget to buy eggs on your way back.

146
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,380
We're out of eggs.

147
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,460
I've got to go.

148
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,390
There's an emergency at home.

149
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,200
Eggs.

150
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,590
You said we were out, didn't you?

151
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,130
What happened to your face?

152
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,790
Hey, you jerk!

153
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,340
Nothing.

154
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,710
Did you get into a fight?

155
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,210
No.

156
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,890
No, I just got punched.

157
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,560
Broke up with my girlfriend.

158
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,510
Why?

159
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,869
To buy eggs.

160
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,170
What are you talking about?

161
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,339
Hey, Kim Donghee.

162
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,450
Going home so early?

163
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,310
Yeah, I'm heading back to study.

164
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,520
What about swim practice?

165
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,349
The training ended early today.

166
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,330
I'll head out.

167
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,390
So… you don't have a girlfriend now?

168
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,320
No, why?

169
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,410
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

170
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,530
Sure.

171
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,400
Really?

172
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,410
Thank you.

173
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:11,290
[Epilogue]

174
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,520
What?

175
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,450
You just walked off without telling me?
