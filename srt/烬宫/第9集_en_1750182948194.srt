Episode 16

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,600
The one who saw the Nuo is Bai Bingxiao.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,840
Nuo Wuqi.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,240
Hong Yunsheng.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,160
Greetings, Your Majesty.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,760
My sisters.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,400
Impossible.

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,680
Lv Yan's bitch is dead.

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,600
She's in front of the King.

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,400
No!

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,720
She must be the one who killed herself.

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,720
You're not the Grand Priestess.

13
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,320
I'm the Saintess of Qiong Nu.

14
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,080
I'm here to marry you.

15
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,760
I heard that

16
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,560
you're here to pray for the late queen

17
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,880
with all the concubines in the harem.

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,720
So I came here

19
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,600
to pray for the late queen with Nuo Wuqi.

20
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,520
We've been praying for Nuo Wuqi since ancient times.

21
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,960
It will make the late queen feel at ease.

22
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,200
May you be blessed with good health.

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:46,960
How ridiculous!

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,640
How dare a Saintess

25
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,040
who came to marry me to you?

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,240
Your Majesty.

27
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,600
This witch

28
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,240
will kill me.

29
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,760
I don't know where she came from.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,080
What if she's hurt?

31
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

32
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,520
Nuo Wu is a witch.

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
She can't stay in the palace

34
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,600
if she's not cured.

35
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,320
Qiong Nuo Fang sent this witch here.

36
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,520
Who knows what she's hiding?

37
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,120
Who's the witch of Qiong Nuo?

38
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,080
She's not a witch.

39
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,680
You're a bitch.

40
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,440
Guards.

41
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,880
Take this witch and two people to the Cold Palace.

42
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,480
Wait.
