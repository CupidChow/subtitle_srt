1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Yu... Yu Yin!

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,840
I've learned martial arts.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,400
You brought me into the Qi Palace

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,400
and even told His Majesty to take me as his concubine.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,560
I swear that

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,600
if I betray you one day,

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,240
I'll be burned to death by the fire.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,640
The Rong family's Yin Qing Master is gone.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,080
The whole clan has been destroyed.

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,680
You've worked so hard

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,600
to restore the spiritual cloud embroidery.

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm so grateful.

13
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,960
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm willing to follow you in this life.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,840
If you betray me,

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,680
I'll take all the responsibility.

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,320
Don't worry.

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,880
I, Lv Yin,

19
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,480
am not a good person.

20
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,400
As long as you're willing to

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,160
serve His Majesty well.

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,800
If I do anything

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,040
that will hurt you in the future,

24
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,720
I'm willing to confess to myself

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,040
and never come out again.

26
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,360
Yang Yu,

27
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,560
Xiang Jin, Rong Jin, and Yu Wan Qi.

28
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,080
Lv Yin has escaped from the Yin Cang Pavilion

29
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,960
and let us fulfill our vows.
