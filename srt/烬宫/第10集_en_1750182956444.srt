1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
and put me in the cold air.

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,280
Wait.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,120
Raise your head.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,840
Your Majesty.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,160
It smells good.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,800
It really does.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,600
Your Majesty.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,560
Your Majesty.

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,040
Are you all right?

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:24,680
Your Majesty.

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,640
You came here

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,160
and His Majesty's Feng Han Jun became fierce.

13
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:27,680
Tell me.

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,000
What kind of monster are you?

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,080
I dare not.

16
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,160
People have their own difficulties,

17
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,160
and so do the demons.

18
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,240
The demons will rise and disappear.

19
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,160
The demons can call the winds and rain

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,320
for the people of the world.

21
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,160
They will sneak into hell for the people

22
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,440
and pray for the heaven.

23
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,320
How can they harm His Majesty's body?

24
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,000
How dare you talk nonsense!

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:46,960
Your Majesty.

26
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,560
Your Majesty.

27
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,160
Your Majesty.
