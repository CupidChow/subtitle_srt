1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yu Huiji has done a great service to Qin.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Jinwei is the beauty.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
She is the master of the palace.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yang Yun, Xiao Jing'er.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I finally returned to the Great Qin Palace.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The bloodbath three years ago should be long.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
King of the Fog, please take me and my sister.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If I don't stop, I will die.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yun.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When Zhou Chengcheng was broken,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
your mother sold her daughter to beg for her honor and left.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You are the only child of the king.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You should know the difference.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
King, I am your wife.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Qiao'er is your daughter.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
My family has 130 servants.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
They are still fighting for the slave.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
How can you have such a vicious idea?

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The wife of the King of the Fog is gone.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Gone.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Sister, just accept the fate.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If you don't keep the wife of the King of the Fog,

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
how can you delay the King of the Fog?

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What's the big deal?

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We are all concubines.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You are the only one who is the queen.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's your honor to sacrifice yourself for the King.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And you just realized now.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Isn't it too late?

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yang Yun.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You treat me like this.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Aren't you afraid of the people of the world?

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The throne is cold and cold.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Of course I have to sacrifice what others can't.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
As long as I can rebuild the country,

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm not afraid of the people of the world.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Come on.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Release the fire.
