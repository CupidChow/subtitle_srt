1
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,330
Execute him.

2
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:42,880
Speak.

3
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,400
Who sent you?

4
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,960
Huan'er thanks Master for years of guidance.

5
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,640
I will never forget your instructions

6
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,100
and will

7
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,200
get along well with my mother.

8
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,520
I doubt that.

9
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,280
Your stepmother is cruel,

10
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,040
sending you to the mountain at such a young age.

11
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,160
She hasn't cared about you for 17 years,

12
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,920
she may not treat you well when you return.

13
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,200
Those who don't honor their parents

14
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,280
are worse than grass and trees.

15
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,200
Besides, a year later she became a mother herself,

16
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,079
so perhaps her heart has opened up.

17
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,680
Go back and be filial to her,

18
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,800
she might find you a good marriage,

19
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,840
a good husband,

20
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,760
and your life will be complete.

21
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,200
Master.

22
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,920
You should go now,

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,640
today is your father's birthday,

24
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,640
don't be too late.

25
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,680
Father,

26
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,120
I've returned.

27
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,240
Miss, who are you?

28
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,920
Do you have an invitation?

29
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,720
I am Yan Jiehuan, the eldest daughter of your Chief Secretary,

30
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,680
I've come home.

31
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,600
Mother, something terrible has happened,

32
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,280
she's back.

33
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,560
Who?

34
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,650
Mother, Huan'er has returned.

35
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,800
She's not dead.

36
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,120
Where is Father?

37
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,650
You claim to be Yan Jiehuan,

38
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,660
and I'm supposed to believe that?

39
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,920
This is a letter from my master to you.

40
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,200
She says you sent me to the mountain

41
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,680
and promised I could return home at eighteen.

42
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,640
This jade pendant is the only thing my birth mother left me.

43
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,960
If you want the pendant back,

44
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,690
you must agree to my condition.

45
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,040
Today is your father's birthday banquet.

46
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,280
If you suddenly appear,

47
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,920
it will certainly cause a lot of gossip.

48
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,650
Help out in the kitchen for now.

49
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,020
I want to see my father.

50
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,280
Don't worry, you'll see him at the banquet.

51
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,080
But I must remind you to behave yourself.

52
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,640
Young Master Li, Mrs. Li.

53
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,500
Secretary Yan.

54
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,180
Secretary Yan.

55
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,000
May this day come every year,

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,800
and may we celebrate for years to come.

57
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,360
Good.

58
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,899
Thank you for coming, Master Zhang. Please have a seat.

59
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,760
Something's happened.

60
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,400
What is it?

61
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,440
The eldest daughter who didn't die has returned.

62
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,520
Right now is a crucial moment for Xi'er's marriage arranged by the Crown Prince,

63
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,840
and she suddenly returns.

64
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,560
Will Xi'er's engagement be called off?

65
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,520
It was decreed by the Emperor himself.

66
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,720
But the Yan family's eldest legitimate daughter...

67
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,280
How could I let her ruin our plans?

68
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:39,880
Minister Yan.

69
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,040
Thank you for coming in person to celebrate,

70
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,170
please, have a seat.

71
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,000
Minister Yan.

72
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,480
Happy birthday to you.

73
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,659
Lord Minister Huo.

74
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,159
I came in a hurry,

75
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,480
without bringing a birthday gift.

76
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,720
Please don't take offense.

77
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,400
Lord Huo forgets many things.

78
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,920
Since we're cousins,

79
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,060
there's no need for formalities.

80
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,640
Since you know we're relatives,

81
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,440
do you realize some actions warrant execution of nine generations?

82
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,240
Why do you keep harassing me?

83
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,000
Family is family, but principles are principles.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
As officials,

85
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,360
loyalty is what matters most.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,960
Minister Yan.

87
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,200
You truly are loyal to the throne.

88
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,800
My lord, you should toast your cousin.

89
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,080
If it weren't for him,

90
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,120
our Xi'er would never have the chance to enter the palace.

91
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,520
Our Yan family never seeks connections with the powerful.

92
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,400
Regarding Xi'er entering the palace,

93
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,060
I absolutely refuse to agree.

94
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,240
She's the supposedly dead eldest legitimate daughter, Yan Jiehuan.

95
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,600
Cousin, I don't care.

96
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,440
You must get Xi'er into the palace,

97
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,240
as the eldest legitimate daughter,

98
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,840
and not let anyone look down on her.

99
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,370
Now it's not just about her.

100
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,580
Anyone with the Yan surname must be eliminated too.

101
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,240
You want to kill him?

102
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,560
You've gone soft.

103
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,560
If father and daughter recognize each other,

104
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,520
Xi'er's position will be compromised.

105
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,920
The Yan family's fortune

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,930
won't fall into your hands either.

107
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,420
Your Highness,

108
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,400
we returned to the capital secretly this time,

109
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,100
yet they found out so quickly.

110
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,480
Could there have been a leak somewhere?

111
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,800
These opportunists,

112
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,220
all flocking to power,

113
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,440
no matter how they try to stop me,

114
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,930
I must go back and get to the bottom of this.

115
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,240
But I've heard the palace is preparing for the coronation ceremony.

116
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,570
My father has just passed away,

117
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,640
are they really this impatient?

118
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,320
Father.

119
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,120
I've made you a longevity soup

120
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,120
that will bring you good health and a long life.

121
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,340
Secretary Yan.

122
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,440
Happy birthday. Here.

123
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,400
I wish you,

124
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,120
a long life and good health, Secretary.

125
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,520
Who is this woman?

126
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,000
She looks somewhat familiar.

127
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,400
Father, I'm Huan'er,

128
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,360
your daughter has returned.

129
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,120
Master, she's a new maid in the household,

130
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,600
skilled at making soup.

131
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,460
She just made this. Please try it.

132
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,000
Father, what's wrong with you?

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,880
Master!

134
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,040
Master!

135
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Let me examine him, I know medicine.

136
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,120
Get away!

137
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,040
How dare you

138
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,300
poison the master!

139
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,480
I have medical knowledge.

140
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,540
Let me examine him.

141
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,760
You dared to poison my father!

142
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,360
Are you alright?

143
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,840
I didn't. Let me examine him.

144
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,520
Master!

145
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,200
Master!

146
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,560
She killed the master!

147
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,240
I didn't!

148
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,000
Daring to murder an imperial official,

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,760
guards, take her to the magistrate!

150
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
No, I didn't!

151
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,679
I didn't!

152
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,760
Father!

153
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,480
Father!

154
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,640
Father!

155
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,159
Father!

156
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,360
All these people have the same symptoms.

157
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,820
What disease do they have?

158
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,400
The pharmacy is just ahead,

159
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,720
I'll take you there first.

160
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,250
Alright.

161
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,640
Prisoner parade!

162
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,040
Clear the way!

163
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,680
Execution at noon tomorrow,

164
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,080
hereby announced!

165
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,320
Prisoner parade!

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,680
Clear the way!

167
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,320
Execution at noon tomorrow,

168
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,720
hereby announced!

169
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,800
It's her!
