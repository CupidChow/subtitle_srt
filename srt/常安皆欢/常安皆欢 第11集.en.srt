1
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,520
Yu.

2
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,560
Your Majesty.

3
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,760
This herb is called Five Elements Grass.

4
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,360
When women take it, it promotes blood flow

5
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,319
and is commonly used for abortions.

6
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,360
Your Majesty, that's impossible!

7
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,220
I didn't add Five Elements Grass!

8
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,760
You are a royal physician.

9
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,840
You should know

10
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,770
which medicines are appropriate.

11
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,080
Your Majesty,

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,760
she did it deliberately.

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,960
It's precisely because Physician Yan

14
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,880
knows medicine so well

15
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,280
that she wouldn't poison anyone.

16
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,760
Otherwise,

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,840
wouldn't she be setting a trap for herself?

18
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,640
Enough!

19
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,960
She prepared this medicine.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,160
If something goes wrong, she must be held responsible.

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,720
Guards, take her away!

22
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,720
Investigate this thoroughly.

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,640
No, Your Majesty, I didn't do it!

24
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,760
I still have official matters to attend to,

25
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,620
you should retire early, my dear.

26
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,640
Hmph.

27
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,010
Your Highness, what has Xiaoqing done wrong?

28
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,400
Every time the Emperor thinks of you,

29
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,530
I will beat you once.

30
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,720
If you ever think of the Emperor,

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,200
I will take your life.

32
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,960
Yes.

33
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,880
Like mother, like daughter indeed,

34
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,600
Yan Xi'er is even more ruthless than Lady Wang.

35
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,800
I just don't know

36
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,360
whether I should tell the young mistress about this.

37
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,280
Have you heard?

38
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,600
Doctor Yan has been thrown into prison.

39
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,120
Anyone who plots against the Emperor's offspring deserves imprisonment.

40
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,480
The Five Elements Herb

41
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,680
is a forbidden substance in the palace.

42
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
How much comes in and goes out

43
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,460
only your Imperial Medical Institute would know exactly.

44
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,480
I've found something, Your Highness. Look.

45
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,440
According to the records,

46
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,360
this herb hasn't been registered entering the palace recently,

47
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,560
nor has any been used.

48
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,240
So what you're saying is,

49
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,770
the Five Elements Herb in the Empress's medicine

50
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,920
was smuggled in from outside the palace.

51
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,640
There were five qian of Five Elements Herb in the Empress's medicine.

52
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,769
Such a large amount,

53
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,040
let alone a fetus,

54
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
even an adult

55
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,600
with a weak constitution

56
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,880
would likely not survive for long.

57
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,250
Who dares to be so reckless?

58
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,980
Your Highness.

59
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,080
Xiaoqing, you may leave now.

60
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:46,960
Yes.

61
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,680
Isn't that the young lady's senior sister?

62
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,600
Why is she with Consort Yan?

63
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,680
Don't come to me without reason,

64
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,920
what if someone sees you?

65
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,480
The poison you told me to give the Empress,

66
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,320
I administered it.

67
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,440
But now they've arrested my junior sister,

68
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,200
what should we do?

69
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,280
Chunyu Yan, you really are stupid.

70
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,840
I ordered you to poison only the Empress,

71
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,090
did you think I was only targeting her?

72
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,440
So your real target was my junior sister all along.

73
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,240
Yan Jiehuan and I have always been mortal enemies.

74
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,200
She stole my title as the eldest legitimate daughter,

75
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,160
and has been working against me since entering the palace.

76
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,420
Why would I keep someone like her around?

77
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,120
Besides, when you poisoned the Empress,

78
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,580
didn't you realize she was the Empress's personal physician?

79
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,680
So it was me,

80
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,360
I'm the one who harmed my junior sister.

81
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,680
Enough. I've already sent word to my mother

82
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,680
to speak well of you to my uncle.

83
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,400
Soon you'll marry gloriously into the Huo family,

84
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,730
isn't that what you've always dreamed of?

85
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,560
How's the investigation on the Five Elements Herb going?

86
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,440
All the pharmacy owners claim they know nothing,

87
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,600
but I recently discovered

88
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,640
that Peach Blossom Pavilion is auctioning herbs at high prices.

89
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,440
Perhaps...

90
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,880
No need to pursue it further.

91
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,880
Worry less to win your beloved.

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,130
What does that mean?

93
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,880
I've been investigating the military camp embezzlement case,

94
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,880
and those behind it are likely getting restless.

95
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,890
They're trying to use Doctor Yan to threaten you,

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,120
but they don't know

97
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,480
that you've stayed away from women for many years.

98
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,850
Greetings, Your Highness.

99
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,440
Aren't you the palace maid from Yan Xier's household?

100
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,200
I was originally a maid in the Yan household,

101
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,800
who came to the palace as part of a dowry.

102
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,840
Yan Jiehuan is the eldest daughter of the family,

103
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,120
and it's the second daughter who harmed her.

104
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,480
You mean it was Yan Xier?

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,840
The eldest daughter was abandoned by the family since childhood.

106
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,560
Lady Wang is a vicious stepmother,

107
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,080
and the second daughter is even more ruthless than her mother.

108
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,010
They see the eldest daughter as a thorn in their side.

109
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,880
Please, Your Highness, help the eldest daughter.

110
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,040
Your Majesty,

111
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,560
I've been investigating the military camp case,

112
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,440
when the accounting officer committed suicide on the spot,

113
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,320
and then I received this letter.

114
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,640
Are you suggesting someone is deliberately framing Physician Yan?

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,880
The Imperial Physician and I have discovered

116
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,000
that the Five Elements Herb is not from the palace.

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,360
The Empress has just become pregnant,

118
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,040
and poison has already been smuggled into the palace,

119
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,920
showing how desperate they are.

120
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,560
They not only want to eliminate the unborn child,

121
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,400
but also use the Empress to get rid of Physician Yan,

122
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,400
and thereby pressure Your Majesty and me to abandon the military camp investigation.

123
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,930
So what are you suggesting?

124
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,560
I stake my life on this:

125
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,320
Physician Yan has absolutely nothing to do with this matter.

126
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,040
I beg Your Majesty to release Physician Yan

127
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,680
and give me three days.

128
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,720
If I cannot find the true culprit,

129
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,380
I will accept any punishment.

130
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,040
Tell me,

131
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,440
why did you poison the Empress?

132
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,720
I didn't do it.

133
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,800
No matter how many times you ask,

134
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,800
I will never confess to it.

135
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,000
Hmph,

136
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,559
stubborn as a mule.

137
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,250
I've been

138
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,679
interrogating you for hours.

139
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:37,960
If you still won't talk,

140
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,520
Stop!

141
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:38,799
I...

142
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,640
Torture and forced confession

143
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,170
who gave you such audacity?

144
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,160
His Majesty has ordered the release of Physician Yan

145
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,960
now get out!

146
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,560
Uh, yes.

147
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,600
Miss Yan.

148
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,640
Miss Yan.

149
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,810
Please put me down, Your Highness.

150
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,880
You're injured.

151
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,840
I'm deeply grateful to Your Highness for saving my life

152
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,560
but I'm now a criminal

153
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,200
and I fear involving others.

154
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,720
Please keep your distance

155
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,440
to avoid being implicated.

156
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,000
You think I'm afraid of such things?

157
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,560
But I am afraid.

158
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,800
While imprisoned

159
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,200
I thought a lot about things

160
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,480
the Empress is clearly a kind and proper person

161
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,000
yet why does she harbor such resentment toward me?

162
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,660
It's all because of your entanglement with her.

163
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,920
My affairs with her

164
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,800
are in the past.

165
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,360
According to what you're saying

166
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,840
I've brought trouble upon you

167
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,280
which means I should take responsibility for you.

168
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,400
But I don't want that.
