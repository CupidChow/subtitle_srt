1
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:56,320
Order in court!

2
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,280
Regarding the murder of Historian Yan,

3
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,840
you who kneel before this court,

4
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,970
do you plead guilty?

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,800
Your Honor,

6
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,280
this woman came to our household

7
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,240
falsely claiming to be our young lady,

8
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,160
and after the master refused to acknowledge her,

9
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,289
she developed murderous intentions.

10
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,920
How is my father now?

11
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,080
Has he been given a proper burial?

12
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,920
Your Honor,

13
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,560
don't be fooled by her pitiful appearance.

14
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,970
This woman is deeply calculating,

15
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,240
and merely because the master refused to acknowledge her,

16
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,970
she harbored evil intentions.

17
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,000
So young,

18
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,360
yet why so vicious?

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,240
Even tigers don't eat their cubs,

20
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,400
and the most wicked human wouldn't harm their family.

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,160
As a child,

22
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,570
how could I possibly poison my own father?

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,200
You repeatedly claim to be the eldest daughter of the Yan household,

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,400
do you have any proof?

25
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,120
On my birth mother's jade pendant

26
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,250
my name is engraved.

27
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,700
Where is this pendant?

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,720
She has it.

29
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,680
Over 30 people in the household can testify to this.

30
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,920
No one knows

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,000
that she's a fraud.

32
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,320
Minister.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,200
Minister,

34
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,400
what brings you here?

35
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,440
Serious criminal on parade,

36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,680
civilians clear the way,

37
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,320
execution at noon tomorrow,

38
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,720
hereby announced.

39
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,040
Serious criminal on parade,

40
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,280
civilians clear the way,

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,600
execution at noon tomorrow,

42
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,160
hereby announced.

43
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,880
Serious criminal on parade.

44
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,160
Civilians clear the way,

45
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,000
execution at noon tomorrow,

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,400
hereby announced.

47
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,560
Help me!

48
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,360
Run!

49
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,720
Run, will you!

50
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,680
Miss,

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,800
save me!

52
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,280
Help!

53
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,560
Miss,

54
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,890
are you alright?

55
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,800
If Hu Yu sees this treasure,

56
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,330
she'll definitely love it.

57
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,600
Perhaps my relationship with Hu Yu...

58
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,000
Serious criminal on parade.

59
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,480
Make way!

60
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,640
Execution at noon tomorrow.

61
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,480
Prisoner parade.

62
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,600
Clear the way!

63
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,120
Sister,

64
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,960
wasn't she supposed to return home as a lady?

65
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,840
How did she become a condemned prisoner?

66
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,200
Stand aside!

67
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,560
Execution at noon tomorrow.

68
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,040
Get out!

69
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,800
Let me give you some advice -

70
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,730
stop wasting your money, will you?

71
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,600
Look.

72
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,079
The whole city is coughing blood,

73
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,560
countless people are dying,

74
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,160
and no medicine works.

75
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,000
Are we just waiting to die?

76
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,480
I won't lie to you,

77
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,680
three people in my family have already died,

78
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,880
and I've already prepared my own coffin.

79
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,040
Just go home.

80
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,080
That's better.

81
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,060
No one will bother us anymore.

82
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,640
How can a sparrow understand the ambitions of a swan?

83
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,500
Yan's death is of no consequence.

84
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,490
I've kept him alive all these years

85
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,120
only for you and Xi'er.

86
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,480
Now

87
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,320
we just wait for Xi'er to enter the palace as the Crown Prince's consort.

88
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,040
Later

89
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,240
she'll become the Emperor's consort.

90
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,880
Liu Le

91
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,360
is nothing but my puppet.

92
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,800
He has entrusted me

93
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,159
with arranging his coronation ceremony

94
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,920
just to make everyone in court

95
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,000
and throughout the empire

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,040
understand one thing.

97
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,000
I am now second only to one person

98
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,760
and above everyone else.

99
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,010
Cousin, you're truly formidable.

100
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,480
But anyway,

101
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,680
this Yan Jiehuan,

102
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,320
can't we make her die sooner?

103
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,930
17 years in the mountains didn't kill her,

104
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,159
and I can't wait any longer.

105
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,760
A mere country girl,

106
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,300
not worth mentioning.

107
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,520
I've already spoken with Governor He,

108
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,250
tomorrow at noon she will certainly be sentenced

109
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,120
and executed.

110
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,740
Stop! Hold your blade!

111
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,800
This is unjust!

112
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,460
Your Honor,

113
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,540
Your Honor,

114
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,600
this is a grave injustice!

115
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,440
Who dares

116
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,400
to cause such a commotion in my court?

117
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,120
Master!

118
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,650
Huan'er!

119
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,000
The Wang family is heartless,

120
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,560
but I won't abandon you.

121
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,500
Your Honor,

122
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,560
may I ask what crime my Huan'er has committed,

123
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,120
and what evidence do you have?

124
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,280
The witness is sitting right here,

125
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,080
Minister Huo.

126
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,760
He witnessed with his own eyes

127
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,960
Yan Jiehuan poisoning Secretary Yan.

128
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,080
Indeed,

129
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,600
I witnessed with my own eyes

130
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,480
that this woman administered the poison.

131
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,520
We three, master and disciples, are all healers.

132
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,680
If we wanted to poison someone,

133
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,340
we wouldn't need to expose ourselves in public,

134
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,320
let alone

135
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,520
kill the relative she's been longing to see for 17 years.

136
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,360
You, as someone outside worldly affairs,

137
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,520
might understand matters of the heart,

138
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,800
but how could you know

139
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,400
the treachery of human nature?

140
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
This woman has spent over ten years

141
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,720
without seeing her biological father,

142
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,400
surely her love turned to hatred,

143
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,560
and hatred bred evil thoughts.

144
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,160
That's why she poisoned

145
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,040
and plotted against her own father,

146
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,640
a truly heinous crime.

147
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,740
Magistrate He,

148
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,920
it's getting late.

149
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,560
It's noon now

150
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,520
proceed with the execution.

151
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,680
Junior Sister!

152
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,320
What's going on?

153
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,560
She must be innocent!

154
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,840
She must be wrongfully accused!

155
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,440
Another one has fallen down,

156
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,000
what is happening?

157
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,480
It seems she truly is innocent,

158
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,960
even Heaven is helping her.

159
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,760
Indeed.

160
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,280
See?

161
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,280
I told you Junior Sister was falsely accused,

162
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,740
even Heaven is on her side.

163
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,760
When Heaven shows unusual signs,

164
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,159
there must be injustice.

165
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,840
Please, Your Honor, reconsider this case.

166
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,360
You think we'll reopen the case just because you say so?

167
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,240
You treat the imperial court

168
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,440
and all its officials

169
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,740
as if they were your meditation retreat.

170
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,000
This is certainly not a wrongful conviction.

171
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,680
Governor He,

172
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,540
ignore their senseless chatter,

173
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,080
carry out the execution.

174
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,320
Sir.

175
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,440
I've studied medicine since childhood,

176
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,440
may I try to help?

177
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,280
Quickly, untie her.

178
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,810
Yes, sir.

179
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:31,960
Sir.

180
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,880
These symptoms are indeed those of the plague.

181
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,200
The reddish-purple face

182
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,530
is caused by high fever.

183
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,240
The weakness and fainting after vomiting

184
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,640
indicates brain damage.

185
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,000
Without immediate treatment,

186
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,860
death will occur within two days.

187
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,960
I feel dizzy.

188
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,520
Huan'er,

189
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,920
my master's master

190
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,800
once encountered similar symptoms.

191
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,040
If I'm not mistaken,

192
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,480
this is the plague.

193
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,140
The plague.

194
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,800
Though the plague is terrifying,

195
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
my two disciples and I are willing to help,

196
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
asking only that you restore my young disciple's reputation.

197
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,280
No,

198
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,840
she is a serious criminal of the imperial court.

199
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,560
Then I dare

200
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,160
to ask Your Excellency to make a wager with me.

201
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,080
If we find a cure for the plague,

202
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,500
please give me time

203
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,360
to find my father's murderer

204
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,480
and clear my name.

205
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,640
If it truly is the plague,

206
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,600
it won't be as easy as you claim.

207
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,400
If you fail to find a cure,

208
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,539
I will surely add to your punishment.

209
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,000
Very well,

210
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,440
for the sake of our people,

211
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,200
I

212
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,650
will accept your wager.

213
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,159
But remember this clearly:

214
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,220
within three days,

215
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,280
if you cannot solve this plague,

216
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,840
you will face multiple charges

217
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,040
and no leniency will be shown.

218
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,570
Alright.

219
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Let this bet be our oath,

220
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,040
with no turning back.

221
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,720
The plague is not incurable.

222
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,880
The Lunheng records

223
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,600
that humans must not eat anything touched by rats.

224
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,080
The Huainanzi also states

225
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,040
that dead rats thrown into water

226
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,400
will cause endless disease.

227
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,300
Therefore,

228
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,760
what we need to address now is

229
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,960
preventing the spread of these things.

230
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,720
Master.

231
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
The herbal remedy

232
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,860
is indeed a good solution.

233
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,760
However, rhinoceros horn and antelope horn

234
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,920
are rare items

235
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,800
that ordinary families cannot afford.

236
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,120
We can use forsythia and bupleurum instead.

237
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,960
Add kudzu root, angelica, and licorice to boil in water,

238
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,160
and it will be effective.

239
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,690
How many qian should we use?

240
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,200
If the dosage is incorrect,

241
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,280
it could be fatal.

242
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,200
I'll test the medicine.
