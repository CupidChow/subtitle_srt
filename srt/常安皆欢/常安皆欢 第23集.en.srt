1
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,200
Leaving for battle just like that,

2
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
it's too sudden.

3
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,200
I didn't even have time to prepare anything.

4
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,080
I've prepared some hemostatic medicine,

5
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,680
anti-inflammatory drugs and various others.

6
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,500
I'm not afraid of going to battle,

7
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,880
or even dying.

8
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,400
I'm just worried about you being alone in the palace,

9
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,000
and how you'll deal with Huo Fang and his people.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,840
Don't worry.

11
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,120
I will definitely secure

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,680
Yan Xier as a witness.

13
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,760
When you earn military merits at the border,

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,890
and I bring down Huo Fang in the palace,

15
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,840
we'll work together from inside and out,

16
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,700
and we'll definitely defeat him.

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,460
Wait for my return.

18
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:25,970
When I come back,

19
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,360
I'll marry you.

20
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,840
When you return safely,

21
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,580
I'll marry you.

22
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,520
Your Highness,

23
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,920
I just returned from the military camp,

24
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,920
it's full of old, weak, and sick men,

25
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,320
I suspect some people

26
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,850
did this deliberately.

27
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,539
Your Highness,

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,000
I had hoped to assemble an elite force for you,

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,640
but due to your strict military discipline,

30
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,280
many soldiers in the court are dissatisfied.

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,080
Some refuse to join your campaign,

32
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,639
while others have retired from service.

33
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,720
Even these so-called old and weak soldiers

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,360
took me tremendous effort

35
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,040
to gather for you.

36
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,800
Then I must sincerely thank you, Prime Minister.

37
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,360
You're too kind, Your Highness.

38
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,280
This old servant

39
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,079
wishes you a triumphant return.

40
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,500
This expedition is hasty,

41
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,960
prepare the Shu troops that were left behind

42
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,120
and protect Chang'an City.

43
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,120
But I'm worried about you,

44
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,980
Your Highness.

45
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,650
Follow my orders

46
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,420
and take good care of Huan'er.

47
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,240
Yes.

48
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,040
Your Highness, please wait.

49
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,740
His Majesty sent me

50
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,200
to see Your Highness off.

51
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,480
May Your Highness

52
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,770
return victorious.

53
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

54
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,340
I will make preparations now.

55
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,130
We depart immediately.

56
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,240
Prime Minister, you've

57
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,200
gone too far.

58
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,060
I've been mindful that

59
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,480
you once helped me,

60
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,240
and I've repeatedly tolerated you in court.

61
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,920
But now

62
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,560
you dare tear up military reports

63
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,680
right in front of me!

64
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,040
You!

65
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,000
Your Majesty,

66
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,380
please don't be upset.

67
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,610
This is merely a fake military report.

68
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,579
You even forge military reports!

69
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,000
I helped you secure

70
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,360
your throne,

71
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,080
so what's forging one small military report?

72
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,520
Your Majesty,

73
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,240
you shouldn't be worried about me,

74
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,860
but about Prince Jing.

75
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,720
Brother.

76
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,240
In my opinion,

77
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,400
Prince Jing already knows the truth about the late emperor's death.

78
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,200
Your Majesty,

79
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
don't you find Prince Jing's return

80
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,640
to court suspicious?

81
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,690
His influence at court is growing,

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,800
inspecting the army, removing your advisors.

83
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,960
On the surface, he seems to be helping you,

84
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
but in reality,

85
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,800
he's exploiting your weakness

86
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,400
to achieve his own goals.

87
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,440
Are you saying

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,240
what he wants

89
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,020
could be...

90
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,960
According to reliable information,

91
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,240
Prince Jing has brought

92
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,760
a large number of Shu troops

93
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,240
stationed just outside the city.

94
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,400
If Your Majesty doesn't believe me,

95
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,920
send someone to investigate.

96
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,960
Is this true?

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,860
If Prince Jing isn't eliminated,

98
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,760
your throne will be in danger.

99
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,420
Therefore,

100
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,560
I wanted to send him to the northern frontier,

101
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,960
just to test him.

102
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,280
But I didn't expect him to agree immediately.

103
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,360
On the surface,

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,480
he appears to be helping you,

105
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
loyal to the throne.

106
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,080
But in truth, he wants to seize military power

107
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,520
when his influence is strong enough.

108
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,240
Your Majesty,

109
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,570
you are in grave danger!

110
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,940
Before he departs,

111
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,760
make him drink this.

112
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,680
What is this?

113
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,840
The Empress may know as well,

114
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,680
this is divine water.

115
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,000
Once he drinks it,

116
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,820
I will forever be Emperor,

117
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,840
and you will forever be Empress.

118
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,800
You don't have to trust him,

119
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,000
but why do you want him dead?

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,480
He's your own brother.

121
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,680
Before his death, Father entrusted you to take care of him.

122
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,810
Have you forgotten?

123
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,330
I've seen through you long ago.

124
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,880
You still have

125
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,440
feelings for him.

126
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,120
You'll deliver it

127
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,820
whether you want to or not.

128
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,000
Mother.

129
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,120
Shi'er.

130
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,080
Shi'er.

131
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,880
Mother.

132
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,200
Go now.

133
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,080
Otherwise

134
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,460
you'll never see the Crown Prince again.

135
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,880
Since the day I married Your Majesty,

136
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,020
I have harbored no illusions about Prince Jing,

137
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
I only ask that Your Majesty trust me

138
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,120
and be kind to my son.

139
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,920
Summon the imperial physician.

140
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

141
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,480
Being with you

142
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,480
in these final moments

143
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,000
is the best arrangement I could hope for.

144
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,200
Tell me,

145
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,690
what exactly happened?

146
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,520
Ten years ago,

147
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,920
I made a terrible mistake.

148
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,920
This time,

149
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
I won't make the same mistake again.

150
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,840
Do you remember

151
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,080
when we first met?

152
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,690
The apricot blossoms are blooming

153
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,280
so beautifully.

154
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,840
But you left,

155
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,660
and I married another.

156
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,080
I never thought you would return.

157
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,400
But your heart now belongs to someone else.

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,860
Your Highness.

159
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,560
If there is another life,

160
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,120
would you still want to meet me?

161
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,720
Who poisoned the Empress?

162
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,440
Your Highness,

163
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,659
it was the Emperor.

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,640
I chose to drink that elixir myself.

165
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,760
I knew the consequences.

166
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,760
But

167
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,600
I was in too much agony.

168
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,480
The Emperor,

169
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,680
he wants you dead.

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,860
Your Highness.

171
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,640
If we meet again,

172
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,520
would you still care for me?

173
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,000
Could you,

174
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,160
please,

175
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,520
call me Wan'er one more time?

176
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,080
Wan'er.

177
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,120
Wan'er.

178
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,240
Your Majesty.

179
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,480
Wan'er.

180
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,720
How dare you!

181
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,680
Stop!

182
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,970
Everyone, leave us.

183
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,080
Why don't you trust me?

184
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,840
Why did you kill Wan'er?

185
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,720
Wan'er is gone.

186
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,650
It's all your fault.

187
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,000
Why did you have to come back?

188
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,570
If you hadn't returned,

189
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,080
Wan'er would still be alive.

190
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,840
It's you who

191
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,160
has selfish motives.

192
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
You even brought Shu troops back to court,

193
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,880
clearly intending to usurp the throne.

194
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,520
If I had wanted to usurp the throne,

195
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,120
I would have dragged you down

196
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,600
from the dragon throne during your coronation.

197
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,800
I thought you would be a good emperor,

198
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,280
but you truly are an incompetent ruler.

199
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,800
I also know

200
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,120
that all these years,

201
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,480
you were always the one in Wan'er's heart.

202
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,210
What about Father Emperor?

203
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,160
Don't think I don't know

204
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,490
you conspired with Huo Fang to poison Father Emperor with that elixir.

205
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,280
Is this my fault?

206
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,720
He was the one who wrote the imperial edict

207
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,240
to leave the empire to you.

208
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,540
If I hadn't discovered it in time,

209
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,370
it would have been too late,

210
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,300
and the empire would be yours now.

211
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,440
I've told you before,

212
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,160
I have no interest in the throne.

213
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,160
I only hope that the Great Jing can continue to prosper.

214
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,040
Why don't you believe me?

215
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,200
A ruler

216
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,320
is always alone.

217
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,560
On the throne,

218
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,280
who can trust anyone else?

219
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,280
Fine.

220
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,640
First you betrayed your filial duty

221
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,920
and harmed our father,

222
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,600
then you ignored our brotherhood

223
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,260
and threatened me with death.

224
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,610
I will avenge our father

225
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,240
and Wan'er.
