1
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,040
Those who don't honor their parents

2
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,640
are worse than plants and trees.

3
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,720
Besides, a year later she became a mother herself,

4
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,760
so her heart must have softened.

5
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,440
Go back and be filial to her,

6
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,360
she might find you a good marriage,

7
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,520
a good husband.

8
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,000
Then your life will be complete.

9
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,840
Master, do you know?

10
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,680
Huan'er once made a vow.

11
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,800
After I get married,

12
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,640
I'll bring you down from the mountain

13
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,570
and take care of you in your old age.

14
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,200
I see you as my mother.

15
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,800
I must seize this opportunity to win you over.

16
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
Even if I'm not the one in your heart,

17
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,700
I still have to try.

18
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,210
Miss Chunyu,

19
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,160
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,860
I already have someone I love.

21
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,640
I can't accept rewards I haven't earned.

22
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,000
I cannot accept this gift.

23
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,360
Huo Yu,

24
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,880
am I only worth these few taels of silver to you?

25
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,380
Is it just for this small amount of money?

26
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,120
Your Highness, you're finally awake.

27
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,380
I'll go get Doctor Yan.

28
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
I knew you would wake up.

29
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,650
How long have I been asleep?

30
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,020
Why do I feel so exhausted?

31
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,920
It's good that you're awake.

32
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,720
Master truly has healing hands.

33
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,740
Why are you crying?

34
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,079
I'm awake now, aren't I?

35
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,200
I now

36
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,800
have only you left in my life.

37
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,880
What happened?

38
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,880
After your master saved you,

39
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,800
he was gone.

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,520
What exactly happened?

41
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,240
Doctor Yan, the Empress urgently summons you.

42
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,640
Something's happened to the Crown Prince.

43
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,959
My son!

44
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,880
Wake up,

45
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,480
don't frighten your mother.

46
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,360
Xiaoyu.

47
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,440
Your Majesty.

48
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,440
Please don't worry, Your Majesty.

49
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,970
Doctor Yan and Doctor Chunyu are on their way,

50
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,520
the Emperor has been informed,

51
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,880
and will be here shortly.

52
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,640
He was only running a fever,

53
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,140
how could he suddenly fall unconscious?

54
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,240
Your Majesty, please allow me to examine the Crown Prince.

55
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,300
Yes, come quickly.

56
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,040
Wait.

57
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,440
The Crown Prince clearly has cold energy invading his body,

58
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,440
applying acupuncture now

59
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,400
will definitely cause the cold to be rapidly absorbed deeper.

60
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,200
I disagree.

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,480
I actually think applying needles now

62
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,290
would help disperse the cold energy more easily.

63
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,600
The Crown Prince's condition isn't that serious.

64
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,920
There's no need for acupuncture.

65
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,400
A few doses of cold-dispelling powder will suffice.

66
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,120
Are you certain?

67
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,040
Yes, I am certain.

68
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,000
Then what are you waiting for?

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Go prepare the medicine now!

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,530
Yes, sir.

71
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,659
The pharmacy is empty now,

72
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,000
so it should be safe.

73
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,660
No matter how skilled you are,

74
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,840
this poison is colorless and tasteless,

75
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,640
you definitely won't detect it.

76
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,560
Since you like to steal credit in front of the Empress,

77
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,760
I want to see

78
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,480
if you can save the Crown Prince this time.

79
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,320
Your Majesty, please don't worry,

80
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,720
the Prince just has a cold,

81
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,280
with so many royal physicians in the palace,

82
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,810
he will certainly recover.

83
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,860
Is Shi'er alright?

84
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,020
Royal brother,

85
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,120
you're even more anxious than I am, his own father.

86
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,160
Shi'er!

87
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,980
Doctor Yan!

88
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,200
Didn't you say he would get better after taking the medicine?

89
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Why is he having trouble breathing?

90
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,100
Doctor Yan,

91
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,840
if anything happens to my son,

92
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,240
I will never forgive you.

93
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,600
He's awake.

94
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,400
He's fine now.

95
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,730
Everything's alright.

96
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,740
Doctor Yan,

97
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,240
what exactly happened here?

98
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,570
What did you give my crown prince to drink?

99
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:09,960
My son.

100
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,400
Your Majesty,

101
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,300
has the prince been poisoned?

102
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,440
Guards!

103
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Take Doctor Yan to the dungeon to await punishment.

104
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,480
Your Majesty.

105
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,410
She has fainted.

106
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,780
Royal Brother.

107
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,420
It's my Crown Prince who is in danger.

108
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,680
If you dare protect her again,

109
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,880
don't blame me for forgetting our brotherhood.

110
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,320
Fine,

111
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,200
you save your people,

112
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,380
and I'll save mine.

113
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,680
Your Majesty.

114
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,060
Let me examine him.

115
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,720
Hurry!

116
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,040
If you can cure him,

117
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,120
I will reward you generously.

118
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,380
I will certainly reward you handsomely.

119
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,360
Mother.

120
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,280
My son.

121
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,120
My dear son has awakened.

122
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,320
Doctor Chunyu

123
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,640
is truly skilled.

124
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,240
For saving the Crown Prince,

125
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,280
Guards, reward him with 1,000 gold pieces.

126
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,440
Your Majesty, forgive my boldness.

127
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,840
What I desire is not gold or jewels,

128
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,520
but a good marriage.

129
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,240
You have someone in mind?

130
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
Who is it? Tell me.

131
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,280
I will arrange the marriage for you.

132
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,080
Your Majesty.

133
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,560
The one I desire is

134
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,400
General Huo Yu from the Huo family.
