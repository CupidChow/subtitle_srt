1
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,680
Juanyu.

2
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,400
Guess the lantern riddles for prizes, miss.

3
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,520
Would you like to try a riddle?

4
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,400
Prizes for every correct answer.

5
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:49,760
Over there,

6
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,360
slow down.

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,960
Guess the lantern riddles for prizes!

8
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,600
Sir,

9
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,600
what's the prize?

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,920
For a family of three.

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:55,800
I see.

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,920
If your whole family can solve all my riddles,

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,800
I'll give you a lantern for free.

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,680
Ask away.

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,220
Listen carefully.

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,080
It strips autumn leaves,

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,520
makes February flowers bloom,

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,920
creates thousand-foot waves across rivers,

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,920
and bends countless bamboo stalks.

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,610
Wind.

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,650
Correct!

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,880
Next one.

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,760
Mountains have color from afar,

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,000
water makes no sound up close,

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,320
flowers remain when spring departs,

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,760
birds aren't startled when people approach.

27
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,200
A painting.

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,880
Correct!

29
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,880
But this last riddle

30
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,960
must be answered by your mother.

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,520
If you get them all right,

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,320
you can choose any lantern here.

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,160
Listen.

34
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,640
A thousand forms return to emptiness,

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,400
reflecting water, hiding mountains, layer upon layer,

36
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,640
endless withered seedlings nearly dead,

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,200
leisurely forming wondrous peaks.

38
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,680
Difficult, isn't it?

39
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,720
Congratulations!

40
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,120
Here's your lantern.

41
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,440
Thank you.

42
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,720
Guess the riddles!

43
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,199
Everyone.

44
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,480
This is the city defense map.

45
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,400
Tomorrow,

46
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,770
you will split into two groups.

47
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,800
One group will wait outside the city.

48
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,360
The other will follow me into the palace.

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,320
We'll follow the minister to the death.

50
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,440
This is treason,

51
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,000
punishable by death for nine generations.

52
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,240
You may leave now.

53
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,620
Nine generations?

54
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,900
What nine generations are even left?

55
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,880
Come with me.

56
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,240
You once asked me

57
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,040
why during holidays

58
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,400
when other families honor their ancestors,

59
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,680
the Huo family never does.

60
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,800
Now you can see

61
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,930
how few of the Huo family

62
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,280
remain.

63
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,880
How is this possible?

64
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,040
How can there be only these few left?

65
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,800
Our Huo family was once full of loyal servants,

66
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,440
but for this Great Jing Dynasty,

67
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,200
in the end,

68
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,079
only your grandfather's line survived.

69
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,880
Your grandfather was once Vice Minister of Rites,

70
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,560
but just because of a diplomatic protocol error,

71
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,240
he was severely punished by the late emperor,

72
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,560
causing him to die of depression,

73
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,620
coughing up blood.

74
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,760
Your uncle was the dynasty's Grand General,

75
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,040
stationed in the northern frontier,

76
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,760
but just because he lost a battle and was captured,

77
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,360
the previous emperor

78
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,200
suspected him of colluding with the enemy

79
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,000
and executed his entire family.

80
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:48,340
Your uncle died with hatred in his heart,

81
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,800
drinking poison.

82
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,800
Your third uncle's fate was even more ridiculous.

83
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,840
Just because of mistakes while managing flood disasters,

84
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,079
he was then by the crown prince...

85
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:59,210
King Jing now has a blade at his throat.

86
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,120
Let me ask you,

87
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,400
my Huo family

88
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,600
and his Liu family

89
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,560
have a blood feud of genocide between us.

90
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
With such a court,

91
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,200
do you still want to protect him?

92
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
This isn't true.

93
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,290
This isn't true.

94
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,610
Tell me this isn't true.

95
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,170
This isn't real.

96
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,840
Brother.

97
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,020
Third Brother.

98
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,740
Sorry to keep you waiting.

99
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,520
I can avenge you soon.

100
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,980
May the Great Jing Dynasty prosper forever.

101
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,680
The Crown Prince cares for the world despite his young age,

102
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,740
truly remarkable.

103
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,880
He will

104
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,740
certainly become a good emperor.

105
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,440
Even for the sake of Shi'er,

106
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,560
Liu Le's patricide

107
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,200
cannot be made public.

108
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,400
I entered the palace with hatred.

109
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,840
But after everything I've been through,

110
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,480
I believe

111
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,840
living with love

112
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,940
is more precious than carrying hatred forever.

113
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,760
I once hated my senior.

114
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,920
Until I saw she kept the handkerchief close to her,

115
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,780
only then did I realize

116
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,120
she treasured my gift so dearly.

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,600
I will stay with you forever.

118
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,770
Uncle, Doctor Yan, what are you doing?

119
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,760
I didn't do anything.

120
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,680
Okay,

121
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,220
let's go home then.

122
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,720
You all go back first.

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,480
Huan,

124
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,680
take Shi and go ahead.

125
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,560
Yu Zhi,

126
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,400
take good care of them,

127
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,040
okay?

128
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,250
Father-in-law.

129
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,040
Are you still trying to run away?

130
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,900
Your Highness,

131
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,480
please let me go,

132
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,360
I don't want to go back to the palace and suffer anymore.

133
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,760
Whether you go back or not

134
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,540
depends on what you do.

135
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,900
Your Highness,

136
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,520
this is the elixir that the late emperor drank.

137
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,720
It's harmless at first,

138
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,960
but with time it creates dependency,

139
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,760
and eventually...

140
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,800
I know all this.

141
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,840
Did Liu Le order you to make this potion

142
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,120
and force my father to drink it?

143
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,000
I dare not say.

144
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,680
You don't have to tell me.

145
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,840
But I will definitely get to the bottom of this,

146
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,740
and by then you won't even have a chance to speak.

147
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,520
I'll talk!

148
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,940
The military funds are in such a deficit.

149
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,650
Prime Minister, how have you been managing affairs?

150
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,040
Your Majesty,

151
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,280
please grant me death.

152
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,850
I have only just learned

153
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,980
that such parasites have appeared in our military,

154
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,240
lining their own pockets,

155
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
colluding with outside forces,

156
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,120
deceiving me,

157
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,800
resulting in such a deficit.

158
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,520
Although this was not my doing,

159
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,120
however,

160
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,480
I have always been responsible for the military,

161
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,400
and this crime,

162
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,170
I must bear the punishment.

163
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,560
The report on the military fund deficit.

164
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,640
Liu An has already handed it to the Emperor,

165
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,320
if this matter is investigated,

166
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,120
neither of us will escape blame.

167
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,930
Prime Minister,

168
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,760
what do you mean?

169
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,920
Minister Wang,

170
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,320
at this point,

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,640
don't you understand yet?

172
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,610
In certain situations,

173
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,050
when it comes down to it,

174
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,720
one must sacrifice the chariot to save the general.

175
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,580
Minister Wang,

176
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,600
tell me,

177
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,400
are you the chariot

178
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,040
or the general?

179
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,240
I...

180
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,880
Even if you fall,

181
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,090
you still have the Wang family,

182
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,600
as long as I remain in power,

183
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,280
I can ensure your family's prosperity for generations.

184
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,080
But if I were to fall...

185
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,600
This matter was my doing alone.

186
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,530
It has nothing to do with the Minister.

187
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,760
Your Majesty,

188
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,000
all of this was my doing alone,

189
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,680
I was overcome with greed.

190
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,600
Minister Huo,

191
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,440
he knew nothing about it.

192
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,120
I'll talk.

193
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,920
My great-grandfather knew some folk remedies,

194
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,160
and to curry favor with court officials,

195
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,760
I often gave them these remedies.

196
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,440
One day,

197
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,780
the Minister suddenly came to me.

198
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,920
He gave me a large sum of money,

199
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,760
saying...

200
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,770
Saying what?

201
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,960
He wanted to find something

202
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,480
that once tasted, couldn't be forgotten.

203
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,000
So I had my great-grandfather

204
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,560
prepare this divine water.

205
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,660
Then why was this divine water

206
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,120
given to the late Emperor by Liu Le?

207
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,330
I know nothing more about this matter,

208
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,860
I took the money and returned to my hometown.

209
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,080
Guards!

210
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,400
Arrest this embezzler of military funds.

211
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,000
You deceitful scoundrel

212
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,140
take him away and execute him!

213
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

214
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,960
Your Majesty!

215
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,050
Prime Minister!

216
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,000
Your Majesty,

217
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,120
please,

218
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,720
spare my life!

219
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,280
The Prime Minister was deceived.

220
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,640
Those who are unaware cannot be blamed.

221
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,240
Wait,

222
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,920
Your Majesty!

223
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,280
I have an account book

224
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,520
to present to you.

225
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,720
Huo Fang!

226
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,200
You'd better explain

227
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,320
what exactly

228
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,400
is going on here.

229
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,680
This...

230
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,320
Your Majesty,

231
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,860
I've been wronged!

232
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,490
This is a false accusation, Your Majesty!

233
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,480
Prime Minister, did you think

234
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,240
that by controlling these two ministers

235
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,680
you could rest easy?

236
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,520
Little did you expect that to save themselves,

237
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,650
they would secretly keep this ledger.

238
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,640
Your Majesty,

239
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,000
I am innocent,

240
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,480
I swear I am innocent!

241
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,800
You must vindicate me!

242
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,520
Your Majesty,

243
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,840
the evidence is conclusive

244
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,370
that the Prime Minister was indeed involved.

245
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,000
Your Majesty!

246
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,200
For the ten years since you appointed the Crown Prince,

247
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,680
I have served you with all my heart and strength.

248
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,680
If I have no merit,

249
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,320
at least I have toiled for you!
