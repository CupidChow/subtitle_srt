1
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,080
Mother.

2
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,240
It's all because of that damn Yan Jiehuan,

3
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,280
otherwise I wouldn't have ended up like this.

4
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,280
It's Mother's fault,

5
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,480
all because Mother was too soft-hearted back then.

6
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,080
I should have strangled her right away.

7
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,720
Mother.

8
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,560
Now the Emperor not only doesn't believe me,

9
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,690
but wants to kill me.

10
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,940
I don't want to die.

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,720
It's alright.

12
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,480
Don't be afraid,

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,340
Mother is here.

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,840
Don't be afraid of anything.

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,520
But now you're imprisoned too,

16
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,680
what can we do?

17
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,520
Daughter,

18
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,650
we still have Minister Huo.

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,640
Uncle?

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,200
But he's never liked me since I was little,

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,360
why would he help us?

22
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,440
Silly child,

23
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,560
he will definitely help us.

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,440
Because,

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,240
he's not your uncle.

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,280
Then who is he?

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,000
He is your real father.

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,259
If I hadn't been pregnant with you back then,

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,840
why would I have married

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,600
someone as lowly as Yan Shan, who was just a minor official?

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,240
But you were already carrying his child,

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,570
why didn't he marry you?

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,340
At that time, he had just started his career,

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,840
and was favored by the Prime Minister then.

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,039
So,

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,600
he betrayed you.

37
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,560
And you betrayed Father.

38
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,600
Beautiful.

39
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,300
Really beautiful.

40
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,760
Father,

41
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,040
in the future, whether it's silver hairpins, gold hairpins, or phoenix crowns,

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,900
I want them all.

43
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
All right.

44
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,880
When my Xier grows up,

45
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,560
I

46
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,660
will give you all these as your dowry.

47
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,140
Thank you, Father.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,800
Don't worry,

49
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,440
our current hardship is only temporary.

50
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,520
Your father, Minister Huo,

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,050
will come to rescue us soon.

52
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,760
No.

53
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,680
He is not my father.

54
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,100
My father is from Yanshan.

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,920
Mother.

56
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,200
You make Xi'er feel so distant now,

57
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,160
so disgusted.

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,040
Everything I've done is for your sake.

59
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
I don't want this.

60
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:39,120
I just want to be the eldest legitimate daughter.

61
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,040
To be a royal consort,

62
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,520
to become empress,

63
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,400
I don't want to be gossiped about,

64
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,530
how could I face anyone after this?

65
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,360
The Prime Minister has arrived.

66
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,160
Cousin

67
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,940
please help us get out of here.

68
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,520
You won't abandon us,

69
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,120
will you?

70
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,600
Cousin,

71
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,200
you know that

72
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,360
I am the Prime Minister of the court,

73
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,320
how can I bear such disgrace?

74
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,000
Besides,

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,860
there's no room for negotiation in this matter.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,440
So in your heart,

77
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,640
all your affection and promises were lies.

78
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,000
Giving me proper status,

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,880
protecting me and Xi'er for life,

80
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,040
you were deceiving me all along.

81
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,650
Things have come to this point,

82
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,460
someone has to be sacrificed.

83
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,760
Think about Xi'er,

84
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,120
and your family.

85
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,160
Cousin.

86
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,240
Didn't you say

87
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,280
you would sacrifice everything for me?

88
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,240
Prisoner.

89
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
I can die,

90
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,520
but you must save Xi'er.

91
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,040
She is your own daughter.

92
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,760
Mother.

93
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:34,900
Mother.

94
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,640
Be quiet.

95
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,080
Cousin.

96
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,400
Please,

97
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,000
I beg you.

98
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,480
I beg you.

99
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,240
After investigation,

100
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,900
the poisoning of Minister Yan

101
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,850
and Consort Yan's fake pregnancy were both orchestrated by Lady Wang,

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,840
while Consort Yan was completely unaware.

103
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,440
His Majesty has granted her a special pardon.

104
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,560
Mother!

105
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,760
Mother!

106
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,360
Mother!

107
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,600
Mother!

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,800
I loved him my entire life.

109
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:40,120
Yet he deceived me all along.

110
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,720
Xi'er,

111
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,600
never trust men.

112
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,640
You must rely on yourself.

113
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,800
You must become the Empress.

114
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,640
You must become the Empress.

115
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,440
Mother!

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,440
This is all your mother

117
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,360
can do for you now.

118
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,320
You!

119
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,960
Mother!

120
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,420
It's not like that.

121
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,240
It's not like that.

122
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,080
I didn't,

123
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,880
Father!

124
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,440
Father!

125
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,000
Father!

126
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,200
Father!

127
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,080
Father!

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,800
In your next life,

129
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,330
if you meet Lady Wang again,

130
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,320
remember,

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,560
never trust her.

132
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,850
Take good care of yourself.

133
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,200
Minister Yan's spirit in heaven

134
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,450
would surely be comforted by this.

135
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,650
Unfortunately,

136
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,680
I never had the chance to call him father one last time.

137
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,240
I swore before Minister Yan

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,930
that I would take care of you for the rest of your life.

139
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,920
Good.

140
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,360
I believe you.

141
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,360
However,

142
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,650
I want to go to the mountain.

143
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,679
I miss my master.

144
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,540
Actually, it's better that you leave

145
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,660
The palace is full of intrigue

146
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,930
I don't know what tomorrow will bring.

147
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,200
But remember this,

148
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,600
whenever you need me,

149
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,840
I'll be there for you.

150
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,080
Take care.

151
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,520
Stop!

152
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,960
Move again and I'll kill her.
