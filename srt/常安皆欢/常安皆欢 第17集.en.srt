1
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,160
Your heart is impure,

2
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,400
filled with desire, jealousy, and even malice.

3
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,160
Master, why do you speak of me this way?

4
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,520
I could clearly see

5
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,920
the Empress had issues with Huan'er.

6
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't want to hear the details

7
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,209
or know the reasons.

8
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,360
But you not only failed to defend Huan'er,

9
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,090
you even provoked the Empress.

10
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,800
You have truly disappointed me.

11
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,960
Master, you always protect my junior sister,

12
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,160
even giving her the ancestral secret manual,

13
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,220
why do you think I'm not as good as her?

14
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,240
This slap

15
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,600
is not meant for you,

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,690
but for your lack of self-awareness and reflection.

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
Since childhood,

18
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,560
you've always favored her over me,

19
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,080
isn't it just because she's the daughter of a chancellor,

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,280
while I have no family background at all?

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,400
Family background

22
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,770
or personal history

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,759
is no excuse for doing evil.

24
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,640
If you still refuse to reflect on yourself,

25
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,479
I will expel you from our school.

26
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,120
Fine.

27
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,479
You look down on me anyway.

28
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,860
Since that's the case,

29
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,770
I don't need to acknowledge you as my master anymore.

30
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,400
You.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,200
It's been three days.

32
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,079
You should wake up now.

33
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,880
I swore before Magistrate Yan

34
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,370
that I would take care of you for the rest of our lives.

35
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,960
I promise you.

36
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,040
When you wake up, we'll...

37
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,640
Doctor Yan, something terrible has happened,

38
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,100
your master is in trouble.

39
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,120
Master!

40
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,120
Master!

41
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,810
Master, what's wrong with you?

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,480
Master,

43
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,360
Huan'er still has so much to tell you,

44
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,000
you raised me,

45
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,520
taught me how to be a good person,

46
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,320
I've long regarded you as my own mother.

47
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,200
Master,

48
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,079
what's wrong?

49
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,920
Master!

50
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,000
Master!

51
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,160
Master!

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,260
How could this happen?

53
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,280
This can't be.

54
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,760
Why, Master?

55
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,160
In consideration of the Taoist's years of devotion to the kingdom,

56
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,600
and her immeasurable merits,

57
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,040
you two are permitted to take her out of the palace,

58
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,960
and give her a proper burial.

59
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,000
These two disciples are so different,

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,640
one could anger her master to death,

61
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,159
while the other cries herself to death for her master.

62
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:47,760
Indeed,

63
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,360
I heard she was angered to death by Doctor Chunyu.

64
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,720
They had a terrible argument,

65
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,780
and the master collapsed on the spot.

66
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,080
Master was fine when she went to the palace with you that day,

67
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,810
why did she come back like this?

68
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,980
What exactly happened between you two that day?

69
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,600
I don't know.

70
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,200
I don't know why this happened.

71
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,440
Yes.

72
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,560
I did argue with Master,

73
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,290
and then she collapsed.

74
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:14,860
But I...

75
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,360
This slap is on behalf of our Master.

76
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,320
Since you were three

77
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,760
and I was one,

78
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,170
Master raised us to adulthood.

79
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,920
You actually angered her to death.

80
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,920
You ungrateful wretch.

81
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,480
This slap is from me personally.

82
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,850
Since I entered the palace,

83
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:40,280
you've repeatedly conspired with others to harm me,

84
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,570
disregarding our sisterhood.

85
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,530
You are disloyal and unfilial.

86
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,440
All these years.

87
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,480
You always pretend to be good,

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,840
in Master's heart,

89
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,760
you were always more important than me.

90
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,480
How dare you talk about sisterhood now?

91
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,680
What right do you have to hit me?

92
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,640
By what right?

93
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Because of this.

94
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,680
I found this under your pillow.

95
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,000
Master hadn't made her decision yet,

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,730
but you already became greedy.

97
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,480
Master must have scolded you,

98
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,440
and you angered her to death.

99
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,040
Yes.

100
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,200
I did argue with Master.

101
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,040
But I never wanted Master to die.

102
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,960
Chunyu Yan.

103
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,160
From today on.

104
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,080
You are not my senior sister.

105
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,440
And I am not your junior sister.

106
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,400
Yan Jiehuan.

107
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,040
How dare you humiliate me in public.

108
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,560
For some reason,

109
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,400
after eating your pastries,

110
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,280
I find them quite addictive.

111
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,640
I had them made by a renowned chef outside the palace,

112
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,500
so they're naturally delicious.

113
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,660
Things I become too dependent on,

114
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,090
I'd better give them up.

115
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,520
I have no desire to become like my father.

116
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,920
I'll be busy with official matters these days,

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,400
so I won't be coming here.

118
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,240
Farewell, Your Majesty.

119
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,680
Don't tell me you actually put something

120
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,200
in those pastries.

121
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,960
Don't ask about things you shouldn't know,

122
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,920
if he doesn't eat them, you will.

123
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,320
You want to control the Emperor,

124
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,920
why don't you just kill him

125
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,760
instead of putting me in this difficult position?

126
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,880
If he obeys,

127
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,040
he can remain Emperor for a while longer.

128
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,960
If he doesn't,

129
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,720
when the time is right,

130
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,280
he'll be nothing but a pawn.

131
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,960
As for you.

132
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,120
Obey me and I'll grant you wealth and status,

133
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,680
disobey, and you'll end up like your mother.

134
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,640
I am your own flesh and blood,

135
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,380
aren't you afraid I'll tell the Emperor?

136
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,480
You won't,

137
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,820
because soon you won't be able to live without this.

138
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,880
Mother!

139
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,920
Did you hear that?

140
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,289
This is the man you've loved your entire life.

141
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,520
Huo Fang.

142
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,640
I hate you.

143
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,530
General Huo.

144
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,010
Why don't

145
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,920
you like me?

146
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,440
General Huo, I

147
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,360
don't dislike you.

148
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,320
Miss Yan,

149
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,440
you're lying to me.

150
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,490
General Huo,

151
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,090
please look carefully.

152
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,330
I'm not Yan Jiehuan.

153
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,760
Please don't leave me, will you?

154
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,120
Huan'er.

155
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,400
Huan'er.

156
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,760
Huan'er.

157
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,720
Huan'er.
