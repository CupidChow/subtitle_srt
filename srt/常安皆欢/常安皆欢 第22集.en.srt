1
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,520
Yu.

2
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,320
Since you appointed the Crown Prince ten years ago,

3
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,560
I have served you wholeheartedly as your advisor,

4
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,000
if not with great achievements,

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,460
at least with dedication.

6
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,280
Your Majesty,

7
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,820
have you forgotten

8
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
what you said to me

9
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,920
ten years ago?

10
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,240
Brother,

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,280
your swordsmanship is impressive.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,800
Minister Huo.

13
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,760
Your Highness.

14
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,480
Prince of Chu.

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,520
Where are you heading, Minister Huo?

16
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,200
I just came from the Imperial Study,

17
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,600
thanks to His Majesty's favor,

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,000
he bestowed this upon me.

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,640
This inkstone

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,340
was my father's favorite.

21
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,560
I hope you, Prime Minister, will be less flattering

22
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,020
and do more useful things.

23
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,720
Your Highness must be joking,

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,650
I wouldn't dare.

25
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,050
I hope you keep your word

26
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,160
and act with a clear conscience.

27
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,400
Minister Huo works tirelessly for the country every day,

28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,560
you must be exhausted.

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,160
By the way,

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,240
I have some fine wolf-hair brushes at my residence

31
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,080
that would perfectly complement this inkstone.

32
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,720
One of these days,

33
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,720
I'll send you one.

34
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,520
Thank you, Prince of Chu.

35
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,480
The Prince of Chu...

36
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,160
He seems more obedient.

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,200
Prince of Chu.

38
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,500
Minister Huo, please sit.

39
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,920
This is

40
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,520
the finest wolf-hair brush from my residence,

41
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,450
a perfect match for your inkstone.

42
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,120
A good brush deserves good ink,

43
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,360
just as a good horse deserves a good saddle.

44
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,220
Your Highness,

45
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,600
as with this inkstone,

46
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,640
so too with the empire -

47
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,040
it needs the right match.

48
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,960
What exactly do you mean, Minister Huo?

49
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,120
I have always thought highly of Your Highness,

50
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,200
while the Crown Prince acts recklessly,

51
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,400
arrogant and domineering,

52
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,880
he is truly not the best candidate for the throne.

53
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,720
Minister Huo, such words amount to treason.

54
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,440
Besides,

55
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,579
my royal brother has been Crown Prince since birth,

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,500
how could I possibly replace him?

57
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,380
Your Highness,

58
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,120
I have my ways

59
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,600
to place you on the throne.

60
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,400
As long as Your Highness promises me

61
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
that whatever I may do in the future,

62
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,360
you will protect me.

63
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,920
Huo Fang committed such a serious offense,

64
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,850
yet he was merely fined his salary.

65
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,000
There's something

66
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,040
I'm not sure if I should say.

67
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,360
You mean to say

68
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
between the Emperor and Huo Fang...

69
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,520
You're thinking the same as I am.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,280
We must make them lose trust in each other

71
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,780
so they'll break their alliance.

72
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,600
Only then

73
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,450
can we completely eliminate Huo Fang.

74
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,000
I truly feel sorry for you, sister.

75
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,920
This Yan Jiehuan has just entered the palace and already caught the Prince's eye,

76
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,560
from now on,

77
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,520
how could there be any room for you in his heart?

78
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,560
I am the Empress.

79
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,520
My heart is devoted to the kingdom

80
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,440
and to my son.

81
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,040
Such nonsense

82
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,400
would only tarnish my reputation!

83
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,159
Everyone in the palace knows about your past affair with Prince Jing.

84
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,040
Even if the Emperor doesn't punish you,

85
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,080
you faked a pregnancy,

86
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,480
your mother disgraced herself,

87
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,960
you are no longer worthy to serve His Majesty in the palace.

88
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,560
I will arrange for you to leave the palace soon.

89
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,560
The Empress has ordered me to leave the palace for spiritual practice,

90
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,280
but I simply cannot stop worrying about Your Majesty,

91
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,320
I wish to bid farewell with the song of parting,

92
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,250
and pray Your Majesty takes good care of your health.

93
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,240
I will pray day and night.

94
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,380
I wish Your Majesty...

95
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,860
I wish Your Majesty...

96
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,120
Summon the royal physician.

97
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,180
Yes, Your Majesty.

98
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,120
Your Majesty.

99
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,960
Consort Yan has merely caught a slight cold,

100
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
nothing serious.

101
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,040
She was caught in the rain,

102
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,570
and now she's unconscious,

103
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,840
and you claim it's nothing serious?

104
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,240
Your Majesty makes a good point,

105
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,160
I shall give Consort Yan a few more acupuncture treatments,

106
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,960
and guarantee

107
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,730
her complete recovery.

108
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,480
This Yan Jiehuan,

109
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,240
always ruining my plans.

110
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,200
I am fine,

111
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,760
I'm sorry to have worried Your Majesty.

112
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,840
I'm glad you're awake,

113
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,240
but you got caught in the rain,

114
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
your body is cold,

115
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,920
not suitable for attending to me tonight.

116
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,380
Yan Fei,

117
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,920
you should rest well,

118
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,650
I will come see you another day.

119
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,720
Your Majesty.

120
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,480
Yan Jiehuan, you did this on purpose.

121
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,480
Faking pregnancy,

122
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,400
pretending to faint,

123
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,730
only the Emperor would believe such acts.

124
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,159
I've warned you before,

125
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,200
if you do it again,

126
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,800
I won't let you off so easily.

127
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,400
I have shown you mercy at every turn,

128
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,120
why do you keep coming after me?

129
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,080
Then do you dare explain

130
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,810
what the aconite was all about?

131
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,840
Don't tell me

132
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,210
it was all your mother's doing.

133
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,440
Although she confessed before her death,

134
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,440
large amounts of aconite were found hidden in your quarters.

135
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,240
Do you dare say

136
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,960
you weren't her accomplice?

137
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,890
Do you dare claim

138
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,370
you had nothing to do with Father's death?

139
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,120
Remember,

140
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
half a coin daily,

141
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,690
don't take too much.

142
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,880
When will it take effect?

143
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,480
You can't rush these things,

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,730
if you hurry,

145
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,320
people will get suspicious.

146
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
I'm just anxious,

147
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,320
Uncle.

148
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
I'll be going now.

149
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,760
Uncle.

150
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,760
Xi'er.

151
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,530
Why did Uncle leave in such a hurry?

152
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,880
What nice things did he give you this time?

153
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,680
Let me see.

154
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,580
I can't betray Mother.

155
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,320
Now is not

156
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,360
the time to betray Huo Fang.

157
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,280
What else do you know?

158
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,159
The aconite your mother purchased years ago

159
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,440
was in large quantities.

160
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,170
Impossible!

161
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,440
How dare you make such an assertion?

162
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,680
I...

163
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,720
I just want to say that

164
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,800
Father and Mother had a loving relationship.

165
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,060
How could one possibly poison the other?

166
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,880
The look in her eyes

167
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,090
suggests she knows something.

168
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,380
I need to see the Emperor soon,

169
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,520
so speak quickly.

170
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,600
Something's wrong.

171
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,320
Yan Jiehuan found out about those things.

172
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,280
What things?

173
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,330
The aconite you gave to mother.

174
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,240
So what?

175
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,919
Although mother confessed before she died,

176
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,799
I know

177
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,820
that you gave her the aconite,

178
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,960
not that she bought it herself.

179
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,820
How do you know whose name I signed

180
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,840
when I sent someone to buy the aconite,

181
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,200
or whose account I used?

182
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,080
You wouldn't have had someone impersonate our mother, would you?

183
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,120
Anyone purchasing large quantities of aconite must sign and seal a document.

184
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,720
If I buy it,

185
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,720
of course I'll sign her name.

186
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,440
You've been plotting against my mother all along.

187
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,320
I heard that when you danced last night,

188
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,480
you fainted and still failed to seduce the Emperor.

189
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,720
What use are you to me?

190
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,340
If this continues,

191
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
I'll have someone else replace you.

192
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,800
When that happens,

193
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,660
you'll truly end up alone and old,

194
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,960
living out your days in seclusion.

195
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,040
I am your daughter

196
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,970
How can you ignore our father-daughter bond?

197
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,200
Brother

198
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,400
you've been staring at me for so long

199
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,460
yet you say nothing

200
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,940
what are you thinking?

201
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,130
If I asked you to choose between me and the Prime Minister

202
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,920
whom would you trust?

203
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,560
If the empire belongs to the Liu family

204
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,880
then the realm is secure

205
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,120
and I have no divided loyalties.

206
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,640
But if we allow treacherous officials to act unchecked

207
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,900
then the Great Jing Dynasty is in danger.

208
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,600
Brother

209
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,040
what do you mean?

210
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,640
I request Your Majesty to issue an edict

211
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,960
to reclaim military authority

212
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,240
forbidding others from interfering

213
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,640
to prevent any upheaval.

214
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,120
What the Prince says

215
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,360
makes perfect sense.

216
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,000
However, I fear

217
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,640
it's too late.

218
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,320
Your Majesty.

219
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,400
Urgent news from the border:

220
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,200
The Northern Yuan has coveted our Great Jing for years

221
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,680
recently

222
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,880
they launched a sudden attack

223
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,040
Their forces will reach Chang'an within days.

224
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,600
What?

225
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,960
The Northern Yuan has always maintained good relations with Great Jing

226
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,520
how could they suddenly revolt?

227
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,600
You are stationed

228
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,280
in the southern frontier

229
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,840
while Northern Yuan is in the north

230
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
As for the reasons

231
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,840
I do not know.

232
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,120
But if Your Majesty waits until the enemy is at our gates before making plans

233
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,180
it will be too late.

234
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,640
I need to consider

235
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,880
who can be trusted with this matter?

236
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,800
The officials in the capital have been stationed in Chang'an for years

237
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,920
and lack the ability to fight at the frontier

238
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
only

239
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,320
the one known for constant victory...

240
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,880
Who?

241
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,400
Don't think I don't know

242
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,000
you framed me in the witchcraft case years ago.

243
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,240
Don't tell me

244
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,240
you did this just to please Liu Le.

245
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,320
Your Highness

246
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
as a subject

247
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,520
pleasing one's future master

248
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,040
isn't that only natural?

249
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,920
Should I have tried to please a deposed crown prince instead?

250
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,400
But we had no grudge between us back then

251
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,760
why did you frame me?

252
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,600
Your Highness, do you remember the southern floods ten years ago

253
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,920
when His Majesty sent me for disaster relief

254
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,560
and took you along?

255
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,840
The flood was a natural disaster

256
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,650
yet you blamed it on human error

257
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,290
and executed the governor.

258
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,240
The people were homeless

259
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,960
while he indulged in pleasure

260
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,420
was I wrong to execute him?

261
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,960
Do you know that governor

262
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,000
was my younger brother?

263
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,960
There's no use dwelling on this

264
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,720
Northern Yuan's army will arrive soon

265
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,440
you should focus on

266
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,920
how to counter the enemy.
