1
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,600
The most urgent issue

2
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,960
is the military camp situation.

3
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,400
The military accounts are in chaos,

4
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,760
expenses keep rising,

5
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,440
yet our forces continue to decrease.

6
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,960
This matter requires a thorough investigation.

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,520
You make a valid point, brother.

8
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,160
This matter

9
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,760
should be left in your hands.

10
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,120
Your Highness.

11
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,000
Your Highness.

12
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,500
Your Highness.

13
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,850
Prime Minister.

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,840
I was unaware of Your Highness's sudden return to Chang'an,

15
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,720
and failed to welcome you properly.

16
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,280
Please forgive my negligence.

17
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,880
Prime Minister, were you hoping for my return,

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,760
or dreading it?

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,440
Your Highness, what do you mean by that?

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,520
I've heard that in recent years,

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,280
you've been bearing the full burden of court affairs,

22
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,880
and I couldn't bear it anymore,

23
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,000
so I returned.

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,120
Your Highness jests.

25
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,880
All of these

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,200
are simply my duties as Prime Minister.

27
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:32,140
Today is the death anniversary of my mother, the Queen.

28
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,290
I offer this modest wine

29
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,400
and send my longing thoughts from afar.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,920
Ten years ago,

31
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,500
my mother lost her life because of me,

32
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,000
yet she wasn't even allowed into the royal ancestral shrine.

33
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,960
Since then,

34
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,520
no one has loved me as deeply as she did.

35
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,320
How's the task I assigned you coming along?

36
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,440
The people from Shu Prefecture

37
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,040
have arrived in Chang'an City

38
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,920
and await Your Highness's orders.

39
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,520
Deliver that box on the table

40
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,400
to a friend of mine.

41
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,720
Which friend?

42
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,620
The one who saved your life, Yan Jiehuan.

43
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,079
Yes, sir.

44
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,480
Are you feeling better, Miss Yan?

45
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,000
This is from my lord, who asked me to deliver it to you.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,079
Your lord?

47
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,040
The one who distributed medicine with you in the city,

48
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,400
and then you saved him afterward,

49
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,130
Prince Jing.

50
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,440
He's a prince?

51
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,130
Alright.

52
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,200
I've delivered the items,

53
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,680
please rest well, Miss Yan,

54
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,280
farewell.

55
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,680
Not bad,

56
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,600
little junior sister.

57
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,160
You've barely been in the palace for two days,

58
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,820
and you're already acquainted with the prince.

59
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,200
Miss Yan.

60
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,040
You're here.

61
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,480
Miss Yan,

62
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,080
I heard ginseng is best for replenishing blood and energy,

63
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,080
so I came specially to bring you one.

64
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,080
Thank you, Guard Huo.

65
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,520
Miss Yan,

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
how is your recovery coming along?

67
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,610
Much better now.

68
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,440
Miss Chunyu,

69
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
please take good care of Miss Yan these days.

70
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,560
Don't worry,

71
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,210
she's my junior sister.

72
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,960
I'll take care of her without you telling me to.

73
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,040
But you,

74
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,480
who are you to me?

75
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,360
What gives you the right to order me around?

76
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,440
Miss Chunyu,

77
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,080
what's wrong?

78
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,640
Nothing.

79
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,659
I'm just letting you know.

80
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,440
This ginseng

81
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,240
our little junior sister doesn't care for it,

82
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,040
plenty of people give her gifts.

83
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,960
You ungrateful son,

84
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,890
how dare you conspire with outsiders against me!

85
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,880
I'll kill you right now!

86
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,610
It wasn't me,

87
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,040
I'm innocent!

88
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,160
That's not true!

89
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,760
Look at what this is!

90
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,760
I don't know,

91
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,360
you're falsely accusing me!

92
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,040
Help me!

93
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,600
Drink!

94
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,280
Drink it!

95
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,320
No!

96
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,130
It wasn't me!

97
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,240
Your Majesty,

98
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,410
how are you feeling?

99
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,500
What happened?

100
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
Why did His Majesty

101
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,600
suddenly faint?

102
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,960
Your Majesty,

103
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,520
overindulgence takes its toll.

104
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,480
Though His Majesty is the supreme ruler,

105
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,480
he must still balance work and rest.

106
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,000
Why did you strike me, Your Majesty?

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,240
If you dare let His Majesty indulge in debauchery again

108
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,480
and harm his royal health,

109
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,920
I will not only beat you,

110
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,440
but also confine you to the Cold Palace.

111
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,840
If we continue with acupuncture treatments

112
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,360
can His Majesty be fully cured?

113
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,890
I will certainly do my best.

114
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,050
An outside quack doctor

115
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
how could you possibly save His Majesty?

116
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,560
Lady Chunyu studied under Master Lingshan

117
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,160
and many ladies in the imperial harem

118
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
have connections with her master.

119
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,480
As her disciple

120
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,220
her medical skills are certainly exceptional.

121
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,560
I feel refreshed all over

122
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,440
and my senses are sharp.

123
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,680
Your medical skills are impressive.

124
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,200
Stay in the palace for now.

125
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,040
Thank you, Your Majesty

126
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,100
and Your Highness.

127
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,200
This is a reward for taking the arrow for me,

128
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,600
to show my appreciation.

129
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,440
Please accept it.

130
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,560
Thank you, Your Highness.

131
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,440
As a healer,

132
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,480
helping others in times of danger

133
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,610
is simply my nature.

134
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,000
I appreciate your kindness,

135
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,120
but I must respectfully decline.

136
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,080
If that's the case,

137
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,400
do you have any wish

138
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,060
that I could help fulfill?

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,840
I wish to investigate the source of the aconite,

140
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,370
starting with the Imperial Medical Academy.

141
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,480
I have some medical knowledge

142
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,840
and wish to join the Imperial Medical Academy

143
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,960
I hope Your Highness will grant my request.

144
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,280
I intended to send her away with gold and jewels

145
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,880
the further from the Prince, the better

146
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,080
yet she wants to stay.

147
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,880
To join the Imperial Medical Academy

148
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,720
you must pass the Imperial Physician's examination

149
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,380
are you truly capable of that?

150
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,760
Despite the Emperor and Empress's favor

151
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,400
I must

152
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,440
still follow the proper procedures.

153
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,320
Anyone wishing to enter our Imperial Medical Academy

154
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,780
must pass an examination.

155
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,680
I've heard the Imperial Physician is rigid

156
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,810
and seeing you today

157
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,020
it's clearly true.

158
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,800
Let them compete against each other.

159
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,400
Ladies,

160
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,620
please identify these various herbs

161
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,730
and explain their medicinal uses.

162
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,840
White peony is cooling in nature

163
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,120
and can treat diarrhea.

164
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,360
Fresh rehmannia is slightly cold

165
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,840
and can treat dampness-heat.

166
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,200
Ophiopogon is dry and cold

167
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,860
and can quench thirst and reduce internal heat.

168
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,720
Red peony is sour and cold

169
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,450
used for women's ailments.

170
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,600
Prepared rehmannia is slightly warm

171
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,200
used to nourish the kidneys and replenish blood.

172
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,680
Asparagus root is cold in nature

173
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,940
used to stop coughing.

174
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,840
Your Majesty,

175
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,760
both of these ladies are well-versed in medicine,

176
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,640
but unfortunately,

177
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,240
our Imperial Medical Office can only keep one female physician.

178
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,080
I must join the Imperial Medical Office.

179
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,810
Only this way

180
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,410
can I quickly trace the source of the aconite.

181
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,370
I must stay here.

182
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,360
It's the only way I can get close to Huo Yu.

183
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,640
Why not keep them both on a trial basis,

184
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,880
for one month,

185
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,280
and then decide whom to keep after the assessment?

186
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
What do you think?

187
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,970
The Empress makes a good point.

188
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,580
Now she has a rival,

189
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,490
let's see if she can still stay.

190
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,260
Junior sister,

191
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,200
let me see.

192
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
More beautiful than flowers,

193
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,080
junior sister looks even prettier now.

194
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,920
Let me see

195
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,600
if senior sister would look good wearing it too?

196
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,460
I don't want to.

197
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,140
I don't want to.

198
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,320
Just try it on.

199
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,360
I never thought the Emperor would allow us all to enter the palace together.

200
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,480
I'm so happy.

201
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Me too.

202
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,280
You.

203
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,480
You've always been so clever.

204
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
Well, let me see

205
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,610
if you look good wearing it.

206
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,370
It looks really beautiful.

207
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,240
Miss Yan,

208
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,840
you're looking well.

209
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,880
Thank you, General Huo, for finding those herbs for me.

210
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,600
If you ever need my help in the future,

211
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,330
I'll do everything in my power.

212
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,200
Miss Yan,

213
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,000
you're too kind.
