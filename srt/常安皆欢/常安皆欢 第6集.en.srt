1
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,360
Juanyu

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,560
Yu.

3
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,880
Perhaps I shouldn't have come back.

4
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,120
I came back only to ask you

5
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,040
why you, now that you're Empress,

6
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,600
have become so vicious?

7
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,800
I'm vicious?

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,640
When you were Crown Prince,

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,040
practicing witchcraft,

10
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,500
did you ever think about my father's safety?

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,920
As your royal tutor,

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,160
he was almost killed because of you.

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,680
It was Prince Chu who pleaded for him...

14
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,300
It was the current Emperor who saved him.

15
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,400
And saved our entire Xu clan.

16
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,880
My royal brother has been back at the palace for some time now.

17
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,740
I've been busy with state affairs

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,039
and haven't visited him.

19
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,840
Please, Empress, deliver this to him on my behalf.

20
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
You know,

21
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,840
these pastries

22
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,810
are still my brother's favorites.

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,120
I will convey to him

24
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,520
Your Majesty's sentiments.

25
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,320
No.

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,320
My brother is angry right now.

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,960
He certainly won't accept anything from me.

28
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,880
Tell him

29
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,890
that these pastries

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,800
were made by your own hands.

31
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,440
Empress, why are you still up so late?

32
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,160
Did you miss me?

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,880
Your Majesty, please dismiss the attendants.

34
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,410
I have something to ask you.

35
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,760
Why?

36
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,880
Why did you use me?

37
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,280
Why did you poison him?

38
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,160
The Empress seems to have forgotten

39
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,840
that he destroyed your entire family with witchcraft.

40
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,079
If I hadn't begged my father for mercy,

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,400
you wouldn't even be Empress now,

42
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,560
you might not even be alive.

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,820
I have always remembered Your Majesty's kindness.

44
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,560
But I don't understand

45
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,320
why you used me

46
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,420
to give him those poisoned pastries.

47
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,680
Never mind just a pastry,

48
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,000
even if I ordered you to kill him with your own hands,

49
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,120
you would still have to obey.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,680
He doesn't even compete with you for the throne,

51
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,440
why won't you leave him alone?

52
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,760
You disappoint me so much.

53
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,640
How dare you!

54
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,520
Empress!

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,800
I put aside past grievances to marry you

56
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,960
and made you Empress.

57
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,000
Don't be ungrateful.

58
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,000
I will accompany Your Majesty hunting tomorrow.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,960
Go to the Imperial Hospital and get the best medicine

60
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,160
to heal my face.

61
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,200
If you dare betray me,

62
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,280
I'll go to the Emperor

63
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,400
and expose how you entered the palace under false identity with ill intentions.

64
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,440
We'll both go down if we must.

65
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,930
Who's there?

66
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,320
Miss, don't be afraid.

67
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,400
I went out to capture some rebels

68
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,860
and got slightly injured.

69
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,640
You're a palace guard.

70
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,560
Well, it's getting late,

71
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,820
I should head back now.

72
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,560
Miss.

73
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,480
I still don't know your name.

74
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,040
Miss?

75
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,290
General Huo.

76
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,900
Miss Chunyu

77
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,280
what brings you here?

78
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,520
I came to see you

79
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,600
no

80
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,760
I didn't come specifically to see you.

81
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,890
Oh, I did come specifically to see you.

82
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,640
Miss Chunyu

83
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,280
please sit down and talk.

84
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,640
I know you came to save your junior disciple.

85
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,980
Thank you for eliminating the plague

86
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,000
and saving everyone in the city.

87
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,720
General Huo, this is for you.

88
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,680
Thank you.

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,800
General Huo

90
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,000
there's something I want to tell you.

91
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,960
I like you.

92
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,400
Miss Chunyu

93
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,320
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,570
I already have someone in my heart.

95
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,680
I can't accept rewards I haven't earned

96
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,040
I cannot accept this gift.

97
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,560
Well, I need to accompany the Emperor on a hunt tomorrow morning

98
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,080
so I won't see you out, Miss Chunyu.

99
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,140
Your Majesty has excellent archery skills.

100
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,280
When the late Emperor passed away,

101
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,040
Eunuch Chen was sent to the besieged city by the Emperor,

102
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,960
supposedly to protect it.

103
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,400
The air is dry,

104
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,840
the sandstorms are severe,

105
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,960
with his frail health,

106
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,160
who knows how much longer he can endure.

107
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:33,960
Eunuch Chen.

108
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,100
Your Highness.

109
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,530
Please come in, Eunuch.

110
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,880
Your Highness, you've finally returned!

111
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,480
This old servant has been holding on

112
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,140
just waiting for your return.

113
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,860
Chen, you've served my father for many years

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,920
and have always been my most trusted person.

115
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,159
Before I left for the border,

116
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,600
my father was in good health.

117
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,260
Why did he suddenly pass away?

118
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Your Majesty, the imperial physician said you just caught a slight cold

119
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,340
and would be fine after taking the medicine.

120
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,700
Father Emperor, this is the divine water I've traveled far and wide to obtain

121
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
drinking it will cure all ailments.

122
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,520
Really.

123
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,600
Rest assured, Father Emperor,

124
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,000
I stake my life on it,

125
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,730
drinking it will certainly cure your illness immediately.

126
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,320
Since that day,

127
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,679
His Majesty would feel terribly uncomfortable if he didn't drink the divine water daily.

128
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,520
Soon after, the late Emperor suddenly couldn't stand steadily,

129
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,080
couldn't sleep or eat,

130
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,100
suffering torment every day.

131
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,200
Prince Chu even cut off his supply of divine water.

132
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,120
And then he...

133
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,480
Divine water.

134
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,720
passed away.

135
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,340
According to what you're saying,

136
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,880
my father's death and Liu Le...

137
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,360
Before the late Emperor passed away.

138
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,320
It's Your Highness's name that's on my mind.

139
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,480
Father.

140
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,170
I heard the Empress just had a fight with His Majesty.

141
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,280
A criminal official's daughter was made Empress,

142
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,840
His Majesty dotes on her so much,

143
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,640
but the one in her heart isn't the Emperor at all.

144
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,980
Keep your voices down.

145
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,680
Bow.

146
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,360
Today His Majesty goes hunting outside the city.

147
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,400
May His Majesty return with a bountiful catch.
