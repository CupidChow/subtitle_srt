1
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,520
Juan Yu.

2
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,080
Your Majesty,

3
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,480
the one I love is

4
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,810
General Huo Yu from the Huo family.

5
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,080
Huo Yu.

6
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,000
He seems more interested in Physician Yan,

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,050
are you certain that Physician Chunyu is fond of you?

8
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,680
Besides,

9
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,210
Minister Huo has only this one son,

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,600
if we hastily arrange this marriage,

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,800
it might not be appropriate.

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,400
Empress,

13
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,680
I promised to arrange her marriage,

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,140
and I will certainly do so.

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,760
Tomorrow,

16
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,120
I'll send someone to the Huo residence.

17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,880
I

19
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,320
have something to say, but I'm not sure if I should.

20
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:26,880
Speak.

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,160
The Crown Prince this time.

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,090
It seems to be caused by poisoning.

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,160
What did you say?

24
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,250
The Crown Prince was indeed poisoned.

25
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,759
Yan Jiehuan,

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,289
I have treated you well,

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,160
yet you dare to poison my son!

28
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:43,840
Empress,

29
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,360
rest assured,

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,479
I will thoroughly investigate this matter.

31
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,880
Your Majesty,

32
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,840
Yan Jiehuan has been troubled by her master's death,

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,300
she's deeply distressed,

34
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,479
and she blames

35
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,280
the Empress and me for her master's death.

36
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,440
I was there that day,

37
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,080
she clearly resents you.

38
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,600
But she also said

39
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,060
her master died after meeting with the Empress.

40
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,720
What did the Empress give

41
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,720
to her master to eat,

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,580
what did she do?

43
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,850
She has been investigating secretly.

44
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,480
She actually poisoned my son

45
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,360
because she suspects me!

46
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,120
Why would you, my lord,

47
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,780
put yourself in prison for me?

48
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,200
Between us,

49
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,520
there's no longer any distinction.

50
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,960
You saved my life.

51
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,320
All I can do

52
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,820
is to stand by you with my life.

53
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,120
So this is what they call

54
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,850
a life-and-death friendship.

55
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,240
But we can't die yet.

56
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,700
We need to find who really framed you.

57
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,960
Think carefully,

58
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,520
what exactly went wrong?

59
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,520
That day I suddenly felt

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,040
my head go heavy,

61
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,240
and then my whole body went weak.

62
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,280
After eating, my lips felt numb,

63
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,240
as if there was anesthetic in it.

64
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,880
Even I, who knows nothing about medicine, understand

65
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,440
that Shi'er was already unconscious,

66
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,700
and adding anesthetic

67
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,600
would only make it harder for him to wake up.

68
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,320
Unless

69
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,360
someone didn't want him to wake up.

70
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,680
When you were brewing the medicine,

71
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,140
did you leave at any point?

72
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,560
I'm going out to get some charcoal.

73
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,640
If someone poisons the medicine at this time,

74
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,240
I won't be able to prevent it.

75
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,680
Guards,

76
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,280
I need to see the Empress.

77
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,640
Guards!

78
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,200
Even if you didn't poison it yourself,

79
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,760
you still deserve punishment.

80
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,800
When preparing medicine for the Crown Prince,

81
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,680
everything must be properly prepared,

82
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,600
yet you chose to leave in the middle of it.

83
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,720
If anything happens to my son,

84
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,600
I will make sure you die with him.

85
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,399
Your Majesty,

86
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,480
to save the Crown Prince,

87
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,240
Physician Yan personally tested the medicine

88
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,700
and was poisoned himself.

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,860
This matter was mishandled by me,

90
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,920
I beg Your Majesties

91
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,850
to grant me another chance.

92
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,440
I see the Crown Prince is sweating profusely,

93
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,320
which means the cold energy is being expelled.

94
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,480
A few more acupuncture treatments

95
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,540
and he will be fine.

96
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,200
This is no longer your concern,

97
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,460
Physician Chunyu has already administered acupuncture.

98
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,040
That day.

99
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,480
Only she and I were at the Imperial Medical Office.

100
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,520
Could it be?

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,040
Once the Emperor grants our marriage,

102
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,400
you will be mine.

103
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,360
Why are you trying to harm me?

104
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,090
Don't you know perfectly well?

105
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,080
I joined the master first,

106
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,560
yet she passed her prized medical skills

107
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,420
to you instead.

108
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,760
I met Hu Yu first,

109
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,610
but he fell in love with you.

110
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,960
Why?

111
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,600
How am I inferior to you?

112
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,520
Why does everyone prefer you

113
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,680
over me?

114
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,260
Master repeatedly told me

115
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,930
that you're impatient,

116
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,320
and asked me to look after you.

117
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,240
How can you say she doesn't care about you?

118
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Besides, whatever happened between you and Hu Yu

119
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,600
is between the two of you,

120
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,360
it has nothing to do with me.

121
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,040
Enough!

122
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,250
Do you know what?

123
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,860
Huo Yu and I have already been intimate as husband and wife.

124
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,960
But when he was doing that,

125
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,920
in his mind,

126
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,340
the name he called out,

127
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,760
was yours.

128
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,120
I hate you,

129
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,140
that's why I plotted against you.

130
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,220
But it doesn't matter anyway,

131
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,900
the Emperor has already arranged our marriage.

132
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,360
I, Chunyu Yan, will soon marry him.

133
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,080
I won't have to compete with you anymore,

134
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,680
because I've already achieved my goal.

135
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,720
To achieve your goal,

136
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,960
you were willing to gamble with my life.

137
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,560
I'm warning you.

138
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,220
I hope this is the last time you hurt someone.

139
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,360
Between us,

140
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,680
we are strangers from now on.

141
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,360
Congratulations, General Huo.

142
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,810
General Huo,

143
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,530
about the Emperor's marriage decree.

144
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,570
This is my compensation to you.

145
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,120
Not only will my father not approve of this marriage,

146
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,850
I myself will never agree to it.

147
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,600
So please don't waste your efforts trying to please the Emperor.

148
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,400
A daughter-in-law rejected by our Huo family

149
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,360
can be refused,

150
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,680
even if the Emperor arranged it.

151
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,040
Miss Yan.

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,640
Miss Yan,

153
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,410
you've misunderstood.

154
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,680
I know you don't like me,

155
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,850
but I still have to tell you,

156
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,840
my feelings for you are genuine.

157
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,640
I will change for you,

158
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,920
become someone you can love,

159
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,120
if only you would give me the chance.

160
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,850
Yan Jiehuan.

161
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,440
You knew I liked Huo Yu,

162
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,010
yet you shamelessly flirted with him.

163
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,640
You!

164
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,480
The shameless one is you,

165
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,560
Chunyu Yan,

166
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,800
don't go too far.

167
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,920
You're the one going too far,

168
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,650
General Huo.

169
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,220
You don't have to like her,

170
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,880
but there's nothing wrong with her liking you,

171
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,409
it's certainly not a crime.

172
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,370
Miss Yan,

173
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,560
that's not what I meant.

174
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,020
What a woman needs is care,

175
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,120
not insult.

176
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,720
Miss Yan.

177
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,800
Miss Yan.

178
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,560
Miss Yan.

179
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,330
This is my compensation to you.

180
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,680
Not only would my father never approve of this marriage,

181
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,880
I myself would never agree to it either.

182
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,330
General Huo.

183
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,860
You don't have to like her,

184
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,559
but there's nothing wrong with her having feelings for you,

185
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,090
it's certainly not a crime.

186
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,080
In my entire life,

187
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,559
I've only taken you two as my disciples,

188
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
and I see you both as my own children.

189
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,570
I only hope that you both

190
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,720
can live safely and peacefully

191
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,330
and happily for the rest of your lives.

192
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,960
Imperial Physician.

193
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,680
I want to fulfill my master's last wish

194
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,200
by creating the life-saving pills.

195
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,930
Could you check if this prescription is correct?

196
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
In the middle of the night,

197
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,880
what brings Your Highness to the Imperial Medical Office?

198
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,080
I've sent people to summon you these past few days,

199
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,200
but you never came.

200
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,180
Why is that?

201
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,220
I didn't want to go.

202
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,780
Do you think this matter will simply go away if you avoid me?

203
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,740
Let me tell you,

204
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,170
once you've done it,

205
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,520
there's no escape.
