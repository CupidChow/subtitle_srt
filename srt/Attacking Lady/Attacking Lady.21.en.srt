=Attacking Lady=

2
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,960
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:43,160
What?

4
00:00:43,307 --> 00:00:44,440
You're getting married?

5
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,280
Yes.

6
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,326
It seems

7
00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:49,440
you're fated to be together.

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,880
Is Sinian

9
00:00:51,993 --> 00:00:53,640
having insomnia?

10
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:56,960
Father.

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,920
How did you know?

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,480
I shall start

13
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:04,320
from the time your mother
was pregnant with you.

14
00:01:05,612 --> 00:01:06,480
Back then,

15
00:01:06,532 --> 00:01:07,920
your mother was frail.

16
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:09,000
So I turned to an old

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,440
traditional
Chinese medicine practitioner

18
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:11,920
for a prescription.

19
00:01:11,984 --> 00:01:13,240
One day,

20
00:01:13,483 --> 00:01:15,560
Mrs. Mo brought Sinian

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,440
to visit your mother.

22
00:01:18,283 --> 00:01:19,520
Sinian

23
00:01:19,827 --> 00:01:20,800
accidentally took

24
00:01:20,953 --> 00:01:22,680
one of the herbs.

25
00:01:24,123 --> 00:01:25,640
Since then,

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,120
he started having insomnia.

27
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,360
Later, the traditional Chinese
medicine practitioner passed away

28
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:34,920
The Qin family

29
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:36,560
went all over the country

30
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,760
but couldn't find

31
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:39,920
any medicine which could cure Sinian.

32
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:42,440
Whenever Sinian came to our place

33
00:01:42,756 --> 00:01:44,760
and your mother held him,

34
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,680
he slept really soundly.

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,400
So I guess

36
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,615
you have

37
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,640
your mother's scent.

38
00:01:56,836 --> 00:01:59,600
No wonder he falls asleep
whenever he's close to me.

39
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:02,640
As the saying goes,

40
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:04,560
family members

41
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:06,320
have the same traits.

42
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,640
You and I

43
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,440
have just reunited

44
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,320
and you're getting married.

45
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,840
Jinse.

46
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,080
Do come back often to visit me.

47
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,120
Father.

48
00:02:27,686 --> 00:02:28,680
Don't worry.

49
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,400
I'll come back often
to keep you company.

50
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,640
I'll be with you forever.

51
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,200
Good.

52
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:51,160
Mr. Mo.

53
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:53,000
What do you think?

54
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,040
Great.

55
00:02:55,452 --> 00:02:56,240
You're beautiful.

56
00:02:57,504 --> 00:02:59,200
You're Mo Sinian
(Mo means black)

57
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,350
and Bai Jinse.
(Bai means white)

58
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,880
You're a match made in heaven.

59
00:03:03,252 --> 00:03:03,840
Ms. Bai.

60
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,480
Do you want this attire for the wedding?

61
00:03:06,861 --> 00:03:08,396
If there's nothing else, I'll go now.

62
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:11,000
Sure, thanks.

63
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:14,530
My name is Jing Xiangdong
(Xiangdong means heading east)

64
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,890
while your name is Lin Xi.
(Xi means sunset)

65
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:17,080
East and west.

66
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:18,480
We're a match made in heaven too.

67
00:03:18,587 --> 00:03:20,200
We aren't.

68
00:03:20,344 --> 00:03:23,040
Fine, I'm not good enough for you.

69
00:03:23,073 --> 00:03:24,120
We aren't a couple.

70
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,475
Instead, we bicker all the time.

71
00:03:26,393 --> 00:03:28,440
If there's nothing else, we'll go now.

72
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:32,360
I want to talk to Jinse about
the bachelorette party.

73
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:34,280
Why are you so ignorant?

74
00:03:34,363 --> 00:03:36,101
We have something to do. Come on!

75
00:03:47,513 --> 00:03:48,166
Tomorrow,

76
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:49,480
you'll be mine.

77
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:51,720
Do you have anything to say?

78
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,480
I want to say

79
00:03:54,698 --> 00:03:57,080
that you'll be mine instead.

80
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:28,240
Jinse.

81
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:29,680
Are you still awake?

82
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,640
I can't fall asleep.

83
00:04:32,756 --> 00:04:33,960
Why are you still awake too?

84
00:04:36,704 --> 00:04:37,960
I want to see you.

85
00:04:41,326 --> 00:04:42,440
No.

86
00:04:42,563 --> 00:04:44,400
We can't meet before the wedding

87
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,960
or it'll be inauspicious.

88
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:49,320
However,

89
00:04:52,295 --> 00:04:54,080
I feel like seeing you too.

90
00:04:57,147 --> 00:04:58,160
I have a way.

91
00:04:59,547 --> 00:05:00,400
What is it?

92
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,520
Go to the balcony.

93
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,000
You're silly.

94
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,600
I didn't expect that

95
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:20,920
there would come a day

96
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,320
for us to enter a marriage.

97
00:05:25,353 --> 00:05:27,720
Do you remember our first encounter?

98
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:30,680
Of course I do.

99
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,800
During our first encounter
outside Civil Affairs Bureau,

100
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,920
in order

101
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,000
to prevent your ex-boyfriend
from knowing you're filming him,

102
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,160
you threw yourself into my arms.

103
00:05:40,744 --> 00:05:41,680
Then,

104
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,600
you even said I was your ex's bodyguard.

105
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,600
It all feels

106
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,320
like a dream.

107
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:52,920
It's not a dream.

108
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,560
This is coming true.

109
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:56,720
Jinse.

110
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,120
I promise you

111
00:06:00,556 --> 00:06:03,160
that I will stay by your side
for the rest of my life.

112
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,120
I...

113
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:13,760
We're already at this stage. Say it.

114
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,120
"I

115
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,000
love

116
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,480
you."

117
00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:22,840
I love you.

118
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,920
Thanks for attending our wedding.

119
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:43,960
Please treat Jinse well

120
00:06:44,323 --> 00:06:44,960
or

121
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:45,920
I won't spare you.

122
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,360
Rest assured.

123
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:49,800
Manage the family business well

124
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,581
or I won't spare you too.

125
00:06:58,833 --> 00:06:59,840
Brother!

126
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:14,790
Come on.

127
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,675
They're waiting for you.

128
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:24,280
Do you, Ms. Bai Jinse,

129
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:27,547
take this gentleman before you

130
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:29,049
to be your husband,

131
00:07:29,947 --> 00:07:32,440
to have and to hold

132
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:34,160
from this day forward,

133
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:36,720
for better for worse,

134
00:07:37,015 --> 00:07:38,320
for richer for poorer,

135
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:39,920
in sickness and in health,

136
00:07:40,086 --> 00:07:41,520
to love and to cherish,

137
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:42,960
till death you do part?

138
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,520
I do.

139
00:07:50,427 --> 00:07:51,480
Do you, Mr. Mo Sinian,

140
00:07:51,532 --> 00:07:53,120
take this lady before you,

141
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,680
Ms. Bai Jinse, to be your wife,

142
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,800
to have and to hold

143
00:07:57,975 --> 00:07:59,640
from this day forward,

144
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,720
for better for worse,

145
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,240
for richer for poorer,

146
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,480
in sickness and in health,

147
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,760
to love and to cherish

148
00:08:06,796 --> 00:08:08,040
till death you do part?

149
00:08:10,086 --> 00:08:11,000
I do.

150
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:19,320
Jinse.

151
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,000
We're finally together.

152
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,436
(Life isn't smooth-sailing, yet it's thorough and balanced. It's accepting, but also fair and strict.)

153
00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:40,347
(Each nice thing obtained through
greed comes with a price.)

154
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:43,812
(You might be lost on your way to contentment, but be grateful that you've met and been together.)

155
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,075
(Embrace your family and happiness
with sincerity. May this be a reminder)

156
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,160
(that when you're in the midst of
a storm, remain sincere and warm.)

157
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:53,400
(Stay away from traps and pits
set for the purpose of fulfilling greed)

158
00:09:13,172 --> 00:09:16,910
