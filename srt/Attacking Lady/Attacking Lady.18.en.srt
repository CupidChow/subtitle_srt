00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,960
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:56,120
How's Mr. Song doing?

4
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,600
He's still in a coma.

5
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,800
Before the truth is revealed,

6
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,960
our company

7
00:01:03,276 --> 00:01:05,516
will firmly defend
the rights of Ms. Bai.

8
00:01:05,612 --> 00:01:06,360
Mr. Mo.

9
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,160
Are you still

10
00:01:08,212 --> 00:01:10,360
going to defend Bai Jinse?

11
00:01:12,452 --> 00:01:13,720
Starting today,

12
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,400
Song Group will terminate
all collaborations

13
00:01:16,449 --> 00:01:18,320
with Hengrui Jewellery.

14
00:01:18,747 --> 00:01:19,520
Moreover,

15
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,270
we'll pursue
Ms. Bai Jinse's legal liability.

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,480
Don't worry,

17
00:01:25,046 --> 00:01:27,760
I'll get to the bottom of this.

18
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,840
By the way,

19
00:01:34,421 --> 00:01:36,120
will Hengrui be affected

20
00:01:36,538 --> 00:01:38,120
by what happened?

21
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,480
As long as you're with me,

22
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:50,840
I wouldn't mind

23
00:01:51,526 --> 00:01:53,040
losing Hengrui.

24
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:11,320
You wouldn't mind losing Hengrui, right?

25
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:14,280
Fine, Mo Sinian.

26
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,520
Let's see

27
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,440
which is more important.

28
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,560
Hengrui or Bai Jinse?

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,120
Mr. Mo.

30
00:02:25,516 --> 00:02:26,640
Throughout the time,

31
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:28,360
I've learnt a lot in Hengrui.

32
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,760
Currently,

33
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,800
the industry has collectively
boycotted Hengrui.

34
00:02:32,196 --> 00:02:34,520
We have no choice.

35
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:36,960
I hereby tender my resignation.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,960
Mr. Mo, I hope

37
00:02:38,132 --> 00:02:39,080
you'll approve it.

38
00:02:41,784 --> 00:02:43,360
Find out who else wants to quit.

39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,920
Settle their payment for this month

40
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,500
on top of giving them
three months of salary.

41
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:53,400
What should we do?

42
00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:56,895
The video of Mr. Song being pushed
down is going viral everywhere.

43
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:00,640
Hengrui Jewellery's share price
was halved in the last few days.

44
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,960
Don't worry,

45
00:03:04,827 --> 00:03:05,800
I can handle it.

46
00:03:09,283 --> 00:03:10,240
Song Jin?

47
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:12,720
Hello.

48
00:03:13,335 --> 00:03:14,560
I'm at Hengrui's parking lot.

49
00:03:14,756 --> 00:03:15,520
Come down.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,360
I have nothing to say to you.

51
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,520
If you want to save Hengrui,

52
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,800
come and see me.

53
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,080
What on earth do you want?

54
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,280
Simple.

55
00:03:43,012 --> 00:03:43,880
Marry me.

56
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,200
I don't even love you.

57
00:03:46,987 --> 00:03:48,560
What's the point of
a marriage like this?

58
00:03:49,212 --> 00:03:50,360
So what if you don't love me?

59
00:03:51,618 --> 00:03:52,840
Most people in marriage alliances

60
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
of the business world
are not happy anyway.

61
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,523
Therefore,

62
00:03:56,732 --> 00:03:58,040
the process doesn't matter.

63
00:03:58,932 --> 00:03:59,960
The outcome does.

64
00:04:00,372 --> 00:04:01,680
It's about who you choose.

65
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,467
Can we stop torturing each other?

66
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,560
Torture?

67
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:15,360
In terms of family
background and talent,

68
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:17,433
I, Song Jin, am as good
as Bai Jinse, if not better.

69
00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:20,000
When you chose to be with her,

70
00:04:20,015 --> 00:04:22,000
didn't you think about
how you're torturing me?

71
00:04:26,686 --> 00:04:27,640
Mo Sinian.

72
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:30,240
As long as you marry me,

73
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,280
Hengrui

74
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:32,360
will survive.

75
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,080
By then,

76
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:36,960
I'll get Song's shares.

77
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,160
Hengrui

78
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,160
can ride on my coattails.

79
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,760
If I marry you,

80
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:51,560
will you spare Jinse?

81
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:57,320
That

82
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,680
would depend on my mood.

83
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:03,400
Mo Sinian.

84
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:07,621
Hengrui is running out of time.

85
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:09,652
I hope you'll

86
00:05:11,676 --> 00:05:13,160
weigh your options carefully.

87
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,800
I've heard of this too.

88
00:05:31,286 --> 00:05:32,400
What do you plan to do?

89
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,200
Do you need Qin's help?

90
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:41,040
I can solve it myself.

91
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,320
Stop acting tough

92
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,920
at this moment.

93
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,640
I told you not to marry the woman,

94
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:50,560
yet you refused to listen.

95
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:51,800
Mother.

96
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:54,400
I've known Jinse for years.

97
00:05:54,652 --> 00:05:55,920
I know her very well.

98
00:05:56,547 --> 00:05:57,360
She

99
00:05:57,593 --> 00:05:58,560
would never do that.

100
00:05:59,163 --> 00:05:59,793
Mother.

101
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:01,080
Rest assured.

102
00:06:01,384 --> 00:06:02,680
Since I told you I could solve it,

103
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:05,000
Qin wouldn't be implicated.

104
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:07,800
I didn't expect

105
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,640
that Hengrui

106
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,600
will fall due to a necklace.

107
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:14,160
I'm curious

108
00:06:14,378 --> 00:06:15,800
about the necklace.

109
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,101
This...

110
00:06:26,932 --> 00:06:28,640
I know this necklace.

111
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,800
This is your Aunt Yanran's
necklace when she's alive.

112
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
(Mo Sinian)
(I suspect that)

113
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,320
(someone is listening in at your place.)

114
00:06:53,107 --> 00:06:54,480
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:12,080
(Jinse)
(Return soon.)

116
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,160
Jinse.

117
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,120
I want to tell you something.

118
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,880
What is it?

119
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,560
Hengrui is on the brink of collapse.

120
00:07:26,892 --> 00:07:28,920
I want to fire you from Hengrui.

121
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:32,640
You want to fire me?

122
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,080
That's right.

123
00:07:35,264 --> 00:07:37,480
Also, we're divorced.

124
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
So I hope that

125
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,880
you will move out of here.

126
00:07:43,818 --> 00:07:45,080
I'll pack up for you.

127
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,980
(Hengrui Jewellery's CEO Mo Sinian
will marry Song Group's heiress)

128
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:01,160
Hengrui Jewellery's CEO
will marry Song Group's heiress.

129
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,760
The wedding date will be announced.

130
00:08:16,855 --> 00:08:17,760
It seems

131
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,480
you've made a choice.

132
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,120
What are you doing?

133
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,880
I have something important to tell you.

134
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:35,000
What is it?

135
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:38,867
Song Cheng might be your father.

136
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:15,840
I want to check on Mr. Song.

137
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,050
Ms. Song has specifically told us that

138
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:18,033
you aren't allowed to enter.

139
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,003
I just want to check on Mr. Song.

140
00:09:28,046 --> 00:09:28,960
No.

141
00:09:30,455 --> 00:09:31,360
Bai Jinse.

142
00:09:37,236 --> 00:09:38,320
What are you doing here?

143
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,680
