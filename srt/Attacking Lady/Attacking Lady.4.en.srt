00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,960
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:44,520
Fine,

4
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,600
since you understand everything,

5
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,640
I shall be frank with you.

6
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,240
Starting today,

7
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,516
you'll sleep with me.

8
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,160
I'm not interested in you as a person,

9
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,880
but I'm deeply interested

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,040
in your scent.

11
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,520
The scent on you

12
00:01:03,843 --> 00:01:05,680
has cured my longtime insomnia.

13
00:01:06,338 --> 00:01:07,960
Therefore, starting today,

14
00:01:08,578 --> 00:01:10,200
you'll sleep with me.

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:19,800
Mr. Mo.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,240
Are you sure

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,680
this is the so-called boundary?

18
00:01:24,775 --> 00:01:25,867
This is the border.

19
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,147
If the bell rings,

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,360
none of us can sleep.

21
00:01:28,661 --> 00:01:29,800
Wait, Mr. Mo.

22
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,280
I mean

23
00:01:31,606 --> 00:01:32,680
should I get

24
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,267
such

25
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,920
a small space?

26
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,800
You get 3/10,

27
00:01:37,156 --> 00:01:38,600
while I get 7/10.

28
00:01:39,027 --> 00:01:40,400
Did I make myself clear?

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,892
I'm sleepy. I'll sleep now.

30
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:05,120
Mr. Zheng.

31
00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:08,200
We found out that Bai Jinse
and Mo Sinian are married.

32
00:02:11,052 --> 00:02:12,000
What?

33
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,320
Mr. Zheng.

34
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,520
The board of directors are outside.

35
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,710
Most shareholders request
to withdraw their investments.

36
00:02:17,723 --> 00:02:20,120
Some have started selling their shares.

37
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,640
Fine, Bai Jinse.

38
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,920
Just you wait.

39
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:51,760
Zheng Huaichen.

40
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,880
What are you doing here?

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,760
Bai Jinse, I underestimated you.

42
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,680
What's wrong with you?

43
00:02:56,787 --> 00:02:57,600
What's wrong?

44
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:58,886
Do you think I have no idea

45
00:02:58,898 --> 00:03:00,160
that you've married Mo Sinian?

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,960
What do you want?

47
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,680
What do I want?

48
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,360
Well,

49
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,440
if

50
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,200
I expose your marriage
with Mo Sinian online,

51
00:03:11,187 --> 00:03:13,000
what do you think
the netizens will think?

52
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,880
So what?

53
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:18,040
Simple.

54
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,640
Post a clarification online for me

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,960
and say you've long known
that I'd been dating Bai Linlin

56
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:25,360
and that you willingly gave
away the company's design.

57
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:27,400
Tell them that you plotted against me

58
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
just because you're
jealous of Bai Linlin.

59
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:34,760
In

60
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:36,320
your

61
00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:38,280
dreams.

62
00:03:43,476 --> 00:03:44,981
Our boss is buying you a meal.

63
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,560
Who's your boss?

64
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,400
Why is he buying me a meal?

65
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:12,200
Spare me.

66
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,200
I can't eat anymore.

67
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:20,840
Mr. Zheng, I know that you
love eating chicken in secret,

68
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,510
but I didn't expect you

69
00:04:22,904 --> 00:04:23,960
to be able to eat so much.

70
00:04:24,393 --> 00:04:25,680
Luckily, I've prepared

71
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,280
enough chicken.

72
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:29,080
Mo Sinian?

73
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,320
Haitian Jewellery has officially

74
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,080
(Press Conference)
terminated its contract with Bai Linlin.

75
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:37,480
We'll support the action
of the jewellery designer

76
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:39,172
Bai Jinse,
to protect her rights.

77
00:04:39,276 --> 00:04:40,920
I hereby sincerely

78
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:43,040
apologise to Ms. Bai Jinse.

79
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:45,360
Jinse.

80
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,760
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:55,332 --> 00:04:56,160
Come in.

82
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,200
Mr. Mo.

83
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,932
You didn't acquire Haitian Jewellery?

84
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,520
Yes.

85
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:06,560
Mr. Zheng,

86
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,760
you've finished the meal.

87
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:10,960
Let's strike a deal.

88
00:05:12,643 --> 00:05:14,480
I just treated him to chicken.

89
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,267
Who would've thought

90
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:18,120
he could eat so much?

91
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,443
He ate eight chickens.

92
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,960
Why

93
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,720
would you do that?

94
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,160
Don't get me wrong.

95
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,360
I didn't sign the contract with you

96
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,960
for Haitian Jewellery.

97
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,560
Haitian Jewellery

98
00:05:48,646 --> 00:05:50,880
no longer attracts me.

99
00:05:51,175 --> 00:05:53,160
I don't like a prey
who can't fight back.

100
00:05:56,793 --> 00:05:57,880
Anyway,

101
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,840
thank you, Mr. Mo.

102
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,120
How do I look in my suit today?

103
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,680
You look great.

104
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,000
You may leave.

105
00:06:14,492 --> 00:06:15,360
All right.

106
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,480
Another woman who has fallen for me.

107
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,560
Father.

108
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,520
You aren't here today

109
00:06:35,276 --> 00:06:36,676
to visit me, are you?

110
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,840
You've been sisters for years.

111
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,720
Can't you spare her?

112
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:43,320
She did so many evil things.

113
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,800
She brought it upon herself.

114
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:47,520
We've raised you for so many years,

115
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:50,600
yet you turned out to be ungrateful.

116
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,800
If there's nothing else,

117
00:06:58,206 --> 00:06:59,240
please go back.

118
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,240
Jinse!

119
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,360
I brought you the doll
you'd been looking for.

120
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:08,240
Jinse,

121
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,320
it's your birthday today.

122
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,480
I made a doll for you.

123
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
Do you like it?

124
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,240
I want this.

125
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,560
This is mine.

126
00:07:23,796 --> 00:07:24,720
Jinse.

127
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:27,400
Why are you fighting with your sister?

128
00:07:42,904 --> 00:07:45,560
Can't you spare Linlin

129
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,720
for the sake of your late mother?

130
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:49,560
If your mother knew you were fighting,

131
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,960
she'd be

132
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,720
rolling in her grave.

133
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:54,920
Father,

134
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,240
do you seriously think she'll spare me?

135
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,040
Mr. Bai.

136
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:13,070
It seems my warning
didn't work last time.

137
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,040
Mr. Mo.

138
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,000
It's a misunderstanding.

139
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:19,680
Jinse, consider it for
the sake of your mother.

140
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,850
Was this what you tried to get
by returning to the Bai family?

141
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,200
What's wrong?

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,520
I'm not a biological child
of the Bai family.

143
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,920
Please enter.

144
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,560
Mr. Mo.

145
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,240
This...

146
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,640
Your doll is sent for repair today.

147
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,040
Hold this bear as you sleep for now.

148
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,640
You

149
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,600
actually have a bear like this?

150
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,200
If you can't sleep,

151
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,000
try this.

152
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,000
Just mind

153
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,880
your own business.

154
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,720
Mr. Mo.

155
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,560
Can you

156
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,520
do me a favour?

157
00:10:29,064 --> 00:10:30,480
Can you drop the lawsuit for me?

158
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:33,440
Why?

159
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Linlin

160
00:10:37,098 --> 00:10:38,640
is my mother's only child after all.

161
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,200
If my mother were still alive,

162
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,200
she wouldn't want

163
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:45,880
her daughters to turn
against each other.

164
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,640
Therefore,

165
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,920
can you drop the lawsuit for me?

166
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:53,840
All right,

167
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,480
but Bai Linlin's act of
drugging is a criminal case.

168
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,360
I can't do anything about that.

169
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,880
I hope your background

170
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,160
won't affect your work

171
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,520
and our cooperation.

172
00:11:07,944 --> 00:11:09,160
Mr. Mo, rest assured,

173
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,440
I know what to do.

174
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:29,513
Haitian Jewellery's chief jewellery
designer Bai Linlin colluded with

175
00:11:29,544 --> 00:11:33,067
Jin Group's heir Jin Chenxuan
to take revenge on Bai Jinse.

176
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,172
Her act involved the crime of rape.

177
00:11:35,193 --> 00:11:37,006
She's being investigated by the police.

178
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,492
Bai Linlin and Jin Chenxuan
have been criminally detained.

179
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:46,363
Zheng Huaichen has to step down
as CEO of Haitian Jewellery.

180
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,800
I know

181
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,320
you don't want to face the Bai family.

182
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,680
So I asked Bai Zhengming

183
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,480
about your identity.

184
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:28,400
He said they found you at a hospital.

185
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,440
A hospital?

186
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,600
Anything else?

187
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,600
No,

188
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,400
but I'm investigating it for you.

189
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,880
I'll

190
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,080
keep you posted.

191
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,080
