3
00:00:52,203 --> 00:00:53,640
Why'd you care

4
00:00:55,058 --> 00:00:56,760
where I've been to?

5
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:00,320
What stated in the agreement is...

6
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,600
Do you like me?

7
00:01:15,898 --> 00:01:16,760
Mo Sinian.

8
00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:19,880
Don't you expect me

9
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:21,800
to report to you

10
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,280
on anything again.

11
00:01:59,360 --> 00:01:59,840
Linda.

12
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,440
Where's Mr. Bai?

13
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:03,760
He has an appointment
with his client.

14
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,880
What's the matter?

15
00:02:16,978 --> 00:02:18,200
Had a fight with your girlfriend?

16
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:24,400
She's not my girlfriend.

17
00:02:24,516 --> 00:02:25,960
I don't have feelings for her.

18
00:02:27,104 --> 00:02:28,040
Really?

19
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:30,120
Why are you drinking
alone here then?

20
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,120
I'm concerned about
the Qin family.

21
00:02:35,972 --> 00:02:36,680
Okay.

22
00:02:36,932 --> 00:02:38,040
I have to take a leak.

23
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,649
"Jinse"

24
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,240
"The number you've dialled
is currently unavailable.

25
00:02:46,504 --> 00:02:48,080
Please call again later."

26
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,520
Speak of the devil.

27
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:54,920
I just saw Bai Jinse next door.

28
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:58,800
Just kidding.

29
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:00,840
She's actually not here.

30
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,080
You obviously like her.

31
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:05,160
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day.

32
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,960
It's your best chance to
confess your love to her.

33
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,596
Seize the opportunity
before it's too late.

34
00:03:12,963 --> 00:03:13,840
Where are you going?

35
00:03:13,883 --> 00:03:15,040
You haven't finished your drink.

36
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,760
Are you going to work?

37
00:03:50,584 --> 00:03:52,040
Have your breakfast before you go.

38
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:54,080
Mr. Mo.

39
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,920
Do you have something to tell me?

40
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,560
No, I don't.

41
00:04:02,886 --> 00:04:04,440
Then I'm leaving now.

42
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:08,600
Have your breakfast before you go!

43
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,160
Mr. Mo.

44
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:19,480
Can I help you?

45
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:28,800
What's this?

46
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,760
You've been looking
tired from work lately.

47
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:34,040
You may take time
off in the afternoon.

48
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,840
Let Linda go shopping with you.

49
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,160
Mr. Mo.

50
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,698
I'm so busy at work.

51
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:39,760
I don't have time.

52
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,160
Please take the card back.

53
00:04:51,455 --> 00:04:52,600
You must

54
00:04:55,698 --> 00:04:56,920
come home for dinner tonight.

55
00:04:57,981 --> 00:04:59,080
I need to talk to you.

56
00:05:01,286 --> 00:05:02,240
Got it.

57
00:05:03,443 --> 00:05:04,600
Take care.

58
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,240
(He needs to talk to me?

59
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:16,600
Today is Valentine's Day.

60
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:19,480
Is he going to confess
his love to me?)

61
00:05:24,609 --> 00:05:26,640
"I'd like to see you before I go.

62
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,880
Let's meet up at the
place where we first met."

63
00:05:38,427 --> 00:05:40,790
"Bincheng University,
Bai Jinse's Alma mater"

64
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:48,320
I thought you were
taking it to heart.

65
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,680
What do mean by seeing
me before you go?

66
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:51,815
What are you up to?

67
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,080
I'm returning to Europe.

68
00:05:56,344 --> 00:05:57,760
There's something
I want to tell you

69
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,360
before I go.

70
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,360
Do you remember

71
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,520
that this is where

72
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
we first met?

73
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:10,800
At that moment,

74
00:06:10,855 --> 00:06:11,840
you were being bullied.

75
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,080
I happened to see it.

76
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:13,760
I remember it.

77
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:15,640
I can remember everything.

78
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:16,800
You helped

79
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:17,950
and even taught me Taekwondo.

80
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:19,440
I remember everything.

81
00:06:19,895 --> 00:06:22,061
So things are still
the same with us, right?

82
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,440
Wuduan.

83
00:06:30,086 --> 00:06:31,840
You'll always be the
best senior that I have.

84
00:06:35,206 --> 00:06:36,040
Wuduan.

85
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,440
All the best

86
00:06:39,873 --> 00:06:41,400
to your new life in Europe.

87
00:06:43,264 --> 00:06:44,400
I have to go now.

88
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,760
This is...

89
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,480
Why have you

90
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,760
come home late?

91
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,080
My senior plans to
return to Europe.

92
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,000
He wanted to bid me farewell.

93
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:23,000
Returning to Europe?

94
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:24,320
Pardon me?

95
00:07:26,852 --> 00:07:27,560
Nothing.

96
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,040
Let's eat.

97
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,280
Did you make all this?

98
00:07:39,735 --> 00:07:40,680
Yes.

99
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,400
Here.

100
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,360
Just try it.

101
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,800
Why don't you eat?

102
00:08:05,744 --> 00:08:06,640
I...

103
00:08:07,276 --> 00:08:08,760
I have indigestion.

104
00:08:08,963 --> 00:08:10,040
So I can't have spicy food.

105
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:13,135
All dishes that
you made are spicy.

106
00:08:36,886 --> 00:08:37,424
I...

107
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:48,800
Jinse.

108
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,680
I have something to tell you.

109
00:09:11,498 --> 00:09:12,840
What is it?

110
00:09:41,996 --> 00:09:43,120
Mo Sinian!

111
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:45,480
What do you actually
want to tell me?

112
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,400
Mr. Mo.

113
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,800
Just stay. I'll go.

114
00:10:11,366 --> 00:10:12,440
Wuduan?

115
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,560
Jinse?

116
00:10:14,956 --> 00:10:16,360
How come you're at
my brother's place?

117
00:10:17,806 --> 00:10:18,800
Your brother?

118
00:10:24,793 --> 00:10:26,320
Mo Sinian?

119
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,440
This is just between us.

120
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:30,720
Why have you got Jinse involved?

121
00:10:33,052 --> 00:10:35,200
She could only sneak photos
after being cheated on.

122
00:10:35,443 --> 00:10:36,778
What's so special about her?

123
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,756
She won the 6th Jewellery
Competition of the century.

124
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:41,320
There's something
you'd be interested.

125
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:42,510
Go on.

126
00:10:43,006 --> 00:10:44,566
She and your brother, Qin Wuduan

127
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,560
attended the same university.

128
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:48,230
I also heard

129
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:50,240
that they have

130
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:51,781
a close relationship.

131
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:55,040
Hello, mum.

132
00:10:55,504 --> 00:10:57,120
Your brother will be home

133
00:10:57,163 --> 00:10:58,480
for dinner tomorrow night.

134
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:02,200
(8 pm tonight at Cui...)

135
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:05,690
From now on,

136
00:11:06,104 --> 00:11:08,412
you must report to me
on anything that you do.

137
00:11:08,513 --> 00:11:09,360
Recently,

138
00:11:09,396 --> 00:11:10,683
I've been trying

139
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:12,670
to acquire Hualan and Lunyao
with the stake that I bought.

140
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:15,184
To acquire Hualan and Lunyao.

141
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,046
Mum.

142
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,600
Mum, did you call me?

143
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,495
Sinian.

144
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:23,440
Your dad is in bad health.

145
00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:25,993
The company is facing
some problems, too.

146
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:28,446
I want you to be the
executive director.

147
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:29,233
Mum.

148
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,913
Don't you worry.

149
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:33,840
I'll deal with all
problems in the company.

150
00:11:55,116 --> 00:11:57,160
That's why

151
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,929
you want me to report
to you all the time,

152
00:12:01,603 --> 00:12:03,440
so that you could find out

153
00:12:04,243 --> 00:12:05,840
about Wuduan's plan from me.

154
00:12:06,612 --> 00:12:07,520
Jinse.

155
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:10,000
So

156
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:12,760
you married me because...

157
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:15,880
You knew that

158
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:18,360
he was my senior,

159
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:20,360
so you married me.

160
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:22,960
No, Jinse.

161
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:24,880
It's not actually what you think.

162
00:12:25,187 --> 00:12:25,920
I can explain!

163
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:28,120
