=Episode 6=

3
00:00:47,507 --> 00:00:48,600
Where are you going?

4
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,280
Mr. Mo.

5
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,920
Since you suspect that
I leaked the design,

6
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,840
I shall not stay at your house.

7
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,160
I thought you're
determined and passionate

8
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,960
about your career,

9
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,720
but it seems to me

10
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,520
that I was wrong.

11
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,880
How's your side?

12
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,520
The surveillance shows
that everything was normal,

13
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,320
except that Feng Xiaoxi got off
work later than you one night.

14
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:35,120
There's nothing weird.

15
00:01:36,132 --> 00:01:37,880
She got off work later than me?

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,960
I'm always the last to leave the office.

17
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:43,320
Something's off.

18
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,320
Show me the surveillance
video of the company.

19
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,320
Okay.

20
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,240
I know.

21
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,400
Mr. Mo.

22
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,960
You're back.

23
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:19,960
Can you do me a favour?

24
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:36,840
Xiaoxi, you look pretty today.

25
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,563
Welcome

26
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,880
to Hengrui's new product launch.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,320
Next,

28
00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:46,800
a round of applause

29
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,080
for the designer of
this batch of new product,

30
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,483
Ms. Bai Jinse.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,520
Thanks for your recognition.

32
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,600
I also want to thank Hengrui

33
00:03:19,673 --> 00:03:20,760
for trusting me.

34
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:23,200
This time, I

35
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:24,880
would like to thank

36
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,120
the person who helps me to learn

37
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,425
to survive in a desperate situation.

38
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,360
For this new product launch,

39
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,040
someone purposely leaked

40
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,172
my design to Tiansheng

41
00:03:36,264 --> 00:03:37,920
and framed me,

42
00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:40,480
causing me to almost
lose this opportunity.

43
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,664
I thought my career
as a jewellery designer

44
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:43,840
would end,

45
00:03:44,092 --> 00:03:45,200
but in the end,

46
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:47,800
I'm back.

47
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,080
Ms. Bai, congratulations.

48
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:52,320
Congratulations?

49
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:55,200
I'm afraid that's not what you meant.

50
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

51
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,120
You're indeed smart.

52
00:04:02,107 --> 00:04:04,600
You deleted record of
your contact with Lucy,

53
00:04:04,735 --> 00:04:06,720
kept your distance and
avoided seeing each other,

54
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:08,240
but the cat

55
00:04:08,578 --> 00:04:11,080
is out of the bag, isn't it?

56
00:04:12,596 --> 00:04:15,160
Bai Jinse, I don't know
what you're talking about.

57
00:04:20,563 --> 00:04:22,320
You tampered with the printer's ink

58
00:04:22,424 --> 00:04:24,880
and led me to think
those were useless papers.

59
00:04:25,027 --> 00:04:26,480
Then, you stole my design

60
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,640
and passed it to Lucy.

61
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,160
You colluded with Lucy
and got me to meet her.

62
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:32,080
You led Jing Xiangdong to see it

63
00:04:32,532 --> 00:04:34,880
and got Lucy to bank in
a huge amount of money to me,

64
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,513
so that Mr. Mo would
misunderstand me.

65
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:38,206
I don't know what you're talking about.

66
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:41,080
I don't even know Lucy.

67
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,640
Bai Jinse,

68
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,369
so what if you

69
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,600
turned on my computer?

70
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,080
How can you prove that I know Lucy?

71
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,160
Don't you know all content you deleted

72
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:04,560
would leave a record in cloud storage?

73
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,160
Lin Xi was a famous hacker

74
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,680
back in university.

75
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,880
Even if you deleted it,

76
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:11,800
she can restore it.

77
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,280
Stop trying to scare me.

78
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,200
Just show the evidence.

79
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,400
You lose,

80
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,640
simply because

81
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,960
you're too greedy.

82
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,363
(Payment bank. Agricultural Bank of China. Super-Inter-net-Bank Express Payment)
Look at the screen.

83
00:05:33,846 --> 00:05:34,840
Ms. Feng.

84
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,240
Let's calculate

85
00:05:36,276 --> 00:05:37,360
the amount

86
00:05:38,323 --> 00:05:39,720
you've earned through this transaction.

87
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,600
Is it RMB10 million,

88
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:43,360
RMB20 million

89
00:05:43,735 --> 00:05:44,760
or RMB50 million?

90
00:05:44,787 --> 00:05:46,960
You're not worth that much.
I only took RMB500,000.

91
00:05:47,092 --> 00:05:48,040
You admitted it.

92
00:05:55,683 --> 00:05:56,713
Bai Jinse,

93
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,800
you tricked me.

94
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,000
Mr. Mo,

95
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:11,040
you framed me to promote Bai Jinse.

96
00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:14,200
You know perfectly well
your relationship with Bai Jinse.

97
00:06:14,393 --> 00:06:15,280
Tell me.

98
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,800
What's my relationship with her?

99
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:18,720
She seduced you.

100
00:06:18,993 --> 00:06:20,280
You're bewitched by her beauty.

101
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:21,520
So you keep defending her.

102
00:06:25,212 --> 00:06:26,560
Then, let me tell you

103
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:29,360
about my relationship with Bai Jinse.

104
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:31,880
We're legally married.

105
00:06:38,818 --> 00:06:39,720
That's exactly why

106
00:06:40,058 --> 00:06:42,560
you've been defending Bai Jinse.

107
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,960
Feng Xiaoxi.

108
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:46,960
Things have come to this stage.

109
00:06:47,443 --> 00:06:49,640
Why are you unrepentant?

110
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,470
Bai Jinse,

111
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:57,240
don't be so smug.

112
00:06:57,556 --> 00:06:59,080
What happened to me today

113
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,600
will befall you in the future.

114
00:07:00,735 --> 00:07:03,440
You'll have it worse
than me sooner or later!

115
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,861
She's indeed with Mr. Mo.

116
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:21,680
Congratulations.

117
00:07:25,347 --> 00:07:26,240
Thanks, Mr. Mo,

118
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,440
for trusting me in the end.

119
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,800
One more thing.

120
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,440
Before Bai Zhengming came to Bincheng,

121
00:07:31,575 --> 00:07:33,080
he'd been living in Hancheng.

122
00:07:34,344 --> 00:07:35,600
It's a coincidence that

123
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,360
he moved to Hancheng

124
00:07:37,726 --> 00:07:39,320
when you're born.

125
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:40,880
Hancheng?

126
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,240
That means I might have
been born in Hancheng.

127
00:07:45,806 --> 00:07:46,480
Great.

128
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:49,240
I don't have to look for
a needle in a haystack.

129
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,160
Sinian.

130
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:53,680
Hello.

131
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,240
Hello, Mr. Song.

132
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,680
Hello.

133
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,200
I heard there's a rising
designer in Hengrui.

134
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,240
You

135
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:00,480
live up to your reputation.

136
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,880
We're flattered.

137
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,840
Jinse,

138
00:08:02,947 --> 00:08:04,320
this is the one I've
been telling you about,

139
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,430
Song Group's chairman,

140
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,200
also at one point,

141
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,120
the most famous jewellery
designer in China.

142
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,000
Meet Mr. Song.

143
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:10,440
Hello, Mr. Song.

144
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,200
Ms. Bai,

145
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,880
I like this work of yours.

146
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:18,080
It's my honour

147
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,120
to get your acknowledgement, Mr. Song.

148
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,640
I stay in Hancheng.

149
00:08:21,787 --> 00:08:23,800
You two are welcome to Hancheng.

150
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,520
Thanks, Mr. Song.

151
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,643
Ms. Bai!

152
00:08:32,707 --> 00:08:33,640
Linda.

153
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,960
Why are you so pretty today?

154
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,880
Linda, didn't Mr. Mo tell you?

155
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,760
What's going on?

156
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,960
Ms. Bai.

157
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,680
Don't worry.

158
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,280
Mr. Mo has told us. We understand.

159
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:43,200
That's right.

160
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:44,040
Ms. Bai.

161
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:45,440
We were ignorant.

162
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:46,760
Just have lunch with us.

163
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:47,840
What do you want to eat? Our treat.

164
00:08:47,913 --> 00:08:49,880
That's right, give us
a chance in the afternoon.

165
00:08:49,975 --> 00:08:50,520
Stop.

166
00:08:52,276 --> 00:08:52,880
It's okay.

167
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,880
I want to use the washroom.

168
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,080
Tell me what you want to have!

169
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
I'll make a reservation for you!

170
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,000
Our treat!

171
00:09:02,286 --> 00:09:02,760
Look.

172
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:05,640
What's the matter?

173
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,160
I'm getting off work.

174
00:09:07,196 --> 00:09:08,600
Do you want to go home with me?

175
00:09:08,984 --> 00:09:10,800
Go home?

176
00:09:13,772 --> 00:09:15,264
I have designs to do.

177
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,406
Go back first.

178
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,360
Don't go home too late.

179
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,840
I'll be waiting for
you to sleep tonight.

180
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
Go home and sleep?
