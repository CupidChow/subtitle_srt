3
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,240
What are you drawing?

4
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:56,800
Sinian.

5
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,920
I want to make a necklace

6
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,200
which is exactly the same as
the one my mother gave me.

7
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,141
Then,

8
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,200
I'll participate in the the auction.

9
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,680
This auction is heavily promoted.

10
00:01:09,215 --> 00:01:11,375
My biological parents
might get to see it.

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,120
What a great idea.

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,390
Ms. Bai.

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,920
Here's the necklace you designed.

14
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:22,920
Thanks.

15
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:37,000
What's wrong?

16
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,960
Isn't this the one?

17
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:45,480
Yes.

18
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,680
It's exactly the same as
the one my mother gave me,

19
00:01:49,363 --> 00:01:51,200
but the gem is different.

20
00:02:02,692 --> 00:02:03,800
Mr. Mo, sorry for making you

21
00:02:04,187 --> 00:02:05,166
work overtime with me.

22
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:06,080
What are you talking about?

23
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,400
Of course I would accompany you.

24
00:02:15,338 --> 00:02:16,080
Ms. Song.

25
00:02:16,098 --> 00:02:16,880
Sit down.

26
00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:19,520
What are you doing here?

27
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:27,683
A few days later,

28
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,584
the the jewellery auction will be held.

29
00:02:29,787 --> 00:02:30,960
The jewellery for the auction

30
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,640
will be kept in advance.

31
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,440
Other works are sent to Song Group.

32
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,480
Therefore...

33
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,720
I don't think we should
trouble your company.

34
00:02:43,858 --> 00:02:45,480
We can keep it ourselves.

35
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:50,160
However, the company requests

36
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,480
for all works to be kept uniformly.

37
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:54,440
They'll be displayed uniformly

38
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,880
at the auction.

39
00:02:57,049 --> 00:02:58,000
Therefore,

40
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,120
Sinian,

41
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,680
please cooperate with us.

42
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,080
Song Jin.

43
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:04,600
Sinian.

44
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:06,440
Pass it to her.

45
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:18,600
Since

46
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:20,840
we're collaborating with them,

47
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,830
we should follow their rule.

48
00:03:29,984 --> 00:03:30,867
Don't worry.

49
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:32,436
I'm looking forward to your work

50
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,966
at the auction.

51
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:34,701
All right.

52
00:03:42,704 --> 00:03:43,680
Jin'er.

53
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,040
Father.

54
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,120
How is it, Jin'er?

55
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,640
It's great.

56
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:55,240
Father.

57
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,720
Why would you be here?

58
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:59,240
It's your first time managing
such a huge project.

59
00:03:59,723 --> 00:04:01,200
Of course I would come to see you.

60
00:04:01,304 --> 00:04:02,520
What's the progress?

61
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,520
It's just an auction.

62
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,840
It's a piece of cake.

63
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,760
Don't worry,

64
00:04:06,836 --> 00:04:08,240
I won't let you down.

65
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:09,720
You used to be playful.

66
00:04:09,993 --> 00:04:10,800
Why are you suddenly

67
00:04:10,963 --> 00:04:11,800
so dedicated

68
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,160
to the company?

69
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,560
You used to call me childish.

70
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,760
I'm all grown up now.

71
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:20,560
You should be happy.

72
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,240
Yes.

73
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,433
I'm happy.

74
00:04:24,526 --> 00:04:25,080
By the way,

75
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,400
how's Bai Jinse's work

76
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,320
this time?

77
00:04:28,846 --> 00:04:30,240
I look forward to it.

78
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:33,600
Actually,

79
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:35,120
I don't really know.

80
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,120
Let's

81
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:37,560
look forward to it.

82
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,200
All right.

83
00:04:55,855 --> 00:04:56,800
Ms. Bai.

84
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:57,880
Long time no see.

85
00:04:58,153 --> 00:04:59,480
Long time no see, Mr. Song.

86
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:00,840
Mr. Song.

87
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:02,440
You're still very alert.

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,840
I'm flattered.

89
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,840
I'm sorry about not
being able to see you

90
00:05:05,944 --> 00:05:07,080
during our last appointment.

91
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:08,760
I suddenly went out for a meeting.

92
00:05:09,132 --> 00:05:11,160
If my daughter offended you in any way,

93
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,120
please

94
00:05:12,163 --> 00:05:13,280
forgive her.

95
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:15,520
Mr. Song, don't say that.

96
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,280
Ms. Song is really capable.

97
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,409
I believe that

98
00:05:18,815 --> 00:05:20,080
this auction

99
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:22,575
will raise a lot of
money for the children.

100
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,800
I'm glad to hear that.

101
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,840
Well, Ms. Bai,

102
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:28,600
we look forward to your work later.

103
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:29,840
All right,

104
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:31,880
I'll get ready backstage.

105
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,880
For this auction,

106
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:39,800
(Charity Auction)
I'm auctioning

107
00:05:40,596 --> 00:05:43,000
a work which is related to my identity.

108
00:05:54,975 --> 00:05:56,920
What's going on?

109
00:06:00,356 --> 00:06:01,560
What's going on?

110
00:06:03,372 --> 00:06:04,960
I'm not sure.

111
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,040
Actually, today,

112
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:13,640
I want to showcase

113
00:06:15,018 --> 00:06:16,360
a story.

114
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,360
Today, this auction

115
00:06:28,996 --> 00:06:31,120
is meant to raise funds for orphans.

116
00:06:32,556 --> 00:06:34,040
Actually, throughout the time,

117
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,880
I've been looking

118
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:38,040
for my biological parents.

119
00:06:47,018 --> 00:06:48,280
When I was young,

120
00:06:48,772 --> 00:06:50,960
I'd been wearing a necklace.

121
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:53,080
After I grew up,

122
00:06:53,606 --> 00:06:54,760
my adoptive mother

123
00:06:54,972 --> 00:06:57,240
told me in her last letter that

124
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,720
I was not her biological child.

125
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:04,320
I was found at
Hancheng Maternity Hospital

126
00:07:04,526 --> 00:07:07,240
on September 21, 1997.

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,920
Perhaps

128
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:11,760
that's my birthday.

129
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,920
The necklace on me

130
00:07:15,587 --> 00:07:18,120
became my only link

131
00:07:18,243 --> 00:07:19,840
to my biological parents.

132
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,040
Father.

133
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,640
It seems that Ms. Bai

134
00:07:23,812 --> 00:07:25,760
has no work today.

135
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,880
Why don't we leave?

136
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,960
Wait.

137
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,050
I want to listen to her.

138
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:32,560
This is the story I want to
share with all of you today.

139
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:34,840
I hope that

140
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:37,200
all children who are lost

141
00:07:38,064 --> 00:07:39,760
can return

142
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:42,040
to the arms of their parents.

143
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:53,960
Father.

144
00:08:02,052 --> 00:08:02,581
Father!

145
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:03,560
Father!

146
00:08:03,624 --> 00:08:04,600
Where are you going?

147
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:06,366
I'll wait for Bai Jinse backstage.

148
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,055
Why is her design

149
00:08:08,135 --> 00:08:09,676
the same as your mother's necklace?

150
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,981
Maybe

151
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:14,120
the two necklaces are similar.

152
00:08:14,153 --> 00:08:15,240
Impossible.

153
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:16,710
There's only one and only necklace

154
00:08:16,732 --> 00:08:18,200
like this in the world.

155
00:08:18,618 --> 00:08:20,360
When I married your mother,

156
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,360
I personally designed it for her.

157
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,600
Perhaps Ms. Bai is mistaken.

158
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,600
Like what you've said,

159
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,800
she's immensely talented.

160
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,320
Perhaps she modified

161
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,320
necklace she'd been wearing.

162
00:08:32,347 --> 00:08:33,840
That's how it became
my mother's necklace.

163
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,040
It's just a draft.

164
00:08:35,073 --> 00:08:36,215
What can you tell?

165
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:37,240
Anyway,

166
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,280
I must ask her about it.

167
00:08:39,643 --> 00:08:41,400
Father, that's her matter.

168
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,716
Don't meddle in it.

169
00:08:42,747 --> 00:08:43,240
No.

170
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,880
This also concerns your mother.

171
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,313
Father! Listen to me, father!

172
00:08:46,338 --> 00:08:46,760
Father!

173
00:08:47,947 --> 00:08:48,880
Father!

174
00:08:58,141 --> 00:08:59,520
This auction

175
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,400
is mainly to raise funds
for the orphans.

176
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,320
I've made a similar necklace

177
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,800
to contribute

178
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:08,600
to the welfare of the children.

179
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:10,840
I hereby

180
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:13,400
use this opportunity

181
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,160
to request my peers in
the jewellery industry

182
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,440
to find

183
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:21,200
my biological parents.

184
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:27,200
Mr. Song.

185
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,360
Jinse.

186
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,760
The necklace...

187
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:34,680
Mr. Song!

188
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,680
Mr. Song!

189
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:41,240
Help!

190
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,129
Someone fainted! Anyone here?

191
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,563
Hurry up. Come here!

192
00:09:48,058 --> 00:09:49,310
Someone fainted!

193
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,720
Ms. Bai,

194
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,800
what happened here?
