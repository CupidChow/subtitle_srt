=Episode 16=

3
00:00:53,704 --> 00:00:54,600
Are you looking for me?

4
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,440
Bai Jinse and I got divorced.

5
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:04,680
Really?

6
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:10,720
Sinian,

7
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,480
don't be too sad.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,480
You will find a better person.

9
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:18,120
Because of her background,

10
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,040
she had a lot of conflicts with my mom.

11
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,080
That's why my mom doesn't
agree with our marriage.

12
00:01:24,763 --> 00:01:25,800
Therefore,

13
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,560
I want to help her find
her biological parents

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,193
and give her a proper wedding.

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,880
What?

16
00:01:33,913 --> 00:01:34,720
Song Jin,

17
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:38,360
I hope you can clearly understand that

18
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,104
I will not marry anyone

19
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,880
other than Bai Jinse in this life.

20
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:45,560
I don't care what you did to her.

21
00:01:46,895 --> 00:01:48,640
But from now on,

22
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,360
if anyone dares to break
up Bai Jinse and me again,

23
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,080
I, Mo Sinian,

24
00:01:57,227 --> 00:01:58,960
will never forgive that person.

25
00:02:02,403 --> 00:02:03,360
Did you hear that clearly?

26
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:08,449
Yes.

27
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,480
Ms. Bai.

28
00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:31,400
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,387
I'm fine.

30
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:33,160
Wipe it.

31
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,440
What's wrong?

32
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,640
Still thinking about

33
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,240
the work you are going
to exhibit at the auction?

34
00:02:52,286 --> 00:02:53,400
Jinse,

35
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,280
there's more to your
world than just work.

36
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,440
You have your own life.

37
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:00,920
Therefore, I wish to

38
00:03:01,286 --> 00:03:03,160
help you find your biological parents.

39
00:03:06,732 --> 00:03:07,563
But,

40
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,560
all the clues we had have
reached a dead end.

41
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,200
Aside from the fact that I was
born on September 21, 1997,

42
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:15,280
I don't know anything else.

43
00:03:17,987 --> 00:03:19,120
Do you remember

44
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,095
telling me that

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,880
Bai Zhengming refused to even buy
you a doll when you were a child.

46
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,224
How could he be willing to buy you

47
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,560
an expensive necklace?

48
00:03:27,095 --> 00:03:28,080
Therefore, I think

49
00:03:28,178 --> 00:03:29,200
that necklace

50
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,560
might be given to you by
your biological mom.

51
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,680
You're right.

52
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,513
I've worn that necklace
since I was a child.

53
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,600
Tomorrow,

54
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,640
let's go to Bai's Residence together.

55
00:03:48,464 --> 00:03:49,440
A necklace.

56
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,760
She was born on the same
day as me in Bincheng.

57
00:03:56,163 --> 00:03:57,080
Could it be...?

58
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,600
Dad.

59
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,880
Mom's necklace is so beautiful.

60
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:07,200
Yes. It's beautiful.

61
00:04:07,858 --> 00:04:11,120
I gave it to her when we got married.

62
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:13,760
Before she passed away,

63
00:04:13,873 --> 00:04:16,560
she gave this necklace to you
who was a newborn baby.

64
00:04:17,283 --> 00:04:18,240
Unfortunately,

65
00:04:18,873 --> 00:04:20,200
we lost it

66
00:04:20,652 --> 00:04:21,720
during the chaos.

67
00:04:22,147 --> 00:04:23,080
Jin'er,

68
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,360
what did you learn in school today?

69
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:28,400
The teacher said that
blood type is hereditary.

70
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:30,495
If you have blood type A,

71
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,920
and mom has blood type O,

72
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,760
then my blood type may be A

73
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,080
or O.

74
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,080
Dad,

75
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,276
what are mom and dad's blood types?

76
00:04:39,532 --> 00:04:41,200
My blood type is A.

77
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:43,120
Your mom's blood type is O.

78
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,760
I see.

79
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,800
(Blood type is AB)

80
00:04:57,018 --> 00:04:59,320
Impossible. That's impossible.

81
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:09,040
Who is it?

82
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,120
Mr. Bai,

83
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,240
it's me.

84
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:18,440
Why are you here?

85
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:19,800
Mr. Bai,

86
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:21,200
I heard from Jinse that

87
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,800
when you found her,

88
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,880
she was wearing a necklace.

89
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:28,560
She must have remembered it wrongly.

90
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:29,855
There is no such thing.

91
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
I believe that the Bai family
must be having a tough time.

92
00:05:33,981 --> 00:05:35,560
If you give me that necklace,

93
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll give you five million dollars.

94
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,360
Don't even think about it.

95
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:40,040
I've never seen any necklace before.

96
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:40,960
How can I give it to you?

97
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:47,040
Since I'm not your biological child,

98
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,600
that necklace means nothing to you.

99
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,113
If you found the necklace,

100
00:05:52,867 --> 00:05:54,000
please contact us.

101
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:01,720
Bai Zhengming was so wary of us.

102
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,240
This shows that

103
00:06:03,356 --> 00:06:05,240
that necklace must be
related to my background.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,012
I told you I don't have any necklace.

105
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,280
Stop coming...

106
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,840
Hello.

107
00:06:30,049 --> 00:06:31,040
Who are you looking for?

108
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,400
Bai Jinse

109
00:06:32,652 --> 00:06:34,200
is not your biological daughter.

110
00:06:37,716 --> 00:06:38,920
Bai Zhengming,

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,880
in the end,

112
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,080
who is your daughter?

113
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:53,640
Song Cheng's wife had a massive
postpartum haemorrhage at that time.

114
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,360
It was chaotic.

115
00:06:55,412 --> 00:06:57,353
I took the opportunity
to switch you two out.

116
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,360
Let me hug my baby.

117
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,280
This is not my child.

118
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,640
Where is my child?

119
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,960
Our child

120
00:07:16,698 --> 00:07:17,920
has passed away.

121
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:20,800
I found this baby on the rooftop.

122
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,880
I was foolish.

123
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:58,280
I am the heiress of the Song Group

124
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:02,320
and Song Cheng's only daughter.

125
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:05,280
This is a fact.

126
00:08:05,713 --> 00:08:07,200
No one can change that.

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,040
Jin'er.

128
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:11,400
Jin'er, I was wrong.

129
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:21,520
Now, I need you

130
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:23,120
to do something.

131
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:26,000
What is that?

132
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,840
I know that necklace is in your hand.

133
00:08:32,569 --> 00:08:34,200
If I have that necklace,

134
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:36,000
Bai Jinse

135
00:08:36,156 --> 00:08:38,080
will never know that
Song Cheng is her dad.

136
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,160
Give me the necklace.

137
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:46,446
Since I ended up in that family

138
00:08:46,907 --> 00:08:48,440
because of you,

139
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:51,473
then, please

140
00:08:51,772 --> 00:08:53,341
help me to keep that.

141
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:55,800
If there's anything,

142
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,760
I will come to you again.

143
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,320
Bai Jinse,

144
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,800
since the necklace is in my hand now,

145
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:19,040
don't you even dream of

146
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,840
