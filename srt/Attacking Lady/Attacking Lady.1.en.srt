00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,200
My dad and my sister are at home.

3
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,040
Can't you be a bit gentle?

4
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,400
I thought you liked it.

5
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,480
Huaichen,

6
00:00:48,224 --> 00:00:49,520
why don't you sleep here today?

7
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,640
Don't go home.

This pantyhose.

11
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,840
You left it in my car on purpose, right?

12
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,360
Do you like it?

13
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,609
Your sister almost saw it today.

14
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:38,960
You better keep a low profile.

15
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,240
She is so stupid.

16
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,680
She never notices the sleeping
pills you put in her wine.

17
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:45,320
How could you say
that? She's your sister.

18
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,098
Huaichen.

19
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:49,430
When are you going to marry me?

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,520
This is a critical period
for our listing plan.

21
00:01:52,676 --> 00:01:53,560
It's a sensitive period.

22
00:01:53,704 --> 00:01:54,480
Be patient.

23
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,581
We have been together for three years.

24
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,240
I can't wait any longer.

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,240
Can we get married in secret?

26
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,120
I want to marry you now.

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,200
All right.

28
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:16,889
I have seen her designs,

29
00:02:16,926 --> 00:02:17,372
which are...

30
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,200
Huaichen,

31
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,396
let Linlin join our company.

32
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,400
I'll be her mentor.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,612
Linlin.

34
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,440
Sister,

35
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,880
I admire you.

36
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,258
Brother-in-law is handsome

37
00:02:28,307 --> 00:02:29,772
and he has his own business.

38
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,600
When can I find such a good husband

39
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,907
like you?

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,649
Linlin,

41
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,840
you're very pretty.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,720
Sooner or later, you will
find the right person.

43
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,920
Order whatever you want to eat.

44
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,996
Huaichen,

45
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,360
how could you give my
design draft to Linlin?

46
00:02:42,556 --> 00:02:44,400
Haven't you already won an award?

47
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,760
Besides, Linlin is not an outsider.

48
00:02:45,843 --> 00:02:48,320
I did it because I want the company
to go public as soon as possible.

49
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,704
But,

50
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:50,350
I...

51
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,680
Let me tell you the truth.

52
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,320
I don't want you to work anymore.

53
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,566
Jinse,

54
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,720
you always wanted to
have a family, aren't you?

55
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,280
Once my company is listed,

56
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,640
I will marry you immediately.

57
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:01,760
You don't have to do anything.

58
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,793
You just have to live a
peaceful life as my Mrs. Zheng.

59
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,403
Everything I'm doing now

60
00:03:05,661 --> 00:03:06,769
is meant for us

61
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,852
and our happy family.

62
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,200
Calm down.

63
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,273
I must play the role of his fiancée

64
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,796
and her sister properly.

65
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,800
Don't make them suspicious.

66
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,920
I have to get back everything I lost.

67
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,640

68
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,880

Mr. Mo.

73
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,600
You can't just simply
acquire my company.

74
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:10,560
You still have 17 minutes.

75
00:04:10,575 --> 00:04:11,520
Let's talk.

(Forgive me for not being able to
accept a marriage with hidden intent.)

81
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,000
This is clearly a bad idea.

82
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,000
Marrying her is a bad idea.

83
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:48,400
Find me a girl as quickly as possible.

84
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:55,400
I just need to make a few phone calls.

Wait here.

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,778
Delete the photo now.

88
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,793
Have you always been this brave?

89
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,440
Don't you know that taking photos of
me secretly has grave consequences?

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,480
What?

91
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:43,443
I'm not going to repeat this.

Hug me.

96
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:00,880
Hug you?

97
00:06:00,972 --> 00:06:01,923
This is an emergency.

98
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,461
Please hug me.

99
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:04,800
I'll explain it to you later.

00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:36,280
Are they gone?

104
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,600
Yes.

105
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,200
I'm sorry, Mr. Mo.

106
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,960
I thought

107
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,067
you are my boyfriend's bodyguard.

108
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,920
I wasn't secretly filming you.

109
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,800
Okay.

Mr. Mo.

115
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,141
I have a collaboration plan

116
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,640
that I wish to discuss with you.

117
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,640
A collaboration?

118
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,240
Do I look like a bodyguard?

00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
This Bai Jinse

120
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,421
is not a simple person.

121
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,120
A woman who only took photos
secretly after being cheated on.

122
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,480
Which part of her is not simple?

123
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:48,055
She is the champion of the 6th
Century Jewelry Competition.

124
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:52,120
There's something else I
think you'll be interested in.

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,360
Mr. Mo.

126
00:08:02,406 --> 00:08:03,264
Wait a minute.

127
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,520
Ms. Bai.

128
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,120
You may speak now.

129
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,440
Mr. Mo.

130
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,840
You saw what happened yesterday too.

131
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,800
I just want to

132
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,480
get back what's mine.

133
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,840
Next week,

134
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,412
there's a new jewellery competition.

135
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,320
I need a place to participate in it.

136
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,400
Therefore,

137
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,240
I want to participate
in this competition

138
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,680
as Hengrui's jewellery designer.

139
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,800
Why should I help you?

140
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:52,160
I know you are interested in
acquiring Haitian Jewelry.

141
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,480
I can help you with that.

142
00:08:54,975 --> 00:08:56,160
This is a trivial matter.

143
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,840
I can do it myself.

144
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:02,200
If Ms. Bai wants to gild the lily,

145
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,440
I'm fine with it.

146
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,760
But I also have a request.

147
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,520
What is your request?

148
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,513
This is...
