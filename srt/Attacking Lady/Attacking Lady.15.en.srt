=Episode 15=

3
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,840
I said I wanted to be alone.

4
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,240
Why are you here?

5
00:00:53,858 --> 00:00:54,960
You're drinking alone today.

6
00:00:55,203 --> 00:00:56,600
Does Mo Sinian know about it?

7
00:00:57,018 --> 00:00:58,840
What does it have to do with you?

8
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:00,200
What are you doing here?

9
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,720
Did you quarrel with Mo Sinian?

10
00:01:11,621 --> 00:01:12,320
Thanks.

11
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,080
Jinse,

12
00:01:15,132 --> 00:01:16,720
Mo Sinian is my younger brother.

13
00:01:18,313 --> 00:01:19,280
There are some things

14
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,880
that we need to face
whether we like it or not.

15
00:01:24,935 --> 00:01:26,560
I know that you hate me.

16
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:30,360
But what happened in the past

17
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:32,320
is now a foregone conclusion.

18
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:40,560
We are

19
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:42,920
a family now.

20
00:01:43,018 --> 00:01:44,400
A family?

21
00:01:48,273 --> 00:01:49,720
Your mom was right.

22
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:54,000
When the gap between us

23
00:01:54,184 --> 00:01:56,760
can only fill it with lies,

24
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,080
we are not meant to be.

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,600
Jinse,

26
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,040
have you ever thought that

27
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,000
certain gaps

28
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:11,520
need not be filled up?

29
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,680
When you are strong enough,

30
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,720
you can naturally

31
00:02:16,744 --> 00:02:17,720
cross over the gap.

32
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,080
Drink up.

33
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,852
I'll send you home.

34
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:30,960
That's not my home.

35
00:02:31,504 --> 00:02:33,040
I don't want to go back.

36
00:02:39,123 --> 00:02:39,960
Okay.

37
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:42,680
Since you want to drink,

38
00:02:43,707 --> 00:02:45,080
I'll drink with you.

39
00:02:59,024 --> 00:03:00,240
Why is Jinse with you?

40
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:02,280
Mo Sinian,

41
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,560
Do you really understand Jinse?

42
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:07,560
What do you mean?

43
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,280
When mom said she was a gold digger,

44
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:10,400
where were you?

45
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,080
When she was upset when she
found out about your relationship

46
00:03:13,304 --> 00:03:15,480
with Song Jin, where were you?

47
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:17,560
I will take good care of her.

48
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,280
You'd better remember what you said.

49
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,120
You're awake.

50
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,920
Jinse,

51
00:03:55,929 --> 00:03:57,101
I did lie to you.

52
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,449
But between me and Song Jin,

53
00:03:58,461 --> 00:03:59,240
we were simply...

54
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:00,360
Song Jin is not

55
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,880
the only issue between us.

56
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,520
Mr. Mo,

57
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,320
your mom asked me to
have coffee with her.

58
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:10,360
That pot of coffee

59
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:12,440
was equivalent to my monthly salary.

60
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,920
You gave me flowers

61
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:15,560
to make me happy.

62
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,824
But the loveliness of the flowers

63
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,560
has nothing to do with its price at all.

64
00:04:19,803 --> 00:04:21,680
Even when I go for a drink,

65
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:26,640
the manager gave me

66
00:04:27,076 --> 00:04:28,800
the most expensive wine for your sake.

67
00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:31,960
I want to give you the best.

68
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:34,080
I want to give you everything

69
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,080
I think is the best and
within my capability.

70
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:38,200
Bai Jinse,

71
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,593
am I too materialistic?

72
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,600
Or are you too sensitive?

73
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,080
I didn't expect you
to have such thought.

74
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,726
You don't understand me at all.

75
00:04:50,836 --> 00:04:51,520
Yes.

76
00:04:51,947 --> 00:04:52,720
I don't understand you.

77
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,320
Qin Wuduan understands you.

78
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:56,360
Then why didn't you two
get together in the past?

79
00:05:04,224 --> 00:05:05,160
Mo Sinian,

80
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,920
let's...

81
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:15,160
Let's break up.

82
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,400
Does that mean

83
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,360
you want to divorce me?

84
00:05:31,135 --> 00:05:32,520
After all, we are

85
00:05:32,538 --> 00:05:34,240
in a contractual relationship.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,440
The marriage is a sham.

87
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:40,680
Bai Jinse,

88
00:05:43,203 --> 00:05:45,360
do you think our relationship

89
00:05:46,243 --> 00:05:48,280
is merely an agreement?

90
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,240
I used to imagine that

91
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,040
we are going to have a great love story.

92
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,880
But in the end, I was wrong.

93
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,320
It’s time to wake up from this dream.

94
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,360
Thank you.

95
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,640
Just now,

96
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,680
you must be scared.

97
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:41,520
I thought

98
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:43,640
we'll never see each other again.

99
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:48,600
I was lucky today.

100
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,480
I left earlier.

101
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,800
I happened

102
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,720
to look at the rear-view mirror

103
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,400
and noticed that the car
behind me had lost control.

104
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,240
I also happened

105
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,320
to escape in time.

106
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,480
Otherwise,

107
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,000
I'll be lying in the hospital now.

108
00:09:12,227 --> 00:09:14,040
Did you look at the rear-view mirror

109
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:18,080
to look for me?

110
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,440
I wanted to see you for the last time.

111
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,800
Even seeing you from behind is fine.

112
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:35,720
Sinian,

113
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,800
I'm sorry.

114
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,440
I...

115
00:09:39,273 --> 00:09:40,120
It's all my fault.

116
00:09:40,753 --> 00:09:43,040
Otherwise, what happened
today wouldn't have happened.

117
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,040
No.

118
00:09:44,526 --> 00:09:45,360
It's me.

119
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,916
It's my fault.

120
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,080
I'm a grown man.

121
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,320
Yet I didn't handle the issues
between us properly.

122
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,360
Jinse,

123
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,320
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,360
Promise me.

125
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,920
From now on,

126
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,240
let's not break up because
of something like this again.

127
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,120
Okay?

128
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:09,400
Okay.

129
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,640
Don't you think

130
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:31,880
everything we've been through

131
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,080
was arranged by God?

132
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:41,760
This should be the fate
between the two of us.

133
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:43,840
Arranged?

134
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:47,640
Can you give me a ride?

135
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,624
Today,

136
00:10:48,707 --> 00:10:49,920
have you gone to see Song Jin?

137
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,938
Did Song Jin

138
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,369
gave you that teddy bear?

139
00:10:56,076 --> 00:10:56,960
Jinse.

140
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,880
Yes?

141
00:10:59,224 --> 00:11:00,640
From now on,

142
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:03,513
no one can come between

143
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,200
