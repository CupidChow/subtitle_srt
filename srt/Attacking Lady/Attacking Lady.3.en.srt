00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,369
(The number you have dialled)

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,080
(is not available.)

5
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,400
Who are you?

6
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,640
What are you doing?

7
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,800
Do you know who I am?

8
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,880
Who are you?

9
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:02,101
I am from the Jin family...

10
00:02:02,126 --> 00:02:03,320
I'll beat you up no matter who you are.

11
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,406
Help!

12
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,433
Who are you?

13
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,058
Why did you come to our house?

14
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,280
Mr. Mo.

15
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,880
Mr. Bai.

16
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:19,280
This Mr. Jin

17
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,280
has seriously trampled
on my bottom line.

18
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,098
He touched my people.

19
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,400
Therefore, I borrowed your house

20
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,720
to teach him a lesson.

21
00:02:36,252 --> 00:02:37,600
Mr. Bai and Ms. Bai,

22
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,160
what you did is a crime.

23
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:42,800
If Ms. Bai Jinse wishes
to pursue this matter,

24
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,920
you're aware of the consequences, right?

25
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,440
I told you to stop causing trouble.

26
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:53,080
I didn't expect Mo Sinian to be here.

27
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,470
This is going to be troublesome.

28
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,160
Can you two talk later?

29
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,960
Take me to the hospital first.

30
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,944
What a stupid woman.

31
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,000
Mr. Mo.

32
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,760
Why is it you?

33
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,840
What's wrong?

34
00:04:53,738 --> 00:04:55,440
Are you hoping that Mr. Jin is here?

35
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,360
(Hello, Mr. Jin?)

36
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,338
Last night...!

37
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Last night, I was so
exhausted because of you.

38
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,200
Don't worry.

39
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,680
I'm not interested in you.

40
00:05:12,215 --> 00:05:13,680
Last night,

41
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:15,480
I gave that Mr. Jin a whip.

42
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,080
Thank you, Mr. Mo.

43
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,360
I'm sorry.

44
00:05:23,676 --> 00:05:25,000
What's the use of being sorry?

45
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,830
Why don't you kick me too?

46
00:05:32,904 --> 00:05:33,800
Where are my clothes?

47
00:05:34,473 --> 00:05:35,600
What do you think?

48
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:38,440
I...

49
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:31,320
I helped you, yet I got beaten.

50
00:06:32,723 --> 00:06:33,680
You're so troublesome.

51
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,080
I...

52
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,450
Go to the Civil Affairs
Bureau with me first.

53
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,350
Go to the office after getting
the marriage certificate.

54
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:49,286
Why is there an ice pack here?

55
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,080
Why is his house so empty?

56
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,600
Have you heard about it?

57
00:08:00,904 --> 00:08:03,240
The designer who exposed her boyfriend's
affair with her sister online

58
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,800
will be reporting to work today.

59
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,400
What?

60
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,381
She's quite pretty.

61
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,240
I heard that

62
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,240
Bai Linlin's

63
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,452
design drafts

64
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,526
were copied from this person.

65
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,560
And I also heard that

66
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:16,329
Mr. Mo personally announced that
she will be joining the Hengrui Group.

67
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,206
If you have time to gossip about others,

68
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,520
why don't you focus on your own work?

69
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,627
In Hengrui,

70
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:25,200
we only look at your capability.

71
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,507
Of course.

72
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,615
If she is half as capable as Ms. Xiaoxi,

73
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,030
she would have made a
name long ago.

74
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,775
Am I right?

75
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:32,901
Jinse is not that kind of person

76
00:08:32,963 --> 00:08:34,560
who rely on hype to get a job.

77
00:08:36,304 --> 00:08:37,840
Thank you for your concern.

78
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:39,760
I'll let my works speak for themselves.

79
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:51,520
Hello,

80
00:08:51,901 --> 00:08:53,240
I'm a new designer,

81
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,800
Bai Jinse.

82
00:08:55,427 --> 00:08:56,600
Hello, Ms. Bai.

83
00:08:56,849 --> 00:08:58,747
I am the Design Director
of Hengrui Jewellery,

84
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,800
Feng Xiaoxi.

85
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,240
I hope that in the future,

86
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,880
you can contribute to
Mr. Mo and the company

87
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,200
with your capability.

88
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,040
Hello,

89
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,880
Ms. Feng.

90
00:09:23,818 --> 00:09:25,760
Is the smell on her body

91
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,120
capable of curing my insomnia?

92
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:51,400
It doesn't smell like this either.

93
00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:14,360
You...!

94
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:15,821
What are you doing in my bedroom?

95
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,720
This is my house.

96
00:10:19,972 --> 00:10:21,480
I can do whatever I want.

97
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:23,560
Then what are you doing
with my nightgown?

98
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:27,920
I think it looks pretty.

99
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,520
Can't I see what brand it is?

100
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,240
What are you holding in your hand?

101
00:10:41,704 --> 00:10:42,720
What are you doing with this?

102
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,160
I ran out of this.

103
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,080
So I took yours. What's wrong with it?

104
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,840
Do you

105
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:53,120
also use

106
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,520
hair removal cream?

107
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,200
I see.

108
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:01,240
You should have told me earlier.

109
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,800
I understand.

110
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,240
My lace trim nightgown

111
00:11:07,178 --> 00:11:08,840
is too small for you.

112
00:11:09,372 --> 00:11:10,800
I'll buy you a big one next time.

113
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,280
No wonder

114
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,378
you are in such a hurry to get married.

115
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:15,840
No, don’t get me wrong.

116
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,120
I'm serious...

117
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,360
I understand everything.

118
00:11:21,624 --> 00:11:22,560
Fine.

119
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,535
Since you understand everything,

120
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:27,480
then I'll be honest with you.

121
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,280
Starting today,

122
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:31,320
