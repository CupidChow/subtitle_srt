00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,960
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,640
Aunt.

4
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,040
Why did you ask me

5
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,640
to come here today?

6
00:00:50,513 --> 00:00:53,012
Jin'er brought this coffee
back from Europe.

7
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,760
Try it.

8
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,920
Thanks.

9
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:02,320
I heard you're an orphan.

10
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:05,160
You got to where you are

11
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,880
step by step.

12
00:01:07,295 --> 00:01:08,840
You've come a long way.

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,581
However, I also hope
that you'll know that

14
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:14,984
certain things

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,960
can't be achieved

16
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,200
through hard work.

17
00:01:18,264 --> 00:01:19,240
Aunt.

18
00:01:20,344 --> 00:01:21,720
Just get straight

19
00:01:22,046 --> 00:01:22,920
to the point.

20
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,720
Jinse.

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,160
I've seen

22
00:01:28,273 --> 00:01:29,480
many girls like you.

23
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,720
You come from a humble beginning.

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,800
The best way to move up a class

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,800
is to marry a wealthy person.

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,320
However, you should think about

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,680
how different

28
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,200
your fundamental values will be.

29
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,440
Such differences

30
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:44,000
cannot be overcome

31
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,600
by your beauty.

32
00:01:48,113 --> 00:01:49,400
Did you ask me to come here today

33
00:01:49,553 --> 00:01:50,960
to talk about this?

34
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:54,120
I didn't get together with Sinian

35
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:55,680
because of his status.

36
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:57,720
We're genuinely in love.

37
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,400
I thought

38
00:01:59,532 --> 00:02:00,720
you'd give us your blessing,

39
00:02:01,353 --> 00:02:02,323
but it seems that

40
00:02:02,504 --> 00:02:04,040
it's not the case.

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,440
Don't worry.

42
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:09,680
I won't break up with Sinian.

43
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:11,240
If there's nothing else,

44
00:02:11,486 --> 00:02:12,486
I'll go now.

45
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,120
Thanks for your coffee.

46
00:02:15,255 --> 00:02:16,560
Let's see

47
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,720
how long

48
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:19,720
your relationship with Sinian will last.

49
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,800
Why are you back so late?

50
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:46,240
Your mother invited me for coffeee.

51
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,920
Sit down, Jinse.

52
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,360
I told you so.

53
00:02:51,412 --> 00:02:52,440
After getting to know you,

54
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,686
she'd surely like you.

55
00:02:55,046 --> 00:02:56,000
Look at this bouquet.

56
00:02:57,406 --> 00:02:58,480
I heard that

57
00:02:58,538 --> 00:03:01,520
many celebrities and even royalty

58
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:03,520
used this bouquet for their weddings.

59
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,000
It's expensive.

60
00:03:05,624 --> 00:03:06,520
It's for you.

61
00:03:10,116 --> 00:03:11,240
Just put it there.

62
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,107
What's wrong with you today?

63
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:16,760
Did my mother

64
00:03:17,575 --> 00:03:19,000
say anything to you again?

65
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:21,560
Your mother said that

66
00:03:22,707 --> 00:03:24,320
we're incompatible in status

67
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,880
and that it would be hard
for our relationship to last.

68
00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:29,600
I don't know

69
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,800
whether I'm ready,

70
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:36,120
but I hope that you'll understand that

71
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:39,120
I'm not a social climber.

72
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,240
I'm tired.

73
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:43,200
I'll go to bed first.

74
00:03:54,246 --> 00:03:56,870
(Song Jin)

75
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,760
Why did you

76
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,840
ask me to come here?

77
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:11,840
Please enjoy.

78
00:04:11,963 --> 00:04:12,932
I think

79
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,880
you wouldn't want Jinse

80
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,360
to see us being together.

81
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:18,720
Jinse is not a jealous person.

82
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:20,120
Fine.

83
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,480
Sinian.

84
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,240
I know that you don't love me.

85
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,160
Hence,

86
00:04:26,486 --> 00:04:27,560
let bygones

87
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:29,120
be bygones.

88
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:33,320
I sincerely wish you happiness.

89
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,280
Thanks.

90
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,280
I also wish that

91
00:04:38,716 --> 00:04:40,840
you'll achieve happiness.

92
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:43,366
I'm here

93
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,840
to help my father

94
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,175
to do a good job with the auction.

95
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:47,520
May we have a happy collaboration.

96
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:50,320
Sure.

97
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,080
By the way,

98
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:54,160
I'll look for Jinse

99
00:04:54,181 --> 00:04:55,196
to discuss the auction.

100
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,240
However, I'm not driving today.

101
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,218
Is it convenient

102
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,280
for you to give me a lift?

103
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,680
Yes.

104
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,200
(Only for Express Delivery)
Here is your parcel.

105
00:05:12,356 --> 00:05:13,920
What is this?

106
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:39,920
Aren't you going up with me?

107
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,720
Go up first.

108
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,440
I'll be there shortly.

109
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:46,800
You claimed that Jinse
wouldn't misunderstand.

110
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
So

111
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:49,360
you still care.

112
00:05:58,412 --> 00:06:00,400
What on earth is this?

113
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:03,640
Ms. Song.

114
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,720
You're here.

115
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:09,520
I'm here to discuss
with you the auction.

116
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:10,960
Sure.

117
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:14,520
Why are you here?

118
00:06:19,615 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm here to discuss the details
of the auction with Jinse.

119
00:06:23,553 --> 00:06:24,440
Go on.

120
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:30,800
For this auction,

121
00:06:30,867 --> 00:06:31,680
the company will...

122
00:06:31,713 --> 00:06:32,680
Ms. Song.

123
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:35,800
Let me treat you to coffee.

124
00:06:35,932 --> 00:06:37,320
Let's talk somewhere else.

125
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,560
Sure.

126
00:06:46,846 --> 00:06:49,480
Mr. Mo and I have communicated
regarding the details of the auction.

127
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:51,000
I looked for you

128
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,320
to talk about this.

129
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,320
Okay.

130
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:58,640
You seem close to Sinian.

131
00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:01,840
We're childhood friends.

132
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,480
Of course we're close.

133
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:06,144
I remember that

134
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:07,800
he has insomnia.

135
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:11,000
I gave him a lavender teddy bear.

136
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:14,760
So the bear

137
00:07:14,824 --> 00:07:16,160
was from you.

138
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:19,760
So he still keeps it.

139
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,880
(So that's what's going on.)

140
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,520
Jinse.

141
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,280
I know what you're thinking.

142
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,800
Although

143
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:37,800
Sinian and I are engaged

144
00:07:37,861 --> 00:07:38,920
due to our families' arrangement,

145
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:40,080
actually,

146
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,640
I don't love him at all.

147
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,240
So you're the one

148
00:07:46,301 --> 00:07:47,800
he's engaged to.

149
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,360
Didn't he

150
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:51,680
tell you about it?

151
00:07:54,153 --> 00:07:55,000
It's understandable.

152
00:07:55,378 --> 00:07:56,680
Sinian

153
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,440
tends to keep everything to himself.

154
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,280
However, Jinse,

155
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,840
don't get the wrong idea.

156
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,880
I'm sure he truly loves you.

157
00:08:08,252 --> 00:08:09,080
I know.

158
00:08:09,821 --> 00:08:10,760
Thanks.

159
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,320
When did you come back?

160
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,120
I thought you'd end up spending
a long time with Song Jin.

161
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:31,240
So I came back early

162
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,400
to cook for you.

163
00:08:45,504 --> 00:08:46,720
You

164
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,040
met Song Jin today, didn't you?

165
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:56,720
I bumped into her on my way.

166
00:08:56,824 --> 00:08:58,600
So I fetched her to the company.

167
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,080
Did you?

168
00:09:01,323 --> 00:09:03,120
Can you explain

169
00:09:03,821 --> 00:09:06,240
why the teddy bear you gave me

170
00:09:06,486 --> 00:09:08,440
was from Song Jin?

171
00:09:09,338 --> 00:09:10,640
Teddy bear?

172
00:09:12,012 --> 00:09:14,880
Jing Xiangdong gave me
the teddy bear to cure my insomnia.

173
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:18,280
How did she know

174
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:20,240
the existence of the teddy bear?

175
00:09:22,643 --> 00:09:23,920
She's been to my place before,

176
00:09:24,249 --> 00:09:27,040
but she's there as Mr. Song
brought her over for a collaboration.

177
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,600
Was it for the collaboration

178
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,200
or was she there to be your fiancée?

179
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,880
Mo Sinian.

180
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:34,400
How long did you plan
to keep me in the dark?

181
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,440
Jinse.

182
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,160
I know

183
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,680
and I admit that I once lied to you.

184
00:09:43,827 --> 00:09:45,240
However, certain lies

185
00:09:45,904 --> 00:09:48,120
snowball once they start.

186
00:09:50,476 --> 00:09:52,000
Please trust me though.

187
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,960
There's nothing between me and Song Jin.

188
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,160
I only

189
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,240
love you throughout the time.

190
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:05,840
Mo Sinian.

191
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:08,160
I really...

192
00:10:09,393 --> 00:10:12,320
I seriously can't tell

193
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:16,400
whether you're lying or not.

194
