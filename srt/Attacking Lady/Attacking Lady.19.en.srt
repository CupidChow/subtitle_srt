3
00:01:08,747 --> 00:01:09,560
(Song Jin.)

4
00:01:10,421 --> 00:01:13,055
(You must get all
the shares of Song Cheng.)

5
00:01:16,707 --> 00:01:17,520
Bai Jinse.

6
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,200
Why are you here?

7
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,680
Are you here to silence him?

8
00:01:25,726 --> 00:01:27,701
I just want to visit Mr. Song.

9
00:01:30,273 --> 00:01:31,240
Bai Jinse,

10
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,000
Mo Sinian has broken up with you,

11
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,443
yet you're still dwelling on this.

12
00:01:38,443 --> 00:01:39,400
I advise you

13
00:01:39,492 --> 00:01:40,560
to know your place.

14
00:01:40,772 --> 00:01:42,360
Leave Bincheng soon

15
00:01:42,655 --> 00:01:43,880
to find another job.

16
00:01:45,858 --> 00:01:47,240
I didn't do anything wrong.

17
00:01:47,292 --> 00:01:48,880
Why must I leave Bincheng?

18
00:01:49,058 --> 00:01:51,360
How did Mr. Song fall down the stairs?

19
00:01:51,504 --> 00:01:53,560
I must get to the bottom of this.

20
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,440
I'm done being nice.

21
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:00,960
If you still won't leave,

22
00:02:04,784 --> 00:02:06,760
I'll ruin you.

23
00:02:11,646 --> 00:02:12,720
Listen up.

24
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,120
Without my permission,

25
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:15,760
no one is allowed to enter the ward.

26
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,640
I don't want

27
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,360
any unrelated person

28
00:02:19,529 --> 00:02:21,240
to disturb my father.

29
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
Yes, Ms. Song.

30
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,603
(Song Group, Song Cheng's company)

31
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:28,320
What?

32
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,018
Charity?

33
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,840
That's right,

34
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,840
according to your father's will,

35
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,040
after he dies, all his properties

36
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:37,600
will gone to charity.

37
00:02:42,224 --> 00:02:43,920
Do you mean

38
00:02:44,673 --> 00:02:46,640
if my father dies,

39
00:02:47,243 --> 00:02:50,920
I won't get anything from Song Group?

40
00:02:51,393 --> 00:02:53,120
From the legal point of view,

41
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,400
yes.

42
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:03,240
What can I do now?

43
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:04,800
Right now,

44
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,947
you can only pray that the chairman
will regain consciousness soon

45
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:09,560
and convince him to transfer
the shares to you personally.

46
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,547
Bai Jinse?

47
00:03:49,252 --> 00:03:50,320
Who let you in?

48
00:03:50,475 --> 00:03:51,230
I'll call the cops now.

49
00:03:51,249 --> 00:03:52,280
Get lost!

50
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:02,520
Get the doctor.

51
00:04:03,163 --> 00:04:05,080
Get the doctor!

52
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,938
Mr. Song.

53
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:18,627
You're awake.

54
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:22,760
Jin'er.

55
00:04:25,778 --> 00:04:27,360
Why am I here?

56
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:34,680
Who is she?

57
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:36,600
I...

58
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:39,880
I'm Bai Jinse.

59
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,480
Father.

60
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,400
I saw her pushing you off the stairs.

61
00:04:45,563 --> 00:04:46,680
Think carefully

62
00:04:46,756 --> 00:04:47,640
and tell me later.

63
00:04:47,713 --> 00:04:49,089
I'll make sure she's in jail!

64
00:04:52,618 --> 00:04:53,840
However,

65
00:04:54,178 --> 00:04:56,320
I don't remember this girl.

66
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,640
Bai Jinse,

67
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:01,400
if you refuse to go out,

68
00:05:01,455 --> 00:05:03,316
I'll get someone to drag you out!

69
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:06,880
You don't have to.

70
00:05:07,184 --> 00:05:08,520
I'll leave on my own.

71
00:05:10,498 --> 00:05:12,120
Take good care of yourself.

72
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,227
The chairman lost his memory temporarily

73
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:27,440
and might go into a coma anytime.

74
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,880
It's not looking good.

75
00:05:33,455 --> 00:05:34,320
Father.

76
00:05:34,932 --> 00:05:36,040
Are you feeling better?

77
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:37,840
Yes.

78
00:05:40,704 --> 00:05:41,320
Father.

79
00:05:41,803 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm here today

80
00:05:43,273 --> 00:05:44,560
to talk to you about something.

81
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,243
What is it?

82
00:05:49,043 --> 00:05:49,913
Look,

83
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:51,640
you're unwell now.

84
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,289
The company needs a leader.

85
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
I'm wondering

86
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:57,160
whether you can transfer

87
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,440
your shares in the group to me.

88
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,160
Father.

89
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,480
I'm your own daughter.

90
00:06:04,107 --> 00:06:05,200
In the future,

91
00:06:05,335 --> 00:06:07,800
you'll entrust the company to me too.

92
00:06:08,843 --> 00:06:09,960
Therefore,

93
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,640
please sign this.

94
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,760
You're right.

95
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,000
My child is all grown up.

96
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:43,520
Thank you, father.

97
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,640
By the way,

98
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:49,600
I'm marrying Mo Sinian soon.

99
00:06:53,716 --> 00:06:55,800
I shall get well soon

100
00:06:56,098 --> 00:06:57,360
so that I can be discharged

101
00:06:57,621 --> 00:06:59,240
for your wedding.

102
00:07:00,181 --> 00:07:01,400
Rest well.

103
00:07:01,532 --> 00:07:02,480
I'll visit you again.

104
00:07:15,756 --> 00:07:16,440
Ms. Song.

105
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,750
Congratulations for being engaged.

106
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:32,480
Where are you?

107
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,040
I'm here.

108
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,560
Bai Jinse.

109
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:03,080
What are you doing here?

110
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,560
How about

111
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:06,440
I call the cops to arrest you?

112
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:07,600
Call the cops?

113
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:09,800
Would you dare?

114
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,000
Did you think you'd know my every move

115
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,960
if you installed
surveillance in my watch?

116
00:08:17,353 --> 00:08:18,560
However, thank you

117
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:21,360
for giving me an alibi.

118
00:08:23,144 --> 00:08:24,560
So what if you have an alibi?

119
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:29,480
Today is my engagement
ceremony with Mo Sinian.

120
00:08:29,716 --> 00:08:31,000
You're not welcomed.

121
00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:33,680
I said I'd marry Song Group's heiress.

122
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,040
What do you mean?

123
00:08:39,172 --> 00:08:41,760
You know your own identity.

124
00:08:45,532 --> 00:08:47,107
I don't know what you're talking about.

125
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:50,560
Kick this woman out!

126
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,560
You're the one who should be out!

127
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,550
