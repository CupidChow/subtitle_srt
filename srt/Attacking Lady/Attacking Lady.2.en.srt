=Episode 2=

3
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,236
(Mo Sinian's home)
We're in a cooperative relationship.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My grandfather has a
share in the family estate.

5
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,000
This share

6
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,960
is enough to influence who
the future heir will be.

7
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Only after I get married,

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,400
I can inherit this inheritance.

9
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,120
If you have extraordinary ability,

10
00:01:01,852 --> 00:01:04,080
Hengrui Jewellery will
help you with your career.

11
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,040
I have something else to do.

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,920
Once you've decided,

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,080
contact me anytime.

14
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,240
What is going on?

15
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,240
Why is his house so empty?

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,480
Mr. Mo.

17
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:31,200
Mr. Mo.

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,910
Did you just move to this house?

19
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,190
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,000
I didn't prepare any housewarming gift.

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,560
I have lived here all along.

22
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,520
Take a look at the contract.

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,600
Okay.

24
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:50,849
We're in a cooperative relationship.

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,240
We won't be sleeping together.

26
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:53,640
Sleeping together?

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
No way.

28
00:01:56,436 --> 00:01:58,240
Please keep your word, Mr. Mo.

29
00:02:01,276 --> 00:02:02,320
Since you've signed the contract,

30
00:02:02,827 --> 00:02:04,360
stop calling me Mr. Mo.

31
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,476
What should I call you?

32
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,560
What do you think?

33
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,720
Read the contract yourself.

34
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,600
The second last page.

35
00:02:12,683 --> 00:02:13,280
At the back.

36
00:02:15,809 --> 00:02:18,240
(Call each other "honey" from now on.)

37
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,200
This is...

38
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,070
Mr. Mo.

39
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,960
Don't worry.

40
00:02:28,307 --> 00:02:30,480
I'll cooperate with you when necessary.

41
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,720
I asked you to come today

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,720
to let you familiarise
yourself with this house.

43
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:36,680
This will also be your home from now on.

44
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,400
At the same time, I also hope that

45
00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:41,320
your arrival can bring Hengrui Jewellery

46
00:02:41,947 --> 00:02:43,960
some refreshing design concepts.

47
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,800
There is an important
point you need to know.

48
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:49,160
I hope that during the cooperation,

49
00:02:49,695 --> 00:02:50,760
Ms. Bai,

50
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,600
please control your emotions.

51
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Don't fall in love with me.

52
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,440
Don't worry, Mr. Mo.

53
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:07,180
(Haitian Jewellery,
Zheng Huaichen's company)

54
00:03:07,206 --> 00:03:07,880
Mr. Zheng.

55
00:03:08,283 --> 00:03:09,080
We have a problem.

56
00:03:09,495 --> 00:03:10,978
Calm down. Behave yourself.

57
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,655
What's going on?

58
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:13,720
Ms. Bai’s design draft was
said to be plagiarised.

59
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:15,440
It's all over the Internet.

60
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:18,040
(Huaichen)

61
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,350
Mr. Mo.

62
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,009
This is my design draft.

63
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,640
(Dad, I'm home.)

64
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:47,800
(Jinse,)

65
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,652
(Let's hold a press conference.)

66
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:52,160
(Please clarify this incident
for me in front of reporters.)

67
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,960
Ms. Bai Jinse,

68
00:03:57,116 --> 00:03:59,258
you've plagiarised
Ms. Bai Linlin’s design draft.

69
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,650
How are you going to apologise to her?

70
00:04:03,298 --> 00:04:04,400
What if I say that

71
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:06,646
it was Bai Linlin who copied my design?

72
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,901
Bai Linlin copied her design.

73
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:13,360
Jinse,

74
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
for the sake of our future...

75
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,000
My future.

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,984
You're not a part of it.

77
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:21,009
Zheng Huaichen cheated
on me with Bai Linlin.

78
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,800
And Bai Linlin stole my design draft
to participate in the last competition.

79
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,578
I have uploaded all
the evidence to Weibo.

80
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,480
Please search and watch it yourself.

81
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,938
These people are shameless.

82
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,280
So the champion of the last
competition was Bai Jinse.

83
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,760
This concludes today's press conference.

84
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,640
Come with me.

85
00:04:49,144 --> 00:04:50,040
Zheng Huaichen,

86
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,800
our relationship is over.

87
00:04:52,587 --> 00:04:54,320
Bai Jinse,

88
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,960
you're despicable.

89
00:04:55,987 --> 00:04:57,640
I'll beat you to death today.

90
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,760
Mo Sinian.

91
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,560
It's Mo Sinian.

92
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,360
Mr. Mo.

93
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,520
What are you doing here?

94
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,243
I hereby announce that

95
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,480
Bai Jinse is joining Hengrui Jewellery.

96
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,240
From now on,

97
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,880
she is one of my people.

98
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:30,080
Bai Linlin plagiarised
our designer’s work.

99
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,440
We will take legal action against her.

100
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,480
From now on,

101
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,796
Hengrui Jewellery will cease all
dealings with Haitian Jewellery.

102
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,640
Let's go.

103
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,400
Bai Jinse,

104
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
if you come back,

105
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,760
I will divorce Linlin immediately.

106
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,520
Zheng Huaichen!

107
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,101
Zheng Huaichen!

108
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,800
You're a cruel man.

109
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,600
I've been in a relationship
with you for so long.

110
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,196
Sister,

111
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,960
please listen to my explanation.

112
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,120
It was him!

113
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,120
Zheng Huaichen.

114
00:06:07,572 --> 00:06:08,713
He seduced me first.

115
00:06:11,141 --> 00:06:12,270
Who made the first move.

116
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,600
Does it matter?

117
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,680
Sister,

118
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,209
you can hit me.

119
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,058
No matter what you
do, I won't fight back.

120
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:20,815
Sister.

121
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,560
You asked me to hit you.

122
00:06:29,793 --> 00:06:30,560
She's despicable.

123
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,778
Ms. Bai,

124
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,200
let's go.

125
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,360
(I hereby announce that)

126
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:46,046
(Bai Jinse is joining
Hengrui Jewellery.)

127
00:06:46,141 --> 00:06:47,138
(From now on,)

128
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,793
(she is one of my people.)

129
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,120
Mr. Mo.

130
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,360
Thank you.

131
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,240
You don't need to thank me.

132
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,560
I merely fulfilled my promise.

133
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,760
Just drop me on the roadside later.

134
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,040
I've fulfilled my promise.

135
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,280
I hope you can also fulfil your promise

136
00:07:26,892 --> 00:07:27,920
and go home with me.

137
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,630
I will go home with you.

138
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,480
However,

139
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,450
I have to go back to Bai's
Residence to get something.

140
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,800
What do you need?

141
00:07:35,898 --> 00:07:37,920
Just make a list and give
it to Jing Xiangdong.

142
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,480
Mr. Mo.

143
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,000
I have to go back there.

144
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,640
Is two hours enough?

145
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,720
Yes.

146
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
I'll go back to my office first.

147
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,880
Call me once you're done.

148
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,600
Okay.

149
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,040
are you really leaving?

150
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,000
Aren't you two hoping that

151
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:12,960
I leave this family?

152
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:14,320
If you really want to leave,

153
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:15,800
you should have dinner at home

154
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:17,480
before leaving.

155
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,760
Where is the doll my mom gave me?

156
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,800
Let’s talk after dinner.

157
00:08:36,353 --> 00:08:37,320
Jinse,

158
00:08:37,532 --> 00:08:39,560
I know your sister has let you down.

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,320
You are aware of her relationship
with Zheng Huaichen, right?

160
00:08:48,716 --> 00:08:49,360
Jinse,

161
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
it's all our fault.

162
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,280
Linlin,

163
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,680
apologise to your sister.

164
00:08:58,624 --> 00:08:59,520
Sister,

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,793
I was wrong.

166
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,240
You've hit me

167
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,720
and scolded me.

168
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Can you just forgive me?

169
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,280
Jinse,

170
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,532
your sister has apologised.

171
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,680
Can you just

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,240
consider this sisterhood

173
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,680
and forgive your sister?

174
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,760
It is the company's decision to
take legal action against her.

175
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,000
I have no right to interfere with it.

176
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,880
Why are you so immature?

177
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,880
You don't even listen to your dad now.

178
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,920
Dad,

179
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,800
I've finished eating.

180
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,320
Dad,

181
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,000
I think she is a little tired
from overworking lately.

182
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,120
How about this?

183
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,280
You go back and rest first.

184
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,680
Let me take care of her.

185
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,160
Bai Jinse,

186
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,480
I thought you'd become smarter now.

187
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,480
(Don't you like taking photos secretly?)

188
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,440
(I will also let you taste the feeling
of being secretly photographed.)

189
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:39,010
♪That person who often
