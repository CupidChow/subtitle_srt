=Attacking Lady=

2
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,960
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,600
Didn't expect, did you?

4
00:00:46,944 --> 00:00:48,640
Even if I'm kicked out by Hengrui,

5
00:00:48,775 --> 00:00:51,000
I'll continue to haunt you.

6
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,480
I don't get it.

7
00:00:58,181 --> 00:00:59,960
Why do you keep targeting me?

8
00:01:00,335 --> 00:01:01,440
I've never offended you in any way.

9
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,480
Are you sure?

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,267
Before you came,

11
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,273
I was the chief designer
of this company.

12
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,840
However, after you came,

13
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,640
everything revolves around you!

14
00:01:11,596 --> 00:01:13,360
We rely on our capability.

15
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:14,480
Let your work

16
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,760
do the talking instead.

17
00:01:18,655 --> 00:01:19,800
Bai Jinse,

18
00:01:20,393 --> 00:01:22,581
they're just temporarily
curious about you

19
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:25,080
as you're young and beautiful.

20
00:01:25,203 --> 00:01:26,120
So?

21
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:34,640
You rely on your
so-called capability, right?

22
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,480
Let's see how you can survive

23
00:01:37,523 --> 00:01:39,200
without this seductive face!

24
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,080
- Mr. Mo.
- Are you all right?

25
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:51,720
Feng Xiaoxi.

26
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,230
I thought of sparing you
as you'd been working

27
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,360
at Hengrui for many years,

28
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,000
but after what happened today,

29
00:01:59,384 --> 00:02:01,240
I'll surely call the cops.

30
00:02:06,384 --> 00:02:07,640
Your hand is injured.

31
00:02:20,843 --> 00:02:25,390
(Feng Xiaoxi is detained by
the police for the attempted crime.)

32
00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:34,880
Mr. Mo.

33
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,200
I'm sorry

34
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,120
for causing your hand to be injured.

35
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,600
Just be responsible for it.

36
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,920
Scratch my back.

37
00:03:07,744 --> 00:03:08,880
Higher.

38
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:11,560
Lower.

39
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,840
Are you done?

40
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,040
Wait.

41
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,800
Do you smell

42
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,640
anything unusual?

43
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,120
Don't tell me

44
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,320
again that

45
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:31,040
I have a weird smell.

46
00:03:31,313 --> 00:03:32,840
I mean whether

47
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,040
I smell

48
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,400
bad.

49
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,320
How about this?

50
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,840
Bathe me.

51
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,520
Mr. Mo,

52
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,520
don't go too far.

53
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,080
Mr. Mo.

54
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,880
Your hand has recovered, hasn't it?

55
00:04:12,203 --> 00:04:13,760
I think so.

56
00:04:20,221 --> 00:04:21,200
Jinse.

57
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,680
I'll go to bed now.

58
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,560
Hello, mother.

59
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,400
(See you at 8pm)

60
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,560
(at Cuifeng Pavilion.)

61
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,160
Dress well.

62
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,080
Mr. Wang.

63
00:05:46,107 --> 00:05:47,880
Thanks for supporting our company.

64
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,120
May we have better cooperation.

65
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:50,960
Sure.

66
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,520
See you.

67
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:09,015
Senior.

68
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,120
It's indeed you.

69
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:22,230
(Bincheng University,
Bai Jinse's alma mater)

70
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,840
Senior.

71
00:07:22,886 --> 00:07:23,920
Why are you here?

72
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:25,360
I thought you're in France.

73
00:07:25,563 --> 00:07:27,240
Something happened to my family.

74
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:30,320
I needed to handle
many things at the company.

75
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,760
I also thought

76
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:33,080
it's time for me to come back.

77
00:07:34,547 --> 00:07:35,760
It's been years.

78
00:07:35,864 --> 00:07:38,040
I didn't expect to bump into you here.

79
00:07:38,135 --> 00:07:39,320
I also didn't expect

80
00:07:39,396 --> 00:07:40,800
to see you upon my return.

81
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:45,920
By the way, Jinse,

82
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,040
are you still designing jewellery?

83
00:07:50,415 --> 00:07:51,160
Great.

84
00:07:51,843 --> 00:07:53,840
I remember that this
used to be your dream

85
00:07:54,055 --> 00:07:55,480
and you're talented in this.

86
00:07:56,806 --> 00:07:58,440
Thanks, senior, for your compliment.

87
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:01,840
Are you

88
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,080
interested in joining my company?

89
00:08:05,024 --> 00:08:05,880
I just returned to China

90
00:08:06,203 --> 00:08:08,040
and I hope to have your support.

91
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,640
Thanks, senior, for your trust,

92
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,720
but

93
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,520
I'm with another company now.

94
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:17,480
Jinse.

95
00:08:18,286 --> 00:08:19,240
You've changed.

96
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:21,440
You've learnt to say no.

97
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,240
It's good.

98
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:28,320
You should've done this long ago.

99
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,080
I'm happy for you.

100
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:32,880
Senior.

101
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,920
How had you been doing in France?

102
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,600
It's good.

103
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,400
It's just that sometimes,

104
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:42,720
I felt lonely.

105
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,200
When I was in France,

106
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:50,000
I kept thinking of our past.

107
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,316
Certain things

108
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:55,686
are regrettable.

109
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,480
This is inevitable.

110
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:02,160
It's good

111
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,520
to see you again.

112
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,160
(I suddenly have a meeting.)

113
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:24,200
Are you waiting for someone?

114
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:25,920
Yes,

115
00:09:26,175 --> 00:09:27,120
but he

116
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:28,200
suddenly has something on

117
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:29,560
and can't show up.

118
00:09:31,556 --> 00:09:32,640
Let's pick today then.

119
00:09:33,283 --> 00:09:34,320
This shall be my treat.

120
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:39,840
All right.

121
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:53,840
Where did you go?

122
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,520
Why did you come back so late?

123
00:09:57,372 --> 00:09:59,080
When I was waiting for you at the hotel,

124
00:09:59,113 --> 00:10:00,920
I bumped into my senior
at the university.

125
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,280
We had a meal.

126
00:10:02,606 --> 00:10:04,080
You're Mrs. Mo now.

127
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,941
I hope that you'll watch

128
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,560
your image when you're out there.

129
00:10:09,683 --> 00:10:10,440
Okay.

130
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,720
I'll keep the right distance.

131
00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:14,920
Starting today,

132
00:10:15,587 --> 00:10:17,960
you must brief me
about your whereabouts.

133
00:10:19,006 --> 00:10:19,827
I have to brief you?

134
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,280
It's stated clearly in the contract that

135
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:22,960
when it's necessary,

136
00:10:23,396 --> 00:10:24,760
you should tell me
about your whereabouts

137
00:10:25,553 --> 00:10:27,267
to prevent any untoward incident.

138
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,560
Noted.

139
00:10:38,686 --> 00:10:39,600
Where are you going?

140
00:10:41,366 --> 00:10:42,480
I'm going to work.

141
00:10:42,535 --> 00:10:43,840
Where else?

142
00:10:44,273 --> 00:10:45,040
Go on.

143
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,240
Why are you in a rush?

144
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
You're so nosy.

145
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,520
The contract states...

146
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,350
I'm going to the washroom.

147
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,360
Are you?

148
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,730
What are you taking sneakily?

149
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:05,200
Show me.

150
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,360
Mr. Mo, look carefully

151
00:11:09,923 --> 00:11:11,240
what top secret this is.

152
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,920
Brief him?

153
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:24,800
Yes.

154
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:27,280
He even wants me to brief him
when I go to the washroom now.

155
00:11:28,532 --> 00:11:30,040
If you asked me,

156
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:33,135
he's probably jealous

157
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,480
as you had a meal with Qin Wuduan.

158
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:36,600
Would he be jealous?

159
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,720
Your relationship
started over a contract,

160
00:11:40,073 --> 00:11:41,160
but it could've led

161
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,360
to love at the destination.

162
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,440
In my opinion,

163
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:45,840
since he cares about you,

164
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:48,760
Mr. Mo has fallen for you.

165
00:11:56,843 --> 00:11:57,498
He

166
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:00,055
