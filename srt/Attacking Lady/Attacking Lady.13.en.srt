00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,960
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,320
I thought we'd find a clue

4
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,920
by coming to the hospital.

5
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,120
All right.

6
00:01:02,778 --> 00:01:03,320
However,

7
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:05,600
it's my first time in the city
where I was born.

8
00:01:05,873 --> 00:01:07,880
Since you're so thoughtful,

9
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:09,560
let me bring you to a nice place.

10
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,960
Come on.

11
00:01:16,495 --> 00:01:17,520
Where are we?

12
00:01:17,809 --> 00:01:19,600
This is the street food
which can be found

13
00:01:19,636 --> 00:01:20,600
in every city.

14
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:21,861
I want you to experience it.

15
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,000
What is this?

16
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,520
Beef entrails.

17
00:01:37,587 --> 00:01:38,520
Is it edible?

18
00:02:12,778 --> 00:02:13,840
What's the matter?

19
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:16,680
Mo

20
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,353
posted a photo with
Bai Jinse on Moments.

21
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,880
It's my first time

22
00:02:20,938 --> 00:02:23,360
seeing him posting a personal photo
with someone else on Moments.

23
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:25,040
This is really rare.

24
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,880
Mr. Mo looks

25
00:02:26,926 --> 00:02:28,200
quite handsome.

26
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:20,520
Look.

27
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:24,120
We're already together.

28
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:27,120
Can I hold you as we sleep?

29
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:38,040
No.

30
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:43,520
We're legally married now,

31
00:03:44,538 --> 00:03:47,000
but you didn't marry me for real.

32
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,240
What are you doing?

33
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,880
However,

34
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,680
I can hold you as I sleep.

35
00:05:14,498 --> 00:05:16,480
Why am I always at a disadvantage?

36
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,040
Aunt.

37
00:06:01,132 --> 00:06:02,400
It's my first time here.

38
00:06:02,507 --> 00:06:04,320
I prepared some gifts for you.

39
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,080
Please accept them.

40
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,120
Thanks,

41
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:08,584
a prominent family like us

42
00:06:08,596 --> 00:06:09,680
has everything.

43
00:06:09,713 --> 00:06:11,080
Ms. Bai, when you leave,

44
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:12,240
bring them back with you.

45
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:17,880
Mother.

46
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,120
We're hungry.

47
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:20,160
Let's eat.

48
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,600
All right.

49
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,520
Thanks.

50
00:06:37,504 --> 00:06:40,080
How can you let the guest use
the bowl and chopsticks of the family?

51
00:06:40,593 --> 00:06:41,240
Madam Wu.

52
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:43,000
Use the bowl and chopsticks for guests.

53
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:50,960
Come on,

54
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:52,000
try this.

55
00:06:57,547 --> 00:06:58,600
Ms. Bai.

56
00:06:58,772 --> 00:06:59,680
I heard

57
00:06:59,704 --> 00:07:01,080
that you're an orphan.

58
00:07:02,344 --> 00:07:04,000
I was raised by the Bai family.

59
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:06,960
Ms. Bai, you should know that

60
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:09,480
the Qin family is not
just any other family.

61
00:07:10,427 --> 00:07:11,800
A couple

62
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:14,320
should always be compatible
in terms of wealth.

63
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,560
I

64
00:07:15,996 --> 00:07:17,760
don't place importance on this,

65
00:07:18,249 --> 00:07:19,089
but

66
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:21,280
I need to know your family background.

67
00:07:22,603 --> 00:07:23,520
Mother.

68
00:07:23,846 --> 00:07:24,846
I'm

69
00:07:24,873 --> 00:07:27,000
finding Jinse's biological parents now.

70
00:07:27,027 --> 00:07:28,480
I'm talking to Ms. Bai.

71
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,960
Don't interrupt us.

72
00:07:32,483 --> 00:07:33,120
Ms. Bai.

73
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,643
I heard you had
an ambiguous relationship

74
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,840
with my eldest son.

75
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:39,120
Mother.

76
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:41,440
Who did you hear it from?

77
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,396
Jin'er.

78
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:43,840
What a pity.

79
00:07:43,876 --> 00:07:45,720
You almost became my daughter-in-law,

80
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,120
but I can't interfere in
his freedom of marriage.

81
00:07:51,498 --> 00:07:53,080
It's okay, Aunt Mo.

82
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:54,840
Thanks for thinking about me.

83
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:57,920
Perhaps Sinian and I

84
00:07:58,261 --> 00:08:00,440
are not meant to be together.

85
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:01,600
Yes.

86
00:08:01,646 --> 00:08:02,880
However, speaking of this,

87
00:08:03,606 --> 00:08:06,360
I know a little about the woman

88
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,104
Sinian is going to marry.

89
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,040
Do you?

90
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,560
Although

91
00:08:13,806 --> 00:08:16,280
it's kind of inappropriate to
talk about one behind her back,

92
00:08:16,403 --> 00:08:16,880
but

93
00:08:16,923 --> 00:08:18,360
you're Sinian's mother.

94
00:08:18,526 --> 00:08:20,560
I think you should be aware of it.

95
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:21,960
Bai,

96
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,480
the designer,

97
00:08:24,147 --> 00:08:26,640
had a relationship with Wuduan.

98
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,720
What?

99
00:08:28,378 --> 00:08:30,200
She dated Wuduan?

100
00:08:30,224 --> 00:08:31,880
They're at the same university.

101
00:08:32,273 --> 00:08:33,600
Before I returned to the country,

102
00:08:33,738 --> 00:08:35,760
I heard that Sinian and Wuduan

103
00:08:35,793 --> 00:08:37,538
fought incessantly.

104
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,640
Perhaps

105
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:41,040
it's because of this woman.

106
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:43,080
Jinse and Qin Wuduan

107
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,040
are just senior and
junior at the university.

108
00:08:46,356 --> 00:08:48,360
There's no intimate relationship at all.

109
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,080
What a coincidence.

110
00:08:51,424 --> 00:08:52,852
First, it's my eldest son.

111
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,744
Then, it's my second son.

112
00:08:56,064 --> 00:08:59,280
Ms. Bai, I wonder whether you're
really destined to meet the Qin family

113
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:01,400
or did you purposely get close to us?

114
00:09:01,658 --> 00:09:02,347
Mother.

115
00:09:02,981 --> 00:09:04,040
What are you talking about?

116
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:05,440
Sinian.

117
00:09:05,516 --> 00:09:07,000
Marriage is not a game.

118
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,480
Aunt.

119
00:09:10,335 --> 00:09:12,455
I'm a little unwell.

120
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,360
I'll go now.

121
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:16,840
My apologies.

122
00:09:17,446 --> 00:09:18,360
Jinse.

123
00:09:20,073 --> 00:09:22,240
You just came back.

124
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:25,080
Keep your mother company.

125
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:32,800
Look,

126
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:34,800
she's simply rude.

127
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,720
Mother.

128
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,640
Since Jinse entered,

129
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,200
you'd been rude to her.

130
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,280
She actually

131
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:45,640
bade you farewell nicely.

132
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:47,560
She's considered polite.

133
00:09:48,575 --> 00:09:50,520
What's wrong with you, mother?

134
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,800
This girl

135
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,840
had an ambiguous relationship
with your brother earlier on.

136
00:09:53,852 --> 00:09:54,480
Did you know that?

137
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:55,200
I did,

138
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,960
but it's not like what you think.

139
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,880
What is it then?

140
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,680
Sinian.

141
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,680
You're still young.

142
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:01,280
You could be fooled easily!

143
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,600
I object to this marriage!

144
00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:10,760
I don't care whether
you agree to our union,

145
00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:14,040
we're legally married anyway.

146
00:10:16,526 --> 00:10:17,800
It's late.

147
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,200
Goodbye.

148
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,680
You didn't have dinner, did you?

149
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,760
I brought food for you.

150
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,520
I'm not hungry.

151
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,360
My mother isn't usually like that.

152
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,800
She might have misunderstood you.

153
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,440
You don't have to apologise.

155
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,600
I think she did that

156
00:11:00,907 --> 00:11:02,520
out of her love for you.

157
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,280
I'm glad that you understand that.

158
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:12,680
I...

159
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,360
I'm tired.

160
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,520
I'll go to bed now.

161
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,000
Hello.

162
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:56,840
