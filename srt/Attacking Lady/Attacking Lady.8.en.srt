3
00:00:43,055 --> 00:00:45,640
(Is he jealous
because you had a meal)

4
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:46,600
(with Qin Wuduan?)

5
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,880
"Are you free tonight?

6
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,040
There's a jewellery gala tonight.

7
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,960
Many prominent
jewellers will be present.

8
00:00:58,003 --> 00:00:59,760
I'll introduce some
of them to you."

9
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,920
Mr. Mo.

10
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:08,880
Take a seat.

11
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,440
Mr. Mo.

12
00:01:13,803 --> 00:01:17,000
My university's senior invited
me to a jewellery gala tonight.

13
00:01:17,295 --> 00:01:18,600
Would you

14
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:20,960
be free to go with me?

15
00:01:24,473 --> 00:01:25,440
I won't be free.

16
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,400
Count me out.

17
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:33,880
Fine.

18
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:36,160
Just report to me when it's over.

19
00:01:39,803 --> 00:01:41,560
There was a married
couple in the gala.

20
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,320
The man

21
00:01:42,338 --> 00:01:44,640
is a jeweller that
I met in France.

22
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,480
The woman

23
00:01:45,535 --> 00:01:47,760
is a famous jewellery designer.

24
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,160
They've joined forces
in the same field.

25
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,760
I truly envy them.

26
00:01:55,624 --> 00:01:56,560
What's on your mind?

27
00:01:58,907 --> 00:02:00,520
Nothing. I'm sorry.

28
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,880
Recently, I've been trying to

29
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,160
acquire Hualan and Lunyao

30
00:02:04,218 --> 00:02:06,160
with the stake that I bought.

31
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,000
If I succeed,

32
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,880
the woman I love

33
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,560
will become the owner of
the largest jeweller in town.

34
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,280
Congratulations to that person.

35
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,480
Jinse.

36
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,560
Have you thought of

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,440
designing couple rings yourself

38
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,360
for the man you love the most

39
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,360
and who also loves

40
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,040
and deserves you?

41
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,560
What are you doing here?

42
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,200
Did you have a great time

43
00:02:57,406 --> 00:02:58,480
with your university's senior?

44
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,320
Did you stay until
now just to ask me this?

45
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,960
I'm tired. I shall
report to you tomorrow.

46
00:03:10,784 --> 00:03:12,520
Just report to me now.

47
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:16,092
During the jewellery gala,

48
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:17,243
he introduced me

49
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:19,080
to a famous couple in design.

50
00:03:19,252 --> 00:03:23,040
He told me that he wants to
acqure Hualan and Lunyao, too.

51
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:34,960
By the way,

52
00:03:35,307 --> 00:03:36,480
he even asked me

53
00:03:36,556 --> 00:03:37,840
whether I'm interested

54
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,480
to design a set of couple rings.

55
00:03:40,363 --> 00:03:42,160
However, this is a fake marriage.

56
00:03:42,876 --> 00:03:44,760
I don't think it's necessary.

57
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:59,340
"The Qin family, the
richest in Bincheng"

58
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:01,840
How is that possible?

59
00:04:02,046 --> 00:04:04,320
This is completely off
from the estimated price.

60
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,880
How could there be
such a huge difference?

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,480
Something must've gone wrong.

62
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,520
Just find it out, now!

63
00:04:08,858 --> 00:04:10,880
I want to know
everything about him!

64
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,800
Wuduan!

65
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,280
Mum.

66
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,000
"Qin Wuduan"

67
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,200
Hello.

68
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:32,040
Wuduan.

69
00:04:32,181 --> 00:04:34,000
"Jinse

70
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,040
I feel upset."

71
00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:38,240
All you all right?

72
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,970
"Time Party"

73
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:05,640
Why have you got drunk, Wuduan?

74
00:05:09,873 --> 00:05:10,953
Jinse

75
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,600
What's the matter?

76
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,000
I have feelings for you.

77
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,040
I had a crush on you
during university!

78
00:05:33,486 --> 00:05:35,880
It's a thing od the past, Wuduan.

79
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,320
Aren't you married now?

80
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,440
I'm married?

81
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,120
With whom?

82
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,280
When did I get married?

83
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,969
(I just got your gift

84
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,280
on my birthday.

85
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,436
Does Qin Wuduan really like her?

86
00:05:58,593 --> 00:06:01,360
Isn't he already engaged?

87
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,600
So what?

88
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,120
Even so, it's fine
for him to love her.

89
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,280
Our classmates
have spread the news

90
00:06:08,766 --> 00:06:10,640
that the son of the
Qin family is engaged.

91
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,080
That's my younger brother, not me.

92
00:06:16,116 --> 00:06:17,000
Jinse.

93
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,880
All this while,

94
00:06:19,227 --> 00:06:21,720
you're the only woman I love.

95
00:06:25,027 --> 00:06:25,840
So

96
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,230
you refused to see me

97
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,920
because of this?

98
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:33,120
Is it because

99
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,560
of this misunderstanding?

100
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:37,520
Wuduan.

101
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,843
It's a thing of the past.

102
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,320
No, it's not!

103
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,920
Let me tell you, Jinse.

104
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,280
Do you know how much I miss you

105
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,046
while I was in France?

106
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,360
I missed you every day!

107
00:06:56,387 --> 00:06:57,760
I wondered why

108
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,840
you refused...

109
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,640
Why you refused to see me?

110
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,000
Jinse.

111
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,320
Do you know that you're the
most unforgettable woman for me?

112
00:07:11,286 --> 00:07:12,200
Wuduan.

113
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:14,649
I...

114
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:17,633
I already have a boyfriend.

115
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,520
I don't believe you.

116
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:24,120
I don't believe you.

117
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,320
Jinse.

118
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,720
I love you.

119
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,120
Jinse.

120
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:30,320
Jinse.

121
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,529
Wuduan!

122
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,440
You're drunk, Wuduan!

123
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,200
Wuduan.

124
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,720
I'll never see you again.

125
00:07:59,987 --> 00:08:01,080
Why are you here?

126
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:03,520
You should go home.

127
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,000
Where have you been?

128
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:09,400
Are you going to check
on me all the time?

129
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,720
I just asked you
where you've been.

130
00:08:23,695 --> 00:08:25,080
Why?

131
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:28,240
Why'd you care?

132
00:08:30,181 --> 00:08:31,640
What stated in the agreement is...

133
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,880
