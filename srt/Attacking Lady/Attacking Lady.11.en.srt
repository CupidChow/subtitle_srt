Yes.

5
00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:46,760
Jing Xiangdong said that

6
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
although Mo Sinian

7
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,720
wanted to use your relationship
with Qin Wuduan at first,

8
00:00:50,886 --> 00:00:53,080
but later he realised that

9
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:54,840
he'd fallen for you.

10
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:56,560
He initially

11
00:00:56,584 --> 00:00:59,080
wanted to come clean to you
on Valentine's Day night.

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,040
but he didn't know how to tell you.

♪Our shadows grow apart♪

14
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:07,800
(No wonder.)

15
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,640
I think you should
give him another chance.

16
00:01:14,673 --> 00:01:15,760
Got it.

17
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:16,760

I think you're faring much better now.

34
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:43,640
I've figured out certain things.

35
00:02:45,175 --> 00:02:46,080
What is it?

36
00:02:47,172 --> 00:02:48,360
I realise that

37
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,160
as time went on,

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,840
my feelings for Mo Sinian

39
00:02:53,095 --> 00:02:54,760
wasn't just disappointment,

40
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,920
but it's also mixed

41
00:02:57,215 --> 00:02:58,640
with affection.

42
00:03:00,141 --> 00:03:01,840
That day, Jing Xiangdong said that

43
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:03,800
on Valentine's Day night,

44
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:05,920
he wanted to confess his love to me.

45
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,160
Therefore, I think

46
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:11,040
I should find out how he feels.

47
00:03:11,855 --> 00:03:12,800
Well,

48
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:15,360
what if he deceives you again?

49
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:19,240
Love is meant for the brave.

50
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:20,560
If I remain timid,

51
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,440
I'll end up losing.

52
00:03:25,052 --> 00:03:26,200
Do you plan to look for him?

53
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:28,640
Yes.

54
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,040
I want a closure.

55
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:37,160
Mo.

56
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:38,920
The voting for tomorrow
is extremely important.

57
00:03:39,196 --> 00:03:40,640
You should pull yourself together.

58
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,680
Just put love

59
00:03:42,064 --> 00:03:42,760
aside for now.

60
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,400
I'll go now.

61
00:03:53,636 --> 00:03:54,320
Hello, Jinse.

62
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:56,240
Let's meet up

63
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,840
tomorrow noon.

64
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:01,400
Tomorrow noon...

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,640
At tomorrow noon, let's

66
00:04:08,747 --> 00:04:10,720
meet at the cafe below the company.

67
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,680
Okay.

68
00:04:28,987 --> 00:04:29,880
Well,

69
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,840
Jinse,

70
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:39,787
I've made up my mind.

71
00:04:39,843 --> 00:04:42,080
Even if I'm not elected today,

72
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,160
for your sake,

73
00:04:43,212 --> 00:04:44,520
I can't leave just like that.

74
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,640
Senior,

75
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,000
no matter what,

76
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,440
it's impossible between us.

77
00:04:59,876 --> 00:05:02,620
(Qin Group, Mo Sinian's family business)

78
00:05:02,707 --> 00:05:04,532
(Mo Sinian. Ballot Box.)

79
00:05:04,593 --> 00:05:06,363
(Qin Wuduan. Ballot Box.)

80
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,264
Mr. Qin, I'm counting
on you in the future.

81
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,240
Uncle Cang,

82
00:06:01,692 --> 00:06:02,880
I'll be frank.

83
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,981
I'm here today

84
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,200
to find out

85
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,840
about your attitude
towards me and my brother.

86
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:11,440
If you think my brother
is a better fit than me,

87
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,760
I respect your choice.

88
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,600
Uncle Cang,

89
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:18,480
you've been in Qin Group
for over 30 years.

90
00:06:19,163 --> 00:06:20,880
I hope you can consider

91
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,360
it seriously.

92
00:06:39,975 --> 00:06:40,846
The voting has ended.

93
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,650
Four votes for Mr. Mo

94
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,350
and three for Mr. Qin.

95
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,880
(Save me.)

96
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,960
(Qiuwu Coffee.)

97
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:46,240
Going by the rules...

98
00:06:48,796 --> 00:06:49,920
What's going on?

99
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:51,778
Why did he suddenly leave?

100
00:06:52,836 --> 00:06:53,855
At tomorrow noon,

101
00:06:54,378 --> 00:06:55,240
let's meet up.

102
00:06:55,861 --> 00:06:56,760
Gao.

103
00:06:57,236 --> 00:06:58,120
Do something for me.

104
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,076
(Luckily I was prepared.)

105
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:05,320
What is this?

106
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:10,640
Calm down, please, everyone.

107
00:07:11,384 --> 00:07:12,040
It seems that

108
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:13,304
Sinian

109
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:14,600
is still too young.

110
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:15,836
On behalf of him,

111
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:17,673
I apologise to everyone.

112
00:07:19,698 --> 00:07:21,040
It's such an important occasion,

113
00:07:21,286 --> 00:07:22,400
yet he left just like that.

114
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,760
That means

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,200
he's given up.

116
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:28,040
The voting is over now.

117
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,200
Mr. Mo

118
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,120
shall be

119
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,160
Qin's new...

120
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,080
Since Mr. Mo has chosen to give up,

121
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:34,160
from now on,

122
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,360
I

123
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:36,960
shall lead everyone

124
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,360
to continue Qin's glory.

125
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,240
We've established the rule.

126
00:07:42,498 --> 00:07:43,840
If you do this, what's the point

127
00:07:44,073 --> 00:07:45,347
of the voting today?

128
00:07:49,972 --> 00:07:50,680
Enough!

129
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:52,720
The appointment of the chairman

130
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:54,160
shall be postponed.

131
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,960
This is ridiculous, isn't it?

132
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:24,384
I'm sorry,

133
00:08:24,495 --> 00:08:27,600
the number you're dialling
cannot be reached.

134
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,753
Where's Jinse?

135
00:09:20,873 --> 00:09:22,860
(Cooperation Agreement)

136
00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:24,080
I have a good lawyer friend

137
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,658
in Europe.

138
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,120
If you trust me,

139
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,320
pass the contract to me.

140
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:32,695
If I expose this contract,

141
00:09:33,516 --> 00:09:35,200
everyone will think that

142
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,440
Jinse got to where she is

143
00:09:38,726 --> 00:09:40,400
through your underhand practices.

144
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:42,600
Guess how people will view her?

145
00:09:44,187 --> 00:09:46,080
