00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,440
I know you've never liked
spicy food since young.

5
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:13,520
So you already knew what
happened between Jinse and I.

6
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,160
It looks like

7
00:01:17,064 --> 00:01:18,800
you've fallen in love with her.

8
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,360
So you've purposely paid me

9
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,240
a visit today, right?

10
00:01:25,855 --> 00:01:26,760
Qin Wuduan.

11
00:01:27,449 --> 00:01:28,960
You're absolutely devious.

12
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,040
I'm devious?

13
00:01:32,886 --> 00:01:35,043
Didn't you spy on me by taking
advantage of my relationship

14
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:36,009
with Jinse

15
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,960
and make me fall into your trap?

16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,800
I'm nowhere

17
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,240
as devious as you,

18
00:01:45,996 --> 00:01:46,960
brother.

19
00:01:50,175 --> 00:01:51,720
I used Jinse.

20
00:01:53,227 --> 00:01:54,800
It's because you'd
do whatever it takes

21
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,107
to get what you want

22
00:01:57,123 --> 00:01:58,160
since young.

23
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,080
You're aware

24
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,240
that there's something
wrong with the two companies.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,560
Why'd you insist to acquire them?

26
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:08,160
You almost put our
company in trouble.

27
00:02:09,913 --> 00:02:12,283
Now you're trying to
break up Jinse and I.

28
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,720
What are you actually up to?

29
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:29,000
Stop pretending to
be a good person, okay?

30
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:34,295
Not only I want to be the heir,

31
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,873
I want Jinse to be with me, too.

32
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,480
What?

33
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:52,640
Mo Sinian used you?

34
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:54,160
I never expected

35
00:02:54,203 --> 00:02:55,480
he's such kind of person.

36
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,320
I even thought you
two made a perfect fair.

37
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:01,520
But then again,

38
00:03:01,627 --> 00:03:03,400
what are you going to do next?

39
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,640
I'd like to cancel the
agreement between him and I.

40
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,080
You've just returned
to the jewellery line.

41
00:03:10,264 --> 00:03:12,553
If you cancel the agreement,

42
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,280
I'm afraid you'll
have to leave Hengrui.

43
00:03:15,344 --> 00:03:17,040
I deserve it.

44
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:18,760
In fact,

45
00:03:18,787 --> 00:03:20,113
he asked me

46
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:23,120
not to mix love with
work right from the start.

47
00:03:23,301 --> 00:03:25,360
I've fallen for him.

48
00:03:25,793 --> 00:03:27,261
I only have myself to blame.

49
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,135
Okay.

Just stop worrying about it.

You've given me

189
00:09:16,735 --> 00:09:18,720
much help and support.

190
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:21,400
I don't wish anything bad

191
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:23,080
to happen to your daughter.

192
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:24,160
After all,

193
00:09:26,307 --> 00:09:27,840
we're a family.

194
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,080
Isn't it so?

195
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,966
This is the boundary.

196
00:09:43,018 --> 00:09:43,960
When the bell rings,

197
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:45,080
none of us could sleep.

198
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,960
What's the matter?

199
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:53,120
Do you miss Mo Sinian?

200
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,880
Things are hard to change

201
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:04,000
once they become habits.

202
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,400
It may have nothing
to do with habits.

203
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:10,280
Dating Jing Xiangdong

204
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:12,240
doesn't make you a love expert.

205
00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:14,200
I'm not dating him.

206
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:15,800
Nevertheless,

207
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:17,520
he told me,

208
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,446
on the night of Valentine's Day,

209
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,540
Mo Sinian wanted to
confess his love to you.

210
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:24,760
