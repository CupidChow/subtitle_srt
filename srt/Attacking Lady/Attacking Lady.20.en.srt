=Episode 20=

3
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,600
What's wrong with you?

4
00:00:52,984 --> 00:00:53,800
When I think

5
00:00:53,843 --> 00:00:55,138
about how I'm meeting your mother,

6
00:00:55,713 --> 00:00:57,480
I feel nervous.

7
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,040
Don't be.

8
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:01,280
My mother won't treat
you like that anymore.

9
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:05,600
Let me take a good look at you.

10
00:01:06,203 --> 00:01:08,040
You're Yanran's child?

11
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,000
I was wrong for believing Song Jin

12
00:01:12,163 --> 00:01:13,760
and thinking that you're
that kind of person.

13
00:01:14,993 --> 00:01:16,080
I was mean

14
00:01:16,212 --> 00:01:18,440
to you earlier on.

15
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:19,920
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:21,920
It's all right, aunt.

17
00:01:22,286 --> 00:01:24,720
I know you did it for Sinian.

18
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:29,200
Jinse.

19
00:01:29,347 --> 00:01:30,126
Actually,

20
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,560
I don't mind your family background.

21
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:33,960
I just hope that

22
00:01:33,975 --> 00:01:35,280
you're marrying Sinian

23
00:01:35,301 --> 00:01:36,520
out of true love.

24
00:01:40,818 --> 00:01:42,360
Don't worry, aunt.

25
00:01:43,107 --> 00:01:45,280
I would love to do anything

26
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,840
with Sinian.

27
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,680
All right.

28
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,240
I give you my blessing.

29
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,440
Thank you, mother.

30
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,880
You're lying.

31
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:03,932
I'm Song Cheng's only daughter.

32
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,800
(Bai Jinse. Song Cheng. Paternity test)
This is my DNA report.

33
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:26,840
So what if you're the real deal?

34
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:30,760
The entire Song Group
is under my control.

35
00:02:31,123 --> 00:02:33,320
Since you want to acknowledge
him as your father,

36
00:02:33,978 --> 00:02:36,400
go on and be a good daughter to him.

37
00:02:38,147 --> 00:02:40,160
Do you think you've obtained

38
00:02:40,476 --> 00:02:42,080
all of the shares?

39
00:02:44,538 --> 00:02:45,280
Father.

40
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,560
I only had 1% of this company's shares.

41
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,800
Most shares

42
00:02:50,852 --> 00:02:52,280
belong to your mother,

43
00:02:52,332 --> 00:02:53,280
Du Yanran.

44
00:02:53,618 --> 00:02:54,760
I was only managing it for her.

45
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,840
Jin'er.

46
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:57,320
listen to me.

47
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,120
You'll suffer endlessly

48
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:01,240
unless you repent.

49
00:03:16,753 --> 00:03:17,520
Fine.

50
00:03:19,624 --> 00:03:21,160
Since you've got back your own daughter,

51
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,400
what am I to you?

52
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:24,720
What am I to you?

53
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,904
Mo Sinian.

54
00:03:29,963 --> 00:03:32,938
I wanted to spare Hengrui,

55
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,172
but you're more ruthless than me.

56
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,560
If you have anything else to say,

57
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,480
tell your lawyer.

58
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:46,130
All of this has nothing
to do with Song Jin!

59
00:03:50,252 --> 00:03:51,440
It's all my fault.

60
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,240
Who asked you to come here?

61
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,120
It's your engagement today.

62
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:02,800
Even if I had to hide in a corner,

63
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:06,920
I'd love to see you being happy.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,784
Song Cheng.

65
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
Do you still remember me?

66
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:20,920
Are you

67
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:24,920
Bai Zhengming?

68
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,280
That's right.

69
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,840
Back then,

70
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,840
you acquired my factory

71
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:32,480
and I was at my wits' end.

72
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:35,640
I didn't expect your wife and mine

73
00:04:35,784 --> 00:04:37,440
to deliver on the same day.

74
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,680
I resented you so much

75
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:40,840
that

76
00:04:41,353 --> 00:04:42,840
I ended up making the mistake.

77
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:49,120
Song Cheng.

78
00:04:50,353 --> 00:04:52,240
I was foolish back then

79
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:54,680
and caused this tragedy.

80
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:57,080
I raised

81
00:04:57,178 --> 00:04:59,400
Jinse up after all.

82
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Can you spare my daughter?

83
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:04,520
I don't need you to
take the blame for me.

84
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,080
I, Song Jin, would take full
responsibility for what I did!

85
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:23,609
In order to obtain
Song Cheng's properties,

86
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,609
Bai Zhengming do a swap with
his daughter and Song Cheng's.

87
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,483
(Song Jin is Bai Linlin's sister.)
Bai Jinse became Song Jin.

88
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:31,984
Also, Song Jin was the culprit
of Song Cheng's accident.

89
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,980
In order to prevent him from
reuniting with his daughter,

90
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,544
after Song Cheng's accident, she
arranged for people to pretend

91
00:05:36,578 --> 00:05:38,544
as reporters to frame Bai Jinse.

92
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:39,667
She resorted to all means

93
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:42,301
and almost killed her family member.

94
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,860
Song Jin is suspected of
negligence causing serious injury,

95
00:05:44,947 --> 00:05:47,470
while Bai Zhengming is suspected
of trafficking in children.

96
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,504
The police is investigating them.

97
00:06:03,812 --> 00:06:04,400
Come here.

98
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,760
Kneel down.

99
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,760
Kneel down?

100
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,160
Did I offend you again?

101
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:28,560
Is my cooking bad?

102
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
I asked you to kneel.

103
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:30,920
Just do it.

104
00:06:36,049 --> 00:06:37,080
On one knee!

105
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,960
Propose to me.

106
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,360
Jinse.

107
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,440
Do you want to marry me?

108
00:07:49,107 --> 00:07:50,120
I do.
