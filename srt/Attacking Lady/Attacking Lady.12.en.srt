3
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:48,280
Where's Jinse?

4
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,830
if I expose this contract,

5
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,440
everyone will think that

6
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,600
Jinse got to where she is

7
00:00:59,132 --> 00:01:00,520
through your underhand practices.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,720
Guess

9
00:01:01,787 --> 00:01:02,880
how people will view her?

10
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:04,036
What

11
00:01:04,286 --> 00:01:05,415
will happen

12
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:06,910
to her professional career?

13
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,120
Brother.

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,520
Sign the agreement to give it up.

15
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,249
Mo Sinian!

16
00:01:59,455 --> 00:02:00,627
Don't you sign it.

17
00:02:07,855 --> 00:02:09,400
Don't sign it!

18
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,840
You've gotted what you wanted.

19
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:55,430
(International Arrival)

20
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:13,969
Ms. Feng,

21
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,800
I'm Song Jin.

22
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,040
Can you do me

23
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:21,600
a small favour?

24
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:23,160
Ms. Bai.

25
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,200
These are designs by
all designers last month.

26
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,680
Organise them

27
00:04:26,707 --> 00:04:27,840
and present it to me
before leaving.

28
00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:30,163
She's indeed dating Mr. Mo now.

29
00:04:49,295 --> 00:04:50,360
Have some water.

30
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,640
I'm

31
00:05:03,756 --> 00:05:06,040
here to tell you a piece of good news.

32
00:05:07,332 --> 00:05:08,360
What is it?

33
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,560
Today, Mr. Song said that

34
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:10,200
he planned

35
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:11,200
to work with Hengrui

36
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,480
for a charity auction.

37
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,800
The chief designer will
be none other than you.

38
00:05:16,227 --> 00:05:17,360
Ms. Bai.

39
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,760
Your opportunity is here.

40
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:22,640
It's work.

41
00:05:31,627 --> 00:05:32,520
What's wrong with you?

42
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:38,680
Mr. Song also asked me

43
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,520
to bring you

44
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:42,760
to Hancheng to dine with him tomorrow.

45
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,480
Hancheng?

46
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,452
(Hancheng)

47
00:05:56,498 --> 00:06:00,700
(The Song family,
the home of Song Cheng)

48
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,000
Thanks.

49
00:06:07,904 --> 00:06:09,400
So this is Mr. Song's house.

50
00:06:10,138 --> 00:06:10,800
Yes.

51
00:06:11,655 --> 00:06:13,901
When I was young, my mother
used to bring me here.

52
00:06:14,664 --> 00:06:15,840
It's been a long time.

53
00:06:33,246 --> 00:06:34,240
Mr. Mo.

54
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,720
Long time no see.

55
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,040
Long time no see.

56
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:39,720
When did you come back?

57
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,720
Why didn't you tell me?

58
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:44,000
I came back last week.

59
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,840
I heard about your marriage in Paris.

60
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:49,040
Congratulations.

61
00:06:50,116 --> 00:06:50,800
Thanks.

62
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,760
Take a seat.

63
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,320
You must be Ms. Bai.

64
00:07:02,043 --> 00:07:02,600
Hello.

65
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm Bai Jinse.

66
00:07:05,212 --> 00:07:06,600
I'm the daughter of Mr. Song,

67
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,480
as well as Song Group's
executive president,

68
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,200
Song Jin.

69
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,720
Hello, Ms. Song.

70
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:13,680
My father is having a meeting.

71
00:07:13,846 --> 00:07:15,840
So he couldn't receive you in person.

72
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,360
My apologies.

73
00:07:18,443 --> 00:07:19,360
It's all right.

74
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:22,981
Actually, I've been hearing
about you from my father.

75
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:24,520
After meeting you today, Ms. Bai,

76
00:07:24,793 --> 00:07:26,920
I see that you're talented

77
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,400
and beautiful.

78
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,440
Mr. Mo, you have good taste.

79
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,040
Of course.

80
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,320
Don't say that.

81
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:38,840
Thanks for your compliment, Ms. Song.

82
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:43,040
I'm not really prepared this time.

83
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,560
I designed this.

84
00:07:45,876 --> 00:07:48,040
I hope you'll like it, Ms. Bai.

85
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,320
Thanks, Ms. Song.

86
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,160
I didn't know you'd return.

87
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,560
So I didn't prepare any gift.

88
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:56,520
It's okay.

89
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,080
By the way,

90
00:07:59,735 --> 00:08:02,400
I'll be in charge of this collaboration.

91
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,440
This project is really important to me.

92
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,440
Therefore,

93
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:07,600
I'm counting

94
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,160
on the both of you.

95
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:13,600
Rest assured,

96
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:15,400
we'll do our best.

97
00:08:24,043 --> 00:08:26,440
I felt that Mr. Song was
approachable when I first met him.

98
00:08:27,393 --> 00:08:30,120
I didn't expect Ms. Song
to be so nice too.

99
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,360
You're the nicest.

100
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,040
Noted.

101
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,520
What's the matter?

102
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,920
I'll bring you to a place.

103
00:08:49,193 --> 00:08:51,650
(Emergency)

104
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,120
Why did you bring me to a hospital?

105
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,320
I have investigated.

106
00:09:00,015 --> 00:09:01,840
Before your adoptive mother
had Bai Linlin,

107
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:03,640
she had another child in Hancheng.

108
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,560
This hospital

109
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:07,960
might just be where you were born.

110
00:09:11,335 --> 00:09:12,080
Where

111
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,680
I was born?

112
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:16,960
(Record Room)

113
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:21,080
All records of the day are here.

114
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,160
Thanks, director.

115
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,320
Thanks.

116
00:09:34,627 --> 00:09:35,840
