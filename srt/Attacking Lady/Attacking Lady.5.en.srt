3
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,120
Why do you care about me?

4
00:00:55,547 --> 00:00:56,840
It's not that I care about you.

5
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,640
I just don't want my wife to have

6
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:00,800
questionable origin.

7
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,280
Also,

8
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,920
Hengrui will launch new products.

9
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,000
Previously, the new products

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,520
were produced by Ms. Feng.

11
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,080
I hope that this time,

12
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,280
you can seize the opportunity

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,600
and show me your capability.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,440
Rest assured,

15
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,720
I'll do my rest.

16
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,280
I hope that you can impress me

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,560
with the new products.

18
00:01:23,313 --> 00:01:24,600
Go all out.

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,320
I...

20
00:01:29,827 --> 00:01:31,320
The company will fully support you.

21
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,000
I hope you can bring to
Hengrui new possibilities.

22
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:37,055
Thanks, Mr. Mo, for your trust.

23
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,680
Ms. Bai.

24
00:01:51,723 --> 00:01:53,907
These are the designs by
all designers last month.

25
00:01:53,926 --> 00:01:55,280
Organise them

26
00:01:55,418 --> 00:01:57,000
and present it to me
before you get off work.

27
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,360
That's not my job, right?

28
00:02:01,052 --> 00:02:04,215
I'm helping you to familiarise
yourself with the work.

29
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,560
Okay,

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,480
even so,

31
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,120
I can't finish it in a night.

32
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:10,720
I believe in your capability.

33
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,480
Jinse.

34
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,680
I'll help you.

35
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:30,520
Excuse me.

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,560
What are you doing?

37
00:02:34,636 --> 00:02:37,080
What does Bai Jinse's work
have to do with you?

38
00:02:37,144 --> 00:02:38,000
Lin Xi.

39
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:40,320
Know your place in the company.

40
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,120
I think you're just jealous of Jinse.

41
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,440
I'm warning you.

42
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,640
Don't be nosy!

43
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:47,160
Whatever.

44
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:49,920
Jinse is much better than you anyway.

45
00:02:50,055 --> 00:02:51,760
She'll surpass you anytime.

46
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Lin Xi.

47
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,200
Jinse!

48
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,320
Bai Jinse, how dare you hit me!

49
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
You're a wretched woman!

50
00:03:19,935 --> 00:03:20,800
Feng Xiaoxi.

51
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,520
I'm telling you one last time.

52
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:24,320
You can do whatever to me,

53
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,560
but don't you ever dare

54
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:28,360
to hurt my friend.

55
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,400
Feng Xiaoxi

56
00:03:32,436 --> 00:03:33,760
is backed by Song Jin

57
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:35,000
and has been
arrogant in the company,

58
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,080
yet you're not even afraid.

59
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:37,880
Who's Song Jin?

60
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,320
A former designer with the company.

61
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,800
Jinse.

62
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,080
Can you teach me taekwondo?

63
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,600
If I encounter anyone
else like Feng Xiaoxi,

64
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,120
I'll handle him or her by myself.

65
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,360
Mr. Jing.

66
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:48,840
Yes?

67
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,400
I can take care of her here.

68
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,040
You may go back.

69
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,960
No.

70
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Mr. Mo told me

71
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,280
to stay here.

72
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:55,840
He's waiting for you to go home.

73
00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:58,000
Well...

74
00:03:58,033 --> 00:03:58,920
Go home?

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,520
Yes.

76
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,640
She's

77
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,880
Mrs. Mo now.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,741
What?

79
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,280
When did you marry Mr. Mo?

80
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,960
No.

81
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:06,492
We

82
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:07,680
had a fake marriage.

83
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,640
A fake marrige?

84
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:10,600
Well,

85
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:12,129
take care of her.

86
00:04:12,184 --> 00:04:12,923
I'll go now.

87
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,880
You...

88
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,320
What are you up to this time?

89
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,320
Bai Jinse,

90
00:04:21,412 --> 00:04:23,080
don't be smug just
because you're recruited

91
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,120
by Mr. Mo.

92
00:04:24,313 --> 00:04:25,480
You want to replace me?

93
00:04:26,126 --> 00:04:27,680
You're so naive.

94
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,480
Ms. Feng.

95
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,800
I've been giving in to you

96
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,320
as you're my superior,

97
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:35,280
but starting today,

98
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:37,840
if you continue to mess with me,

99
00:04:38,203 --> 00:04:40,200
I won't spare you.

100
00:04:41,738 --> 00:04:42,480
Bai Jinse!

101
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,520
Starting today,

102
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,916
only one of us can exist

103
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,400
in Hengrui!

104
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:53,920
Why aren't you sleeping?

105
00:04:56,636 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm writing the design concept
of the new products.

106
00:04:59,855 --> 00:05:00,840
I can't fall asleep anyway.

107
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:02,400
I'll accompany you.

108
00:05:03,523 --> 00:05:04,200
Mr. Mo,

109
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,640
this is the privacy of a designer.

110
00:05:08,135 --> 00:05:09,600
I'm your boss.

111
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,000
My idea for this batch of design

112
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,720
originated from protection.

113
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,240
Speaking of protection...

114
00:05:48,286 --> 00:05:50,400
What do you think of the design?

115
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,000
Beautiful.

116
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,760
What?

117
00:05:58,864 --> 00:06:00,440
Your design is beautiful.

118
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:05,720
What a great idea.

119
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:08,160
Actually,

120
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:10,880
it's not entirely my own idea.

121
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:12,480
When I was young,

122
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:14,640
I had a similar necklace,

123
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,840
but it was taken away by Bai Linlin.

124
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:21,640
Anyway,

125
00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:24,160
good luck for this new product launch.

126
00:06:26,658 --> 00:06:27,280
Mr. Mo.

127
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,960
Rest assured.

128
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,840
By the way, Mr. Mo,

129
00:06:33,578 --> 00:06:34,960
whenever I can't fall asleep,

130
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:37,120
I like listening to audiobooks.

131
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:39,360
Whenever I listen to it, I fall asleep.

132
00:06:41,046 --> 00:06:41,953
Do you want to try it?

133
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,880
How is it?

134
00:07:52,864 --> 00:07:55,452
Although your work becomes
the new product for this season,

135
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,800
this is just the beginning.

136
00:07:58,523 --> 00:08:00,400
Don't be smug,

137
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,200
got it?

138
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,920
Got it, Mr. Mo.

139
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,120
Congratulations,

140
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,120
Ms. Bai.

141
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,440
Thanks, Mr. Mo.

142
00:08:13,732 --> 00:08:14,572
Ms. Bai.

143
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,504
Someone named Lucy

144
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,000
has an appointment
with you at 1pm today.

145
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:19,720
Okay, noted.

146
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,064
My apologies, Ms. Bai.

147
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,830
I just became the CEO of a company.

148
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:41,320
That's why I had no time
to visit your company

149
00:08:41,652 --> 00:08:43,280
and could only meet you here today.

150
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:44,560
It's okay.

151
00:08:46,141 --> 00:08:47,840
Isn't that Ms. Bai?

152
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,240
Indeed.

153
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,609
Let's greet her.

154
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:56,720
The ladies are sharing secrets.

155
00:08:56,793 --> 00:08:58,640
Why must you disturb them?

156
00:08:59,966 --> 00:09:01,680
Isn't that Lucy from Tiansheng?

157
00:09:02,526 --> 00:09:03,960
How did they become close?

158
00:09:04,283 --> 00:09:06,950
Ms. Bai is pretty and talented.

159
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:08,987
Who would know who she'd

160
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:10,600
get close to and share secrets with?

161
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,680
We should go.

162
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,643
Ms. Bai.

163
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,480
I purchased the jewellery

164
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,480
in individual capacity.

165
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,320
So it shouldn't go through
the business account.

166
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,840
I hope that

167
00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:24,080
I can bank in the money
to your personal account.

168
00:09:24,516 --> 00:09:25,440
Ms. Bai.

169
00:09:25,726 --> 00:09:26,753
Are you willing to help me?

170
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,760
Ms. Bai,

171
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,360
if you have concerns,

172
00:09:34,609 --> 00:09:36,200
I can bank in the full amount

173
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:37,756
to your account.

174
00:09:40,993 --> 00:09:41,421
Okay.

175
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:43,600
Trust is mutual.

176
00:09:43,695 --> 00:09:44,960
Since you trust me,

177
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,040
I trust you too.

178
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,280
Don't worry.

179
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:48,680
I'll take care of it.

180
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:57,450
(Photocopy)

181
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,064
Next,

182
00:10:27,098 --> 00:10:30,240
here's Tiansheng Jewellery's
new product of the season.

183
00:10:31,784 --> 00:10:33,920
Isn't this Ms. Bai's work?

184
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:38,440
I'm sorry, Ms. Bai.

185
00:10:41,716 --> 00:10:43,920
This person looks familiar.

186
00:10:44,003 --> 00:10:46,880
I heard that Lucy had been
furthering her studies in Europe.

187
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,480
We had no news of her in China.

188
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,800
How did you get to know her?

189
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,846
I think I saw Ms. Bai

190
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:54,400
being with Lucy that day.

191
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,360
(Tiansheng's New Product Launch)
Mr. Jing, you saw it too, right?

192
00:10:59,846 --> 00:11:00,720
That day,

193
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,483
Ms. Feng...

194
00:11:02,544 --> 00:11:03,440
Mr. Jing,

195
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:05,560
I have an appointment with
Mr. Da, whom you want to meet.

196
00:11:05,849 --> 00:11:06,680
Do you want to go with me?

197
00:11:06,923 --> 00:11:07,800
Seriously?

198
00:11:07,963 --> 00:11:08,960
Sure.

199
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,120
Let's go.

200
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,800
As we passed by a cafe,

201
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:14,735
we happened to see
Bai Jinse being with Lucy.

202
00:11:15,156 --> 00:11:15,920
No.

203
00:11:15,947 --> 00:11:18,640
She met me to ask me
to design jewellery for her

204
00:11:18,673 --> 00:11:21,716
I didn't know she's
the CEO of Tiansheng.

205
00:11:22,446 --> 00:11:25,680
Why did you choose to meet
at the cafe below Tiansheng?

206
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:28,200
She claimed that she was
too busy to come to Hengrui.

207
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,080
So we met nearby her company.

208
00:11:30,516 --> 00:11:31,049
Mr. Mo.

209
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,440
If you don't believe me,

210
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,520
check my chat history with Lucy.

211
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,040
I didn't know her before this.

212
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,280
You might not know her before this,

213
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,120
but who knows whether you

214
00:11:40,147 --> 00:11:41,200
have any secret deal after that?

215
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,920
Why would I give the exact copies

216
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,200
of my design to her?

217
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:45,960
Hengrui's new product launch

218
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:47,680
is a week away.

219
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,640
Tiansheng is a rival of Hengrui.

220
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,780
It's apparent that you want
Hengrui to be accused of plagiarism.

221
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,960
Don't simply accuse me.

222
00:11:56,612 --> 00:11:57,200
Mr. Mo.

223
00:11:57,236 --> 00:11:58,560
To know whether Ms. Bai did it,

224
00:11:58,695 --> 00:12:00,640
just check her account statements.

225
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:05,640
Jing Xiangdong.

226
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,960
Check Ms. Bai's account.

227
00:12:08,443 --> 00:12:09,720
Before we know the truth,

228
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,400
no one can leave this place.

229
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,520
Tiansheng

230
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,763
has indeed banked in money to Ms. Bai.

231
00:12:25,184 --> 00:12:25,880
Mr. Mo.

232
00:12:26,738 --> 00:12:28,560
I really don't know why
this amount of money...

233
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:30,415
The company has its own rules.

234
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:32,480
All designs

235
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:35,120
and transactions should be done
with the company's knowledge.

236
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:37,760
I don't care whether you did this,

237
00:12:37,864 --> 00:12:40,120
but you violated the company's rule.

238
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,123
Mr. Mo.

239
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:44,160
Don't you think

240
00:12:44,193 --> 00:12:45,880
I'm set up by someone?

241
00:12:45,944 --> 00:12:47,680
I'll get to the bottom of this,

242
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,000
but before that,

243
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,840
you, Bai Jinse,

244
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:54,960
shall halt all company affairs.

245
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,720
You don't trust me.

246
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,960
I've made it clear.

247
00:13:07,581 --> 00:13:08,480
Mr. Mo.

248
00:13:09,024 --> 00:13:10,440
Since you don't trust me,

249
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,240
you don't have to suspend me.

250
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,280
I resign.
