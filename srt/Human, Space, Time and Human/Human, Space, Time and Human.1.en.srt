1
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:37,704
"human"

2
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,368
What's wrong?

3
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,790
I think it reeks of blood.

4
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:11,999
Many must've died here, right?

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,867
Right. Not fit for a honeymoon.

6
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,870
But I like it.

7
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:23,327
Nice weather.

8
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:29,661
Honey? Isn't he a famous politician?

9
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,791
He's a presidential candidate.

10
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,448
Must be traveling with his son.

11
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:41,328
This is so old.

12
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,330
Is it strong enough?

13
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:47,203
What if it sinks?

14
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:49,535
What do you want to be?

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,286
Not a politician like you, dad.

16
00:01:55,042 --> 00:02:00,036
Any company you want to work at?
I'm friends with all the owners.

17
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:04,330
I want to get hired on my own
without your help.

18
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:07,458
Really?

19
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:10,292
We'll see.

20
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,573
Cut the racket!

21
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:15,748
What the heck!

22
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:17,702
What?

23
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:18,948
Scram, fools!

24
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,198
- Come down.
- What?

25
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,620
- Go away!
- What the hell?

26
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:23,705
What the!

27
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,286
Just go, assholes!

28
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:28,998
- What the hell?
- Scram!

29
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,912
Oh! Mr. senator!

30
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,414
Hello, sir!

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hi.

32
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:43,454
Is this your son, sir?

33
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:44,455
Yes.

34
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,824
A grown son like this?

35
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,243
Did you marry early?

36
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,615
What's it to you, mister?

37
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,572
Boys! He'll be the next president.

38
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,368
Please...

39
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,536
- Greet him.
- Hello, sir!

40
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,949
If you need anything, call us.
We'll make sure you're comfortable.

41
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,583
Thank you.

42
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:10,417
Let's go.

43
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:14,203
- Escort them!
- Yes, sir!

44
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:19,622
This way, sir!

45
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:24,708
What the hell?

46
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:26,868
What are you doing?

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,456
Let's go, sir.

48
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,250
Sure.

49
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,447
You're pretty even without makeup.

50
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:58,999
Stop wearing makeup. What about us?

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,037
Right! Men want her only!

52
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,707
But you girls have hot bodies!

53
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:08,329
Move out of the way!

54
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,539
Don't hit me!

55
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:10,542
This way.

56
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,039
Who is he?

57
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,869
That'll do.

58
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:19,157
Enjoy your rest, sir!

59
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,333
Let's go.

60
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:32,579
Who's that? He looks mean.

61
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,491
Just shitty gangsters.

62
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,370
Why's it so nice here?
There's even a bathroom.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,615
Look! It's totally nice!

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Excuse me!

65
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,156
Yes?

66
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,823
Why do we get regular rooms

67
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,414
and he gets a suite?

68
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:58,829
Don't you know him? He's a senator.

69
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:03,706
I know, but shouldn't politicians
set good examples?

70
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,790
This is unfair!

71
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:07,532
Treat us the same!

72
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:10,158
What's all the damn noise?

73
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:11,788
What?

74
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:14,784
What's unfair? Don't you know who he is?

75
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:18,739
Who cares? We're all travelers!

76
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,162
How dare you, bitch! Get lost!

77
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:22,458
Scram!

78
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:25,124
Damn sluts living on selling yourselves!

79
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,572
Watch your damn yapping, asshole!

80
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:32,697
Then you live on sucking up, huh?

81
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,991
You wanna die?

82
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,991
So what if I do?

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,161
They didn't say anything wrong.

84
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,789
Who asked you?

85
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,823
Get lost before I toss you into the seal!

86
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,539
Don't use force!

87
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,118
Who are you people?

88
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,832
Damn crazy bastards!

89
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,125
Hold on.

90
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:56,782
Sir!

91
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,870
Please go inside. I'll handle this.

92
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,708
Look!

93
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,831
Complainers! Step forward!

94
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:07,667
Come out!

95
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,697
No one? Then go back to your rooms!

96
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,740
- Go away!
- Takashi!

97
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,914
Why's it so nice here?

98
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,741
I can see why they complained.

99
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:31,166
We can't sleep in dog cages like them.

100
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:33,453
Who are those gangsters?

101
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:36,784
It's like you hired them.
Tell them to stop meddling.

102
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,333
They want to serve me. Leave them.

103
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,206
They'll come in handy.

104
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,244
You're enjoying this?

105
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:51,536
We all have our statuses.
They're doing it out of respect.

106
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:55,822
No, it's to get a position off you later.

107
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,744
If they're good, why not?

108
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,457
Mic test one, two!

109
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,493
Welcome passengers!

110
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:10,530
This is the captain of the ship speaking.

111
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:11,875
First,

112
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:16,452
I'd like to thank all passengers
for coming on this meaningful trip.

113
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:24,917
We'll set sail on a new adventure
for a week together.

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,322
For a safer journey on this ship,

115
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,947
everyone must please follow my orders.

116
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,323
Look here!

117
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,291
I hope we have a great trip

118
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:40,739
and return safely after a week.

119
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,789
May it be a precious time for everyone.

120
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:48,865
Now, let's sail out into the vast seal

121
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,867
Wanna take a picture by the Cannon?

122
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:02,658
Let's just take it with the sea behind us.

123
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,245
Why? Because the Cannon killed people?

124
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,619
He's been doing that for a while.

125
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,250
Sir?

126
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,746
Why are you collecting dirt in a cup?

127
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,416
- How do you like the food?
- It's good.

128
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:52,283
I got something to say. I'll join you.

129
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:53,532
You can't sit here.

130
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:56,079
- I have something to say!
- Why you!

131
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,500
It's okay.

132
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,869
Have a drink.

133
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,365
Thank you, sir!

134
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,288
Your son is quite handsome.
What's your name?

135
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,910
Why do you want to know?

136
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:19,906
Anyway, I'll make sure you're happy
along the trip, sir.

137
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:22,874
Thanks. Have some.

138
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:36,282
It's tasteless.

139
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:39,283
Why is their menu so different?

140
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,956
They eat different food too.

141
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,073
They even get wine.

142
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,990
It's not fair.

143
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,198
They even have the suite.

144
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,285
Takashi!

145
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:05,833
Captain?

146
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,332
Why's the food here different from ours?

147
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,789
There's wine too.

148
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,328
Don't you know who he is?

149
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:18,535
That's not what matters.
Why's everything so different?

150
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,625
Look!

151
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,286
Keep it down before the senator.

152
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,743
He'll do big things for the country.
He should eat better.

153
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,698
Go back before I hurt you!

154
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,743
You're the same.

155
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:33,033
Your men are eating over there.

156
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,780
How can you eat good food by yourself?

157
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:42,042
What?

158
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,369
Hit me if you want to.

159
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,492
Those in higher positions should share!

160
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:56,578
Taking all the good room and food,

161
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:01,204
aren't you like a dictator?

162
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,318
Use your fists for justice,
not to suck up to higher powers!

163
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,911
Calm down! Let's go.

164
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,246
Overlooking stuff like this
is what's ruining this world!

165
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:13,124
Captain! Change their things
to the same as us!

166
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:18,995
How dare you cut in you shitty bastard!

167
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:22,999
Don't mind him, sir.

168
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,582
He's right! It's not fair!

169
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,244
What? You shithead!

170
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,072
Who says you rule here? You ugly gangster!

171
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,324
- You shitty bastards!
- Yeah!

172
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,664
Give us wine too!

173
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,583
Please stop!

174
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:40,623
What you say is right.

175
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,740
I sincerely apologize to you all.

176
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:50,034
From tomorrow, I'll eat
the same food as you.

177
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:52,782
Are you happy now?

178
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,250
And your room?

179
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,116
Captain? Give us a regular room.

180
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:01,989
The regular rooms are fully occupied, sir.

181
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,119
Please understand.

182
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,116
Please make sure
nothing like this happens again.

183
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,870
I'll take care of that arrogant bastard.

184
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,080
No! Don't!

185
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,619
Stop meddling in our matters.

186
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,198
With you acting up for us,

187
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,324
my dad's image is going bad.

188
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,619
A good image is everything to a politician!

189
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,536
I was just trying to help, sir.

190
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,749
Doing nothing is helping.

191
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:35,532
Please leave!

192
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:38,789
Yes, sir!

193
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:54,155
If you act up again, you're dead! Got that?

194
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,120
You're threatening us?
We just pointed out what's wrong!

195
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,824
Damn! You're cute.

196
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,123
Get your hand off her!

197
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:11,413
If you act up again,
I'll toss you into the sea.

198
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Let's go.

199
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:35,704
Not again!

200
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:41,534
- One more time!
- Sure!

201
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:42,702
Let's play!

202
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:46,910
Choose the right cup and win!
Where can it be?

203
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:48,782
Where is the dice?

204
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,618
Wanna have fun?

205
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,162
Come with us.

206
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:56,281
This one?

207
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:58,783
Place your bet.

208
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,539
Place your bets and win!

209
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,287
- Don't. They're swindlers.
- Just once. I can win.

210
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,750
This one!

211
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,824
Let's see!

212
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,865
- Damn!
- Yes!

213
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:14,197
You're very lucky!

214
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,450
Having fun?

215
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,416
Wanna play together?

216
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:27,375
Hey, move over.

217
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,161
Come on!

218
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:32,078
Hey, give me a shot!

219
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:39,618
- You're handsome.
- Then it's free?

220
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,831
Pay before you touch.

221
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,740
Crazy bitches!

222
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:48,167
What?

223
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:50,748
You asshole!

224
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:56,532
- Here's the money.
- Take it!

225
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:58,203
Is that enough?

226
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,083
Happy now?

227
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:04,576
Then I'll strip. Happy?

228
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,658
Pour me a drink.

229
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:12,114
Damn animals!

230
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,287
Cheers!

231
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,993
I don't drink without a girl.

232
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,991
Eat this, jerk!

233
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,161
You know, mi-young loved me.

234
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,327
No! It was me!

235
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:31,874
- Crazy bastard!
- Why you!

236
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:36,705
Shut up and drink. Forget mi-young!

237
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,083
Look over there.

238
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,742
Damn! Whoever fucks her first gets her!

239
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,415
Hurry up and cum!

240
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:57,830
It's coming! Hold on bitch!

241
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,790
Where is the dice?

242
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:03,407
Watch carefully!

243
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,458
Where is it?

244
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,197
- Here! Trust me on this one!
- Stop! It's rigged!

245
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,323
One more time.

246
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:11,489
Here!

247
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:14,329
Is it here or not?

248
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,662
Nope! Too bad.

249
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:19,578
This is a con!

250
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,290
Get lost if you don't have money.

251
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,577
- My turn!
- One game?

252
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,699
- You're in it together!
- What?

253
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,208
- Give me my money!
- Get lost bastard!

254
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:33,532
What a sorry loser!

255
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:35,078
Come back here, bastard!

256
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,165
You piece of shit!

257
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,283
Damn young bastard!

258
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:43,739
The gangsters are trouble. Watch out.

259
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,991
Honey? Wanna play?

260
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,664
You can't come in here.

261
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,123
No, it's okay.

262
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:51,572
Come in and have a seat.

263
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,414
Bring some wine.

264
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:58,157
- We brought some!
- And glasses too!

265
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:01,374
Have a seat, hon. Relax.

266
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,949
Let's have some drink.

267
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:09,788
Such lovely ladies were on our ship?

268
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,581
Interested, sir?

269
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:27,042
In what?

270
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,698
Isn't that girl cute?

271
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,994
Her body is hot too.

272
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,035
What do you mean?

273
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,832
Having big ambitions
means having great desires.

274
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,832
If you want, I'll bring her to you.

275
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,957
Her boyfriend won't like that.

276
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:55,329
What you say is the law on this ship now.

277
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:58,703
Do you really think so?

278
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,365
Have a drink and wait in your room.

279
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:07,494
Well, let's see what you can do.

280
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:20,748
What did he want?

281
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,240
We should keep distance from him.

282
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:25,907
He's of use to us.

283
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:10,622
Get out!

284
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,456
What are you doing?

285
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,660
Let go of me!

286
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,830
Takashi!

287
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,332
Hold her down!

288
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:26,417
Asshole!

289
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,990
You shithead!

290
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,581
Arrogant fool!

291
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:50,577
Use my fist for what?

292
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,331
You piece of shit!

293
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,199
You educated fools are shit!

294
00:20:57,542 --> 00:20:58,998
If you did your jobs right,

295
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,539
we wouldn't live like this.

296
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,905
Stop yapping, asshole!

297
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:14,908
Son of a bitch!

298
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:41,948
It's okay!

299
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:49,533
You wanna live?

300
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,122
Don't wanna die?

301
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,536
Are you okay?

302
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:55,157
Don't wanna die?

303
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,198
How do you like that?

304
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:20,240
Stop screaming!

305
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:26,868
Fuck! Stop him!

306
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,664
Get him!

307
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:31,248
You asshole!

308
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:51,452
What!

309
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:52,458
No!

310
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:14,074
- There.
- I like it!

311
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,823
What are they doing?

312
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:17,873
Get lost!

313
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:18,875
Su-hyun!

314
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:23,535
You bitch! Come quietly!

315
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,949
Son of a bitch!

316
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,574
Hurry! Open the door!

317
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,615
Hold her!

318
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,786
No! Stop!

319
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,414
Kyu-ri!

320
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,783
Kyu-ri! No!

321
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:42,828
Bastards! Open up!

322
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:56,124
You didn't have her first, did you?

323
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:21,583
Bitch!

324
00:24:22,292 --> 00:24:23,292
I love it.

325
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:32,072
It was good.

326
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,448
Nice!

327
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:36,123
W ait.

328
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,083
Move.

329
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:39,828
Your dad's busy.

330
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,164
Out of my way!

331
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,160
Boys hit you?

332
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:45,494
Damn bastards.

333
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:49,327
Want me to punish them?

334
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:52,375
Forget it. Stop meddling in my matters.

335
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,785
Takashi.

336
00:27:04,292 --> 00:27:05,292
Takashi!

337
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:10,243
Give me that!

338
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:12,702
You have lots!

339
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:15,905
Why you!

340
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:18,908
You have more!

341
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,532
What's going on?

342
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:23,284
Why fight pretty ladies?

343
00:27:23,292 --> 00:27:25,453
Because of money?

344
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:26,458
Get lost!

345
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:28,490
Calm down.

346
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,661
Get your damn hands off me!

347
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:36,948
- You hit me, bitch?
- Damn con artists!

348
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:41,074
What? You dirty rags!

349
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:42,448
Rags?

350
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,115
Takashi!

351
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:56,331
Geezel

352
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,831
thanks, man!

353
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:03,323
Kyu-ri!

354
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:05,618
I'm sorry.

355
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:08,619
It's okay now.

356
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:11,537
I'm so sorry.

357
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:13,498
Takashi!

358
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:16,831
Takashi!

359
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,242
Takashi! Where are you?

360
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:30,158
Where's her boyfriend?

361
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,286
Not on this ship.

362
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:36,039
Did you kill him?

363
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:48,871
You devil! What did you do to takashi?

364
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:50,490
He's not on this ship.

365
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:54,534
Let go of me! Go to hell!

366
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:11,666
If that girl has a baby...

367
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:15,744
Whose would it be out of us?

368
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:21,368
What the hell are you saying?

369
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:24,119
How about a drink as accomplices?

370
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:26,993
Accomplices?

371
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:32,993
Takashi!

372
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:36,615
Takashi!

373
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:41,532
Takashi!

374
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:45,160
Takashi!

375
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:47,243
Takashi!

376
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:52,865
Takashi!

377
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:01,865
Let go!

378
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:20,619
What in the world?

379
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:30,370
- What happened?
- No idea, sir.

380
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:32,907
What happened?

381
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:38,952
Where are we?

382
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,991
What's going on?!

383
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:45,533
There's nothing below us!

384
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:56,000
"Space"

385
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:03,532
where did the sea go?

386
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:06,284
Help! Help us!

387
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:08,328
Help us!

388
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:13,828
How can the sea vanish?

389
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:17,124
Please calm down and listen carefully.

390
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:18,907
This is an emergency.

391
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,286
There is no radar, the sea is gone,

392
00:32:21,292 --> 00:32:23,999
and the ship is floating in air.

393
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,742
We have no idea where we are.

394
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:30,618
We'll try to find out, so please stay calm.

395
00:33:04,042 --> 00:33:05,953
Why did you stop me?

396
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:11,494
Why didn't you let me die?

397
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:26,207
You know where we are, don't you?

398
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,866
Alpha? This is bravo! Come in!

399
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:42,828
Delta? This is bravo! Come in!

400
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:45,789
Captain? There's no answer.

401
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:50,573
Did this ever happen before?

402
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:52,208
No, sir.

403
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:55,457
We got lost in the fog before,

404
00:33:56,458 --> 00:33:58,449
but we've never seen the sea vanish.

405
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,990
How much food is left?

406
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:04,784
We have about 6 days' worth left.

407
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:08,494
- Follow me.
- Yes, sir.

408
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:14,829
They're trying to take over
the food supply first.

409
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,494
It's our ship! We control the food!

410
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,500
Let's go!

411
00:34:22,917 --> 00:34:24,123
Back away!

412
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:29,619
Damn bastards!

413
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:32,702
Don't boss us!

414
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:37,580
Folks! We'll manage the food supply!

415
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,581
- Go on!
- Block it!

416
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:49,158
- Listen people!
- Shut up!

417
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,573
Let's maintain order.

418
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:55,825
I'll protect the food supply from now on.

419
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:57,702
Trust me.

420
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:58,788
No!

421
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:01,950
This is our ship. We'll manage the food.

422
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:03,869
We'll distribute it equally.

423
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:04,875
No!

424
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,039
I'll manage it myself with these men.

425
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:13,534
I'm in charge of this ship!
It's an emergency!

426
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:14,657
I know!

427
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:19,657
That's why I'll manage it.

428
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:24,370
Don't let anyone touch the food.

429
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:25,948
Yes, sir!

430
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,081
Let's manage it together.

431
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:30,165
Cut the bullshit!

432
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,741
Kill anyone who touches the food!

433
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,364
Yes, sir!

434
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:37,243
We already have a captain,
but who made you boss?

435
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,490
Hell yeah!

436
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,365
What if you take it all?

437
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:41,911
We don't trust you, asshole!

438
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:45,330
We'll all die if they manage the food!

439
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:46,573
Let's fight them!

440
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:49,575
Yes! We can beat them together!

441
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:51,949
Let's fight them!

442
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:56,040
If you don't like it, step forward!

443
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:57,248
Now!

444
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:03,035
Put the gun away.

445
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:06,375
Now.

446
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:14,618
Listen everyone.

447
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:18,245
Trust me and go back to your rooms.

448
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:20,999
Breakfast will be served soon.

449
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:24,116
I work for the country.

450
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:25,413
Go on.

451
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:32,872
Fine. Let's go for now.

452
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:40,830
Hand out breakfast. Cut the amount in half.

453
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:43,828
Just give them rice balls.

454
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:47,197
- Rice balls?
- That's right.

455
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:48,868
We should conserve food.

456
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,698
You're overstepping my authority
to protect the passengers' rights.

457
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:56,370
Shut up and do as I say!

458
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:57,831
Who are you to give me orders?

459
00:36:57,833 --> 00:36:59,448
We're under martial law now!

460
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:04,911
The experienced senator
is trying to save us all!

461
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:09,448
All our crew members
are trained for emergencies!

462
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:12,530
You wanna fight it out?

463
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:14,368
What are you doing?

464
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,911
I can't trust you.

465
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:17,373
Then how can we trust you?

466
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:19,081
You have no choice!

467
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:23,075
People dying is good
since we're short on food.

468
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:29,449
If anything goes wrong,
you'll be responsible!

469
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:34,698
Tell the cooks to make special meals
for us with lots of meat.

470
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:36,824
Then others get less food!

471
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:37,948
Do it!

472
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Got it?

473
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:45,742
We can't let them manage
the food supply, sir.

474
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:48,457
What can we do? They have a gun!

475
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:52,535
Lay low for now.

476
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,789
First, look for any weapons.
There must be some on this ship.

477
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:02,160
We have to prepare to
protect the passengers.

478
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:06,243
They're here!

479
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:23,951
- You gotta be kidding.
- Just take one.

480
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:26,661
We made one for each person.

481
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:31,532
- I want one more.
- No.

482
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,783
One is not enough for me!

483
00:38:33,792 --> 00:38:35,077
What the hell!

484
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:39,330
Asshole! Just eat what you get!

485
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:41,494
What's this?

486
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:46,538
You can have mine.

487
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:49,073
No water?

488
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,535
Shit!

489
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,911
Bullshit!

490
00:39:04,917 --> 00:39:06,703
Let's follow him!

491
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:08,913
We handed out the food.

492
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:10,663
Sit down and eat!

493
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:12,208
Enjoy your meal.

494
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:20,490
I knew it!

495
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:24,664
What's all this!

496
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:27,499
Different menu?

497
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,660
Quiet!

498
00:39:29,542 --> 00:39:31,078
I'll explain!

499
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:34,620
To overcome this crisis,

500
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:36,741
we need a resourceful man.

501
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:42,828
I nominate the senator
as the man in charge here!

502
00:39:43,417 --> 00:39:48,787
I'll follow his orders like he's god,
so follow along!

503
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:52,117
Let's listen to a word
from our dear senator.

504
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:58,125
Everyone!

505
00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:02,990
We're at a place we've never even imagined.

506
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:08,039
Luckily, we have air to breathe
and oil to last us.

507
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:12,410
We have food to last a week.
But beyond that...

508
00:40:12,417 --> 00:40:13,953
We'll all starve to death!

509
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:19,573
So I declare a state of emergency!

510
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:23,162
Martial law? What right do they have?

511
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:28,782
As you all know,
I've resolved many things for our country.

512
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:34,957
Based on my experience,
we must first buy more time.

513
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:39,788
So I'll cut the food in
half starting today.

514
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:41,657
Then why do you eat whatever you want?

515
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:44,500
Because we're working hard for you!

516
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:48,245
Complainers! Step forward!

517
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:52,163
You may have complaints, but bear with me.

518
00:40:52,792 --> 00:40:57,661
Because our lives are at stake,

519
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:00,328
I won't tolerate excessive protest.

520
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:06,746
What are we supposed to do?

521
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:14,575
Alpha? This is bravo! Come in!

522
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:16,458
Alpha!

523
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,036
Still can't see anything?

524
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:22,866
Damn! Didn't you hear me?

525
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,537
There's nothing and no response either.

526
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:34,323
Conserve all energy
and report on all the remaining oil.

527
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:36,750
Yes.

528
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:40,323
Speak louder!

529
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:43,954
If you keep at it, a riot will arise!

530
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,250
What?

531
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:49,784
You eat all you want
but cut our rations in half!

532
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:51,698
And if you even use force,

533
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:52,868
think people will stay still?

534
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Then what?

535
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:03,578
We eat all the food,
then each other when it's all gone?

536
00:42:03,917 --> 00:42:04,917
What?

537
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,240
How could you...

538
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:11,539
If you don't want to see that hell,
shut up and listen!

539
00:42:12,417 --> 00:42:13,417
Understood?

540
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:20,455
Understood?

541
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,198
When the food is gone...

542
00:42:26,208 --> 00:42:29,496
Throw them to the starving
people one by one.

543
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,286
Yes, sir!

544
00:42:32,458 --> 00:42:35,074
You know where we are, don't you?

545
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:39,614
Did you bring us to a strange place
to screw us over?

546
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:43,083
I told you we've never seen this before!

547
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:46,199
Maybe god is testing our limits!

548
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:52,662
God? What god? And what limits?

549
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:57,034
We'll know when we run out of food.

550
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:06,581
There is no god!

551
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:11,116
Give one meal per day

552
00:43:11,542 --> 00:43:13,142
and reduce it to one-fourth from now on.

553
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:18,202
Got that?

554
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:37,368
We'll eat that when we run out of food?

555
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:44,832
When will all that grow?

556
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:50,281
How will it be enough for all these people?

557
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:57,745
There's not enough dirt
to raise the plants.

558
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,035
Found any weapons?

559
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,662
We're searching from the bottom up, sir.

560
00:44:09,667 --> 00:44:14,081
There's gotta be something!
Find it quickly!

561
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:16,160
We're looking, sir.

562
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:21,075
Check the udt's storage in the basement.

563
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:25,081
- Go!
- Yes, sir!

564
00:44:32,417 --> 00:44:33,702
Must be something here.

565
00:44:35,542 --> 00:44:36,907
I found an ammo box!

566
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:38,373
- Where?
- Here.

567
00:44:45,167 --> 00:44:48,785
Great! We can blow them up with these!

568
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:51,119
If these all explode,

569
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:53,164
won't we all die together?

570
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:55,664
We'll use 'em carefully one by one.

571
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,662
Hide them for now.

572
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:21,417
Eat up.

573
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,241
What good is only us eating well?

574
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,582
We'll all starve to death.

575
00:45:28,917 --> 00:45:30,828
Even so, until we're alive

576
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:33,415
we keep our status and dignity.

577
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:36,039
Just shut up and eat.

578
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:44,582
Why do you eat all you want?

579
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,490
How is this fair?

580
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,865
So what?

581
00:45:54,417 --> 00:45:55,417
Stop it.

582
00:45:57,625 --> 00:45:59,331
Come on, we're accomplices!

583
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,285
Come with me!

584
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:04,663
Let's go!

585
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:05,827
I said stop!

586
00:46:06,292 --> 00:46:07,247
Why you little!

587
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,615
Stop and sit down!

588
00:46:51,667 --> 00:46:55,956
He's raising them to eat
when the food runs out?

589
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:02,322
It'll only last 2 months at most.

590
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,991
They won't grow in time to feed us.

591
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:07,494
Why are you staring?

592
00:47:10,417 --> 00:47:17,243
What did the gangster mean
by "accomplices"?

593
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:25,745
Someone touched me
when I was unconscious, was it you?

594
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:27,583
I'm sorry.

595
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,035
But...

596
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:03,285
Why separate the dung and urine?

597
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:13,868
Oh! I heard urine is good for vegetables.

598
00:48:24,542 --> 00:48:26,328
Planting fruit too?

599
00:48:27,417 --> 00:48:28,907
That's crazy.

600
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:34,281
It'll take years for fruit to grow.

601
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:37,244
How will we eat that?

602
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,830
Crazy fools!

603
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:24,657
Bring 'em out!

604
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,250
Watch closely!

605
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:39,706
If you touch the food,
you end up like this!

606
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,322
- Don't feed 'em for 2 days!
- Yes, sir!

607
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,786
They stole the food so we punished them.

608
00:49:53,708 --> 00:49:54,993
Good job!

609
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:03,118
Listen carefully.

610
00:50:04,417 --> 00:50:05,417
Anything you say, sir!

611
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:08,699
People will start going crazy
out of starvation.

612
00:50:09,542 --> 00:50:12,124
Then they'll attack us to death!

613
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:17,573
We gotta get weapons before that happens.

614
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:28,744
Your safety comes first, chief.

615
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:32,493
You scared me.

616
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:38,949
Captain must be after us too.

617
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:41,873
We gotta suppress him first.

618
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:43,417
Yes, sir.

619
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:49,865
They can't be trusted.
Blow them up first with grenades!

620
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:55,243
What?

621
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:57,698
Forgive me.

622
00:50:58,333 --> 00:51:00,119
How can I forgive you?

623
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:07,581
"Warning: Restricted area"

624
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:43,708
What are you doing?

625
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:45,365
Just watch.

626
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:17,615
What are you doing?

627
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:20,574
Gonna have all the food?

628
00:52:22,542 --> 00:52:25,739
You even have weapons! I saw them!

629
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:32,414
Distribute the food fairly
and stop acting like toy soldiers!

630
00:52:32,417 --> 00:52:37,787
Cut the shit! You wanna die too?

631
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:40,243
You devils!

632
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:43,198
Why you!

633
00:52:47,792 --> 00:52:48,952
Damn bastard!

634
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:49,958
Enough!

635
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,490
Leave them alone.

636
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,080
Excuse me!

637
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:23,865
Son of a bitch!

638
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,080
What the fuck!

639
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:45,366
What is it?

640
00:53:46,542 --> 00:53:48,248
Give me one!

641
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,332
Stupid jerks!

642
00:53:58,333 --> 00:53:59,573
Where'd you get this?

643
00:54:05,667 --> 00:54:07,203
Son of a bitch!

644
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:30,368
Stand straight!

645
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:36,413
I'm sorry, sir!

646
00:54:36,417 --> 00:54:39,614
It's my fault. It won't happen again, sir!

647
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:48,240
Stop! Damn it!

648
00:54:50,708 --> 00:54:55,156
If it wasn't for us,
you two would be long dead!

649
00:54:58,833 --> 00:54:59,833
I'm sorry, sir.

650
00:55:00,417 --> 00:55:02,328
You are supposed to set examples,

651
00:55:03,292 --> 00:55:06,125
but you sell food for money?

652
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:09,700
I'm sorry, sir! We won't mess up again!

653
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:17,697
Fine. You'd better.

654
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:27,415
Isn't it harsh for sneaking out some food?

655
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:32,156
So why give him a reason to hit! Assholes!

656
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:37,915
Why do we have to bow down to him?

657
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,659
We're the strongest here.

658
00:55:40,667 --> 00:55:41,998
Why'd you give him the gun?

659
00:55:42,542 --> 00:55:43,952
Gave him all the bullets, too?

660
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:49,160
If he hits us again, he's getting it.

661
00:56:00,542 --> 00:56:01,542
Does it hurt?

662
00:56:03,792 --> 00:56:07,535
We have to set an example, right?

663
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:11,037
There's a limit to how much I can take.

664
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,740
Show me some respect.

665
00:56:16,667 --> 00:56:17,667
Right.

666
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:21,115
I will.

667
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:42,325
Will they really grow to feed us

668
00:56:43,042 --> 00:56:44,657
when the food is gone?

669
00:56:45,458 --> 00:56:50,282
Not everyone, but it'll feed one.

670
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:53,867
Who? The old man?

671
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:55,458
I don't know.

672
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:59,742
There must be a reason he's growing them.

673
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:06,166
I think the old man knows where we are.

674
00:57:07,042 --> 00:57:08,657
Did he say anything?

675
00:57:09,167 --> 00:57:10,703
What'll happen to us?

676
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:16,373
He just smiles without saying anything.

677
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:26,415
I could gather only a bit.

678
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:12,331
No!

679
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:19,243
Let go of me!

680
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:30,530
Why! Why!

681
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:38,121
You know everything that happened to me!

682
00:58:39,292 --> 00:58:42,955
This is a sinful baby!

683
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:17,868
It's filthy!

684
00:59:19,542 --> 00:59:22,955
It's the seed of the devils!

685
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:28,450
It's a precious life growing out of shit?

686
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:33,324
Still, 1 don't want to have this baby!

687
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,500
Hungry?

688
00:59:57,292 --> 00:59:58,292
Here.

689
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,615
Food!

690
01:00:01,167 --> 01:00:02,532
Hold your horses!

691
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:05,039
Calm down!

692
01:00:08,125 --> 01:00:09,535
Eat slowly, bitch!

693
01:00:09,542 --> 01:00:10,748
Don't eat it all!

694
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:13,494
Don't hit me!

695
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,491
There's more. Eat slowly.

696
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:32,365
Need a girl?

697
01:00:36,667 --> 01:00:38,077
You're no different.

698
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:41,914
We'll all die here anyway.

699
01:00:42,417 --> 01:00:44,408
Think there's a way out?

700
01:00:48,333 --> 01:00:51,496
Life is about satisfying
what you want till you die.

701
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,115
I thought it over.

702
01:01:05,917 --> 01:01:07,407
I can't do it.

703
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:10,618
Fine.

704
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:19,499
Maybe it could be takashi's baby.

705
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,911
I won't harm it.

706
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,240
Listen up!

707
01:02:14,458 --> 01:02:18,827
No food distribution today.

708
01:02:18,833 --> 01:02:22,155
We'll give you food once
every three days now.

709
01:02:24,167 --> 01:02:27,204
What? I bet they're stuffing themselves!

710
01:02:27,292 --> 01:02:28,702
Damn bastards!

711
01:02:29,667 --> 01:02:31,749
Let's go check!

712
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:43,073
You'll give it to the girl?

713
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,957
Cut the crap and just eat.

714
01:02:57,417 --> 01:03:01,365
People are getting edgy.
The gun won't scare them.

715
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:03,292
I know.

716
01:03:13,542 --> 01:03:18,787
Don't worry. I'll have the baby.

717
01:03:21,292 --> 01:03:27,948
As the plants grow bigger,
won't you need more soil?

718
01:04:02,792 --> 01:04:06,705
You want me to overcome my hatred?

719
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,661
Is that possible?

720
01:04:20,417 --> 01:04:21,657
I'll try.

721
01:04:36,167 --> 01:04:38,249
Came again? Get lost!

722
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:41,287
Scram you bastards!

723
01:04:45,792 --> 01:04:47,248
Get lost!

724
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:52,411
We want to eat!

725
01:04:53,792 --> 01:04:55,373
I know it must be hard for you,

726
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:58,457
but we don't know when this will end.

727
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:02,951
We'll feed you every third day
to conserve the food.

728
01:05:02,958 --> 01:05:04,073
Bear with us.

729
01:05:04,083 --> 01:05:07,155
Then why do you eat so much!

730
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:08,953
You're taking our food!

731
01:05:08,958 --> 01:05:10,494
I can't take it anymore!

732
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,411
Let's take over the food supply!

733
01:05:12,417 --> 01:05:14,078
Let's go!

734
01:05:15,042 --> 01:05:15,701
What the fuck?

735
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:18,245
Damn bastards!

736
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:45,750
Shit...

737
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:48,540
He's dead?

738
01:05:48,542 --> 01:05:53,161
Anyone who touches the food
will end up like him!

739
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:01,914
Get rid of him!

740
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:03,708
Yes, sir.

741
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:05,993
Move fools!

742
01:06:07,042 --> 01:06:08,953
Get out of here!

743
01:06:10,792 --> 01:06:12,453
Hurry!

744
01:06:17,583 --> 01:06:18,583
What?

745
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:38,581
Get rid of him, oldie.

746
01:06:45,667 --> 01:06:46,952
We can't wait any longer.

747
01:06:47,625 --> 01:06:49,661
If a riot arises, we'll be in danger too.

748
01:06:50,417 --> 01:06:52,203
We gotta get rid of them first!

749
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:53,788
Get the grenades!

750
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:55,167
Yes, sir!

751
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:16,905
What are you doing? That's so cruel!

752
01:08:53,125 --> 01:08:55,662
I'm going beyond my limits.

753
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:05,656
The disgrace of having a baby
without knowing its father.

754
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:11,366
It doesn't even matter now.

755
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:20,957
Calm down. Nothing's happened yet.

756
01:09:21,167 --> 01:09:23,579
Can't you see the people going crazy?

757
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:26,574
Didn't you intend that
by cutting down the food?

758
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:31,490
Now, stop giving them food all together.

759
01:09:34,542 --> 01:09:36,999
You'll stir up a riot and kill 'em all?

760
01:09:37,458 --> 01:09:39,119
Think we'd just sit and watch?

761
01:09:39,583 --> 01:09:41,039
The food is ours!

762
01:09:43,167 --> 01:09:44,247
What the hell?

763
01:09:44,625 --> 01:09:45,625
Where'd you get that?

764
01:09:46,208 --> 01:09:47,744
There's more!

765
01:09:48,792 --> 01:09:51,659
Join us! I'll give you half the food!

766
01:09:51,667 --> 01:09:52,667
No!

767
01:09:52,958 --> 01:09:54,698
If you die, it's all ours!

768
01:09:54,708 --> 01:09:55,788
Think I'm stupid?

769
01:09:55,875 --> 01:09:59,663
Fuck! I shouldn't have listened to you!

770
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,072
Go see if there is a god or not!

771
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,910
Farewell bastards!

772
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:24,286
Where's the rest of them?

773
01:10:29,333 --> 01:10:30,333
Good.

774
01:10:31,833 --> 01:10:33,289
This will be enough.

775
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,615
How much food is there left?

776
01:10:45,125 --> 01:10:46,535
About a week's worth

777
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:47,952
if everyone eats once every 3 days.

778
01:10:48,292 --> 01:10:49,623
What if we only eat?

779
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:50,875
About a month.

780
01:10:51,292 --> 01:10:52,577
A month...

781
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:55,449
What are you thinking? Don't do it!

782
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:56,914
You stay out of it!

783
01:10:57,667 --> 01:10:58,998
Why are you so cruel?

784
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:01,456
If I'm not, we'll die!

785
01:11:09,708 --> 01:11:11,573
There will be a riot soon.

786
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:12,958
I know.

787
01:11:13,208 --> 01:11:14,539
If they attack us together,

788
01:11:14,542 --> 01:11:15,657
we're through!

789
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:18,449
Lure them to the food storage.

790
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,240
What if they take all the food?

791
01:11:20,833 --> 01:11:22,869
Move it elsewhere before.

792
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:29,990
Open up!

793
01:11:30,833 --> 01:11:31,833
What the hell...

794
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:38,203
Tell me if you need more food.

795
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:40,706
It's not even yours.

796
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:46,164
Convince your father to share fairly

797
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,706
and wait for god's will.

798
01:11:48,917 --> 01:11:50,782
He won't listen to me.

799
01:11:51,583 --> 01:11:54,825
If people rise up in a riot, we'll all die.

800
01:11:57,667 --> 01:11:58,873
I know.

801
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:04,413
What's wrong?

802
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:08,957
It's a gift from you men.

803
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:13,707
Or it could be takashi's.

804
01:12:16,292 --> 01:12:21,867
Now, I think it doesn't matter
whose baby this is.

805
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,869
Even if we all die, this baby must survive.

806
01:12:28,667 --> 01:12:30,623
It could be my baby too.

807
01:12:31,333 --> 01:12:34,200
The baby is our future.

808
01:12:36,167 --> 01:12:41,332
That's why the old man
is planting and raising crops.

809
01:12:42,333 --> 01:12:44,540
I'll protect this baby to the end.

810
01:12:45,792 --> 01:12:50,161
Help me keep this baby.

811
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:56,203
Get in! Hurry up!

812
01:12:57,458 --> 01:12:59,244
It's suffocating in here!

813
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:01,081
Just hide in there or else you'll die!

814
01:13:02,875 --> 01:13:05,241
Don't come out until we open the door.

815
01:13:09,667 --> 01:13:10,667
Put 'em down.

816
01:13:14,792 --> 01:13:15,952
This is everything.

817
01:13:17,208 --> 01:13:18,208
Where were you?

818
01:13:18,458 --> 01:13:19,994
To fuck the chicks.

819
01:13:25,417 --> 01:13:26,497
It's stuffy in here!

820
01:13:28,042 --> 01:13:30,033
I'm leaving too!

821
01:13:30,042 --> 01:13:31,202
Come back here!

822
01:13:48,708 --> 01:13:50,118
One, two! One, two!

823
01:13:51,125 --> 01:13:53,116
You must be all starving.

824
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:57,371
You'll get regular meals from today,

825
01:13:57,375 --> 01:13:59,787
so please come to the food storage!

826
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Wait!

827
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:26,249
They're up to something. Don't fall for it.

828
01:14:27,958 --> 01:14:28,958
Captain!

829
01:14:29,208 --> 01:14:32,075
Those bastards moved the food elsewhere.

830
01:14:34,375 --> 01:14:37,447
What!

831
01:14:37,542 --> 01:14:40,454
There's no food here!

832
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:43,780
- It's empty!
- Go back!

833
01:14:44,583 --> 01:14:46,414
There's no food!

834
01:14:46,417 --> 01:14:48,408
The bastards took it all!

835
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:51,159
- Fuck! It's a trap!
- Bastards!

836
01:14:51,167 --> 01:14:53,203
- They locked us up to kill us!
- Let's run!

837
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:55,199
Let's get out!

838
01:15:07,375 --> 01:15:09,411
Open up!

839
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:14,119
Open!

840
01:15:15,667 --> 01:15:16,873
Wait!

841
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,615
I have a bad feeling.

842
01:15:21,542 --> 01:15:22,748
Let's hide in here.

843
01:15:43,958 --> 01:15:44,958
Stay focused!

844
01:16:00,708 --> 01:16:02,949
Hurry! Kill those bastards!

845
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:13,956
Motherfuckers!

846
01:16:20,667 --> 01:16:21,667
What happened?

847
01:16:21,958 --> 01:16:23,038
They're locked up!

848
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:24,747
Grenade!

849
01:16:30,667 --> 01:16:31,667
No, dad!

850
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:33,118
Move!

851
01:16:35,583 --> 01:16:36,583
Open it!

852
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:43,707
What? It's a grenade!

853
01:16:50,167 --> 01:16:51,202
Where else?

854
01:16:51,625 --> 01:16:52,625
This way, sir!

855
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:03,375
Grenade!

856
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:06,282
Grenade!

857
01:17:08,292 --> 01:17:09,498
Are you crazy, dad!

858
01:17:12,625 --> 01:17:13,625
Open it!

859
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,500
It's a grenade!

860
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:27,208
Go!

861
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:28,660
Kill everyone!

862
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:32,750
Follow me.

863
01:17:58,833 --> 01:18:01,040
Don't!

864
01:18:36,167 --> 01:18:37,623
Go away!

865
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:46,914
Don't!

866
01:19:06,042 --> 01:19:06,997
Honey!

867
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,581
It's all over!

868
01:19:11,583 --> 01:19:12,197
Go away!

869
01:19:12,583 --> 01:19:13,993
Son of a bitch!

870
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:20,958
Grenade!

871
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:36,116
All I did was follow your orders.

872
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:39,540
Damn coward.

873
01:19:42,833 --> 01:19:45,620
But where is the captain and his crew?

874
01:19:46,083 --> 01:19:47,539
Probably dead inside there.

875
01:19:48,667 --> 01:19:49,998
No, they're not there.

876
01:19:52,375 --> 01:19:53,581
Stop giving me orders!

877
01:19:54,542 --> 01:19:55,452
What?

878
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:59,952
You're nothing but a selfish politician
out to save only yourself!

879
01:20:02,167 --> 01:20:04,123
Damn gangster shit!

880
01:20:05,125 --> 01:20:09,573
Find the captain and kill him! Now!

881
01:20:11,042 --> 01:20:12,873
Son of a bitch.

882
01:20:44,417 --> 01:20:45,702
Let's go hide.

883
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:25,370
Su-hyun?

884
01:21:25,667 --> 01:21:29,831
Su-hyun!

885
01:21:30,458 --> 01:21:31,458
Su-hyun...

886
01:21:59,667 --> 01:22:01,032
Are you insane?

887
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:06,490
If I wasn't, how do you explain this?

888
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:11,075
You got two more bullets. Use 'em wisely.

889
01:22:17,208 --> 01:22:18,243
Where's the food?

890
01:22:18,625 --> 01:22:20,105
I'll tell you if you give me the gun.

891
01:22:20,542 --> 01:22:22,157
Not until I see the food.

892
01:22:22,958 --> 01:22:26,200
Lead me to it before the captain takes it.

893
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:31,325
Lead the way, asshole!

894
01:22:46,333 --> 01:22:47,413
Captain!

895
01:22:47,417 --> 01:22:49,078
What the hell are you doing?

896
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:52,500
You bastard!

897
01:22:52,833 --> 01:22:54,164
Motherfuckers!

898
01:22:54,583 --> 01:22:58,781
You'll starve to death miserably,
fucking bastards!

899
01:23:02,167 --> 01:23:03,167
What the hell!

900
01:23:04,292 --> 01:23:06,624
Put the fire out now!

901
01:23:06,625 --> 01:23:09,742
Stop bossing me around, you bastard!

902
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:11,365
You son of a bitch!

903
01:23:32,583 --> 01:23:36,405
"Time"

904
01:26:58,375 --> 01:27:00,366
Fuck! It's all burned!

905
01:27:04,375 --> 01:27:05,375
What?

906
01:27:15,083 --> 01:27:19,622
Damn shit. You wanna live that badly?

907
01:27:20,625 --> 01:27:22,741
Fuck! Are you insane?

908
01:27:23,292 --> 01:27:25,533
Who are you calling shit?

909
01:27:26,167 --> 01:27:30,991
You and me, we're all shit!

910
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:33,331
Bastard.

911
01:27:42,375 --> 01:27:43,785
Damn it!

912
01:27:47,625 --> 01:27:52,289
Having no food makes me hungrier.

913
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:54,248
Fuck. Me too.

914
01:27:54,708 --> 01:27:55,708
It's gross!

915
01:27:58,292 --> 01:27:59,828
Your greed led to this!

916
01:28:01,167 --> 01:28:03,408
- I'm starving!
- Now what?

917
01:28:04,667 --> 01:28:06,032
We eat each other?

918
01:28:07,875 --> 01:28:08,875
What?

919
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:28,621
I think we've reached the end.

920
01:28:29,875 --> 01:28:33,572
What did you expect after living like shit?

921
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:39,290
I don't care about others,
but I feel sorry to you.

922
01:28:39,917 --> 01:28:40,952
No need.

923
01:28:42,417 --> 01:28:43,907
Just excessive obligations

924
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:46,206
being either parents or children.

925
01:28:48,208 --> 01:28:49,493
Hungry?

926
01:28:54,458 --> 01:28:56,494
What the hell? Are you crazy?

927
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:58,990
If you eat me and live,

928
01:28:59,583 --> 01:29:01,164
then I'd be still alive.

929
01:29:04,833 --> 01:29:06,369
Everyone's gone insane!

930
01:29:08,833 --> 01:29:10,198
Listen to me!

931
01:29:11,083 --> 01:29:13,074
We'll all turn into cannibals!

932
01:29:13,958 --> 01:29:16,791
Eat before you're eaten to survive!

933
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,661
What good is living like that?

934
01:29:18,667 --> 01:29:19,952
Surviving is what matters!

935
01:29:22,125 --> 01:29:23,125
Dad!

936
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:28,661
From now on, there's no dad.

937
01:29:51,917 --> 01:29:53,032
What is it?

938
01:30:02,208 --> 01:30:05,450
We can't eat them before they lay eggs?

939
01:30:08,417 --> 01:30:10,203
Then we can't eat the vegetables

940
01:30:10,208 --> 01:30:12,369
before they form seeds?

941
01:30:20,333 --> 01:30:21,573
Don't look at me like that.

942
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:22,948
Like what?

943
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:26,121
- Like you'll eat me!
- I did not!

944
01:30:26,125 --> 01:30:28,411
Stay away from me!

945
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,491
I can kill you both!

946
01:30:32,042 --> 01:30:33,327
What is death?

947
01:30:34,625 --> 01:30:36,991
Cut the crap at a time like this.

948
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,242
Is death the end?

949
01:30:41,833 --> 01:30:47,157
Those that eat me
after I die will keep living.

950
01:30:48,417 --> 01:30:50,874
What kind of bullshit is that?

951
01:30:52,583 --> 01:30:54,039
I'm so hungry.

952
01:30:55,833 --> 01:30:59,781
Fuck! I can't take it!
I'm going to eat that bitch!

953
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:05,953
Stop staring at me!

954
01:31:10,042 --> 01:31:11,202
Wanna live?

955
01:31:15,333 --> 01:31:16,493
Want me as your meat?

956
01:31:17,292 --> 01:31:18,327
Crazy bastard!

957
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:22,866
Then you'll be my meat?

958
01:31:24,625 --> 01:31:26,707
Dying is not the end.

959
01:31:27,708 --> 01:31:29,869
You'll keep living within me.

960
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:38,206
But I think you'll taste gross.

961
01:31:40,958 --> 01:31:43,415
All the food got burned.

962
01:31:45,292 --> 01:31:49,615
No wonder. It's because of mistrust.

963
01:31:57,333 --> 01:32:00,040
Back off if you don't wanna die!

964
01:32:00,042 --> 01:32:01,122
Stop it!

965
01:32:03,542 --> 01:32:04,702
That was my gun.

966
01:32:04,708 --> 01:32:07,199
So stop it, shithead!

967
01:32:15,292 --> 01:32:16,828
You son of a bitch!

968
01:32:18,417 --> 01:32:20,248
I told you to use the bullet wisely.

969
01:32:31,208 --> 01:32:32,448
Bastard!

970
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:40,956
You stay back!

971
01:32:42,708 --> 01:32:43,743
Shoot me!

972
01:32:44,917 --> 01:32:47,749
The devil wants to save his son?

973
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:49,661
After killing all the innocent people?

974
01:32:49,667 --> 01:32:52,158
Cut the bullshit and shoot!

975
01:32:52,167 --> 01:32:53,282
I willl

976
01:32:59,542 --> 01:33:00,622
Dad!

977
01:33:07,208 --> 01:33:09,415
Got something to say?

978
01:33:12,875 --> 01:33:15,708
What? Speak up!

979
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:21,786
It was a role?

980
01:33:24,708 --> 01:33:27,074
Living so mercilessly like that?

981
01:33:27,542 --> 01:33:30,659
Still quibbling even as you die!

982
01:33:40,208 --> 01:33:45,032
So my life is a damn
role to torture others?

983
01:33:46,792 --> 01:33:49,534
Then I'll do my best to the end!

984
01:34:18,833 --> 01:34:20,915
Fuck! He tastes gross.

985
01:34:55,333 --> 01:34:56,664
What did you eat?

986
01:34:59,583 --> 01:35:00,583
Stab me!

987
01:35:01,208 --> 01:35:02,208
Try it!

988
01:35:02,583 --> 01:35:03,242
Go on!

989
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:05,366
Stab me, bitch!

990
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:09,616
- Strip!
- What's with you?

991
01:35:09,625 --> 01:35:11,786
I'm hungry! Strip!

992
01:35:21,917 --> 01:35:25,364
What comes first? An
appetite for food or sex?

993
01:35:27,167 --> 01:35:28,657
An appetite for sex?

994
01:35:28,667 --> 01:35:29,907
Then lie down!

995
01:35:49,625 --> 01:35:50,660
Oh baby!

996
01:36:34,125 --> 01:36:38,198
It's so bland. Where's the salt?

997
01:37:14,125 --> 01:37:15,990
It could be your baby!

998
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,037
If you shoot, it'll get hurt!

999
01:37:21,667 --> 01:37:23,623
You're really pregnant?

1000
01:37:23,625 --> 01:37:27,447
Yes! A cruel gift from god!

1001
01:37:27,708 --> 01:37:31,576
If it's mine, then we're family!

1002
01:37:32,333 --> 01:37:33,869
Crazy bastard!

1003
01:37:34,583 --> 01:37:36,790
It can't be the child of shit like you!

1004
01:37:37,625 --> 01:37:39,490
There'd be no hope for the future!

1005
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:41,456
You think it's yours?

1006
01:37:42,458 --> 01:37:44,073
If it has your dad's genes,

1007
01:37:44,083 --> 01:37:46,415
there's no future either!

1008
01:37:48,458 --> 01:37:51,165
Say it! Whose baby is it?

1009
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,786
You liked it the most when I did it, right?

1010
01:37:54,792 --> 01:37:57,078
Shut up! You filthy piece of shit!

1011
01:37:57,792 --> 01:37:59,703
It doesn't matter whose it is.

1012
01:38:00,542 --> 01:38:02,282
It's just a seed.

1013
01:38:05,167 --> 01:38:07,283
Fucking bastard!

1014
01:38:08,333 --> 01:38:11,496
Your role is acting good like your dad?

1015
01:38:11,917 --> 01:38:16,866
Then my role is to get rid of
rotten shit like you!

1016
01:38:19,292 --> 01:38:23,035
Fuck! Shoot me!

1017
01:38:23,292 --> 01:38:26,079
If 1 die, who'll raise the baby?

1018
01:38:26,083 --> 01:38:27,243
Shoot him now!

1019
01:38:27,542 --> 01:38:32,411
Promise you'll protect the baby
no matter what!

1020
01:38:33,375 --> 01:38:34,080
I promise!

1021
01:38:34,083 --> 01:38:35,539
Fuck!

1022
01:38:36,958 --> 01:38:40,906
Swear you won't touch the baby
no matter how hungry you are!

1023
01:38:41,167 --> 01:38:42,327
I swear!

1024
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:45,331
Keep your word!

1025
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:47,410
Help me!

1026
01:38:48,667 --> 01:38:51,454
Kill him and live with me!

1027
01:38:51,458 --> 01:38:53,369
I'll treat you well!

1028
01:38:53,375 --> 01:38:55,536
Let me play a good role for a change!

1029
01:39:17,458 --> 01:39:19,039
You promised!

1030
01:39:27,792 --> 01:39:29,498
Why take his clothes off?

1031
01:40:16,292 --> 01:40:20,035
We're starving. Can't we eat that?

1032
01:40:22,042 --> 01:40:26,456
I'm okay, but I'm worried about the baby.

1033
01:40:38,417 --> 01:40:40,123
How can we eat this?

1034
01:40:43,958 --> 01:40:47,280
Could this be my dad?

1035
01:40:50,833 --> 01:40:52,118
It's just food.

1036
01:42:15,958 --> 01:42:19,530
What will the baby's future be like?

1037
01:42:19,958 --> 01:42:22,040
Probably the same as ours.

1038
01:42:22,458 --> 01:42:26,406
If it's the same, why should it live?

1039
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:31,869
Because it must live. No other reason.

1040
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,118
One of us will die, right?

1041
01:42:39,083 --> 01:42:42,655
If I die, there will be no future.

1042
01:42:43,458 --> 01:42:49,408
Then I have to be food for the baby?

1043
01:42:50,625 --> 01:42:55,289
I hope the hens lay eggs
before that happens.

1044
01:42:56,292 --> 01:42:58,032
That's impossible.

1045
01:42:59,667 --> 01:43:05,708
Then my role is to be
sacrificed for the baby?

1046
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:07,956
Probably.

1047
01:43:21,292 --> 01:43:23,032
You said if I eat you,

1048
01:43:23,875 --> 01:43:27,163
you'll be living in me.

1049
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:37,992
I'm saving you now!

1050
01:43:38,958 --> 01:43:44,498
Within me, there is no death!

1051
01:43:59,125 --> 01:44:00,706
It's rotten!

1052
01:44:03,250 --> 01:44:05,992
The chicken! Let's eat it!

1053
01:44:06,625 --> 01:44:10,243
No! Not till it lays eggs!

1054
01:44:11,167 --> 01:44:12,167
I'm hungry!

1055
01:44:12,958 --> 01:44:14,619
I'm going crazy here!

1056
01:44:16,542 --> 01:44:17,542
Open up.

1057
01:44:20,375 --> 01:44:21,535
Open the door!

1058
01:44:29,417 --> 01:44:31,373
I'm hungry! Open up!

1059
01:44:32,125 --> 01:44:34,081
Open up! Damn it!

1060
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:38,036
That old man is fucking with us!

1061
01:44:38,542 --> 01:44:40,282
He's eating alone, isn't he!

1062
01:44:40,292 --> 01:44:41,748
I don't think so.

1063
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,786
Fuck! I'm starving!

1064
01:44:45,792 --> 01:44:47,282
Stop it!

1065
01:44:48,042 --> 01:44:50,454
Crazy? Not you too!

1066
01:44:53,708 --> 01:44:55,994
Open up now!

1067
01:44:59,542 --> 01:45:01,032
I'm hungry.

1068
01:45:01,958 --> 01:45:05,075
I have to eat something for the baby!

1069
01:45:22,125 --> 01:45:23,490
I thought there was no more meat.

1070
01:45:33,167 --> 01:45:37,581
I'm so sorry.

1071
01:45:51,083 --> 01:45:52,744
I get it now.

1072
01:45:55,375 --> 01:46:02,747
Why the old man protected
me and the baby...

1073
01:46:11,042 --> 01:46:19,042
Even if we're gone, time will go on.

1074
01:46:52,167 --> 01:46:54,328
I woke up out of hunger.

1075
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:57,615
Me too.

1076
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:55,536
We can last a few more days!

1077
01:48:05,167 --> 01:48:09,160
Where'd he go? Wasn't he god?

1078
01:48:30,625 --> 01:48:33,992
Let's eat just one chicken.

1079
01:48:37,417 --> 01:48:41,330
No. Not till it lays eggs.

1080
01:48:43,333 --> 01:48:45,415
The old man is gone. Who cares!

1081
01:48:55,833 --> 01:48:56,833
No!

1082
01:48:58,083 --> 01:48:59,323
Just one!

1083
01:48:59,333 --> 01:49:00,914
Not until it lays eggs!

1084
01:49:03,583 --> 01:49:05,915
Open up!

1085
01:49:10,208 --> 01:49:12,494
Open the damn door!

1086
01:49:13,417 --> 01:49:14,076
No!

1087
01:49:14,375 --> 01:49:15,740
Just one!

1088
01:49:16,583 --> 01:49:18,448
Let's just eat one chicken!

1089
01:49:18,667 --> 01:49:19,747
No!

1090
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:21,500
Damn it!

1091
01:49:40,208 --> 01:49:41,573
Open it!

1092
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:51,368
You bitch!

1093
01:49:56,625 --> 01:49:58,286
No!

1094
01:50:00,875 --> 01:50:01,875
Then what?

1095
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,286
Take that out and eat it?

1096
01:50:05,667 --> 01:50:06,667
No!

1097
01:50:07,208 --> 01:50:09,449
You promised to protect it!

1098
01:50:10,083 --> 01:50:11,083
Shit.

1099
01:50:11,125 --> 01:50:12,365
Wait!

1100
01:50:13,208 --> 01:50:16,325
What can I do? I'm starving to death!

1101
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:46,617
Fuck! I'm sick of eating human meat.

1102
01:50:55,792 --> 01:50:57,077
No!

1103
01:51:59,167 --> 01:52:00,657
Who are you?

1104
01:52:04,167 --> 01:52:06,123
Why did you come to me?

1105
01:54:25,250 --> 01:54:28,242
"And human"

1106
01:56:03,667 --> 01:56:07,159
"17 years later”
