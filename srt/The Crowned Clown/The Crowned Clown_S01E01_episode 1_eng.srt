 The characters, organizations, locations, and events in this drama are fiction and have no relation to historical facts.

8
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,740
 Father.

9
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,950
 Father.

10
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,080
Father.

11
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:08,880
Yool, it saddens me deeply not to see you

12
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,860
grow up before I go.

13
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,900
Father.

14
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,180
Father.

15
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,170
Father.

16
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,320
Young Lord.

17
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,370
Crown Prince.

18
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,190
Come closer.

19
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,740
Tell me, Your Majesty.

20
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:15,140
When I think about passing on the royal throne that I have protected with my bloody tears

21
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,060
to an undeserving arse like you,

22
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:27,880
it makes me so angry that I can't close my eyes.

23
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:34,090
I'm worried that you might persecute

24
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:40,730
the young prince Gyeongin because of your

25
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,970
resentment against me.

26
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:52,230
Promise me that you'll protect your little brother.

27
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:03,050
Your Majesty, that's not how you ask for a favor.

28
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:10,150
You need to plead with tears and beg on your hands and knees.

29
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,190
This punk...

30
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,370
Alright, I'll watch over you...

31
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,690
how your world will unfold...

32
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:53,170
what-what actions you will take,

33
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,950
this insolent punk.

34
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,990
Father!

35
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,820
Father.

36
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,550
Pay him proper respect.

37
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,210
The king has passed!

38
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:07,000
The king has passed!

39
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,500
The king has passed!

40
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,300
Your Majesty!

41
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,590
Your Majesty!

42
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,710
Your Majesty!

43
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:39,590
Your Majesty, the throne you kept with your blood and tears,

44
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,190
I'll protect it well.

45
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,540
So please go in peace.

46
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:09,080
 It will be awesome if you do well but deadly if you don't!

47
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,320
Let's have fun!

48
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,990
 Episode 1

49
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,550
How exciting!

50
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,240
Alright!

51
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,900
In all eight provinces of Joseon,

52
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,560
do you know what the scariest thing is that will make people pee their pants in fear?

53
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,680
I know!

54
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,810
- The scariest thing is a tiger!
 - Definitely not!

55
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,300
- Then dried persimmons?
 - Lords?

56
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,760
- Isn't it loneliness? 
 - No, no!

57
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,930
- It's not that. 
- Then what?

58
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,320
More than Highness Ho Hwan and

59
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,970
scarier than the savages who cut off your nose and ears,

60
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,640
that punk is...

61
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,070
Where is he?  What?  What? What is he?

62
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,910
Ah, that person.

63
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:29,950
Even a ghost spits and

64
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,730
avoids this country's infamous rogue.

65
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,280
The rogue.

66
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,510
That loutish bastard.

67
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,700
He's the bastard?

68
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,370
You punk, I am the king of this country.

69
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,950
How dare you try to go in front of me without any fear?

70
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:56,100
Bring that punk at once and beat him!

71
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,360
What are you doing?

72
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,010
Don't stop the torture until he confesses.

73
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,330
Yes, sir!

74
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,790
Stop!

75
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:29,160
Wait. Please just spare my life.

76
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,310
Then, who is the leader of this attempt at treason?

77
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,150
Tell me the name.

78
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,910
Give me the name!

79
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:56,530
It's Prince of the Court Neung Chang.

80
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:00,730
Neung Chang? Are you talking about Prince Gyeongin's maternal grandfather?

81
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,360
Yes.

82
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,090
Your Majesty, what should I do?

83
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,380
Bring that criminal at once!

84
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,820
What do you mean treason? Who said such things?

85
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,390
I'll go see the queen dowager right now!

86
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,800
I don't think so.

87
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:43,430
What are you going to do after seeing the queen dowager?

88
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,410
You wretch, Sin Chi Soo! With your sly tongue,

89
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,840
what did you tell His Majesty?

90
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,720
Do you think I will just sit around and watch?

91
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:02,690
When I see the king myself, I will report all of your crimes!

92
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,590
Mother!

93
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,370
How dare you touch him?!

94
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,950
You wretches! Let him go at once!

95
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,190
You wicked girls, whom do you think you are putting your hands on?

96
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,130
Prince! Prince!

97
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,370
Prince!

98
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:51,140
Your Majesty, how can you be so cruel to your mother?

99
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:56,710
Is it not enough to kill my innocent father? And now you take my innocent son, too?

100
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,170
Do you not fear the heavens?

101
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,810
Your Majesty!

102
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,340
Your Majesty, why would the young prince

103
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,530
plan treason?

104
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:26,360
While you've punished his grandfather, you must acknowledge his innocence.

105
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,940
- Your Majesty. 
- Your Majesty!

106
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,760
You cannot do so.

107
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,130
His name came up during the interrogation of the criminal,

108
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,690
so the request for his crime to be ignored is

109
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,030
no different than a dereliction of duty.

110
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:50,340
Your Majesty, you must punish the prince for his crime and leave no stone unturned.

111
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:55,130
Your Majesty, even if he has committed crimes, he's your brother after all.

112
00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:01,790
If you punish him too harshly, you will be criticized for losing your morals as a noble.

113
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,550
Please show your grace.

114
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:10,400
Your Majesty, what he's saying now is no different than saying to stop catching the traitors.

115
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,380
In addition to the traitors who endangered this country's stability,

116
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:20,300
you must also punish the ministers and councilors that sway or confuse you.

117
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,800
He's so determined to kill the prince.

118
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,500
It's up to His Majesty now.

119
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,070
Hyungnim, what took you so long?

120
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,650
Do you know how long I've been waiting for you?

121
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:42,000
Yool, listen very carefully to what I'm about to say.

122
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:50,600
I think I'm going to have to send you somewhere for a little while.

123
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:58,850
While you're there, if you listen well, eat well, and wait,

124
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,230
I will come to get you soon.

125
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:05,880
You promise?

126
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:10,260
Sin Chi Soo who brought down the traitors and kept this country safe,

127
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,120
I give him the rank of a first-class retainer and

128
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:18,040
promote him to Prince of the Court Goseong.

129
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,330
Your Majesty.

130
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:57,830
Your grace is endless.

131
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,020
Your Majesty!

132
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,960
That's good.

133
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,040
You need to pay if you enjoyed it.

134
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,480
Ah, this is hard.

135
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,300
You need to pay more.

136
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,860
You are stealing.

137
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,110
How much did you take?

138
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,540
Why are you handing that to me?

139
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,900
Hey, just a bit. Add to it.

140
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,720
That punk is quite...

141
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,040
He is too handsome to be lowly.

142
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,790
Ey! You rotten people!

143
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:01,690
Since you are going wild over this craziness, I can't stop my craziness.

144
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,630
There! You crazy people who are crazier than me.

145
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,790
Eat this!

146
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,450
What do you mean you can't pay a penny?

147
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:27,220
You didn't expect to be paid when you played with the ruler of this country in my yard, did you?

148
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,220
But Lord,

149
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:34,830
it was only all for fun. How can you be like this?

150
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,620
Shut your mouth!

151
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,540
Just be grateful that I am not reporting you to the government offices.

152
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,660
Get lost!

153
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,660
Lord! Lord! Lord!

154
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,940
He said to get lost!

155
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,130
Lord!

156
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,250
Get lost!

157
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,750
No.

158
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,460
What filthy rich man?

159
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,750
Just take this and die!

160
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,530
What is this?

161
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,870
Just where do you think you are spitting?

162
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,850
So disgusting I could die.

163
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,110
What's with you again?

164
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,420
I was just going to go,

165
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,490
- but I don't think I can do that. 
 - What?

166
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,260
Hey, hey, hey!

167
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,120
Brother!

168
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:31,370

169
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,490
Isn't there any food to eat?

170
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,540
What are you doing?!

171
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,680
Catch him!

172
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,380
Come on, come on! That scum there!

173
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,960
Gather up.

174
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,720
What was that sound?

175
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,640
Aigo, Hyungnim.

176
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,640
Pick it up!

177
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,190
Run!

178
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,640
Those punks.

179
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,960
Catch them!

180
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,070
Catch them!

181
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,030
Catch them!

182
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,960
Move.

183
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,220
Catch them!

184
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:35,240
Oh my! My legs! Aigo!

185
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,370
I died and lived again.

186
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,060
I thought you were taking it well.

187
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,560
Look what you've done.

188
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,070
Oh, my.

189
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,830
This is...

190
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,480
Here.

191
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,550
What is that?

192
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,920
What?

193
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,440
Oh my!

194
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,490
Isn't this that corvina that even the king has difficulty finding to eat?

195
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,400
They look good, don't they?

196
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,000
What is this taste!

197
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,960
Isn't it insane?

198
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,800
Make sure to chew as you eat. You'll get indigestion.

199
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,700
Ha Seon... you didn't break the pot, did you?

200
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,260
How many did you break?

201
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,450
Ah that is... there were so many pots...

202
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,640
I was tapping so many of them, but I couldn't find it.

203
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,050
So you broke all of them?

204
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,410
It felt so good.

205
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,390
We are dead now.

206
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,170
You made the seven stars mad.

207
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,620
That lord is going to kill us!

208
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,360
Well if he does we can just die.

209
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,290
When are you going to stop playing around?

210
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:11,560
The rumors will spread quickly nearby. What are we doing to do now?

211
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,280
Where are we going to perform now?!

212
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,970
How can you eat this, you immature things?!

213
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,630
Aigoo, Mother.

214
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:27,380
Old man Gap Soo. Since this happened, let's head to the big stage.

215
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,960
The big stage, my foot.

216
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,100
We are clowns anyway. It's awesome if we do it well and deadly if we don't.

217
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,150
Since we can't perform here, let's go perform on the big stage.

218
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,700
Where is the big stage?

219
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,100
When you speak of the big stage, it means Hanyang.

220
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,930
Hanyang?

221
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,970
Ahjussi.

222
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,260
Forget it. It'll take a few months.

223
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,900
We have no roof over our heads anyway, so what's the worry?

224
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,320
Let's just go.

225
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,290
Big Brother, wait for me.

226
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,330
Hey.

227
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,980
Big Brother.

228
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:33,440
Ah, seriously...

229
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,950
I can't go anymore. My legs are killing me.

230
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,160
Seriously.

231
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,930
Ahjussi.

232
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:42,260
So why break the pots...?

233
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,380
We are almost there. Get up.

234
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,960
What's wrong?

235
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,900
I can't walk any further.

236
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,230
Aigoo, right.

237
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,040
There we go.

238
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,340
Get on.

239
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,870
Alright. Let's go, let's go.

240
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,600
You comfortable?

241
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:51,130
Come on.

242
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,710
Come on!

243
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,750
  Onyang Temporary Palace

244
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,370
Your Majesty.

245
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:23,750
Tonight, you should be able to rest peacefully.

246
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:36,260

247
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,670
Hyung-nim.

248
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,220
My stomach hurts so much, Hyung-nim.

249
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,600
Please save me.

250
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,080
Don't come! Get away! Get away!

251
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,390
Who ordered you?

252
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,160
If you tell me the traitor's name,

253
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,210
I will save your life.

254
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:19,400
You killed the late king's firstborn son, and you have stolen the king's throne.

255
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Who are you calling a traitor?

256
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,130
- What did you say? 
 - Killing your father wasn't enough, so you killed your little brother, too.

257
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,900
You entrusted political affairs to Sin Chi Soo, who is a disloyal subject.

258
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,720
You're so busy whoring that you don't even know time is passing by.

259
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,600
What kind of king are you?!

260
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,720
Are you not even afraid of the people's resentment towards you?!

261
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,470
Drag this man away

262
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,420
and interrogate him until he confesses.

263
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:54,450
They all whisper to each other that I have gone insane.

264
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:58,290
They think I've gone mad and killed my little brother.

265
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,940
But look.

266
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:04,890
There are people hiding outside trying to kill me.

267
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:07,310
They don't acknowledge me as king.

268
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:12,060
They are trying to kill me.  They are trying to make me go crazy!

269
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,980
Your Majesty.

270
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,660
Please put down the sword.

271
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:22,050
Promise me that you will find them all and kill them.

272
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:24,800
If I could protect you with my words,

273
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,960
I would do it a hundred or a thousand times.

274
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,720
Empty words are good enough, as well, so you can relax.

275
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,600
Can you not tell me

276
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,930
that you will try with all that you've got?

277
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:40,650
Until my dying breath

278
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:43,780
I will protect you, Your Majesty.

279
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,980
That is not enough.

280
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,890
Find a way.

281
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:54,240
Find a way to wipe all of them out and protect me.

282
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,290
Can you find a way?

283
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,690
Yes, Your Majesty.

284
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:03,030
I will find a way.

285
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,910
Your Majesty.

286
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,700
Please.

287
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,180
Hurry.

288
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,960
Before I really go crazy.

289
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,630
The reason why the king ended up that way

290
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:40,850
is because I ignored your advice and brought in Sin Chi Soo.

291
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,920
It's my fault.

292
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,320
At the time, the king needed a hunting dog like Sin Chi Soo.

293
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,850
Since that hunting dog has become a first-class retainer,

294
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:53,460
it seems as if he'll be promoted to Left State Minister.

295
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,660
We just have to prevent that.

296
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:01,220
I will petition the king. Find a good day for it.

297
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,740
Yes, Your Excellency.

298
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:47,070
Seems like you failed.

299
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,780
I apologize.

300
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,290
What is this?

301
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,620
It's Hanyang! Hanyang!

302
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,810
Finally we arrived!

303
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,690
Wow, it's Hanyang!

304
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,540
- I told you guys not to make a fuss! 
 - Is this a dream?

305
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,420
Or is it reality?

306
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,580
- How is this? 
 - It hurts!

307
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,650
Then, that means it's reality!

308
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:26,380
Come on out!

309
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,430
Oh, my!

310
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:39,430
The main entrance truly is as big as an entrance should be!

311
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:42,970
Wow, Hanyang's brothels are truly different, right?

312
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,700
I can just tell that we'll be beaten and thrown out. Let's just go.

313
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,450
No, no.

314
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,210
You can stay here. I'll quickly go.

315
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,420
What will you do?

316
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:10,270
Really? You're going to play around with (mimic) the king.

317
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,340
Yes. If you give me a chance,

318
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:16,750
I have the confidence to make your jaws drop!

319
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,720
We have enough jokers and entertainers here.

320
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,860
Go elsewhere.

321
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,170
No, just give us one chance. Just one! Please!

322
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,660
Madam! Madam!

323
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,310
Please. We can do well.

324
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,320
Madam!

325
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,040
What are you laughing at?

326
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:54,230
Is it not funny? You said you would play around with the king.

327
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,680
Who would want to see something like that nowadays?

328
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,860
That...

329
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,190
Something like that?

330
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:09,040
Wait... I am playing with my neck on the line and you call it something like tha...

331
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,390
Something like that?

332
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,930
Shall I give you some advice?

333
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:18,260
Rather than a king who is a gentleman,

334
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,160
playing with the Queen and Seon Hwa Dang

335
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,640
is more popular amongst the brothel's guests.

336
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,170
How is that more popular?

337
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:28,200
Seeing that you don't know of this,

338
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,910
you truly must be from the countryside.

339
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:35,750
So then what are you talking about?

340
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,120
The queen disposed of the king's concubines and persecuted them.

341
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,490
The queen disposed of the king's concubines and persecuted them.

342
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,240
I heard her wickedness is incomparable to

343
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,610
regular women.

344
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:47,220
Are you saying

345
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,740
the queen is such a terrible and wicked wife?

346
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:55,080
Your Highness, Seon Hwa Dang has arrived.

347
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,550
Your Highness, you called for me?

348
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:15,090
I have something to give to you.

349
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,820
Do not feel pressured.

350
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:44,830
I'm giving this to you so that you can assist the king for my sake.

351
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:47,170
I am very sorry.

352
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:50,080
You are so considerate like this,

353
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,790
but I do not know why there are such rumors that fly about you.

354
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,970
Are you talking about the rumor that I persecuted you

355
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:01,420
and delayed you from spending a night with His Majesty?

356
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,090
You knew of it?

357
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,690
They say all rumors are half lies.

358
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:08,040
I am not too worried about it.

359
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,280
So, you should not worry, either, Seon Hwa Dang.

360
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:16,110
I will be leaving then, Your Highness.

361
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:33,020

362
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,780
You should've seen it, Uncle.

363
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:45,720
She's only the queen for appearance, but she pretends to be so kind and puts on all sorts of airs.

364
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,040
It was too much for just me to see.

365
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,500
Yes.

366
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:57,960
Take this away. I don't want to see it.

367
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,970
What is this?

368
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:15,090
My lord brought it.

369
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:30,640
What is this, Uncle?

370
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,410
This is a talisman for having a son.

371
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,380
 Birth of a boy

372
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,440
When you meet His Majesty tonight, you must keep it on your person.

373
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,490
It will be effective when you do so.

374
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:48,530
 Talisman for conception of a son

375
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:52,940
To not disappoint you,

376
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,420
I will do my best serving His Majesty tonight, so don't worry.

377
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:59,780
That won't be enough.

378
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,210
You have to put your life on the line.

379
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:06,110
Because if something goes wrong, you have to pay for it with your life.

380
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:13,870
My dearest niece, I didn't make you a concubine

381
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:17,970
so you could merely compete with the queen.

382
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:22,710
Earning His Majesty's favor and giving birth to a son.

383
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:25,930
That's the reason why you are here and

384
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:29,610
the only way for you to keep your life.

385
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:35,120
Yes, Uncle. I will keep that in mind.

386
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:48,380
Your Highness, what are you thinking about so deeply?

387
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:53,470
Father. When no one is around, at least,

388
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:57,000
couldn't you talk informally to me like you used to?

389
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,110
I'm asking you because it's so suffocating.

390
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,320
Of course, I will do that.

391
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:11,900
So Woon, is palace life still hard and

392
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,150
uncomfortable?

393
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:20,130
Since I'm living in the palace,

394
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:22,170
how embarrassing it must be

395
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:26,080
that I have a new habit of missing somewhere that's not the palace.

396
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,950
So Woon.

397
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,940
His Majesty won't be like that forever.

398
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,870
He's someone who used to have the qualities of a good and wise king, did he not?

399
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:41,050
I will do my best to serve His Majesty, so

400
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:43,720
hang in there a little bit more.

401
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:48,630
Yes, Father.

402
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:20,460
Your Majesty.

403
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:25,270
  Your father-in-law Prince of the Court and Chief Royal Secretary are asking to see you.

404
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:27,420
 What should I do?

405
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,270
Let them in.

406
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:00,400
So you're saying that Sin Chi Soo

407
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,110
was taking bribes, secretly helping those who blocked us from receiving taxes,

408
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:07,380
and pocketing relief aid sent in by various provinces?

409
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

410
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,870
They are freely paying off government officials and public resentment is widespread.

411
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,960
I understand your intentions, my father-in-law,

412
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,370
but Sin Chi Soo is a first-class retainer.

413
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:33,550
You know that I can't punish him unless it's treason.

414
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:39,680
Your Majesty, the royal court is already filled

415
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,490
with Sin Chi Soo's men and is moving according to his will.

416
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:46,150
Since no one can stop whatever he does,

417
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:49,890
they're even saying that there are two suns in the sky.

418
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,820
If Sin Chi Soo's crime is not severely punished,

419
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:58,730
the order of this country will collapse and, eventually, so will your reign.

420
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:02,960
Father-in-law, don't exaggerate.

421
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,220
- But, Your Majesty— 
- Stop, I don't want to listen!

422
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:13,440
Do you think there is even one man who is free of any speck of dust if you shake him?

423
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,840
Are you confident (that you will be free of dust)?

424
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,600
Your Majesty, I am—

425
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,290
Forget it!

426
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:21,220
I don't want to hear any excuses.

427
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:27,830
What is that on your clothes?

428
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,810
This is an accessory, a gift from the queen.

429
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:35,290
The queen gave you something like that?

430
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:39,510
Yes, she said that I should serve you well.

431
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:44,670
These refreshments are also sent by the queen.

432
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,910
Drink this.

433
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,030
Eat this.

434
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,510
How does it taste?

435
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:30,530
You gave it to me. How can it taste bad?

436
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:32,730
So it's very good?

437
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:37,900
Yes. It's very sweet and good.

438
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,170
Then drink more.

439
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,440
Your Majesty...

440
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:55,140
I'm giving you as much as your greed's worth, but why don't you like it?

441
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:58,360
Drink more. More!

442
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:20,970
What is this?

443
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:24,440
I don't know.

444
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:28,190
It must be a talisman for having a son.

445
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:32,140
The queen wouldn't have given you something like this.

446
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,390
This must be the work of a greedy old one.

447
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:42,640
I wanted to do something that would make you happy. That's all.

448
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:46,040
And that's giving birth to a son?

449
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,610
Even if you give birth to a son, he will be illegitimate.

450
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:08,810
Unless he's a legitimate first son, I don't need one!

451
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,790
Y-Your Majesty!

452
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:17,960
Let me go.

453
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,960
I said, let me go!

454
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:37,940
Your Highness, His Majesty is—

455
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:58,420
Leave.

456
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:14,780
Your Majesty, what brings you here with no notice?

457
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:19,180
When someone is so desperate to have a son that she comes to me with a talisman,

458
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,340
how come you are not doing anything?

459
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:26,130
Get a talisman, perform an exorcism.

460
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:30,810
If that doesn't work, you should at least beg me to build a temple so you can make offerings.

461
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:34,490
You are neither Confucius nor Mencius.

462
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:36,900
How can you be so calm?

463
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,920
What Your Majesty wants is

464
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,930
for me to defy a court lady's rules and employ witchcraft?

465
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:43,680
If that's what I wanted, would you do it?

466
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,690
If it's your order, then

467
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:48,570
I will follow no matter what, but—

468
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:50,580
- But what? 
 - I hope that

469
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:53,740
you become an example for all people.

470
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:59,070
If you build a graceful character with bountiful mercy, wouldn't the heavens be touched

471
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:01,540
and give us a son that will carry on your line?

472
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,620
Stop.

473
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:07,700
That condescending nagging again!

474
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,330
Your Majesty, I know that

475
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:14,060
my words are meaningless to you.

476
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:18,860
If you don't want to listen to my words, then please listen to the citizens.

477
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,780
Please meet them in person and—

478
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:50,320
Those fools must think

479
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:55,240
that I'm the one rejecting you.

480
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,710
Who would know

481
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,200
that you're the one rejecting me?

482
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:29,850
 What good is it to have beauty so beautiful that the flowers cry and the moon hides?

483
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:35,170
She can't even win over her husband's heart!

484
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:52,050
Young girl, unfamiliar girl, other girl.

485
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:55,200
I can't live because of them!

486
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,060
- What about you?
 - You wenches!

487
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,460
You wicked wenches!

488
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,250
Come out here!

489
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:09,130
- My husband!
 - That wench! Seon Hwa Dang, you wench!

490
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:12,250
Get away from His Majesty this instant!

491
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:13,960
How dare you

492
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,840
put your butt there?

493
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:21,690
Oh, my! The queen is killing me!

494
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:25,920
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

495
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,580
You wench, there is no point in calling for the king!

496
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,980
Go ahead and die!

497
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:35,930
Alright, you wench! Now let's see if you die, or I die.

498
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:38,550
- Let's have at it! 
 - This b*tch!

499
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:40,510
You!

500
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:43,040
Looks like I won.

501
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,060
Are you alright, Your Highness?

502
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:48,100
Seon Hwa Dang, you!

503
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:52,480
Have a taste! Have a taste of it! Tickle, tickle!

504
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,170
It tickles! Geez!

505
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:56,490
I could just chew you up, Your Highness.

506
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:58,820
Come here!

507
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,120
I told you to be gentle! Come! Come!

508
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,770
Save me!

509
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:05,240
Save me!

510
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,460
You're so fast!

511
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:29,030

512
00:56:55,650 --> 00:57:01,420
So the king only wants a firstborn son born from the queen?

513
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,720
Blood is thicker than water.

514
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,400
I cannot believe

515
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,240
he is becoming so much like the late king, whom he resented.

516
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,530
His Majesty trusts and relies on the queen's father.

517
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:17,650
If the queen gives birth to a son, that'll be a huge problem.

518
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,640
We have to stop that before it happens.

519
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,820
Is there a way to stop it?

520
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:26,590
He only wants a son from the queen.

521
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:30,180
Then we just need to change the owner of the queen's quarters, don't we?

522
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,530
That is easier said than done.

523
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:35,350
You just wait.

524
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:38,430
Soon we'll have a new queen.

525
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:55,090
Yes, Your Majesty, it's true that I have been amassing wealth.

526
00:57:55,090 --> 00:58:00,370
However, I did it to build Your Majesty a main palace.

527
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:01,990
What does that mean?

528
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:04,540
After the last uprising destroyed the main palace,

529
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:09,220
how many years has it been that you've lived in this shabby annex palace?

530
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:13,990
Also, having a main palace is like the difference between earth and heaven.

531
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:17,310
After you said you would make me the left state minister,

532
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:20,490
I was even more concerned about that.

533
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:26,450
So you are saying that all the bribes you took were for my sake?

534
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,160
Your Majesty.

535
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:37,050
I did it out of fear that if the rebuilding of the main palace is delayed anymore,

536
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:39,290
not only the dignity of Your Majesty,

537
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:42,170
who is the face and the father of this country,

538
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:45,380
but also the prestige of our court could fall to the ground.

539
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:49,770
Please give your thoughtful consideration!

540
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:52,970
Fine.

541
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,580
I'll believe your loyalty.

542
00:58:57,830 --> 00:59:02,370
Your grace has no bounds, Your Majesty.

543
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:30,600
Do we really have no way to stop him?

544
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:41,110
Minister, Chief Royal Secretary.

545
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:42,740
What is it?

546
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:46,950
The man we captured in Onyang Temporary Palace is ready to talk.

547
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:02,160
So who are you working for?

548
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:06,350
Deputy Minister of Justice, Sin Chi Soo.

549
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:09,560
You mean you tried to assassinate the king under Sin Chi Soo's order?

550
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,450
Yes.

551
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,600
Can you give that answer in front of the king?

552
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,280
Even if I speak a hundred times or thousand times,

553
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,650
my answer will be the same.

554
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:47,040
If he's telling the truth, we can stop Sin Chi Soo.

555
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:51,190
We must be cautious.

556
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,280
I understand your meaning,

557
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,210
but we can't lose this chance.

558
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:20,610
I am instating Deputy Minister of Justice Sin Chi Soo as Left State Minister.

559
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:25,450
Your Majesty.

560
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,510
Please wait a moment.

561
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:39,050
I wish to report an act of treason.

562
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:54,690
Who is that traitor?

563
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:58,940
Please listen to it directly from the one who confessed.

564
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,740
Bring in the criminal!

565
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:34,000
You will say nothing but the truth.

566
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:38,740
Who ordered you to kill the king?

567
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:57,410
If you only tell the truth, I will save you.

568
01:02:57,410 --> 01:03:00,000
Who is the one who gave you orders?

569
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:10,840
It was your father-in-law.

570
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:40,020
How dare you lie here?

571
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:44,300
Didn't you tell me Deputy Minister of Justice Sin Chi Soo had ordered you?!

572
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:51,320
Yes. You promised to spare my life if I said so.

573
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,940
This bastard...

574
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:58,980
Your Majesty, he is lying.

575
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,460
I have never seen this man before yesterday

576
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:05,380
and I never ordered him to do such a thing!

577
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:13,570
Then present me with one piece of evidence

578
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:15,780
that he is lying.

579
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:19,070
That...

580
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:24,290
There is no evidence

581
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:28,820
except for my loyalty.

582
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:46,130
Lock up my father-in-law who planned treason at once!

583
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:49,270
Your Majesty!

584
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:51,980
Your Majesty! I have been framed!

585
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:56,450
This is a lie! Your Majesty!

586
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:28,290
- Queen.  
 - Your Majesty,

587
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:33,440
my father has lived his entire life for the sake of you and the citizens of this country.

588
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,940
How could you say that a person like that betrayed you?

589
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:41,370
I am certain somebody framed my father to remove him from court.

590
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:44,480
He has been unjustly framed?

591
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,600
Yes, I believe so.

592
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,180
You're right.

593
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,740
How could I believe the words of the man

594
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:57,280
who put a blade to my neck?

595
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,970
However, it's obvious that my father-in-law tried to scheme with lies

596
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:03,470
to take down Sin Chi Soo.

597
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:05,330
I can't forgive his treason.

598
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:10,210
But I also can not forgive the fact that he tried to trick me.

599
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:13,840
If you understand, move.

600
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,550
What is this now?

601
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:23,440
Your Majesty is doubting my father's loyalty.

602
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:27,430
How could I be your queen?

603
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:31,090
If you throw away my father, throw me away as well.

604
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:32,940
Are you threatening me right now?

605
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:37,820
How could you call my earnest and desperate words a threat?

606
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:41,510
Please give my father an opportunity to resolve this.

607
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:44,640
You will put your position on the line?

608
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,050
Yes.

609
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:54,360
Because a witness testified to your father's crimes,

610
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:57,340
there is no choice but to treat it as treason.

611
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:03,400
If you dare threaten me again with this matter,

612
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,670
I will not overlook your crimes either.

613
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:09,330
Know this and leave now!

614
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,840
Now the only thing that doesn't fall under Sin Chi Soo is

615
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,710
the queen's court.

616
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:43,420
I understand what you are saying.

617
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:47,030
I will protect the queen's court,

618
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,640
so do not worry.

619
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:03,290
It seems that the king was betrayed by somebody he trusted.

620
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:06,900
This is all going according to your plans, Prince Jin Pyeong.

621
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:10,050
Things worked out better than expected.

622
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:14,900
 If, by chance, the king's assassination fails,

623
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:19,350
 confess that it was the doing of the queen's father.

624
01:08:20,650 --> 01:08:22,680
 Yes, I will do so.

625
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:28,430
 When I sit on the throne, I will give you and your children government official jobs.

626
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:35,610
 Your grace is limitless.

627
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:44,790
My decision to put you on the throne in case of the king's death was indeed correct.

628
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:52,850
Your Majesty, I've held back for a long time.

629
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:57,520
This is just the beginning. You can look forward to it.

630
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:14,200
Bring me more alcohol.

631
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:23,600
You've already drunk a lot. If you drink anymore--

632
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,770
Stop your gab, and bring it.

633
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:30,190
Seeing how your behavior is not even acceptable at the taverns on Juja street,

634
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:34,100
it looks like something big has happened.

635
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:35,940
Woon Sim,

636
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:38,580
I have a favor to ask.

637
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:44,110
The queen bitch is trying to kill me.

638
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:47,820
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

639
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:52,250
Even if you call His Majesty, it doesn't matter! How about dying once!

640
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:55,080
Fine. Let's see who'll die first.

641
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,260
Let's go a round today!

642
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,560
What's this? You can't get up?

643
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:12,300
You punk! Whose name do you think you are disgracing?

644
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:17,770
Lord, why are you like this? What crime did I commit?

645
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:20,960
This punk.

646
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,200
But you still don't know what sin you've commi–

647
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:57,450
Is it a crime to have fun and perform?

648
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:02,660
Oh my... Sir, we've committed a grievous crime.

649
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:08,000
What are you doing? Beg for forgiveness on your hands and knees.

650
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:15,980
Forgive me.

651
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:23,100
Woon Sim, lock this punk up in the storage room.

652
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:25,040
What?

653
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:31,430
Sir, why make a big deal over a clown making fun?

654
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:34,050
Turn him over to the authorities.

655
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:36,030
No.

656
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:38,010
No...

657
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,880
Lock him up.

658
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,510
Noona.  No, no...

659
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:48,060
Sir! Go look in the market streets.

660
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,120
They all play like me.

661
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,270
My lord!

662
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:54,680
- What just happened? Ha Seon! 
- Brother!

663
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,530
Oh my...

664
01:11:57,410 --> 01:12:00,500
That man's name is Ha Seon?

665
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,220
Yes.

666
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:06,290
Are you really going to turn him over to the authorities?

667
01:12:06,290 --> 01:12:09,190
That's none of your business, Woon Sim.

668
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:15,910
Until I tell you, you can never let him go, do you understand?

669
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:19,490
Yes, I will do that.

670
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:47,960
Chief Royal Secretary, we have a big problem.

671
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:52,470
It seems the king's madness is back.

672
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:09,600
Bring me the rest of the porridge.

673
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:28,180
- Eat it. 
 - Pardon?

674
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:31,140
I'm telling you to eat it to see if there is poison!

675
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,680
Yes, yes.

676
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:43,640
You wench, what are you trying to start?

677
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:47,200
It's because it's really hot.

678
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:50,070
This wench!

679
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:54,580
I told you to eat. Eat!

680
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:08,350
Stop crying at once!

681
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:11,850
Stop crying at once!

682
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:14,450
Your Majesty.

683
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:33,870
Your Majesty, I have something to tell you in private.

684
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:36,100
Just say it.

685
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,800
Please let them leave.

686
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:44,660
This is about a way that I promised to you before.

687
01:14:48,530 --> 01:14:51,150
You are all dismissed!

688
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:09,460
Have you found a way?

689
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:15,600
Do you remember the Chinese Odyssey you enjoyed reading when you were young?

690
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,960
What does that have to do with it?

691
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:23,560
I think I found the hair of Son Oh Gong in the book.

692
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:29,650
The hair that when you blow on it, you can create a duplicate.

693
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:54,470
Are you releasing me now?

694
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:35,210
Have respect. It's His Majesty the King.

695
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:39,100
Your Majesty.

696
01:19:23,610 --> 01:19:25,500
Try it on.

697
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:37,230
Yes.

698
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:23,020
"This punk," say it.

699
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,610
This punk.

700
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:30,380
This punk! Are you not going to play properly?!

701
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:36,900
This punk! Are you not going to play properly?!

702
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:13,720

703
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:17,300
 The Crowned Clown

704
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:38,100
 Preview

705
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,660
 There are only two options to survive in the palace.

706
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:44,080
 Either you stomp on them mercilessly and cut off their airway,

707
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,750
 or you totally ignore it.

708
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:49,030
 Have you slept well?

709
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:52,360
 I can't really read Chinese characters.

710
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:56,370
 Is this your playground?

711
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:59,700
 This is something I really needed as the person dying in place of His Majesty!

712
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,760
 Queen, I'm sorry.

713
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:05,760
 If you leave now, I'll have to kill you.
