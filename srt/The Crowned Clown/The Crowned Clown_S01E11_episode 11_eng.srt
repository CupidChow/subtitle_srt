 Episode 11

5
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:45,370
Your Majesty, what is my name?

6
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:02,400
Your Majesty, call me by my name.

7
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,050
 A thousand partings from my beloved.

8
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,760
 My devotion is unchanged.

9
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,880
Who are you?

10
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,120
Who are you?

11
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,440
How impertinent.

12
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,290
Your Highness.

13
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,540
Does the queen know?

14
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,680
That was the first time she looked at me that way.

15
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,320
I only wanted to make her laugh,

16
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,090
but I ended up hurting her.

17
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,210
I shouldn't have approached her from the start.

18
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,980
I shouldn't have dared to have feelings for her.

19
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,470
Your Majesty.

20
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,390
The way she looked at me...

21
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,660
My heart is more bitter and burns more than the ginger tea.

22
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,260
My heart hurts so much.

23
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,710
Still, it's probably nothing compared to the pain she is feeling.

24
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,370
I have implanted hell in her heart.

25
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:11,240
This is not something Your Majesty should deal with alone.

26
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,340
I will send a message to Chief Royal Secretary.

27
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,810
 My beloved, even if we are apart for a millennium, my faithful heart will remain steadfast.

28
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,030
Your Highness, are you not feeling well?

29
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,580
Should I summon the royal physician?

30
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,850
No. You should go.

31
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,380
Yes, Your Highness.

32
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,250
Where have you been?

33
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,500
What's going on?

34
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,950
The queen has caught on about His Majesty's identity.

35
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,380
What do we do?

36
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,690
Soon the day will break,

37
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:35,180
I'll meet with the queen and speak to her.

38
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,090
 Daejojeon Hall (Hall of Great Creation - royal residence for the king and queen)

39
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,720
Your Highness, I should pay courtesy and ask about your well-being.

40
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,290
But since I am here to report my crimes, I will forgo the greeting.

41
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:03,710
Before I report my crime, if you question me, I will answer.

42
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,420
Who is the person in the king's palace?

43
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,760
He is a clown.

44
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,540
The one who has the same face as His Majesty.

45
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:23,020
I discovered and reported it to His Majesty, and put him in the king's palace.

46
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,700
Where is His Majesty?

47
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,900
After ascending the royal throne,

48
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,950
His Majesty become quite indisposed mentally, as you know.

49
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,580
Hence, he became dependent on medicine,

50
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,660
and in the end, he became unable to bear even a few hours without medicine.

51
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,120
Someone who could take His Majesty's place appeared.

52
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,880
And His Majesty left the palace in an attempt to grasp his mental state once more.

53
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,970
However, the timing was missed and he started to hallucinate and harm himself.

54
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:10,030
And in the end, His Majesty was met with mishap.

55
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,880
Mishap?

56
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,700
But, if my memory serves me right,

57
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,770
I'm positive he returned to the palace at one point.

58
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,910
Yes.

59
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:31,360
That night he lost consciousness and left this world.

60
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,120
Your Highness.

61
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:46,300
All this is my fault for not being able to properly serve His Majesty.

62
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,310
If you tell me to remove him from the palace right away, I shall do so.

63
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,720
If you wish to punish me for my crimes, I will accept the punishment.

64
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,950
However, if that happens, His Majesty's mishap will be known to the outside.

65
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,310
And around the throne,

66
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,340
there will most definitely be a bloody storm.

67
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,880
Chief Royal Secretary.

68
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,110
Yes, Your Highness.

69
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:16,650
His Majesty died without my knowing.

70
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,100
Do not try to use the future as an excuse to threaten me

71
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,400
and attempt to control me.

72
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,330
It's not a threat.

73
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,480
It's my earnest plea and my desperate request.

74
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,870
No matter what I say, it will only sound like excuses to you.

75
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,840
I am well aware of that.

76
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,420
No matter what you decide, I will follow it,

77
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,340
so may you please not only see my crimes

78
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,790
but also think further and deeper.

79
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,560
I plead that you make the decision.

80
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,230
What did the queen say?

81
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,870
I have reported my crime, so she will come to a decision.

82
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,760
It won't do.

83
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,640
I will go see her personally and will tell her of my crimes.

84
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,050
Be calm.

85
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,170
But...

86
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,220
Whatever her punishment is, I will take it.

87
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,310
Ha Seon, you only need to protect the throne.

88
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,250
Do you understand?

89
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,800
Your Highness, the wind is chilly.

90
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,090
I worry you might catch a cold, so let's go, please.

91
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,170
Please?

92
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,440
Just a bit longer.

93
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,900
Let's stay a bit longer before going in.

94
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,490
But Your Highness...

95
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,410
Just in case.

96
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,420
If I continue to let the cold wind blow on me,

97
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,040
perhaps my heart will become frozen too.

98
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,250
What? What do you mean by that?

99
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,540
 Your Majesty, the Ming's envoy has arrived in the capital.

100
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,300
In four days, he will arrive at Welcoming Imperial Grace Gate.

101
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,450
This envoy carries with him the emperor's decree for the new year.

102
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,820
so we must host them hospitably with nothing lacking to avoid complaints.

103
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,510
Your Majesty.

104
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,850
Preparations for a royal banquet to receive the envoy are complete.

105
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:40,530
And we've also done our best without overdoing it on the tribute goods to be sent to the Ming,

106
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,690
so please do not worry.

107
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,140
Your Majesty, it's not right to stop before overdoing it.

108
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,700
A son is serving the father so how can we hold back?

109
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,440
Hence last year we already sent 35,000 taels of silver to the Ming imperial family.

110
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,920
And we also offered twelve tribute items to the Ming.

111
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,740
 Your Majesty.

112
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,290
 Please look at this.

113
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:20,380
 It's so white and transparent. Isn't it like a star?

114
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,240
My Lord, did something happen at the side palace?

115
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,270
The queen has found out about Ha Seon's identity.

116
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:43,000
What? How...

117
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,340
Did you escort Ha Seon's sister safely?

118
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,690
Yes. He will look after her well and he said not to worry.

119
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,710
Please take this.

120
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,620
Over here.

121
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,830
Sit, sit.

122
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,190
To celebrate you guys coming to my house, I put together this meal.

123
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,130
What's all this?

124
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,560
Don't refuse.

125
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,980
Hurry and have some. Come on.

126
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,550
Then, thank you for the food.

127
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,770
Let's eat.

128
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,060
Eat.

129
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:42,740
It seems like you live alone.

130
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,500
Who made all this?

131
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,250
Who do you think?

132
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,510
You personally made these?

133
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,880
My mother was a cook.

134
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,870
Though I only learned this by stealing looks from behind my mother's back,

135
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,510
I think it'll still be pretty edible.

136
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,110
Wow. Let's try it.

137
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,240
What's wrong?

138
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,950
It's not good?

139
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,980
It's freaking delicious.

140
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,490
Really?

141
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,040
Well, My Lord.

142
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:52,010
You know that lord with a sword who brought us here to you?

143
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:56,820
You all seem to work in the government. Is that right?

144
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,620
It's true.

145
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,410
But why do you ask about that?

146
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,520
Do you not believe it?

147
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,580
Oh my. It's not that.

148
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,150
It seems like Ha Seon sent you guys.

149
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,680
But Ha Seon says he doesn't know.

150
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:20,370
So I really don't know what's going on, and I feel so pathetic.

151
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,260
Orabeoni.

152
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,330
I don't know the details.

153
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:32,690
But seeing how Chief Royal Secretary said to look after you two well,

154
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,280
I think that person named Ha Seon must be well too.

155
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,160
That hyungnim isn't so humble but he's a nice man.

156
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,560
Since you say that, I should believe it, right?

157
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,390
That's what I'm saying.

158
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,220
So don't worry and let's eat.

159
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,940
Oh, the soup I made is getting cold.

160
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,150
I won't decline and will enjoy this deliciously.

161
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:05,310
Here, this, I learned from Master Baek who is a famous chef.

162
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,420
Marinated meat!

163
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:13,440
- Try this too. 
- Wow, we come here and get a home-cooked meal.

164
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,890
This is nothing short of a king's meal.

165
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:28,800
We searched all around Beop Jeon Temple but they vanished without a trace.

166
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:34,600
Seeing how no one in the capital saw them either, it seems they are not performing as clowns anymore.

167
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,300
It's certain Chief Royal Secretary hid that clown.

168
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,510
You should continue to monitor Chief Royal Secretary.

169
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,880
Yes, Your Excellency

170
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,950
The king taking the Ming envoy lightly is an opportunity for us.

171
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,570
Send messages to the men. Tell them to prepare to make this into a public issue.

172
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:16,620
I will send the first messages to the sarim scholars who previously gathered at Yonghyeon Temple to show their support for you.

173
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:22,980
Did you look into why the king shed tears at the side palace earlier?

174
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,510
I apologize, but I haven't.

175
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,260
However, I will find out soon.

176
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,220
I understand.

177
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,090
You may leave now.

178
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,470
Then, please rest comfortably.

179
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:46,050

180
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,530
It's clearly something.

181
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,960
Your Highness, why are you like this?

182
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,920
I will wear that today.

183
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,310
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

184
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,500
How impertinent! What do you think you're doing?

185
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:19,480
Your Majesty, I ran here to report something urgent to you.

186
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,360
Did something happen to the queen?

187
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,110
Please stop the queen.

188
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,590
The queen is trying to leave the palace.

189
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:08,660
Go outside and send everyone away.

190
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,820
Do not allow anyone to stay near.

191
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,100
Yes, Your Highness.

192
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,980
What are you doing?

193
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:36,100
Please forgive me. I couldn't not come.

194
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,450
How impertinent. Move back.

195
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,330
Please don't leave the palace.

196
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,200
I only came to tell you that.

197
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,540
I'd rather you told me to get lost instead.

198
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,800
I will leave.

199
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,480
When did it start?

200
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:06,960
Was it you who saved my father?

201
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,280
Were you the one who got bitten by the hunting dog instead of me?

202
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,660
At the market...

203
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,010
It was also you.

204
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,600
Please kill me.

205
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,670
I've committed a crime deserving of death.

206
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,980
- It's all my fault—
 - Your crime is none of my business.

207
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:58,360
I knew my husband was in pain but I couldn't help him.

208
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:03,450
I wasn't even by his side when he passed, so my sins are great.

209
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,410
What are you talking about?

210
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,580
Are you saying His Majesty is dead?

211
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,560
You didn't know?

212
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,740
Forget it.

213
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,900
You may leave.

214
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,390
- But Your Highness—
 - I've committed an unforgivable sin.

215
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,060
I do not have the morals to continue being the queen.

216
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:39,870
That's why I am leaving. So do not block me.

217
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,980
Never again.

218
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,970
I hope I never see you again.

219
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,200
So don't look for me.

220
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,990

221
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,830
Officer Jang.

222
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,220
Yes, Your Majesty.

223
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:20,330
Go to Chief Royal Secretary at once, and tell him the queen is about to leave the palace.

224
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,210
And tell him to find a way to block her.

225
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,710
Yes.

226
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:34,870
 Daejojeon Hall

227
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:11,840
Your Highness, why are you leaving the palace?

228
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,470
Didn't you ask me to make a decision?

229
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:19,230
This is what I've decided.

230
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Your Highness, if you leave like this,

231
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,840
you won't be able to protect your position as queen.

232
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,310
Your life could be in danger.

233
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,110
I've kept that in mind.

234
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:37,140
Please reconsider.

235
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:42,870
If I remain in the palace, I don't know what trouble I might cause.

236
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,340
Is that what you want?

237
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,520
So Woon.

238
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:58,280
You can't do this.

239
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,310
When I wanted to make you the crown princess,

240
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:06,260
your father refused.

241
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:12,760
He thought because you were upright, you wouldn't be able to endure the turbulent palace.

242
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,220
But that's why it had to be you.

243
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:21,190
I thought if it were you, you wouldn't waver and would be able to protect the position of mother of the nation.

244
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:29,500
Please, I am begging you not to leave.

245
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,360
 Your Majesty, it is Eunuch Jo.

246
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,890
Is it news about the queen?

247
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,550
It's not that.

248
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:22,140
The queen dowager is looking for you urgently.

249
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:30,650
How can the queen, the head of the women in the palace, act so rashly?

250
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:34,280
I don't think it was right to just sit still, so I called you.

251
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,100
I gave her permission.

252
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,350
How could you give her permission to leave the palace?

253
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,090
Even if you gave her permission,

254
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:53,370
I can't sit idly by watching the queen break the codes of the ladies at court.

255
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,720
It is only right for you to give a royal command to strip her of her position and order her to drink poison.

256
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,880
I cannot give such a command.

257
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,810
When women climb the mountain behind their houses without their husbands, it's right for them to die by committing suicide.

258
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,810
So why are you defending the queen's sins?!

259
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:09,930
The queen is my person before she is the head of the court women.

260
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:13,840
I'll take care of my person and her deeds, so

261
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,920
do not bring this up again.

262
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,790
 Royal edict: Royal Consort of Yoo Clan (i.e. Queen So Woon) failed to make tributary offering at the ancestral shrine.

263
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,550
 For her failure to carry out her duty for the state, she will be deposed and become Commoner Yoo.

264
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,910
What is this?

265
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,000
It's an order to remove the queen of her title.

266
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,330
Pick up the king's seal.

267
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:20,460
Excuse me? Just what...

268
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,780
What are you talking about?

269
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,040
The queen dowager talked about it earlier, too.

270
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,110
This isn't something that came from the queen dowager, is it?

271
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,130
It's not because of the queen dowager.

272
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:34,530
If we continue like this, we'll be bombarded with petitions

273
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:38,100
to take away the queen's title and order her to drink poison.

274
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,840
If you want to save the queen's life,

275
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,500
letting her become a commoner is the only way.

276
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,990
No. I oppose her becoming a commoner.

277
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,940
- Ha Seon. 
- Absolutely not!

278
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,850
If it's because the queen left the palace,

279
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:04,190
I will quickly go and bring her back.

280
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,660
Do not act rashly.

281
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,920
Step aside.

282
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,400
Didn't I tell you clearly?

283
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:15,540
I told you being a king means you must give up everything including your heart.

284
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:20,300
Then why didn't you do it instead of telling me to do it when you know so well!

285
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:32,550
You can't become the king just because you want to be.

286
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,990
You can't personally covet the seat nor should you ever covet the seat.

287
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:42,010
Do you really not know why I put you on the throne?

288
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,470
You probably put me on it to make me your puppet.

289
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:48,230
Isn't that why you hid the fact that His Majesty has passed away?

290
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,740
I decided to make you the king

291
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,050
and vowed to keep you there.

292
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:05,740
I thought if it were you, you wouldn't waver from the politics and would firmly protect the throne

293
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:11,030
and make a nation that the people can live well in.

294
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,100
Did I see incorrectly?

295
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:18,720
In that nation, the queen needs to be there too.

296
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,600
My Lord, I will definitely escort the queen back.

297
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,090
Please send me.

298
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:53,790
The Ming envoy will arrive in the capital in four days.

299
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:58,560
Until then, I will hide your absence.

300
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,530
So you must return within four days.

301
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,800
Can you promise me?

302
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,140
Yes. I will promise you.

303
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:43,180
Your Majesty, where did the queen go?

304
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:46,220
Do you have an idea of where she might be?

305
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:49,350
Wouldn't she have gone to her father?

306
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,230
Bring the guards.

307
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:58,940
But leave secretly so that the palace servants don't know.

308
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,640
Yes, My Lord.

309
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,750
Hurry and go.

310
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:22,390
From now on, Ha Seon is not feeling well due to the queen's actions

311
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,820
and is suffering a bout of madness.

312
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:30,420
For the time being, block all ministers and palace servants from entering the king's palace.

313
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,560
I understand.

314
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,540
However, as for having a bout of madness,

315
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:40,260
how do we show it?

316
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,340
How about this?

317
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,470
How do I look? Do you think His Majesty will find me pretty?

318
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:10,410
Of course. Please don't worry.

319
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:14,980
The queen's left the palace so this is my chance to look good to His Majesty.

320
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,000

321
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,670
 Your Majesty.

322
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,870
What happened?

323
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:33,420
The thing is... it seems His Majesty is having a bout of madness.

324
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,400
 Your Majesty!

325
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,130
Your Majesty.

326
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:43,980
 I said to drink to your greed, but why are you saying no?

327
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,370
 Drink more. More!

328
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,770
Should I announce you to His Majesty?

329
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,750
It's alright.

330
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,050
 - You cannot.  
- Let's hurry and go back.

331
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:59,000
 Your Majesty.

332
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:16,760

333
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:39,000
Your Majesty, you can't, Your Majesty!

334
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,290
Your Majesty!

335
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:50,910
How long do I need to keep this up?

336
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,230
If it's hard, rest a bit.

337
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:59,340
But instead, I suppose we can't help it if Ha Seon's absence is exposed.

338
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,630
No.

339
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:06,970
I'll try to keep going.

340
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,190
Have strength.

341
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:21,510
Your Majesty. You can't, Your Majesty!

342
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,920
Your Majesty!

343
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,200
 Border Report: Later Jin's army invading the borders.

344
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,270
What's wrong?

345
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,820
Did something happen?

346
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:56,230
The report from the borders states that Later Jin's army is invading our borders.

347
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,650
When His Majesty isn't even here? What do you plan to do?

348
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:35,500
My Lord, I received a message that the peddler has arrived.

349
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,770
Should I tell him to come here as we've always done?

350
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:44,550
No. Sin Chi Soo is probably monitoring you, Woon Sim.

351
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:49,460
This place is no longer suitable for secret meetings.

352
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:53,570
Then, what do you plan to do now?

353
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:59,200
I will let you know about the meeting place so tell him to go there.

354
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,990
Yes, My Lord.

355
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:20,290
They said they would not invade the borders recklessly again so why did they break that promise?

356
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:24,600
The Qing emperor said it was Joseon that broke their promise first.

357
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:30,300
They probably wouldn't be doing this over the Ming's envoy coming.

358
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:35,290
It must be because they've decided to go to war with the Ming.

359
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,580
Tell the Qing emperor that even if he decides to wage war with the Ming and Later Jin,

360
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:45,070
Joseon will not strike Later Jin in the back.

361
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:51,140
And we will not take anyone's side and will remain neutral, so stop attacking Joseon any further.

362
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,580
How can we trust that?

363
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:57,960
- What if you put us at ease but give troops to the Ming?
 - What?

364
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:04,390
Joseon made a treaty of amity with Ming but you won't even agree to be brother nations with us.

365
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,370
Wouldn't it be stranger for us to believe you?

366
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:13,110
Amity is a grand state matter that requires both nations to be mutually respectful of each other's customs.

367
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:15,940
To demand amity like this with provocation...

368
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:20,950
Then I cannot recommend to His Majesty to maintain our relationship with Later Jin.

369
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,510
It's useless to try to persuade me.

370
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:27,380
Joseon is my mother nation and the nation I was born in.

371
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:31,140
Would I want to see blood taint this land?

372
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,090
What do I have to do to get them to believe me then?

373
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:36,800
They would believe it if it were the king's words.

374
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:47,690
The king's suffering a bout of madness and secluding himself.

375
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:53,340
It truly seems the heavens have made their mind up to help you, Prince Jin Pyeong.

376
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,500
I also thought so as well.

377
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,230
Is there a good way to do this?

378
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:04,590
If we seize this opportunity,

379
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:11,390
we can probably make the king make a big mistake before the Ming envoy.

380
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:16,700
But in order for that to happen, whether the king is truly mad

381
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,620
and if he's really in the royal chamber,

382
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,580
we need to verify it.

383
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,670
If it's that, don't worry.

384
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,420
There's someone who can verify it for us.

385
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:41,370
Your Majesty, the queen dowager is here.

386
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:47,780
Your Majesty, the queen dowager is here.

387
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:56,150
Queen Dowager.

388
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:58,380
What is this you're doing?

389
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:03,470
Queen Dowager, what brings you here at night?

390
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:07,450
I came to see after hearing that the king was not feeling well.

391
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,120
Where's the king?

392
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,840
Well... that... so about that...

393
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,420
Answer me properly!

394
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,160
I came after getting a message about an urgent matter. What is it?

395
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,470
That's...

396
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:36,920
 Send in Chief Royal Secretary if he's here.

397
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:50,480
Welcome, Chief Royal Secretary.

398
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:02,170
- Queen Dowager. 
- Bring me the royal jade seal and the military badge at once.

399
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:08,010
May I ask why?

400
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:10,150
You ask me because you don't know?

401
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,250
They say the crows cry when an epidemic strikes.

402
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,520
The king and the queen both abandoned the palace and left.

403
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,960
Shouldn't I at least take up the responsibility of this nation's affairs?

404
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:24,650
It's to be prepared just in case of hardships, so bring them without further words.

405
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:28,150
I apologize but I cannot follow that order.

406
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:32,350
What did you say? You will ignore my order then?

407
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:34,800
It's for your sake, Queen Dowager.

408
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,270
When His Majesty returns to the palace and finds out you took the royal jade seal and the military badge,

409
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,820
what do you think would happen?

410
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:48,200
Just thinking about it, it will make one's knees knock together.

411
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:54,270
Since I already know that will happen, how could I follow your order?

412
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,610
Chief Royal Secretary, you wouldn't know.

413
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:09,720
Wherever the king is played by treacherous subjects and fails to complete his duties as the king,

414
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,830
it puts my heart in such pain.

415
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:21,050
Who can dare to understand the heart of a mother?

416
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:24,470
Since Sin Chi Soo is gone,

417
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:27,800
another treacherous subject has covered the king's ears and eyes.

418
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:33,370
I worry so much that I fail to sleep at night.

419
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:41,910
I hadn't realized you were so worried about His Majesty.

420
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:50,980
Everyone thinks I resent the king over the matter of Grand Prince Gyeong In.

421
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:55,340
However, that is a trick played by those who try to drive the king and me apart.

422
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,980
I apologize.

423
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:05,560
I didn't realize you were this nation's most loyal subject.

424
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:17,190
Chief Royal Secretary's words are sweet as honey, but to me, they seem as sharp as a knife.

425
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:19,570
Are you suspicious of what I've said then?

426
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:24,840
How could I suspect your loyalty, Queen Dowager?

427
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:30,650
However, for your sake, I dare to offer advice.

428
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:32,750
What is that?

429
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:39,040
Using His Majesty's absence as your chance to pounce into the king's palace like this.

430
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:45,260
Please do not be someone who orders for the royal seal and military badge to be brought to her.

431
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:51,920
No matter how loyal the queen dowager is, this kind of indiscretion...

432
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:58,650
As His Majesty's subject, I will not look on idly.

433
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:04,950
The likes of a chief royal secretary dares to threaten me?!

434
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:06,980
Threaten?

435
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:11,270
It's my word of advice for the queen dowager.

436
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,390
Is the court lady of the queen dowager's palace outside?

437
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,400
Escort the queen dowager away.

438
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:36,470
Queen Dowager.

439
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,440
Chief Royal Secretary.

440
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:52,090
I shall not forget what happened today.

441
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:58,260
Much obliged, Your Highness.

442
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:11,770

443
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,170
Prince Jin Pyeong told me to deliver this message to you.

444
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:23,540
"He was not there."

445
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:29,630
"He was not there."

446
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:34,890
Alright. Tell him I'll proceed with that knowledge.

447
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:36,800
Yes, Your Excellency.

448
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,510
Is there anybody out there?

449
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,240
Yes, Your Excellency. Did you call for me?

450
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,730
I'm going out, so make preparations.

451
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:53,300
Where are you going?

452
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,330
I'm going to Gaegyong where the Ming envoy is staying.

453
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:00,620
Yes, Your Excellency.

454
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:10,080
"He was not there."

455
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:41,150
Father!

456
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:49,480
I must be finally hallucinating.

457
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:53,430
Father, it's So Woon.

458
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:57,470
So Woon!

459
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:02,440
So Woon is here!

460
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,800
You... how did you come here?

461
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:13,130
Look here, it doesn't have to be long.

462
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:17,000
Could you let her come inside and sit down?

463
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,780
No! If the governor knew, he'd have a fit.

464
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,070
Let them in.

465
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:30,640
I'm His Majesty's guard, here to carry out a royal command.

466
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,640
Do as they say.

467
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,810
- And leave your station for one day...
 - Excuse me?

468
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:38,140
without reporting it to the governor separately.

469
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,130
Yes, sir.

470
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,180
What brings you to this faraway place?

471
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:59,090
I came to see you.

472
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:02,150
Did His Majesty send you?

473
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:09,560
Seeing that he had Officer Jang accompany you,

474
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:14,150
he must've been concerned for your safety.

475
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:18,580
His Majesty's grace is beyond limits.

476
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:29,140
It's cold today. Let's go in.

477
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:55,380
Did the queen go in alright?

478
00:51:55,380 --> 00:52:00,470
Yes. I'll go back and bring her after a few hours.

479
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:03,490
No. Since it's been a long time since she's seen her father,

480
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:05,420
we should let them have the night.

481
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,400
Alright.

482
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:53,560
It's cold out. Why are you out here not coming in?

483
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,460
Yes, Father. I'll go in.

484
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,080
Were you crying?

485
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:08,970
There must be something wrong.

486
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:12,470
Nothing. There's nothing wrong.

487
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:18,850
So Woon, ever since you were a child, it was always obvious when you lied.

488
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:25,020
So Woon, since I became a criminal and went into exile,

489
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:28,130
how lonesome and tired you must be in the palace,

490
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:30,840
I understand more than you know.

491
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:35,200
Father, it's not that.

492
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,800
Then what is it?

493
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:42,020
Because seeing you brings tears to my eyes—

494
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:49,410
Perhaps I should live here taking care of you?

495
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:52,540
Your words are seriously absurd.

496
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:56,760
We should be grateful His Majesty sent you here like this.

497
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:03,380
Don't worry about me and go back to the palace when day breaks tomorrow.

498
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:11,540
It's cold. Let's go in.

499
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,740
Yes, Father.

500
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,700
 I couldn't keep you standing there.

501
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:52,540
 I felt like I had to take you away from everyone. I'm sorry.

502
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:57,000
 Your Majesty, I'm fine.

503
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:04,250
 Rather, being with Your Majesty seems warm like a dream and I like it.

504
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:13,030
 If this is a dream, really a dream,

505
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:17,620
 no matter what I do, it wouldn't be a sin.

506
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,680
 Isn't that right?

507
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,910
 I won't avoid it any longer.

508
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,130
 I won't run away either.

509
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:43,250
 Just... I'll just look at you and think only of you.

510
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,220
 I love you.

511
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,890
 As if my heart's about to explode.

512
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:54,790
 As if it's okay that it does.

513
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,510
 I love you.

514
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,640
Your Majesty, it's cold.

515
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,620
I'll find a place to rest, so let's go.

516
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:56,500
You can go by yourself. I'll stay here.

517
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:25,700
I'll go by myself from here.

518
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,430
You cannot.

519
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:30,570
I should at least be with you for your safety.

520
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:36,080
I'm asking for a favor because I need to speak with the queen alone.

521
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:40,270
I understand.

522
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:02,770
Your Highness!

523
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:05,040
Your Highness, where are you?

524
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,110
So Woon! So Woon!

525
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:09,430
- Your Highness!
 - Your Highness!

526
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:11,940
Your Highness!

527
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:14,030
So Woon!

528
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:33,940
Is there still no message from Officer Jang?

529
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:41,530
I don't know why I feel so uneasy.

530
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:47,770
Ha Seon will definitely keep his promise, so please believe him.

531
01:00:58,450 --> 01:00:59,940
Chief Royal Secretary, we're in big trouble!

532
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:03,080
Your Excellency, what is wrong?

533
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:09,400
The Ming envoy arrived at Taepyeonggwan a day early.

534
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:14,080
A message came asking His Majesty to come and receive the emperor's statement.

535
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:19,850
 Letter from Ming's Left Vice Minister of War, Ministry of War:  
The Ming Envoy and his entourage have arrived one day early

536
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:21,870
 and request to meet the King of Joseon today at the Hall of Great Peace to receive a letter from the Emperor of Ming.

537
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:24,640
It's disrespectful on their side for them to arrive a day early.

538
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,100
Don't you think so?

539
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,770
Etiquette-wise, you are right.

540
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:33,190
However, the envoy who carries the emperor's report is no different from the emperor himself.

541
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:36,920
Eunuch Jo, hurry and inform His Majesty.

542
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:41,240
About that...

543
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:45,930
- His Majesty is not here at the moment.
 - What did you say?

544
01:01:45,930 --> 01:01:49,700
If His Majesty does not go, it will eventually incur the emperor's wrath.

545
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:52,000
What do we do about this?

546
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:56,230
I will go.

547
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:10,860
 Taepyeonggwan (Hall of Great Peace - a work and rest place for the Chinese emissary)

548
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:14,250
Who are you? Who are you to come in here without permission?

549
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:17,080
I am Lee Gyoo, the chief royal secretary who serves the King.

550
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,850
I'm here to meet Ming's Ministry of War's Vice Minister.

551
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:23,090
How dare a mere chief royal secretary try to meet the vice minister?

552
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:24,670
Get out.

553
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:27,780
I bring with me His Majesty's authority and intention.

554
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:31,880
I will not go until I relay it to the vice minister.

555
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,910
This bastard... What are you all doing?

556
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:37,300
Drag him out this instant!

557
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:40,060
Stop.

558
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,610
I don't wish to see blood here.

559
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:48,010
Although this is a place for Ming envoys,

560
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:50,470
this is still Joseon land.

561
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:53,830
Back off.

562
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:04,720
I clearly asked for Joseon's king

563
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:08,440
to receive the emperor's report.

564
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:11,180
Who are you?

565
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:18,260
I am Chief Royal Secretary Lee Gyoo. His Majesty asked me to tell you this.

566
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:21,810
Because the promised day to meet the envoy is not today but tomorrow,

567
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:26,800
His Majesty said he'll receive the emperor's report tomorrow.

568
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:43,930
How dare he send a mere chief royal secretary and scorn the emperor's envoy?

569
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:52,590
I will kill you and let Joseon's king know the weight of that crime.

570
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:57,740
 Taepyeonggwan

571
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,350
Why are you here?

572
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:03,790
Are you okay?

573
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:06,570
Did you get hurt?

574
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:09,830
Let go of me.

575
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:14,000
I already told you that I won't see you ever again. Why did you follow me all the way here?

576
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,650
Are you looking down on me?

577
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,900
Are you really planning to die?

578
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,410
It's none of your business.

579
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:26,060
How can I not care?

580
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:28,900
Just punish me instead.

581
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,940
Whatever the punishment it is, I will gladly accept it.

582
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:34,070
Stop. That's enough.

583
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:39,630
The more I talk to you, the more of a sinner I become.

584
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:41,330
That's not true.

585
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:44,170
It's not your sin.

586
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:46,410
Everything is my fault.

587
01:06:46,410 --> 01:06:50,780
I will be the one to pay for my sins, so please don't blame yourself.

588
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:53,620
How can I do that?

589
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:56,340
I have so many sins.

590
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:58,510
They're my sins.

591
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,530
A hundred, a thousand times,

592
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:07,570
I asked myself over and over again.

593
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:12,070
Who is the person inside my heart?

594
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:15,760
Is it you or is it that person?

595
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:22,810
I wanted to deny and avoid it.

596
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:28,210
However, it was my heart that did it.

597
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:35,470
I might be able to fool the world but there's no way I can fool myself.

598
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:38,130
This is the only way.

599
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:00,220
Can you not live for my sake?

600
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:07,800
After I entered the palace, I almost died on several occasions.

601
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:13,860
Every time I thought I would really die, I desperately wanted to survive.

602
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:18,430
It's fine even if I become a high treason criminal like no other.

603
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:25,380
Even if I can only live one more day, I want to live with you.

604
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:32,670
Next to you, while listening to the sound of your laughter, together like that,

605
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:36,640
for a very long time.

606
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:45,830
 I love that you, Your Majesty, and I deeply respect you.

607
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:51,590
 That's why I want to continue living with Your Majesty now.

608
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:56,980
 Next to you, giving birth to your child,

609
01:08:56,980 --> 01:09:01,570
 while listening to the sound of that laughter, together like that,

610
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:03,790
 for a very long time.

611
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:09,620
Please live.

612
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:14,370
For me, please.

613
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:02,210
Your Majesty?

614
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,770
Your Majesty!

615
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,090
Your Majesty!

616
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:44,520
 The Crowned Clown

617
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:54,070

618
01:11:02,410 --> 01:11:04,530
 Preview

619
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:09,120
 This was carried by that clown's sister Dal Rae.

620
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:14,480
 If I can ascend to the throne, there is nothing that I cannot do for you.

621
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:19,040
 I was told that if I came today, the king would be here.

622
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,640
 This is not as promised.

623
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:25,420
 There might be another rebellion in this land.

624
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:28,270
 For the duties of the throne that I am responsible for,

625
01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:34,770
 I have realized that the time for me to cut the ties I have treasured all this time has finally come.
