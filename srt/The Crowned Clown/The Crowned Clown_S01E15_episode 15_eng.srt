 Episode 15

5
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,480
What... What is that?

6
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,560
 Donuimun Gate (also known as The West Gate)

7
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,930
Sir, a huge problem has occurred.

8
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,330
I believe a war has started.

9
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,590
What did you say?

10
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,680
I'll look into it, so you canâ€”

11
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,100
- Open the palace gate! 
 - Yes, sir.

12
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,140
Have there been any problems?

13
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,670
No particular movements.

14
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,370
Who are you?

15
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,400
Stop where you are!

16
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,630
Who is it?

17
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,940
Say the military password.

18
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,000
Sir, the four main gates...

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,820
The four main gates have been broken through!

20
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,230
The rebels are coming...

21
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,030
Hey, come to your senses!

22
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,680
Hey!

23
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,460
Close the palace doors.

24
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,100
Close the palace doors!

25
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,500
Let's go to the West Palace.

26
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,950
Zhao Yun was fighting alone

27
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,540
and sped through the early morning,

28
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,940
and as he saved Liu Bei's wife, Lady Gan's,

29
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,390
son...

30
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,070
Oh, this!

31
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,970
Your Majesty, do you know this story?

32
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,630
When I was on the streets, I heard a joker tell this story.

33
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,590
Liu Bei was initially happy that his son was rescued by Zhao Yun,

34
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,520
but he realized he had almost lost a loyal subject and threw out his son.

35
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,350
Isn't it that famous story?

36
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,790
Yes.

37
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:09,390
If you had been Liu Bei, would you have chosen your son or your loyal subject?

38
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,210
If it were me...

39
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,430
Your Majesty! Your Majesty.

40
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,520
There's a rebellion!

41
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,030
The rebels are intruding right now!

42
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,430
Your Majesty.

43
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,360
Eunuch Jo, please calm down.

44
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,220
Rebels? What do you mean?

45
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,510
I apologize.

46
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,410
The thing is... Prince Jin Pyeong led the rebels

47
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,630
and they have entered the capital.

48
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,770
Prince Jin Pyeong?!

49
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,090
Your Majesty.

50
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,200
How are things looking outside of the palace?

51
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,940
We looked at the direction the torches were moving

52
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,090
and it seems that the rebels have turned back towards the West Palace.

53
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,660
The West Palace? They went to the queen dowager?

54
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,320
It seems the queen dowager will become their leader.

55
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,430
Where is Chief Royal Secretary?

56
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,460
He doesn't seem to be in the palace.

57
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,530
However, he sent you an urgent letter.

58
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,100
  Your Majesty, I am very sorry.

59
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,590
  As a result of my negligence,

60
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,920
  the confidential letter sent to the emperor of Later Jin disappeared.

61
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,220
  I am determined to find the letter.

62
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,740
  Just in case, in the future,

63
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,540
  it would be best if you pretended not to know of the letter.

64
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,310
  Please burn this letter as soon as you receive it.

65
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,160
Your Majesty, what is the matter?

66
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,100
It is nothing.

67
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,510
Officer Jang, do you know of a general we can trust?

68
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,880
The commander of Central Division in Hamgyeong Province, Kang In Bok,

69
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,740
has been handling the border matters with Chief Royal Secretary for a long time.

70
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,830
If he hears of  the revolt that has occurred, he will give you his support.

71
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:41,300
Your Majesty, please ask for help from Commander Kim Ki Joon of Hwanghae Province.

72
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,420
He was a longtime friend of my father.

73
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,830
He will surely stand by your side.

74
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,840
I'll give you the pass to move the military, so send a messenger.

75
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,430
If I sent it now, when will the soldiers arrive at the capital?

76
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,660
Even if we gather  all of our power, it will take time for the soldiers to arrive.

77
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,180
It will at least take four days.

78
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,910
Four days?

79
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,910
Do we have enough manpower and weapons to last us four days against the rebels?

80
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,230
We do not have enough manpower and weapons.

81
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:17,200
We will give it our best. Do not worry.

82
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,630
The eunuchs and officials will also use their strength in protecting the palace.

83
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:28,300
I will make sure the court ladies and the people in the palace are fed.

84
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,110
Thank you all.

85
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,530
Chief Royal Secretary must come quickly.

86
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,930
Shall we go save the scared queen dowager?

87
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,540
Did the king's hunting dogs come to kill me?

88
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,590
Your Highness.

89
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,210
Your Highness.

90
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,960
Prince Jin Pyeong, why did you come so late?

91
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,780
I am very sorry and honored.

92
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,990
Your friend, who came to save you, is outside.

93
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,930
Have them come in.

94
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,240
Your Highness.

95
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,030
Seeing your healthy state makes me feel relieved at last.

96
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,200
Prince Jin Pyeong, what is this?!

97
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,320
Please do not say anything to Prince Jin Pyeong about this.

98
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,630
I came here myself to see you, Your Highness.

99
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,630
How dare you think of showing yourself before me?

100
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,500
It must be true that you've lost your mind.

101
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,520
I have something I have prepared for you.

102
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,060
Please look at it first before speaking further.

103
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:17,930

104
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,750
What a great sight to see.

105
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:43,130
I thought I would never see you punished by the heavens.

106
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,490
But, the heavens did not let me down.

107
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,200
They're allowing me to avenge my son.

108
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:56,250
Your Highness. Avenge the prince? What do you mean?

109
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,770
This man poisoned Prince Gyeong In.

110
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,350
He's the true culprit!

111
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,660
You were my father's enemy,

112
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,400
but you helped me avenge my son.

113
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,550
I'll let you live.

114
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,160
Your Highness, your grace is unlimited.

115
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,020
But the reason why your father was killed,

116
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,280
that was due to the king's orders.

117
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,040
From now on, I will take the lead in overthrowing the tyrant

118
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,420
and escort you back into the palace.

119
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,070
Please give me the opportunity to correct my mistakes.

120
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,820
Alright.

121
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,400
He got fooled by traitor Lee Gyoo and killed his innocent brother.

122
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,000
It wasn't enough for him to usurp the throne,

123
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,120
so he carried out the unfilial act of deposing his mother.

124
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,240
Remove that rebellious king, Lee Heon, from the throne.

125
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,700
Why do you laugh?

126
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,100
You call me a traitor,

127
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,320
and even if you try to remove the king from the throne using that,

128
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,230
if you try and remove the king who has earned the trust of his people and the entire country,

129
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,690
that is just an act of treason with no justification.

130
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:19,870
In the end, you have just become another traitor, Your Highness.

131
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,810
You say you will get revenge on me,

132
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,590
and yet you are on the road to self-destruction.

133
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,960
How can I not laugh at that?

134
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:38,060
Your Highness, it is not unjustified treason.

135
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,180
The king threw away his duties and joined hands with a barbarian from the North in secret.

136
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,300
There is evidence that proves it.

137
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,480
What is the evidence?

138
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:01,340
Sin Chi Soo, show Her Highness the letter right away.

139
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,990
What are you doing? Show her the letter right away.

140
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,320
I cannot do so.

141
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,270
It's not in my hands right now.

142
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,380
What did you say? Then, where is it?

143
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,090
About that...

144
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,040
I cannot tell you.

145
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,730
You bastard!

146
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,770
Prince Jin Pyeong, Sin Chi Soo killed your brother and father,

147
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,510
and you're trying to take the throne with his help?

148
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,170
Are you foolish or just innocent?

149
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,180
You should've just told me instead.

150
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,540
I would've felt sorry for you

151
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:02,180
and had mercy on you as I helped you sit on the throne.

152
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:07,550
One more word and I'll cut your tongue off.

153
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:12,410
To think that such a lowly worm dreams of being king.

154
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:15,640
Isn't that so funny?

155
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,850
- Prince Jin Pyeong. 
 - Die, you bastard!

156
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,650
Prince Jin Pyeong, stop it!

157
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,170
Your Highness, I'm trying to avenge Prince Gyeong In by killing this man.

158
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,940
Why are you stopping me?

159
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,190
Do you truly not know?

160
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,570
This man plans on provoking you into killing him.

161
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,830
But that won't do.

162
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:43,190
If you kill him, the king will not surrender.

163
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,940
Do not worry about that.

164
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,850
If you give me the order, I will barge into the palace,

165
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,460
kill the king, and bring you the royal seal!

166
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,270
I cannot give you that order.

167
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:59,930
Like he said, I cannot return to the palace as a traitor.

168
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:07,190
We'll have to restore the throne and establish legitimacy.

169
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,220
First, get the king to surrender.

170
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,490
How dare you deceive me?

171
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,870
Where is the king's confidential letter?

172
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:42,990
When we go to the palace and get the king to surrender, I'll tell you then.

173
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:48,520
You dare test me as an opponent?

174
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:53,810
Four days. We only have four days.

175
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,860
What are you saying?

176
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,860
Right now, the king has most definitely sent someone for reinforcements.

177
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:05,020
Then nine times out of ten, he will have sent for commanders whom Chief Royal Secretary is close to.

178
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:09,680
In four days, the soldiers will come to protect the king.

179
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,870
We'll have to succeed in restoring the throne in four days, then.

180
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:18,430
Yes, but we do not have the time to fight amongst ourselves right now.

181
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,400
Four days.

182
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,600
Four days.

183
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,880
Bring the royal seal to me in four days.

184
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,230
Of course.

185
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,440
I have nowhere else to go now.

186
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,150
My Lord.

187
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,140
The queen dowager is calling for you.

188
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,450
I heard you were the one who put up the posters showing contempt for the king. Is that true?

189
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,070
It is true that I put the posters up,

190
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,070
But it is not true that I was showing contempt.

191
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:23,160
How is calling that clown what he truly is showing contempt?

192
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,760
Court Lady Kim's words were true.

193
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,840
Then, where is the king?

194
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,670
I do not know myself.

195
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:37,780
But if the king is alive,

196
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,890
would he have allowed that lowly clown to dirty the throne like that?

197
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,490
The king is dead, then?

198
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:52,880
Wow. If we could've had them together in one spot,

199
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,560
the king could've been removed for monopolizing matters of State.

200
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,850
What a shame.

201
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,660
Do not worry.

202
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,790
I will take responsibility and have that fake king surrender.

203
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,040
You don't even have the confidential letter. How will you get him to surrender?

204
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,890
It makes no difference if I have the letter in my hands.

205
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:15,150
I ask that you believe in me and grant me full authority.

206
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,970
Full authority?

207
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,930
Tell me exactly what you want.

208
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:31,240
More than anything else, it is important that the new owner of the throne

209
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,860
should give you his utmost loyalty, Your Highness.

210
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,890
You do not wish for it to be Prince Jin Pyeong?

211
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,370
Well, if I am to act as regent,

212
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,570
it would be better to have a younger member of the royal family.

213
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,770
I understand.

214
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:56,870
When I am choosing the next person to take the throne, I'll ask for your opinion.

215
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,290
Since I will be doing that, bring the royal seal

216
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,420
and the head of the fake king.

217
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,930
It'd be even better if you brought the head of the queen, too.

218
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,840
Can you do it?

219
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,180
Your grace is immeasurable.

220
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,490
Arrest Joo Ho Geol and bring him to me.

221
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,510
Yes, Your Excellency.

222
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,530
 Official letter with a personal message from faux King Yi Heon to  Nurhaci, the First Khan of Manchu, Later Jin Dynasty: 
To notify...

223
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:55,870
 Nurhaci  that Joseon is forced by the Ming to deploy 10,000 soldiers against Later Jin, but he will block and delay it. (Historically, this is known as The Liaodong Campaign.)

224
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,900
I don't know what to do.

225
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,470
Even though I wish to follow my uncle's orders,

226
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,680
I wonder if I must show this to His Majesty.

227
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,170
What would you do if it were you?

228
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,750
Shouldn't your uncle's orders come first?

229
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,790
That's true.

230
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,370
The king does not even care for me.

231
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,640
But, my uncle fed me poison.

232
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,760
Who must I trust?

233
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,070
 The official letter is stamped with an imperial seal.

234
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:37,180
Your Majesty, does it worry you that Chief Royal Secretary has not shown up yet?

235
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:45,870
He should've come by now, but since he hasn't arrived, it worries me.

236
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,840
Do not worry.

237
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,930
It's probably taking him a long time because he's finding a way to oppose the rebels.

238
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:01,870
Your Majesty, I, Eunuch Jo, am entering.

239
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,550
Did Chief Royal Secretary arrive?

240
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,250
I apologize.

241
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:19,110
Chief Royal Secretary did not arrive, but Joo Ho Geol has.

242
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,360
Joo Ho Geol?

243
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,090
The rebels should've been blocking the path. How did he...?

244
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:41,420
How did you come here?

245
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,170
Your Majesty.

246
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:47,750
Sir, report what happened to Chief Royal Secretary to the king.

247
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,610
Chief Royal Secretary.

248
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,590
What happened to him for you to be like this?

249
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,280
Your Majesty.

250
00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:01,160
He was captured by Prince Jin Pyeong and Sin Chi Soo.

251
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,680
Sin Chi Soo was captured by the Royal Investigation Bureau. How did he escape?

252
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:13,800
Sin Chi Soo asked for this to be sent to you, Your Majesty.

253
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,910
 Chief Royal Secretary, Lee Gyoo's official badge.

254
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,820
This belongs to Chief Royal Secretary.

255
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:37,850
 To Ha Seon:  Within two hours, open the palace gates and approve the beheading of a treacherous court official, Lee Gyoo. Only then will the rebellion cease.

256
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:44,390
They're asking for the opening of the palace gates and the approval to behead traitor Lee Gyoo.

257
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:49,060
Only if we do that will they cease the rebellion.

258
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,350
Oh, my Hyungnim!

259
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:10,010
Your Majesty, please save the life of Chief Royal Secretary.

260
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:17,320
He isn't someone who should die in vain like this!

261
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:25,330
The world he dreamt of... it has only just begun.

262
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:31,480
Your Majesty, please,

263
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,220
save Hyungnim's life.

264
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,380
Please stop.

265
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,290
To save the life of Chief Royal Secretary

266
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,770
is what we all want too.

267
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:57,830
Your Majesty, in four days, the soldiers will have come to protect you.

268
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:03,300
Please, stand firmly until then. That is what you must do for the future.

269
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,330
Please give me time to think for myself.

270
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,990
Yes.

271
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

272
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:29,990

273
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,610
My Queen.

274
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:49,280
Your Majesty, I heard what happened to Chief Royal Secretary.

275
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,530
Are you okay?

276
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,080
I'm not sure.

277
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,440
Whenever I struggled because I didn't know the answer, Chief Royal Secretary was next to me. And he's not here anymore.

278
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:08,000
I'm not sure what the right thing to do is.

279
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,390
Your Majesty, do you remember what I told you a while back?

280
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,180
What was it?

281
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,020
Are you talking about the story between Zhao Yun and Liu Bei?

282
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,760
Yes.

283
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,520
I asked you if you had been Liu Bei,

284
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,260
whom would you have chosen between the son and the loyal subject?

285
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,810
Please answer me.

286
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:46,980
If I had been Liu Bei, I wouldn't have given up on anyone.

287
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:52,930
If an innocent person, my person, or my people get hurt, that's unpardonable.

288
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:57,580
Yes, that's the kind of man you are, Your Majesty.

289
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:02,290
When you feel as if there is no answer, you find one.

290
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:06,930
When others say it can't happen, you say that it can.

291
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:11,750
This time, too, you'll find the answer again, Your Majesty.

292
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,770
I believe in you, Your Majesty.

293
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,330
Thank you.

294
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,910
Seon Hwa Dang.

295
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:44,280
Your Majesty, there is something I must tell you.

296
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,720
Please send everyone away.

297
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,980
Go on.

298
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,350
Your Majesty, even though my uncle committed a treasonous crime, he did not stop there, and

299
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:08,380
I apologize for the fact that he has joined forces with the rebels.

300
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:15,640
It bothers me to think that I might have to leave this palace.

301
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:21,390
If you tell me to leave, I will, but if you tell me to stay, I will.

302
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,530
Please tell me your will.

303
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,120
Seon Hwa Dang, what do you wish for?

304
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,020
I wish to remain in the palace.

305
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,210
Then, you may.

306
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:40,560
It was not your crime, so you may stay at the palace.

307
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,930
I was so worried that you would tell me to leave.

308
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:48,960
Now, with such a happy heart, I will tell you the news.

309
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:55,080
To be honest, before my uncle was imprisoned by the Royal Investigation Bureau, he entrusted me with a letter.

310
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,390
I looked and the letter had your royal seal on it.

311
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,530
Where is that letter?

312
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:03,660
I have hidden it well at my palace.

313
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,310
Bring it right away.

314
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,290
Yes, Your Majesty

315
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:21,050
I wanted to make you happy at least once. I am so relieved.

316
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,500
This is the letter with my order written on it.

317
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,870
Go to Sin Chi Soo and Prince Jin Pyeong tomorrow

318
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:52,830
I will be holding a court session with all of the military and civil officials. Tell them to prepare.

319
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:57,820
Your Majesty, you're going to let those men in the palace?

320
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,440
Yes.

321
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,050
Even if you say it is a court session, they will think it dangerous and will not enter the palace.

322
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,050
They will surely come into the palace.

323
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:11,490
When they attend, I have written the condition that they must bring in Chief Royal Secretary.

324
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,940
You should receive a definite answer from them about that.

325
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,220
Yes, Your Majesty.

326
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:22,000
 Whether Chief Royal Secretary Lee Gyoo is guilty of a crime or not, that is a matter for the cabinet ministers

327
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,990
 to discuss and decide during a court session. Come and attend the session tomorrow morning.

328
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,930
What is the matter?

329
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,740
Have a look yourself.

330
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,640
Whether Chief Royal Secretary Lee Gyoo is guilty of a crime or not,

331
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,170
that is a matter for the cabinet ministers to discuss and decide during a court session.

332
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:50,970
Come and attend the court session tomorrow morning.

333
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:54,880
I had a feeling the king would do something like this.

334
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,370
He just wants to stall by having a useless court discussion.

335
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:01,840
Still, we have to go into the palace.

336
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,760
What? The king is being protected by palace guards.

337
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,810
How could we go in without our soldiers?

338
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:17,430
The confidential letter that shows that the king sided with the Jurchens is in the palace.

339
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:21,770
If we get our hands on that letter,

340
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:25,760
we can have his head based on that evidence itself.

341
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,570
You wish to give up here?

342
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:54,710
Let His Majesty know that we will attend tomorrow with Chief Royal Secretary.

343
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:59,570
But, however many palace guards the king may have,

344
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:04,850
we will bring just as many. Tell him that he must accept this condition.

345
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:10,410
  If he insists on bringing their soldiers, tell him our condition of having all the officials attend, as well.

346
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:13,560
  Have the number of military allowed be reduced.

347
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,350
Are you listening to me?

348
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,540
His Majesty will have all the court officials attend, as well.

349
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,090
He ordered for no more than ten soldiers to be brought in.

350
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,880
What will you do?

351
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,270
Then, the court session must be held in the courtyard of the palace.

352
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:43,820
The king should only have ten palace guards, as well, then.

353
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:48,390
If the king does so, then so will we.

354
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,340
Tell him.

355
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:02,000
Your Majesty, I have returned.

356
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,880
Yes, did they accept my proposal?

357
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,470
Yes. They did as you predicted.

358
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:10,970
How did you know?

359
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:15,280
They have a reason why they must enter the palace.

360
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,290
The evidence that they could use to take down Chief Royal Secretary and I is in the palace.

361
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,390
Then, shouldn't we prevent them from entering?

362
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:28,090
I have the evidence they want. Things will not go the way they want.

363
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,070
What is the evidence?

364
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,800
Seon Hwa Dang said that she would bring it to me.

365
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,650
She is late.

366
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:44,540
Your Majesty. Please hurry over to Seon Hwa Dang.

367
00:34:54,010 --> 00:35:01,090

368
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,140
Officer Jang!

369
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,550
Scour the palace and find the person who killed Seon Hwa Dang.

370
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,590
Start interrogating the court ladies at Seon Hwa Dang's residence.

371
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:29,930
Yes, I will carry out your order.

372
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,490
Let's go.

373
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,420
You must look through Seon Hwa Dang's residence

374
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,670
and find me a letter.

375
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,520
What kind of letter are you speaking of?

376
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,360
It's a confidential letter with the royal seal on it.

377
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,530
How did it go?

378
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,710
We searched Seon Hwa Dang's residence

379
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:46,890
and the court ladies that worked for her.

380
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,970
But we couldn't find the letter.

381
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,800
Did you find out who killed Seon Hwa Dang?

382
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,430
We interrogated the court ladies around her,

383
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:02,230
but Court Lady Jo, who came with her from her home, seems to be the key suspect.

384
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,960
Receive the land documents and find the confidential letter.

385
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,650
You must find the confidential letter before the court session.

386
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

387
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:22,210
I told you to bring me his surrender. Who told you to go to a court session?!

388
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:27,320
You assured me that you could get me that clown's surrender.

389
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:34,010
I apologize, but I have a plan. Please trust me.

390
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:36,250
I don't want to listen to it.

391
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:39,720
I'll see that clown myself.

392
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:44,130
Send that confidential letter to the palace, and tell him to come at once!

393
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:53,590
Your Majesty, you cannot leave like this.

394
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:57,990
It is surely a plan for those who want to hurt you.

395
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,720
I cannot let Chief Royal Secretary die.

396
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,010
But...

397
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,540
I will take His Majesty there.

398
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:10,020
I'll bring the palace guards. I'll trust you with the defense of the palace.

399
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,390
Your safety is the most important.

400
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:15,490
I'll leave the defense of the palace to the commander of the Royal Army.

401
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,730
Do not worry.

402
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,590
I understand. You may leave.

403
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:27,600
Your Majesty, must you leave?

404
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,030
Do not worry. I'll return safely.

405
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,720
You lowly clown.

406
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,350
Show your respect.

407
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:40,650
You have been deposed and are now a private citizen. I no longer have to show my respect.

408
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:45,930
I believed that there was no man in the world crazier than the king.

409
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,610
But Chief Royal Secretary found a crazier one.

410
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:53,190
To be fair, the lowest of the low has tasted the king's power. How could you not?

411
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,070
Is Chief Royal Secretary safe?

412
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:57,630
Are you afraid that your owner might die?

413
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,930
Do not worry.

414
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:03,300
I'll give him the proper punishment for showing contempt for the royal family and the court of this country.

415
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,740
I won't kill him before I get my revenge on you.

416
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:14,700
If a stranger heard you, they'd definitely think you treasured your stepson.

417
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:23,440
It's true that for a long time, I prayed for the king's death.

418
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:29,500
Even if he was only half, he was still continuing the line of royal descendants from the former king.

419
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,280
But how could one be indifferent to Chief Royal Secretary's crime

420
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,190
of putting a clown on the throne and monopolizing the affairs of State?

421
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:38,630
You've engaged in rebellion just to give Chief Royal Secretary his punishment?

422
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,120
Who would believe that?

423
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,330
You should just say that you wish to avenge your son.

424
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:50,820
Even if you say that, you cannot hide your impure intentions and desire for the throne.

425
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,580
Even if you try your best to act as king,

426
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,360
you can't hide your lowly origins.

427
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,790
If Chief Royal Secretary disappears,

428
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,850
you will be taken down in an instant.

429
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,330
Your only crime is that you received Chief Royal Secretary's orders

430
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,540
and acted upon them.

431
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,740
If you take issue with Chief Royal Secretary's crimes,

432
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,510
then I'll forgive you of your crimes.

433
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:17,360
So you should obediently surrender and hand over the royal seal.

434
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,170
What right do you have to be asking me about my crimes

435
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,960
and telling me you'll forgive them?

436
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,730
The person who should confess their crimes and receive punishment is standing in front of me!

437
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,220
You bastard!

438
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:35,730
I'm going to expose the fact that you are a lowly clown playing a king to your citizens!

439
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,680
Let them know!

440
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,260
How will you prove that I am fake?

441
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,190
Would the people listen to a traitor?

442
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:48,220
The queen was obedient to a lowly clown like you as if you were her father.

443
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:52,030
What if they knew she had fooled everyone?

444
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:55,760
The rumors say that the queen is wicked and lacks virtue.

445
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,130
It will be recorded in history and your descendants will know of it.

446
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:04,390
Could the queen live in her right mind if she held onto such indignity?

447
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:11,890
Do as you wish.

448
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:16,490
Whenever a single tear is shed from my queen's eyes,

449
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:20,650
I'll make your eyes shed blood.

450
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:24,920
Whenever sighs leave my queen's mouth,

451
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,780
I'll make screams leave yours.

452
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:34,990
You bastard. You are wicked and impertinent.

453
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:39,580
You are merely a clown. What do you have that you are so impertient?

454
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,740
Are you not even afraid of the heavens?

455
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:46,190
Will you truly sully the sacred royal throne with your lowly blood?!

456
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:49,090
Do not speak such nonsense!

457
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:53,480
People do not decide what is precious or lowly. The heavens do.

458
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:58,210
Your position determined from birth does not matter. Your heart and your actions do.

459
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,170
You do not even know about that.

460
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:05,740
How dare you speak about royal descendants in such a way? Are you not even embarrassed?

461
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,750
Shut up.

462
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:11,150
Then again, the only thing you have is your royal blood.

463
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:14,020
I guess you have no choice.

464
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:46,520
Do you have the confidence to reveal the crimes of Chief Royal Secretary

465
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,880
and bring me the royal seal of the clown?

466
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,580
I will be fully ready for it.

467
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,060
You do not need to worry.

468
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:25,010
I've come to apologize to you.

469
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:30,070
For a while, I believed that you were spotless and aloof

470
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:36,340
as you hid behind the king and queen's father, while you were really a schemer.

471
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,260
From what I see now,

472
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,720
you are far ahead.

473
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,240
What is it that you wish to say?

474
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:50,960
I will request that the queen dowager save your life.

475
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,800
Instead, convey a single message to that clown.

476
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,520
Tell him to step down from the throne and surrender.

477
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,570
He might not listen to others, but he'll listen to you.

478
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:04,710
You have misjudged him.

479
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:07,730
The king only does as he wishes.

480
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:11,660
He is not the type to be swayed by words without his own say.

481
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:15,230
Are you still unaware after what you've been through?

482
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:21,910
Will you truly throw away your life because of that lowly, fake king?

483
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:26,780
What is lowly and what is fake?

484
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:30,810
Everything that man did was for the country and its people,

485
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:35,460
so you cannot call that lowly or even fake.

486
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,580
Just like what that clown says,

487
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,000
this is nonsense.

488
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,310
Nonsense. That's true.

489
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:50,850
People do not look at the heavens, and only look at the ground, at their own feet, and where they go.

490
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:57,050
People like you and Prince Jin Pyeong can never understand.

491
00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:01,370
I feel sick, so I can't listen to this any longer.

492
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:11,980
That clown asked that you attend tomorrow's court session, as well.

493
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:16,840
His Majesty opened a court session?

494
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,330
He's fearless.

495
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:22,060
He doesn't even know what a court session is.

496
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:25,720
The more you threaten the king,

497
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,240
the more daring he gets.

498
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,730
He has decided to fight the rebels.

499
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:33,340
Alright.

500
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:40,560
Then, we'll see if that clown wins or if the king's blood wins.

501
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:52,950

502
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,860
You bastard! Get out of the way!

503
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:09,020
What is this fuss?

504
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,680
Prince Jin Pyeong, I have come to greet the queen dowager.

505
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,990
Why are you blocking the way?

506
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:31,180
If you don't want to die, just leave.

507
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,990
Why did you block Prince Yeong Hwa from entering?

508
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:53,060
I didn't want to see his face.

509
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,000
What?

510
00:47:55,860 --> 00:48:01,480
Do you believe I don't know why you're meeting with the royal family members?

511
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,520
Be careful.

512
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:10,140
The only reason I am here is to get rid of the king and sit on the throne myself.

513
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,070
Of course.

514
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:18,080
There is no one else I have thought about to take the throne beside you, Prince Jin Pyeong.

515
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:26,890
You must follow through on what you just said.

516
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,700
It's cold. Why are you out here?

517
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,860
Why are you out here, Your Majesty?

518
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:00,850
I cannot deceive you, My Queen.

519
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:07,130
I cannot sleep thinking about what's to happen tomorrow at the court session.

520
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:09,740
Do you feel the same?

521
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:15,990
I need to offer you my support,

522
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:20,220
but I actually feel anxious for some reason.

523
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:25,620
To think that you have to confront the others on your own,

524
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:30,510
I worry that something might happen to you, Your Majesty.

525
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,160
Nothing will happen to me.

526
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,170
I apologize.

527
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:49,960
I should be firm in my support for you, but...

528
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,030
It is alright.

529
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,480
Just as the locust trees become intertwined and firmer,

530
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:03,140
it will be alright if you lean on me, and I lean on you.

531
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:37,420
Today there will be a court session in the courtyard of the palace.

532
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,480
It is different from other occasions.

533
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,760
No matter what happens, you cannot leave His Majesty.

534
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,780
Yes, Eunuch Jo.

535
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:53,240
Make sure you convey what I said to the palace officials.

536
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,680
Do not worry.

537
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,630
Did you find the letter?

538
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:27,550
I apologize. Court Lady Jo has still not confessed.

539
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:32,230
Your Majesty, don't you have to postpone the court session?

540
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:33,860
No.

541
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:38,020
If not today, there is no chance to save Chief Royal Secretary.

542
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,050
Your Majesty!

543
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:46,750
Have they arrived? When will the soldiers arrive?

544
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:51,010
Commander Kang In Bok from Hamgyeong province saw the soldiers starting to depart,

545
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:55,410
so he quickly came by horse. The soldiers will arrive tomorrow.

546
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:58,560
Alright. You did well.

547
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:27,550
Your Excellency.

548
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:31,220
What is the matter?

549
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:35,990
I thought about your proposal all night.

550
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,130
What proposal do you mean?

551
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:42,790
I told him to personally meet with the king and make him surrender.

552
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:46,320
Please allow me to meet with the king.

553
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,800
That won't do.

554
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,480
If you two get together and get your stories straight,

555
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:57,120
then there's no point in me putting myself in danger to attend the court session.

556
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:03,020
You can come with me. Just allow me to meet the king.

557
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:01,970
Have you been well, Your Majesty?

558
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:09,130
Your lifeline is quite long.

559
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:12,890
It wasn't enough for you to be imprisoned, so you joined forces with the rebels?

560
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:18,220
Are you speaking of me, Your Majesty?

561
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,530
That is nonsense.

562
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:24,670
If I had thought of causing a rebellion,

563
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:27,730
I would've forced myself in with my military.

564
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:32,160
Why have you asked to see me before the court session?

565
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:37,760
This man said he had something to tell you.

566
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,120
Your Majesty.

567
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:48,560
Do you remember when I said there were two ways to survive in the palace?

568
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,220
  There are two ways to survive in the palace.

569
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:56,090
  You either completely step on them and kill them,

570
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:58,150
  or you completely ignore them.

571
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:00,160
I remember.

572
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:05,630
Today,

573
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:09,690
you need to just choose the second method.

574
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,990
Do you have anything else to say?

575
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:21,430
The only things you should consider important are this nation and its people, Your Majesty.

576
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:26,770
Anything else besides that, you must be willing to throw away.

577
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:29,320
Including me.

578
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:33,120
I cannot agree with that. Throw you away?

579
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:37,850
Is that not the same as telling Liu Bei to throw away Zhao Yun?

580
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:45,160
To think that you are comparing me to the great commander and loyal subject, Zhao Yun,

581
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,450
it is such a great honor that brings tears to my eyes.

582
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:52,250
Since I saw you last,

583
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:56,670
you seem to have formed a talent in making your loyal subjects laugh, like a clown, Your Majesty.

584
00:56:56,670 --> 00:57:01,040
No. I was born with it.

585
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:18,370
Yes. You were born with it, Your Majesty.

586
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:22,410
I forgot that.

587
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:32,970
Your Majesty, I was met with such immeasurable grace in serving you.

588
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:35,570
I have no regrets.

589
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:40,220
It is not right to say that you have no regrets.

590
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:42,510
You have so many days ahead of you.

591
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:45,720
Yes. That's true.

592
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,560
I also wanted to say the same to you.

593
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:53,920
Even if it is for this country and its people,

594
00:57:53,920 --> 00:58:00,730
please firmly protect the throne for the rest of your days.

595
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:03,520
- Chief Royal Secretary.
 - Your Majesty.

596
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,990
We cannot keep listening to such a lengthy talk.

597
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:10,360
Let us proceed with the court session.

598
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:15,720
Alright.

599
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:11,520
Your Majesty, we are supposed to pay our respects

600
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:15,510
in accordance with the court session. But because of the recent rebellion,

601
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,980
things have been so chaotic.

602
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:22,010
We will bow just once.

603
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:26,990
Your Majesty, please lay down your command.

604
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:41,210
Release Chief Royal Secretary from his bindings.

605
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:47,630
Your Majesty. Criminal Lee Gyoo is someone who has come here as a traitor.

606
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:49,680
It is unreasonable to free him.

607
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,820
Sin Chi Soo and Prince Jin Pyeong,

608
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,630
you two are both traitors, just the same, to me.

609
00:59:55,630 --> 01:00:00,280
The matters of Chief Royal Secretary have not been settled yet. It is not correct to treat him as a criminal.

610
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,510
Loosen his bindings right away!

611
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:38,490
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.

612
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:07,430
Your Majesty. I will inform you of criminal Lee Gyoo's crimes.

613
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:10,760
Come forth and show the evidence.

614
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:04,740
This is a confidential letter that Chief Royal Secretary sent.

615
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:14,220
"Joseon's king and the royal court do not wish to fight with Later Jin."

616
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:17,060
"We will not release our soldiers to the Ming Dynasty."

617
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:19,940
"Even if Later Jin and the Ming Dynasty cause a war,"

618
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:22,720
"we will not attack."

619
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,590
"Joseon is on neither side."

620
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:31,060
"Emperor of Later Jin, please believe this."

621
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,460
He has forgone the hierarchy to power.

622
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:59,800
Criminal Lee Gyoo, who communicated secretly with the Jurchens,

623
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:03,160
come forth and confess to your sins.

624
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:07,790
Confess? That's unreasonable.

625
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:11,480
I am not even embarrassed about what I did.

626
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:16,100
The ones who should truly be embarrassed are not me, but you two.

627
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:22,170
How long will you keep serving the Ming Dynasty, who has nothing to do with us,

628
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:25,470
and continue to be submissive to them?

629
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:27,900
Why is it alright to serve the Ming who are our supposed superior nation?

630
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,830
What does it matter if we are friendly with Later Jin, who are Jurchens?

631
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:36,020
The most important thing is to protect the people of this country.

632
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:48,740
How touching.

633
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:50,460
But...

634
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:57,050
Your Majesty, in this confidential letter, your royal seal is stamped.

635
01:03:57,050 --> 01:04:01,580
Were you truly unaware of this letter?

636
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,180
If you did not know, Chief Royal Secretary took your power and laid down a royal command.

637
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:21,830
If you knew, then you were communicating secretly with the Jurchens.

638
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:24,960
What is the truth?

639
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,330
- That... 
 - Your Majesty!

640
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:43,710
I assumed your command by using your royal seal.

641
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:47,440
That is my own crime.

642
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,430
Chief Royal Secretary.

643
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:54,250
- Do not say that. 
 - Your Majesty.

644
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:59,670
Please consider my words for you to protect your remaining days.

645
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,070
Stop!

646
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:33,760
Let go! Let go of me!

647
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,040
Protect His Majesty!

648
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:50,340
Chief Royal Secretary!

649
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:57,390
  The Crowned Clown

650
01:06:57,390 --> 01:07:09,380
