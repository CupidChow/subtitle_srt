 Final Episode

5
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,430
- Stop! 
 - No, Your Majesty!

6
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,070
Let go! Let go of me!

7
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,210
Protect His Majesty!

8
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,170
Chief Royal Secretary!

9
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,900
Clear the way! Clear the way!

10
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,360
Your Excellency!

11
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,990
Close the palace doors!

12
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,700
Protect the queen!

13
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,510
Your Highness! Your Highness!

14
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,260
Your Majesty!

15
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,970
Your Majesty.

16
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,580
Chief Royal Secretary.

17
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,470
How could you act so recklessly?

18
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:17,790
I deeply apologize for not keeping my promise.

19
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,590
  Engrave this moment in your heart.

20
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,630
  No matter what danger arrives,

21
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,050
  I will never leave your side.

22
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,670
  I will protect you.

23
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,010
I should be protecting you by your side.

24
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,600
Save your words, please.

25
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:52,910
When I die, hang my body on the palace doors.

26
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:02,070
Show them that you made the right decision to punish a criminal.

27
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,220
Comfort the anger of the people.

28
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,260
No, I cannot do that.

29
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,880
You are not a criminal to me. You are a loyal subject! How can I?

30
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,100
Is that so?

31
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:29,050
I am happy to hear those words.

32
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,080
Chief Royal Secretary!

33
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,800
Your Majesty.

34
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,320
Chief Royal Secretary! Chief Royal Secretary!

35
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,050
Move aside!

36
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,140
Open the doors this instant.

37
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,910
If it's not a royal order, we cannot do so.

38
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,880
Clear the way!

39
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,840
Do not stand aside!

40
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,260
Hyungnim.

41
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,200
Hyungnim.

42
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,770
Hyungnim.

43
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,710
Hyungnim.

44
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,630
Hyungnim.

45
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,030
Your Majesty.

46
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:44,690
Please allow for his coffin to be sent out

47
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:49,080
so that his last path can be spent with the people who care for him.

48
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,150
Your Majesty, it is too dangerous to open the palace doors now.

49
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,250
You could just be opening the way for the rebels.

50
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,790
If you just give royal permission,

51
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,740
I'll carry him on my back and leave.

52
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,460
You said that right now at the doors of the Royal Investigation Bureau,

53
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,410
Prince Jin Pyeong and Sin Chi Soo are facing the palace guards?

54
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,940
Yes, Your Majesty. What should we do?

55
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,970
I want to properly take care of

56
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,920
Chief Royal Secretary's last path.

57
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,840
  Chief Royal Secretary's coffin will be sent out.

58
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,010
  For a quarter of a day, cease your attacks so that the funeral rites can be carried out.

59
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,720
  If you do not allow for the coffin to be sent out,  Chief Royal Secretary's corpse will be hung on the palace doors

60
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,400
  and it will be shown that I dealt with a criminal in a proper way.

61
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,860
  If that happens, the people will find out that a rebellion had occurred without proper justification.

62
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,750
  If an order is sent to kill Prince Jin Pyeong and Sin Chi Soo, who acted rudely towards me during the court session,

63
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,490
  no one will oppose it.

64
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,090
  What will you do?

65
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,440
Funeral rites?

66
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,140
For a traitorous criminal?

67
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,510
Your Highness, if I do not send a response within the hour,

68
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,760
it was said that my master, Prince Jin Pyeong's throat would be slit.

69
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,450
Please save my master.

70
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:32,110
There is no need to cause trouble by hanging a traitor's corpse on the doors.

71
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,480
Send the message that we'll follow his orders.

72
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,540
  I know for sure now.

73
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,350
  You are different from that man, Ha Seon.

74
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:45,570
  I chose you but I could not completely trust you.

75
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:50,340
  Trust is so important.

76
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,400
  I have come to that realization through you.

77
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,350
  Your Majesty.

78
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,940
  I will not be afraid any longer.

79
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,500
  I will protect my duty,

80
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,990
  and I will trust in you and serve you completely.

81
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:22,820
  Please forgive all of my faults from the past.

82
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:09,950
 Casket of Constitutional Reformer, Chief Royal Secretary, Lee Gyoo.

83
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,360
  If I asked you to come to the dangerous and secluded borders with me,

84
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,110
  would you come with me?

85
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:49,190
I could have been completely with you, My Lord.

86
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,150
You said for us to go together,

87
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,220
but how could you leave like this?

88
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,500
I need to go avenge him.

89
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,820
- I will, too. 
 - Forget it.

90
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,640
It won't be avenging his death.

91
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,160
You'll just be killed in vain.

92
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,690
Your words are true.

93
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:29,370
Would Chief Royal Secretary have wanted you to sacrifice your lives?

94
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,400
Your Highness.

95
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,910
Prince Yeong Hwa.

96
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,380
Prince Jin Pyeong, how are you feeling?

97
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,500
This

98
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,430
isn't anything at all.

99
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,570
I'll be up as if nothing happened tomorrow morning.

100
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,250
Do not worry.

101
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,780
What a shame.

102
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,370
If you had not coveted the throne,

103
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,340
you would've enjoyed living out the rest of your life.

104
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,030
This is such a shame.

105
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:39,870
The 3,000 soldiers that you gathered,

106
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,730
I will use them well when I succeed in restoring things to the way they were.

107
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,480
I will place Prince Yeong Hwa on the throne and plan for the future.

108
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,490
Do not worry about the aftermath. Alright?

109
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,040
You were so confident that you would be able to get the king to surrender after going to the court session.

110
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,790
If Chief Royal Secretary had not died,

111
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,630
I would have never condoned your mistakes at the palace.

112
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,460
If something happens to Prince Jin Pyeong, his soldiers will become dispirited.

113
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,200
Do you have something to deal with that?

114
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,970
Yes.

115
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:36,960
I have already used my wealth to boost the soldiers' morale.

116
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,380
Do not worry about it.

117
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:45,230
Rather than that, do you still think

118
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,790
that you need to find justification to restore the throne?

119
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,620
What are you trying to say?

120
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,820
If you let this night pass as you try to find the justification,

121
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,900
your attempt at restoring the throne will fail.

122
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,890
You have not received an edict for being deposed yet.

123
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:03,500
You still come first before the king, Your Highness.

124
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:09,140
If you use that as your source of authority and order for the traitorous tyrant to be deposed,

125
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,740
I will immediately come forth and request a justification.

126
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,530
We're going to go into the palace.

127
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,930
Drag that clown

128
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,690
down from the throne tonight.

129
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,990
Your Majesty.

130
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:37,350
The commander from Hamgyeong Province, Kang In Bok, has sent a message.

131
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,540
Your Majesty, what is the matter?

132
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,220
The situation at the borders has worsened suddenly.

133
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,250
Later Jin could intrude  at any moment.

134
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,880
They have arrived at Yangju of Gyeonggi-do Province.

135
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,460
But he is not sure if he can bring the soldiers to the capital in this situation.

136
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:14,090
He is asking whether I will order them to return to the borders and have them defend against Later Jin.

137
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,600
He is waiting for my order.

138
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,740
This is all because Sin Chi Soo intercepted your confidential letter.

139
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,520
Your safety comes first, Your Majesty.

140
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,590
You must order them to come to the capital right away.

141
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:31,680
Call Commander Kang. Protecting the throne is the right way.

142
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,770
But if the borders crumble,

143
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:43,110
the people will be trampled by the Later Jin soldiers and they will die.

144
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:48,110
It would be meaningless to just protect the throne.

145
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,790
How many rebels are there?

146
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,850
Including those in Gyeonggi Province and the soldiers in the unit there,

147
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,460
we have more than 3,000 people.

148
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,600
If we combine the palace guards, soldiers,

149
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,130
and the eunuchs, it will not be greater than 400 people.

150
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:18,270
Your Majesty, I apologize, but even if we gather all the strength of the palace with these numbers,

151
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,440
we will not make it more than two days.

152
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:25,620
The rebels must know about this, as well. They will probably attack soon.

153
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:31,880
Your Majesty, I will find a way to take you and the queen out of the palace.

154
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,870
Please prepare for it.

155
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,540
I cannot do so.

156
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,800
The people in this palace are my people as well.

157
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,070
How could I go and leave them here?

158
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,400
Stop.

159
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,990
Stab the tyrant to death!

160
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,820
There he is.

161
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,360
Protect the king!

162
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,370
Your Majesty!

163
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,070
I will kill you and have you charged for stealing the confidential letter for your personal gain,

164
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:06,360
putting the borders in danger, and for throwing the capital into confusion.

165
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,360
If you let me go alive,

166
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,700
I will bring the queen dowager's head.

167
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,660
The queen dowager's head?

168
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,480
Yes, Your Majesty. Her head.

169
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:48,020
Not only her head, but I will bring the heads of all the rebels.

170
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,200
Please forgive my sins.

171
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,980
There is no forgiveness.

172
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,730
The only thing that can pay for Chief Royal Secretary's death is death itself.

173
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,290
You lowly clown!

174
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:18,180
Your Majesty, I apologize.

175
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:22,520
We were late because we were suppressing the rebels blocking the way to the capital.

176
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:27,090
Do not worry. You came at the right time.

177
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,370
  Your Majesty!

178
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:37,520
 Commander Hwang Hae Do has arrived near the capital.

179
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,970
 He will be arriving by tonight.

180
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:43,170
 Commander Hwang Hae Do will be arriving soon?

181
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:48,660
 I have thought of a way to suppress the rebels.

182
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:54,630
Your Majesty, you should order for the rebels to surrender and uphold your dignity.

183
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,750
Please wait a moment.

184
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,680
I have one last thing I must do.

185
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:30,440
Water...

186
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,700
How come it is as silent as a dead mouse?

187
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,400
Go out and check what's happening.

188
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,930
Yes, Your Highness.

189
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,180
Your Highness, I bring back news of victory.

190
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,410
The rebels have succeeded in entering the palace and capturing the king!

191
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,570
Where did Sin Chi Soo go? Why are you here?

192
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:38,220
He died in battle.

193
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,880
The king has been cornered and confined at the palace.

194
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,070
I received a letter. Please take a look.

195
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,540
 If Queen Dowager would agree not to hold my men accountable for their crimes, I will confess mine and hand over the imperial seal. Come to the palace at 7 - 9 am.

196
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:57,660
  If the queen dowager says that she will not ask for the crimes of my people,

197
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,560
  I will confess to my crimes and hand over the royal seal.

198
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,180
  Come to the palace at 7 - 9 am.

199
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,810
Call for Prince Yeong Hwa.

200
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,580
It is the first time seeing the throne with my very own eyes.

201
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:03,270
Your father worked so hard to have my descendants to sit on the throne.

202
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,230
Even though Prince Gyeong In died,

203
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:12,650
I have finally relieved him from his resentment.

204
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,830
Confess to your crimes.

205
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:22,520
You sided with Later Jin and showed contempt for the Ming Dynasty, our superior nation.

206
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,640
Do you acknowledge your crime of ruining the loyalty and duty of this country?

207
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,180
I have no crimes to confess.

208
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,050
What did you say?

209
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,800
Are you denying your crime of sending the confidential letter?

210
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,870
The confidential letter was a choice and method to protect my country.

211
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:42,720
If it means that I can protect my people, I will side with whomever without hesitation.

212
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,980
That is my duty as a king.

213
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,420
You bastard.

214
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,090
You set up a trap by saying

215
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,450
you would confess.

216
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:09,190
I have called you to take the final step in deposing you.

217
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,790
You have no power to depose me!

218
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:16,750
Are you outside? All, come in!

219
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,520
Prince Yeong Hwa.

220
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,440
Your Majesty.

221
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,120
Did you deceive me?

222
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:13,810
I did not deceive you. I merely followed the king's orders.

223
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,140
Since you have followed my orders well, I will not ask for your crimes.

224
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,460
Your grace is immeasurable.

225
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:31,890
I had planned to give you the throne. You are weak.

226
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,350
Eunuch Jo.

227
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,460
 Imperial edict on the deposition of Queen Dowager Kim: The late king's heavenly match as his legal wife was Queen Dowager Kim and she became my stepmother. Since then, I have exhausted all effort

228
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,770
 to be respectful toward her. Yet, she harmed my queen with witchcraft and ordered the assassination of the late Minister Yoo, as well as led a rebel force in a revolt. Therefore, I order Queen Dowager Kim to be deposed and given poison.

229
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:02,360
Through my power as king, I give an order as follows.

230
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,970
Because you were the spouse of the previous king who was confirmed by the Chinese Emperor and my mother,

231
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,480
up until now, I have fulfilled my filial duty to Queen Dowager Kim.

232
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,280
She performed witchcraft towards the queen.

233
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,330
She ordered the assassination on the queen's father and was the instigator of this rebellion.

234
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:26,490
Depose Queen Dowager Kim and have her be given poison!

235
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:38,170
He dares to act in such an unreasonable way towards me.

236
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,330
What are all of you doing?

237
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,580
Are you just going to stand there and watch?!

238
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:12,990
If Prince Gyeong In had been here, I would not have been degraded like this.

239
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:17,660
It was not enough for you to just kill your innocent brother and have the throne.

240
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,590
You dare to try and tear me down by killing me?

241
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,520
- Drag her out this instant. 
 - Alright!

242
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,130
Go ahead. Try to depose me and give me poison.

243
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:31,370
Even though I will vomit blood and die,

244
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,800
I am not defeated by you, ever!

245
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:41,890
If I die, you will never be able to reign peacefully.

246
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:46,950
The later generations will remember you as a traitorous king who killed his mother.

247
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,260
Even if I die, I am not truly dying.

248
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,580
If you live, you are not truly living!

249
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,500
I will take responsibility for my own crimes.

250
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,920
Your crimes, however,

251
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,800
you can carry them and leave.

252
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:18,920

253
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:53,190
I bloodied my hands for the first time,

254
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,740
but I do not regret it.

255
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:04,270
I could take on things even more severe if it would mean that I could protect my country and its people.

256
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:12,120
I will not be a beast who seeks bloodshed and uses the power of the throne to do so.

257
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:19,020
I will not hesitate when I am dealt with what I must do, just because I am afraid.

258
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,150
Since you have discovered the cruel nature of the throne,

259
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,550
you will be able to take another step forward.

260
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,690
I will always be with you,

261
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:35,120
but in the end, you must take the path yourself.

262
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:40,750
If you get exhausted doing so and wish to rest momentarily,

263
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,900
please come to me.

264
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:49,650
I will always be in this position for you.

265
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:33,830
Your Majesty, the Dae Dong policy has been expanded to the three southern provinces.

266
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:38,050
You have done so much work this past year.

267
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:44,730
Then, I apologize, but could you approve of my break?

268
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:46,580
A break?

269
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,160
- How about you go to Jeju during your break? 
 - Pardon me?

270
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,230
Shouldn't the people of Jeju also enjoy the benefits of the Dae Dong policy?

271
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,190
Oh, yes.

272
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:03,940
I will arrange for that quickly.

273
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,350
Your grace is... immeasurable...

274
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,750
Jeju?

275
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:19,930
  The Principles and Practice of Eastern Medicine   was published well.   (T/N: Book written by Heo Jun, a royal physician)

276
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:23,120
I wish for the book to be published in Hangul as well,

277
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,890
so that the people can read it.

278
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:30,130
Your Majesty, it is too excessive for the people.

279
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:35,520
Even though you wish to benefit them, they will not even understand your grace.

280
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,920
Why does that matter?

281
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,760
When the people try to make sweet rice cakes using azaleas,

282
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,810
we could prevent them from getting stomachaches.

283
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,320
Have you tried consuming azaleas?

284
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,310
You could die from it.

285
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,200
You are correct, Prince Ki Seong.

286
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,640
I will have the farmer's handbook also written in Hangul to make sure that there are no starving people.

287
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:15,980

288
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,510
Your Majesty.

289
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:33,760
You don't look very well.

290
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,030
You barely slept last night.

291
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,010
You should sleep early tonight.

292
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:44,670
No, I have a mountain of reports to look through today.

293
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:48,810
I will look through these a bit longer. You should go and sleep for a bit.

294
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,170
 Classic of Poetry: Ode of Shang Dynasty - Black Swallow; an ode in praise of Emperor Wu Ding of Shang Dynasty;

295
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:33,080
 of his descent into the mortal world like a black swallow; and of him being sent by Heaven to govern the country.

296
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:29,700
Look at those honorable people who are spreading seeds and working the fields.

297
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,820
Our country would only be a truly good one if I stepped down from the throne and gave my seat to one of them,

298
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:40,720
and the country's affairs continued with no problems.

299
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,250
I think the same way, Your Majesty.

300
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:48,350
The king only gives royal permission for the court's discussions and takes responsibility for the results.

301
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:50,700
He cannot play around with his power.

302
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,850
He cannot be played around by his disloyal subjects either.

303
00:40:53,850 --> 00:41:00,560
If only that were so, would the people not suffer and live happily.

304
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,060
Your Majesty.

305
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,510
Hope for the future has helped you have a peaceful reign.

306
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,580
The country is peaceful.

307
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:37,860
However, we worry that you do not have an heir.

308
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:43,030
I apologize for giving you concern.

309
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,170
Since you are still young,

310
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:52,290
you should allow in a new concubine to quickly bear a son.

311
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:56,430
The queen herself will not oppose this.

312
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,030
Your Majesty.

313
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:43,030
Do not worry about me and accept a new concubine.

314
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,760
You already know that I will not do so.

315
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,930
Why are you telling me this?

316
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:53,010
I am telling you this because I cannot give you a son.

317
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:57,530
You need a line of succession for your reign to be secure.

318
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:02,000
My queen, if that is the issue, do not worry.

319
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,640
I already have chosen someone in the line of succession.

320
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,230
Pardon me?

321
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,600
Who is that?

322
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,790
Prince Ki Seong.

323
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:15,650
I plan on giving him my throne while I am still alive.

324
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:19,440
With my bloodline, I do not plan on staying as the king.

325
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,180
I have watched the royal family members during this time.

326
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,940
So that I can find someone to leave this country to.

327
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:33,090
Prince Ki Seong will lead this country well.

328
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:36,860
How long have you had those thoughts?

329
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,890
After the rebellion,

330
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:46,300
I realized that I owe my life to many.

331
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:50,740
During that time, I was in pain.

332
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,320
Is that the only reason why you will step down from the throne?

333
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,360
This throne is not completely mine.

334
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,020
I just borrowed it momentarily.

335
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:18,980
People should not want the throne for their personal gain.

336
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,450
Hence, when it feels the heaviest,

337
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:25,730
I plan on standing up from this position in the lightest of ways and leave it.

338
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:31,700
I am the king, but I am also a citizen.

339
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:37,890
I plan to return to being a citizen. Is that alright?

340
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:43,050
You have already done so much, Your Majesty.

341
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:47,990
I will follow you.

342
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:49,820
My Queen.

343
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:56,400
Then, Your Majesty, please remove me from my position first.

344
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,710
If you leave the throne,

345
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:03,740
I will become the queen dowager and I cannot leave the palace.

346
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:08,730
Therefore, I will leave first and wait for you.

347
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:38,310
 Imperial edict on abdication of throne: Lord Ki Seong is richly blessed by Heaven with integrity, courage, and intelligence. He is an extremely fine man upon whom the nation can depend

348
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:06,960
 and is suitable to be my successor to unify the country.  I hereby abdicate the throne to Lord Ki Seong.

349
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:40,270
You should go ahead.

350
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:43,380
I will follow you after the palace affairs are settled.

351
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:48,100
I will be waiting for you near the zelkova tree in the capital.

352
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:53,430
There is something I must give you.

353
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:25,190
Do you remember the promise you made to me then?

354
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:27,160
Yes.

355
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,280
Yes, you made me promise you that I wouldn't harm myself again.

356
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,960
Yes.

357
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,490
The reason why I am returning this is so that you can protect yourself.

358
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:39,370
Do not worry.

359
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:43,760
I will keep my promise.

360
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,350
 My beloved, even if we are apart for a millennium, my faithful heart will remain steadfast.

361
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:01,650
Your Majesty.

362
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:08,660
Can I not follow you, as well?

363
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,360
No, you cannot.

364
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:18,650
Actually, I have recommended for you to be Chief Eunuch.

365
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:24,190
When I first came to the palace, you watched over me warmly.

366
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:26,710
Please assist the new king as you did me.

367
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,800
Your Majesty.

368
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:34,730
However, even if you are promoted, you will always be Eunuch Jo to me.

369
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:43,770
Please take this.

370
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:46,540
What is this?

371
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,970
 Summer Celestial Being

372
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:57,950
A while ago,

373
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:02,830
you wanted to make me laugh and drew me something.

374
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:06,330
 Eunich Jo, thank you.

375
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,650
As a reply,

376
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:16,290
I drew something using your name.

377
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:23,290
I have never thought about my name in Chinese characters.

378
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,090
 Ha (Summer) Seon (Celestial Being)

379
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,520
You have attached such an undeserved excessively good meaning.

380
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,990
Undeserved?

381
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:34,990
You are already such a person, Your Majesty.

382
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:40,620
Your Majesty, you are like summer.

383
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:47,320
You shone on all of the people fairly and equally, like the sun,

384
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:52,300
and you have made all things vibrant with life.

385
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:56,130
Having served a person like you as my master,

386
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:59,960
I have been blessed for life.

387
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:09,560
Your Majesty.

388
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:14,720
I will never forget you.

389
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:21,170
I will do the same.

390
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,400
Your Majesty.

391
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:33,400
Thank you for all this time, Eunuch Jo.

392
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:21,970

393
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:42,330
Officer Jang!

394
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,180
You scared me.

395
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:51,490
Were you planning on leaving me behind?

396
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:56,870
You've really fallen for me, haven't you?

397
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:02,740
Even if Eunuch Jo remains at the palace,

398
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,440
I will follow you, Your Majesty.

399
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,050
Your Majesty.

400
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:25,820
We've come to avenge the queen dowager!

401
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,090
  Do not be like that. Just tell me.

402
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:44,480
  What is your wish?

403
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,860
 It isn't my wish,

404
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:49,790
 but there is something I set my heart on.

405
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:51,890
  What is that?

406
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:55,750
  My wish is that after I serve you with all that I have,

407
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:58,790
  that I shall die in a profound way.

408
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,760
  Two years later

409
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:08,680
A long time ago, when tigers smoked,

410
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,620
a benevolent king was alive.

411
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:15,010
But, wow, this king's looks!

412
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:17,780
He was as handsome as I am.

413
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:22,000
He could dance and sing.

414
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,420
There was nothing he couldn't do!

415
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:30,580
But among those things, there was something he was best at.

416
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:34,660
It was his heart for his people.

417
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:38,690
He received taxes only from those with land.

418
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:41,400
He gave relief to the people without anything.

419
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:48,410
I have finally implemented the Dae Dong policy even in Jeju.

420
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:53,600
My seasickness was so severe.

421
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:56,260
You have done well.

422
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,170
I'll be off, then.

423
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:04,100
- "Cheon" for sky, "ji" for ground. 
 -  "Cheon" for sky, "ji" for ground.

424
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:09,720
- Black hyeon, yellow hwang.
 - Black hyeon, yellow hwang.

425
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:14,970
- Part ji, house joo. 
 - Part ji, house joo.

426
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:18,110
  What is lowly and what is precious?

427
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:22,110
  It is enough for just a world to be made where everyone can live together.

428
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:32,290
Your Highness, it seems that the clowns have come.

429
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,730
The clowns?

430
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:44,830
There are so many people who wish to see the king again.

431
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:49,170
And so the winter passes, the spring comes.

432
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:50,970
Manure must be scattered.

433
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:53,590
So that white sprouts may bloom.

434
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:57,950
The peacefulness these days are all due to the king, is it not?

435
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:59,690
That's true!

436
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,800
What is all of this screeching about?

437
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:08,300
Did someone speak of me?

438
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:40,590
Oh my, how can you give me such a precious item?

439
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:45,180
One coin and a handful of barley will be plenty.

440
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,510
Take it.

441
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:50,540
I was able to hear of someone precious to me for the first time in a long while.

442
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:53,060
I was happy.

443
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:57,350
I am truly grateful.

444
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:08,960
 Derivation of the Great Learning by Zhen Dexiu, Philosopher/Politician, Southern Song Dynasty.

445
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:32,510
But where are you trying to go by yourself?

446
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:34,460
Do not worry.

447
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:38,890
I'm going to see the world, traveling through all eight provinces of this country.

448
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:41,620
I plan on enjoying the scenery.

449
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,520
Alright. You've been mourning for three years,

450
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,400
so it's okay to just travel around elsewhere.

451
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,130
He would've understood.

452
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:54,870
It's not like that.

453
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:58,010
Alright. We'll just say it isn't.

454
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:03,760
No matter where you go, keep in touch.

455
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,270
Yes, I will.

456
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:51,720
  Where is His Majesty?

457
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:59,310
  Your Highness, it seems the king has died.

458
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:02,780
  Please kill us.

459
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:07,020
  That cannot be.

460
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:11,730
  I told him that I'd meet him here.

461
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:14,340
  He'll come here for sure.

462
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:17,230
  Is this, by any chance,

463
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:21,390
  His Majesty's?

464
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:37,880
  Your Majesty.

465
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:43,190
  It was discovered on the corpse of Officer Jang, who was supposed to be  protecting him.

466
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:45,240
  However, we could not find His Majesty.

467
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,700
  I apologize, Your Highness.

468
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:53,060
  Your Highness.

469
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:57,960
  No, there is no way.

470
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:01,060
  If you didn't find His Majesty,

471
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:03,880
  then he must be alive.

472
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,720
  He'll return!

473
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,910
Your Highness, I slept in.

474
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:53,230
I'll prepare breakfast right away. Please wait a bit.

475
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:54,840
It's okay.

476
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,900
I feel like taking a walk.

477
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:00,220
You can take your time.

478
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:03,380
Then, please do not stray far.

479
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:05,860
You must only walk around once.

480
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,700
Alright.

481
01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:25,250
  I am in love with you, my queen,

482
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:28,020
  to the point where my heart may burst.

483
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:30,560
  To the point where it would be alright if it did.

484
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,670
  I love you.

485
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:42,120
  Even if I live for a day, I want to live it with you.

486
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:45,670
  I want to live by your side.

487
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:49,640
  I want to hear your laughter

488
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:54,330
  and live with you for a long time.

489
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:00,980
  In the spring, let us go and see the flowers.

490
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:04,400
  In the summer, we will experience the rain showers.

491
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:09,630
  In the fall, we will go to the mountains to pick hazelnuts.

492
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:14,030
  In the winter, let us make beautiful snowmen.

493
01:06:14,030 --> 01:06:16,560
  You promise me?

494
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,620
  Of course.

495
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,750
To the goblin that protects our home,

496
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:41,320
please allow for spring to arrive quickly.

497
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:44,520
We will make sweet rice cakes with azaleas

498
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:49,470
and so that we can make grass puppets.

499
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:10,370
Child, who taught you how to make a wish that way?

500
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:15,440
Earlier, some person was passing by and taught us.

501
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:17,900
Where did that person go?

502
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,500
That way.

503
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:07,490
♫  The flower that blooms in the deepest of nights  ♫

504
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:15,220
♫  Like a love that no one knows  ♫

505
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:22,730
♫  On the road that feels further than it is  ♫

506
01:09:22,730 --> 01:09:29,100
♫  Only now do you shine  ♫

507
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:38,510
♫  I'm going closer little by little  ♫

508
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:45,350
♫  It gets further again  ♫

509
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:03,890
♫  In the far days ahead, to you  ♫

510
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:11,290
♫  I have something I need to tell you  ♫

511
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:22,390
♫  All of your steps and hesitation  ♫

512
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:30,350
♫  To me they were all dreams  ♫

513
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:54,970
I have dreamed about this countless times.

514
01:10:56,190 --> 01:11:01,110
When I got close enough to hold onto you, you would disappear.

515
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:05,460
They are such sorrowful and wicked dreams.

516
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:11,970
If this is a dream, as well, I will not approach you any further.

517
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:16,950
Please just stay where you are.

518
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:21,080
Just watch me from where you are.

519
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:25,300
This is not a dream.

520
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:30,440
I have walked within dreams

521
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:34,590
just to get to you.

522
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:37,880
I have had dreams that I hoped I would not wake from

523
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:44,860
in order to just see you.

524
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:50,570
How come you have arrived only now?

525
01:11:52,190 --> 01:11:54,090
I apologize.

526
01:11:54,990 --> 01:12:00,250
When I woke up, time had passed by like this.

527
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:04,570
I wanted to run to you like the wind,

528
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,660
but I walked so slowly.

529
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,550
You should have called for me.

530
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:33,050
I could have run to you.

531
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:40,590
I apologize for making you wait for so long.

532
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,790
  Even if you wandered,

533
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:05,630
  even if you took long roundabout paths,

534
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:09,650
  I knew that you would come to me someday.

535
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:15,450
  You will no longer have to long for me.

536
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:20,210
  Nothing can keep us apart anymore.

537
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:30,060

 Thank you to our Chinese Expert Translator: Jadecloud88

541
01:13:54,110 --> 01:13:58,680
  That January, the king suppressed the rebels and ruled wisely.

542
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:03,470
  The country's people all praised the king's flourishing virtues.

543
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:10,500
  He died suddenly after removing the queen from her position.

544
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:19,390
  There were rumors that there was a clown who looked like the king, but it had not been proven.

545
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:29,630
  The Crowned Clown

546
01:14:29,630 --> 01:14:38,050
  Thank you to Yoon Park who made a special appearance.

547
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:46,970

548
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:54,580

549
