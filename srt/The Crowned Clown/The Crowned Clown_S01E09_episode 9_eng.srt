00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:09,930

 The Crowned Clown

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,540
 The characters, organizations, locations, and events in this drama are fictional and have no relation to historical facts.

4
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,680
 Episode 9

5
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,680
Your Majesty.

6
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,800
As expected, you understood my meaning perfectly.

7
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,850
Did you wait very long? I was planning to come early.

8
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,840
The round-table discussion went long today.

9
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,760
It's alright. Even waiting for you brings me joy.

10
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,400
Then you can give it to me.

11
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,030
What are you talking about?

12
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,310
The present you prepared with so much thought.

13
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,910
How did you know?

14
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,470
Did you make it yourself?

15
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,720
It's a pen pouch.

16
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,030
Since Your Majesty is a masterful calligrapher, I thought it'd be nice to use for carrying brushes.

17
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:31,100
If brushes aren't to your liking, then you could use it to carry the compass as well.

18
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,150
 My beloved, even if we are apart for a millennium,

19
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,740
 my faithful heart will remain steadfast.

20
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,230
Even if I am parted from you for a thousand years,

21
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,380
my love for you cannot be changed.

22
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:56,230
I selected from among many different ones and chose this to engrave my heart.

23
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,760
I have something to confess.

24
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,660
I ate a whole bundle of medicine.

25
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,140
As one would look upon the stars or the moon, I would look towards the queen's palace for long stretches of time.

26
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:25,700
Be it the garden or library, I don't know how many times I went in and out in a day.

27
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,010
 I went through an entire bunch of medicine to prepare them.

28
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,860
 As one would look upon the stars or the moon, I would look towards the king's palace for long stretches of time.

29
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,870
 Be it the garden or the library,

30
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,310
 I don't know how many times I went in and out in a day.

31
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,370
 I cannot hide it anymore.

32
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,110
I won't avoid it anymore.

33
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,610
I won't run away either.

34
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,720
I...

35
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,510
I will only look towards you and think about you.

36
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,200
I'm in love with you.

37
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,910
Even if my heart explodes,

38
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,630
I wouldn't mind

39
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,400
because I love you.

40
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,890
♫  Closer to you   ♫

41
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,760
♫  Little by little  ♫

42
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,530
♫  You are getting farther  ♫

43
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,110
♫  And again  ♫

44
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:39,090
♫  In a faraway today, to you   ♫

45
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:46,390
♫  I have words I must tell you   ♫

46
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:57,580
♫  No matter what keeps you faltering  ♫

47
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:05,400
♫  You were my dream   ♫

48
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,400
Your hands are so cold!

49
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,810
They will get warmer soon.

50
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,160
They already are.

51
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,320
I think the compass you gave me is broken.

52
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:39,090
♫  You in this moment  ♫

53
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,360
It always points in towards your palace.

54
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,420
♫  I will keep in my memory  ♫

55
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:58,540
♫  All your smiles too  ♫

56
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,290
Your Highness, did something happen?

57
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,560
It's nothing. Just...

58
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,350
It's because of His Majesty, isn't it?

59
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,990
Is it so obvious?

60
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,240
When you returned from seeing His Majesty in the past,

61
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,930
without even realizing it, I always felt bad.

62
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,650
Seeing you smiling now is a miracle.

63
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,250
Did you now?

64
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:33,020
The maids in the his palace said it is like he was reborn. Ah!

65
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,430
Why are you laughing? What did you hear?

66
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:45,360
That... they said even his poop smells different.

67
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,300
You will get punished for saying that.

68
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,200
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

69
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:09,330
Father, am I really going to have to go?

70
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,640
It's an island that only has rocks.

71
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,020
If I catch something and die from an epidemic, who will carry on our clan?

72
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,640
 I recently summoned some clowns to my home.

73
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,780
 But among the clowns,

74
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,990
 one had the exact face as His Majesty.

75
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,300
Two of the same face?

76
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,630
Are you listening to me, Father?

77
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,880
Since you received the appointment, you must go.

78
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,200
Don't get on the boat going to the island, but wait quietly at Naju.

79
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,920
Naju? Alright, I understand.

80
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,350
However, what will His Majesty say?

81
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,530
Do you have a plan?

82
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,500
The sky has collapsed and the ground is shattered,

83
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,640
so I will have to find a hole to rise from.

84
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,160
Shall I tell you how to shoot the target properly?

85
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,740
First, on a windy day, you shouldn't raise the bow.

86
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,770
But if you insist on raising the bow regardless,

87
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,020
you will have to make the target big.

88
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,360
So you will certainly penetrate the center.

89
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,280
Like this?

90
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,990
How dare the hunting dog that His Majesty abandoned come barking noisily to me?

91
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,420
To you and the queen dowager,

92
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,060
I am well aware I'm regarded as the enemy.

93
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,840
However, it is unfair to me.

94
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,370
A hunting dog only ever follows its owners' commands

95
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,590
never having a will of his own.

96
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,610
I was just killed after the hunting was over.

97
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,170
If you have any parting words, you may say them now.

98
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,610
What made you come find me here?

99
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,930
I came to seat you on the king's throne.

100
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,740
Why does it have to be me?

101
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,890
As the proverb goes, "The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

102
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:44,920
I served with all my loyalty but I was abandoned.

103
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:51,100
Hence, I thought deeply who would loathe the king as much as me.

104
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,740
And I couldn't think of anyone else but you, Prince Jin Pyeong.

105
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,770
My father and my brother were both killed by your hand.

106
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,990
Why would I trust you?

107
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:05,100
A justification for reformation. Will that suffice?

108
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,450
You'll make a target for me?

109
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,030
Yes, exactly.

110
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,410
You'll have to make a very large target.

111
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,960
Spectacular.

112
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,060
 Resignation Letter

113
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,130
I never imagined you'd go this length.

114
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,450
Can you really handle it?

115
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,140
  Didn't I tell you? Concerning the queen–

116
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,970
 In order to receive one thing, you need to let go of another.

117
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,150
 Is that what you want to say?

118
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:14,200
 Sometimes for just one thing, you must let go of ten or even a hundred things.

119
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,630
Sometimes for just one thing,

120
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,740
you must let go of ten or even a hundred things.

121
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,800
How can I help you?

122
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,350
Let me know how.

123
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,960
There is no way to help me.

124
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,070
It was my crime, so I will take responsibility.

125
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,610
I'll come back on the 49th day.

126
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,120
I ask this of you until then.

127
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:59,240

128
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,860
 The clown with this face is playing as this country's ruler.

129
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:26,920
The clown with this face is playing as this country's ruler.

130
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,910
What the heck is this about?

131
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,740
Nonsense! Is this a joke?

132
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,530
This may not be a lie.

133
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:37,700
There's a rumor spread all over the market about the barbarians invading.

134
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,200
You mean there will be a war again?

135
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,800
Where is this bastard—

136
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,290
For sure...

137
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,150
that's the face of that freaking clown.

138
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,090
Why is...?

139
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,490
I am illiterate so I can't read it! Sir, what does it say?

140
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:11,380
Maybe there's something good to see.

141
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,090
 Really?

142
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,260
 Yes, the current king is the clown.

143
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,920
He's acting as the ruler?

144
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,620
So the ruler is a clown?

145
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,410
What is this?

146
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:28,960
Dal Rae, you read it. What does it say?

147
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:35,820
 The clown with this face is playing as this country's ruler.

148
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,800
My brother is the king?

149
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,170
Do you know this clown?

150
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,320
If you know him, you better tell us. We'll report to the authority right away!

151
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,090
Do you know him?

152
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,370
Of course not, how could we know?

153
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,470
Do you know that face? Seriously...

154
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,780
Ahjae...

155
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,380
Come quickly.

156
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,910
You better tell us before you go!

157
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,770
 Geumoh Hall (State Tribunal)

158
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,540
Chief Royal Secretary, what brought you here?

159
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,960
There are strange posters plastered all over the city.

160
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,440
Order your men to get rid of them at once!

161
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,710
Yes!

162
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,880
Men, follow me!

163
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,490
Yes!

164
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,960
Sir, did you see the posters?

165
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,820
What is happening? Where is Ha Seon now?

166
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,930
Woon Sim, tell me the truth.

167
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,840
Where is Ha Seon's sister now?

168
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,460
I sent her to the temple.

169
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,010
But she disappeared a while ago, so I don't know where she is now.

170
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,260
Sir!

171
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,030
Is Chief Royal Secretary still not here?

172
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,270
No, not yet.

173
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:58,270
Your Majesty. There were strange posters put up in the city, so I brought one.

174
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,030
Please take a look.

175
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:50,160
 The clown with this face is playing as this country's ruler.

176
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,580
 I apologize, but it is a poster that calls a face similar to yours a clown.

177
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,250
Inscrutably, among the citizens,

178
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,800
the rumor that Your Majesty's face is the same as the clown's

179
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,210
is spreading quickly.

180
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,420
It's a sign of a possible uprising.

181
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,130
That it is the sign that the world will come to ruin by the wrath of the heavens.

182
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,590
It seems those words are being spread.

183
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,480
Your Majesty, please cast down the order to capture the clowns first.

184
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,060
It is proper to win the people's trust first.

185
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,800
Why is there a need to capture the clowns in order to garner the people's trust?

186
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,810
A clown was mentioned in the poster.

187
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,930
So if we capture the clowns, the people's rumors will dissipate out of fear.

188
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,170
And it will serve as a severe warning to those who put up the posters.

189
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,250
You think that makes sense?

190
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,860
What crimes have the clowns committed? I cannot consent.

191
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,760
However, Your Majesty, it was the clowns that played with rumors in the first place.

192
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,190
And they are causing the rumors to spread.

193
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,530
Isn't it difficult to say they are completely innocent in the matter?

194
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:54,190
Time is of the essence, so please approve.

195
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,620
Please approve.

196
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,320
That cannot happen.

197
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,940
Chief Royal Secretary.

198
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,040
Your Majesty, I apologize.

199
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,920
I am a bit late due to managing the matter of the posters.

200
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,410
It's fine as you are here now.

201
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:30,600
Your Majesty, may I say something?

202
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,400
Go on.

203
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,520
Just over one poster,

204
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,340
the capital fell into chaos immediately.

205
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:45,730
That means that this country's royal court has not earned the people's trust.

206
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,850
Just with that alone,

207
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,330
all you ministers of high and low rankings should kneel on straw mats to repent.

208
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,040
To beg for your crimes before His Majesty and the people.

209
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,270
However, not even a sign of repentance,

210
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,850
but only the thought to push the responsibility onto innocent people.

211
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,820
How shameless!

212
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,460
This humble subject, as a member of this royal court,

213
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,730
I apologize to Your Majesty and I am ashamed before the people.

214
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:26,100
Your Majesty, that poster is clearly the conduct of one who holds treasonous intentions!

215
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,730
We must eradicate the rebels who are holding Your Majesty in contempt and misleading the public.

216
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,510
It is the proper course to cut off these roots of disturbance.

217
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,720
Chief Royal Secretary is right.

218
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,400
We cannot allow the people to fall into fear and instability over these posters.

219
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,770
Hurry and find the mastermind behind the posters.

220
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

221
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,380
This poster. Do you think it was done by someone who knows of my identity?

222
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:59,670
If that's the case, it wouldn't have ended with just a poster.

223
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,170
Dal Rae!

224
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:09,870
If she sees this poster she will worry about whether something happened to me.

225
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,130
Please send a message to Woon Shim to look after Dal Rae well.

226
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,950
I understand.

227
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,250
Crack down on the court ladies of the king's palace.

228
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,940
Especially Court Lady Kim. Forbid her from entering His Majesty's chamber from now on.

229
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,080
I was thinking that as well.

230
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,140
I shall do so.

231
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,100
Try to avoid audiences with ministers for the moment.

232
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:38,400
Just in case, pay attention to your surroundings and be careful.

233
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,510
Yes.

234
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:44,980
 Your Majesty, Goseong, Sin Chi Soo requests an audience.

235
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:59,000
What brings you to the palace?

236
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,760
I ran here worried about His Majesty, upon hearing news of the posters.

237
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,160
I must see His Majesty to report something, so ask for an audience.

238
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,620
His Majesty has said he will decline every request for an audeince today, so you may leave.

239
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:16,250
But I could be of assistance to His Majesty. Why do you stop me?

240
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:21,730
You committed a crime and left your job, so what can you do to help?

241
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,960
The national affairs will be managed by the royal court.

242
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,680
So restrain yourself, Your Excellency.

243
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,190
I heard it was quite the spectacle at the side palace earlier.

244
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:37,790
I heard you roared as if you were the king.

245
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,470
Though capturing the clowns is the most certain and quick method,

246
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,870
you blocked that from happening.

247
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,630
Though the court ministers reproached him,

248
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:53,020
His Majesty only listened to you.

249
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,890
You cover up His Majesty's eyes and ears.

250
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,600
What are you trying to do?

251
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:06,440
That's the stuff you'd do, Your Excellency.

252
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,670
As for me, I don't go behind His Majesty's back

253
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:12,350
and do sinister deeds such as profiting for my own gain.

254
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,780
Don't worry.

255
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,570
My lord, you've been aloof lately.

256
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:35,940
It's because my rope was cut and you had no reason to see me.

257
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,730
I can understand.

258
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,710
Everyone's yakking about the bizarre poster.

259
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,410
How is it that you don't seem too startled?

260
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:49,350
What's there to be startled by?

261
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:55,450
After having served His Majesty, there aren't just one or two strange and bizarre things.

262
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:00,010
Have there been strange happenings that occured to His Majesty recently?

263
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,380
Overnight,

264
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,760
a severe wound on His Majesty's ear appeared then disappeared.

265
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,610
Are you certain?

266
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,640
Really...

267
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:19,230
I am getting curious.

268
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,290
Verify His Majesty's scar.

269
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,660
Say something that makes sense.

270
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,040
The day I am caught by His Majesty is when my head flies off.

271
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,520
How can I take that risk?

272
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,160
You fed poison to His Majesty's consort.

273
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,330
And your witchcraft. If those crimes are revealed,

274
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:38,050
you'll be put to death as a high criminal anyway.

275
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,120
Wasn't it you who ordered me regarding Seon Hwa Dang?

276
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,840
Do you have proof that I made you?

277
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,170
But I have plenty of proof and witnesses that you did it.

278
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,710
Are you threatening me right now?

279
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,620
I mean for us to help each other.

280
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:59,460
Do you feel like doing it now?

281
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,670
That's a good idea.

282
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,640
I won't forget your help.

283
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,650
 Resignation letter and entrance tag (for access anywhere within the palace at any time)

284
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:35,990
 I request to resign for not fulfilling my duty protecting the king.

285
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,030
Chief Royal Secretary.

286
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:52,590
Welcome. I asked to see you because I have something to discuss with you.

287
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:56,270
Due to the arguments in the royal court lately,

288
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,300
urgent current matters have been put to the side.

289
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,880
It's now time to act on those.

290
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,520
Are you talking about the Dae Dong policy?

291
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,920
Not only the Dae Dong policy but activate the agricultural  business as well to

292
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,640
expand the agriculture fields to support the national treasury.

293
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,140
My Lord, a message has arrived from the authorities.

294
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,890
The royal painter, Song Ji Sang was found dead last night.

295
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,710
 Royal Painter: An artist who paints King's portrait.

296
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,980
I think he died of a stab wound to the chest.

297
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,790
He was found on a secluded road.

298
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:38,240
As we were unable to find witnesses and evidence, I suspect he was murdered.

299
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:53,250
We received 16 bushels of tax rice and among them, we will submit 14 to the Ministry of Finance.

300
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,690
And two bushels can be saved for next year.

301
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,000
Your Majesty. Are you listening?

302
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,490
Uh?

303
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,730
What did you say?

304
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:20,870
Your Majesty, if you don't like my explanations, just tell me.

305
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,970
Not at all, continue!

306
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,160
Droughts or cold waves could come and cause a bad harvest.

307
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,840
So overall, we will implement the ratio in place...

308
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,740
 Your Majesty!

309
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:47,510
I am sorry to interrupt, but the queen dowager asked to have a snack with you.

310
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,160
A snack? At a time like this?

311
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:56,310
She requested that you and the queen join her.

312
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,350
Then I must go.

313
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,670
Your Majesty...

314
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,280
I am not done explaining.

315
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,660
Looking at your face, I realize how handsome you are.

316
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,490
Isn't it interesting there's another handsome face like yours?

317
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,800
I didn't know you'd like my face this much.

318
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,420
I am not liking it but worrying about it.

319
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:41,130
When I am feeling like this, people must be frightened not knowing what's going on.

320
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,320
Don't you think so, Queen?

321
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,190
The reason for the people being agitated is because their lives are tiring and hard.

322
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,480
But the court and the royal family are different.

323
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:58,620
I don't think it's appropriate to act on merely a rumor regarding His Majesty.

324
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:04,110
I believe the royal family should set an example for the people at times like this.

325
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:10,180
As the leader of women in the palace, I will take measures. I hope that you will support me in this.

326
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,940
Measures? I will do so.

327
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:19,060
But, Queen, isn't there something more urgent to pay attention to?

328
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,460
What do you mean?

329
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,050
So you really don't know?

330
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:30,600
When the public sentiment is so unsettling, how great would it have been if the king had an heir?

331
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,860
Doesn't it occur to you that the king is suffering because you've not done your duty, Queen?

332
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,140
How is that the queen's fault?

333
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,270
Are you saying that it's your fault then?

334
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:55,450
Children are granted by the Heavens is what I wish to say.

335
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:02,090
If you're so worried, should I name Prince Jin Pyeong as my foster son? Is that your wish?

336
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:07,690
You are distorting my words again.

337
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,800
Have I?

338
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:15,200
Actually it's true now that I think about it. It won't fair to name Prince Jin Pyeong my foster son.

339
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,000
He's not friendly and always so stiff-faced. Not much fun there.

340
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:31,960

341
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:40,590
Your Majesty, are you really alright?

342
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:44,840
I hear there were lots of talks at court about the posters.

343
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,330
You were worried about me?

344
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:52,550
If I were there, I would have held your hand and walked out.

345
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:57,340
Like when you saved me on the streets last time.

346
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,900
Like this?

347
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,180
Your Majesty.

348
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,950
Let's go.

349
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,970
Whoever it is, what a great ruse they put out!

350
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:40,370
I am ready to find them before the king to reward them.

351
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:43,120
I'm relieved you are so delighted.

352
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,670
Did you do it?

353
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:54,860
You should have done it sooner and I wouldn't have suffered all this bitterness.

354
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:03,720
The king will have a hard time getting out of this, with the rumors grabbing him by the collar...

355
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,160
- unless the queen produces an heir.
- Heir?

356
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,390
Don't be  startled. That will not happen.

357
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,620
We don't know about that.

358
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:19,080
On my way in, I saw how affectionate the king and queen were.

359
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,380
I guarantee it.

360
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,720
The king took away my child who was like my life.

361
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,700
He won't get to taste the joy of having his child in the queen's womb.

362
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,590
Your Majesty, don't you need to go to the side palace?

363
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,930
I need to go.

364
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:31,040
Then, hurry and get up.

365
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,840
Please sit for a bit.

366
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,430
I am doing something very important right now.

367
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,670
What is it?

368
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,230
I am receiving strength.

369
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:49,110
I have to look at you like this to get the strength to look at reports.

370
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:56,780
Then, please summon me at any time.

371
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:02,000
I will be your strength by your side.

372
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:33,080
What's all this?

373
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:40,040
Prince Jin Pyeong, you have a private army but it's still too lacking to take on the king.

374
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,960
With this money, gather the soldiers by the borders.

375
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,750
And I will mobilize the high ministers of the court.

376
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:53,790
Would the high ministers listen to you when you've been pushed out of the court?

377
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:57,310
I'll have to re-enter the court.

378
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:00,430
Would Chief Royal Secretary sit and let that happen?

379
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,890
He seems to be aiming for the left state minister position.

380
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:08,340
The likes of a chief royal secretary can't dare to be my opponent.

381
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:12,780
Soon the Ming will be sending over a deputy minister of military affairs.

382
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,850
I am the only one who can deal with the deputy minister.

383
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:20,510
So the king will have to summon me too.

384
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:25,630
The royal painter was stabbed and killed?

385
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,560
Do you think it was done by the ones who put up the posters?

386
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,740
They must have killed him to silence him after he painted the king's face.

387
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:36,100
Then, is there no way to find the one behind the posters?

388
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:40,420
I do have a few suspicions but I have no proof.

389
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:45,100
Evidence or confession. We just need one sure thing.

390
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:51,600
My Lord. Should we order Officer Jang to look through the royal family members first?

391
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,950
Moo Yeong left a resignation letter and left.

392
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:59,160
What? At this time, of all times, to ask for a resignation?

393
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,980
I apologize, Your Majesty.

394
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,620
If I had known before, I would have stopped him.

395
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:12,470
It's not your fault, Eunuch Jo, so don't blame yourself.

396
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,160
 Dragon Tiger Gate

397
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,730
My Lord.

398
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:33,260
My Lord. My—

399
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,160
My Lord.

400
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,800
Who is this?

401
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,880
I have something urgent to report to you regarding the posters.

402
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:42,800
Posters?

403
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,650
I know the clown on the posters.

404
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:57,540
My report is worth at least ten silver nyang.

405
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:06,000
Actually, I think I will need twelve nyang.

406
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,580
Fine.

407
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:12,010
I'll listen and if I think it's good then I'll pay, so speak.

408
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:16,430
It's that scum from back then. Two nyang for the dog.

409
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,910
Two nyang for the dog?

410
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,720
You've forgotten already?

411
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,330
The one with the face mask and sickle over the younger lord's incident.

412
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:26,850
The one that charged into this house.

413
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:30,450
 - Who is Sin Yi Gyeom? Sin Yi Gyeom!
 - What is this?

414
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,200
 My Lord, please save me.

415
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,340
 How much does a dog cost nowadays?

416
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,960
 It wouldn't be over two nyang.

417
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,520
 Give him two nyang and send him off.

418
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,560
 Yes.

419
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,400
 What the...

420
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,720
 My sister is not a dog!

421
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,450
Do you remember now?

422
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:59,050
But how are you sure that's the clown on the posters?

423
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:01,090
His face is the same.

424
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,730
Even twins couldn't be that exact.

425
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,950
Then do you know where he is now?

426
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:10,800
He used to entertain at the Hwagyedong brothel, but he's probably left by now.

427
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,060
But the gisaeng by the name of Woon Sim there would know.

428
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:19,070
Ha Seon and his sister Dal Rae would play there at the brothel.

429
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:23,460
Hwagyedong brothel. Gisaeng Woon Sim.

430
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,450
That sounds quite familiar.

431
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:29,820
Woon Sim is a gisaeng cherished by Chief Royal Secretary.

432
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,660
What? Chief Royal Secretary?

433
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:39,760
Then, that clown was at the brothel that the chief royal secretary frequented?

434
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,760
Yes. That's right.

435
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,000
Since I got to hear such good things from you,

436
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:50,870
I will reward you handsomely.

437
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,830
Here.

438
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,910
Thank you.

439
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,110
How...

440
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:12,270
What you said, no one else can know besides me.

441
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,430
 The clown with this face...

442
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:24,220
I will have to see that face of the wench Woon Sim.

443
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,760
Yes.

444
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:43,500
What is the reason for Lord Sin Chi Soo to summon me?

445
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,680
Is there a reason needed for summons?

446
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,050
Just follow right away.

447
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,450
Just as there are rules for summoning a nobleman,

448
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:52,630
there are procedures to summoning a gisaeng as well.

449
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:55,740
Go and tell that to your lordship.

450
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,510
Woon Sim is an artisan who performs in the royal palace.

451
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,580
She cannot be easily summoned.

452
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,850
What are you waiting for? Drag her out.

453
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:10,550
Do not step back even an inch.

454
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:19,520
Ma'am, I will go.

455
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,760
But Woon Sim...

456
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,450
Nothing will happen.

457
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,050
 Dragon Tiger Gate

458
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:43,550
My Lord, a message from the outside.

459
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,090
 Left State Minister's manor has kidnapped Woon Sim from Cheongwol Pavilion.

460
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:01,100
Do you know the clown called Ha Seon?

461
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,570
Yes. He used to entertain at the brothel.

462
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:08,870
I hear you know where that clown is now.

463
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:12,360
I don't know who said such a thing to you, Your Excellency.

464
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,080
But I don't know where that clown is.

465
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,470
You really don't know?

466
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:19,620
I have only told you what I know.

467
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,520
Fine then.

468
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,820
Anyone outside?

469
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,740
Your Excellency, did you call?

470
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,160
Drag her out and twist her legs.

471
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,770
Torture her until she confesses the truth.

472
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:41,120
If she doesn't heed, you may kill her.

473
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,830
Yes, Your Excellency.

474
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,960
Why you...

475
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:57,160
If you don't want to die, let go of her.

476
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,360
The guards are waiting outside.

477
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,430
Go to the brothel.

478
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,570
I called her because I heard she was the woman you cherished.

479
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:28,210
And indeed you ran here right away.

480
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:32,330
What are you acting like such a ruffian?

481
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:35,430
If you feel wronged, you can do as I have.

482
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:39,720
It's human nature that one starts to harbor greed once he's been close to the king.

483
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,750
I'm not saying there's anything bad about that. But acting like you're so clean.

484
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:47,280
Like you're so upright. That act of yours is what pisses me off.

485
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,260
You called me over so that you could vent?

486
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,860
The clown on the posters.

487
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:57,720
I heard that clown used to entertain at the brothel you frequent.

488
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,110
By chance, have you seen him?

489
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:04,260
Isn't a clown merely someone who puts on a mask to entertain.

490
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,590
It must just be rumors that someone made up after seeing the posters.

491
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:10,370
Is that right?

492
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:14,590
Then what if I find the guy that looks exactly like him?

493
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:20,400
Are you confessing you're the one who put up the posters?

494
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,770
Seeing how you're fretting, it seems I've got you.

495
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:28,690
Be careful, Your Excellency.

496
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:34,690
If you make a reckless assumption, your hands and neck can fly.

497
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:47,880

498
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,500
Why are you still here?

499
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,960
I wanted to see that you were safe before I left, so I waited.

500
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,510
Are you alright?

501
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:04,450
I'm completely fine.

502
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:10,570
That must have hurt a lot.

503
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:18,200
Lord Sin Chi Soo pressed me about Ha Seon.

504
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,200
Someone must have reported to him after seeing that the face on the posters looks like Ha Seon.

505
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,730
I'm getting a strange feeling.

506
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:28,590
My Lord, what happened?

507
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:33,050
He seems to blame me for being banished from the court.

508
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:36,410
And using you as a bait, he is after me.

509
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:40,360
If you knew that then you shouldn't have come.

510
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,810
I couldn't not come.

511
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:47,130
You've suffered because of me.

512
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,430
Escort her safely to the brothel.

513
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:58,770
Yes, Sir.

514
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:28,620
I wondered who sent the message and it was you!

515
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:36,730
I had thought you'd be back at your hometown already.

516
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:38,540
But you were still in the capital then.

517
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,740
I had planned to.

518
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:44,480
But I saw the posters and I couldn't leave.

519
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,750
You asked to resign and left, so what do you care?

520
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:53,470
I know, right? I am asking myself the same.

521
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:56,270
What regrets do I have to be like this?

522
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:59,050
Have you been monitoring Sin Chi Soo all along?

523
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:01,950
At first, I was watching Prince Jin Pyeong.

524
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:05,450
But Sin Chi Soo kept crossing my mind.

525
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:07,640
Your instincts are correct.

526
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:12,640
Sin Chi Soo seems to have somewhat caught on.

527
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:24,880
I will assist the king in the chamber from now on, so you will not enter the chamber.

528
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:29,010
It's my main duty to serve in the chamber but to tell me not to?

529
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:31,710
Are you telling me that I have to leave the main palace?

530
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,400
Who's order is this?

531
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,960
His Majesty's order.

532
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,770
I will have to hear it personally from His Majesty.

533
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:40,010
How audacious!

534
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:42,900
Will you only listen after being dragged out?

535
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:16,910
You're suffering a lot on my account.

536
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:18,540
Please rest a bit first.

537
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:22,620
Will you really be alright?

538
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:26,870
I'm fine. Go and shut your eyes for just two branch hours (four hours).

539
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:31,630
Since you say so, I shall follow.

540
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:55,590
Security can't be lax just because I'm gone.

541
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:59,510
Of course. Please do not worry.

542
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:42,050
Your Majesty!

543
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,650
What is the meaning of this?

544
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:51,010
It's not what you think.

545
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:53,680
I came to bring your drinking water for the night.

546
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,440
And your breathing sounded stifled.

547
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:14,210
It looks like you're asking to die by my hands, you wench.

548
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:17,000
 We need to set a mouse trap.

549
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:23,860
 The person who put up the posters is someone who clearly is suspicious of your identity, Ha Seon.

550
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,290
 So they will be sending someone to verify it.

551
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:29,950
 We're going to use that and catch their tail.

552
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:32,320
 Can you do that?

553
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:35,580
 You're not a clown if you pick and choose your performances.

554
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,900
 I'll do it!

555
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,560
I clearly ordered you not to enter my chamber,

556
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:46,360
but you dare to feed me medicine and check my scar?

557
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,790
I wasn't doing that.

558
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,960
Shut up!

559
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,860
You wouldn't have committed this act alone.

560
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:57,870
Who put you up to it?

561
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:01,530
I swear that's not the case. Please believe me.

562
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:06,050
No one ordered you, but you crawled in here to check my scar?

563
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:08,740
I see now that I've kept a snake-like wench by my side.

564
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:11,010
I committed a crime deserving of death.

565
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:13,790
May you forgive me.

566
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:17,280
You say you committed a crime worthy of death, but you ask for forgiveness?

567
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,570
Your Majesty.

568
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:21,620
Eunuch Jo!

569
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:30,900
Drag her out.

570
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,250
Your Majesty!

571
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:34,650
Your Majesty!

572
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:40,310
Your Majesty, please believe me. Your Majesty! Please believe me!

573
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:42,740
 Your Majesty!

574
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:51,770
What do I need to do to live?

575
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:57,830
His Majesty believes Sin Chi Soo is the one behind the posters.

576
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:03,060
Go to him and report to him what you verified.

577
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:07,850
And get his confession that he put up the posters.

578
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:14,040
If you do that, I will ask His Majesty to spare your life.

579
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:24,480
My lord says to enter.

580
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:31,150
 Dragon Tiger Gate

581
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:37,590
There was a scar on His Majesty's chest?

582
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:39,310
You definitely saw it?

583
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:44,060
Yes. I confirmed it with my own two eyes.

584
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:53,610
You should've received my verification first,

585
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:57,130
before you put up the posters.

586
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:06,630
How did you know I did it?

587
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:09,830
When you told me to verify His Majesty's scar,

588
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:12,260
I had already realized.

589
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:17,530
And the royal painter as well. You did that as well.

590
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:21,730
I had no choice in order to keep him silent.

591
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:25,370
At any rate, I've done my duty.

592
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,070
Please do not forget my contribution.

593
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:29,540
Of course not.

594
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:32,640
Then, I will need to return to the palace now.

595
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:37,340
Wait.

596
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:42,780
What is it?

597
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:46,880
There's something for you to verify.

598
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,240
Come on in.

599
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:01,680
Why didn't you tell me you were caught by His Majesty?

600
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,830
Did Chief Royal Secretary tell you to come and get my confession?

601
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:08,150
His Majesty was going to kill me so what am I to do?

602
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:11,730
And you think I would save you then?

603
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:17,240
I trusted you. But I'm so disappointed.

604
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:32,230

605
00:56:56,710 --> 00:57:00,000
Court Lady Kim went in Sin Chi Soo's house.

606
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,030
Then she disappeared.

607
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:07,020
What about the eunuch who was bribed by her? If we use him as our witness—

608
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:10,750
That eunuch also left the palace and we don't know where he is.

609
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:15,320
He must also be a spy Sin Chi Soo planted in the palace.

610
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:19,270
Then we can't place blame on Sin Chi Soo for his crimes?

611
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,170
If Court Lady Kim had returned safely,

612
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:24,220
and testified on Sin Chi Soo's confession, it would have been possible.

613
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:28,390
But since we only have suspicions, we can't go after Sin Chi Soo's crime.

614
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:32,570
However, Court Lady Kim would have told him you have a scar,

615
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:36,550
so he shouldn't be suspicious of your identity anymore.

616
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:40,120
He can still do this after being banished from the position of left state minister.

617
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:43,610
We can't leave Sin Chi Soo be.

618
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:46,580
Sin Chi Soo's power comes from his assets.

619
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:52,080
I'm going to begin cutting off his wealth.

620
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:09,550
I plan to install Seonae Hall and push forward the enforcement of the Dae Dong policy.

621
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:11,820
What do you all think?

622
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:20,830
Your Majesty, the Ministry of Finance is ready to support Your Majesty.

623
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:25,270
I will also support Your  Majesty.

624
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:30,570
Your Majesty, the Dae Dong policy has already failed once before.

625
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:33,710
It seems prudent to decide on it more thoughtfully.

626
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:36,950
The Minister of Commerce is right. In these chaotic times,

627
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:42,000
if we enforced the Dae Dong policy, landholders would severely resist.

628
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,770
Take ten bushels of rice from one who owns ten acres of land.

629
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:48,910
And take one bushel of rice from one who owns one acre.

630
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:51,050
What's the problem?

631
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:53,260
If we're so worried about the opposition from the landlords,

632
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:56,960
why are we not worried about the starving people?

633
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:01,810
Paying taxes by how much you own. That is my will.

634
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:05,830
Royal family members and government employees are not exempt.

635
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:11,420
Your Majesty, taxing the land granted to us by the late king?

636
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:13,610
We've never had such a law.

637
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:17,650
Words cannot be returned once spoken.

638
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,060
 There's a way to turn things back, right?

639
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:26,110
 Regrettably, once spoken, words cannot be returned.

640
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:30,390
I spoke the words and now they are the law.

641
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:45,640
Greetings, Your Highness.

642
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:49,760
His Majesty is implementing the Dae Dong policy for the people.

643
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,300
And he's commanded that the royal family will also be taxed.

644
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:57,590
I would like the palace ladies to support His Majesty too.

645
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,430
I will practice reduced repast, so follow suit.

646
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:05,860
Yes, Your Highness.

647
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,010
Eunuch Jo, there's something I'm curious about.

648
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:29,950
Please ask.

649
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:32,960
Taxing landholders.

650
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,910
The intent of the Dae Dong policy is so great.

651
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:37,810
Why did it fail before?

652
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:41,840
The majority of the royal court ministers are landholders.

653
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:47,380
Among them, the one who has the most land is Lord Sin Chi Soo,

654
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:49,940
so, of course, it didn't go well.

655
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:53,610
So that's why they're making such a ruckus.

656
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:56,030
We'll have to truly root the Dae Dong policy this time.

657
01:00:56,030 --> 01:01:01,450
The inner palace is reducing repast by the queen's order.

658
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:02,530
Reduce repast?

659
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:06,540
It means to reduce the number of dishes served at meals.

660
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:10,520
Then I'll have to reduce my meals too.

661
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:13,020
These kinds of snacks too.

662
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:16,170
I won't eat them anymore so send that order.

663
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:22,950
If it's something like this, just eat.

664
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:25,930
It's not even that much.

665
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:34,570
 Gwansanggam (Astronomical Observatory Records)

666
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:37,170
 Gwansanggam's report

667
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:40,170
This is a document sent in from Gwansanggam. Please read it to me.

668
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:44,810
 Gwansanggam: Office of Astronomy and Astrology

669
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:49,560
Last night the sky was covered by dark clouds.

670
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:53,590
And not one star could be monitored.

671
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:57,060
The horizons were covered by fog.

672
01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:01,740
And the sky is disorderly.

673
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:05,560
Please be advised to be more careful for the time being.

674
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:08,500
Is there no talk of snow there?

675
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,580
Snow?

676
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:16,510
Even the Gwansanggam wouldn't know that.

677
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:21,780
But because my knees ache so,

678
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:25,220
I believe it will snow tonight.

679
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:28,660
Are you... sure about that?

680
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:33,500
Please try trusting my knees.

681
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,390
What is this?

682
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:48,830
It's a present that His Majesty sent for you.

683
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:50,820
Open it, please.

684
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:53,060
His Majesty?

685
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:06,550
 Pear Blossom Pavilion Records - Top Volume

686
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:10,350
His Majesty doesn't seem to understand a woman's heart

687
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:13,310
to send a book like this as a present.

688
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:15,780
This is good!

689
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:20,370
But this is the top volume.

690
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:25,210
It means there's a second volume. Why didn't he send it?

691
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:27,710
I'll fetch tea for you.

692
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:45,900
 If you want to see the second volume of this book,

693
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,360
 come to the library tonight.

694
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:05,220
That clown named Ha Seon.

695
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,470
And his sister, Dal Rae.

696
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:10,320
Find that child.

697
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:14,160
If you chase after those who are close to the wench Woon Sim,

698
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,810
you will find something.

699
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:19,630
Yes, sir.

700
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:13,140
 Pear Blossoms Pavilion Records - Bottom Volume

701
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:30,620
 Look at, "With All of One's Heart" by Mencius.
(The Works of Mencius, Chapter 13)

702
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,450
 You've got something on your face.

703
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:52,080
 It's beauty.

704
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:56,120
♫  With that smile  ♫

705
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:00,030
♫  Those delicate tears  ♫

706
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:07,220
♫  Shines like those stars  ♫

707
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:16,570
♫  That promise, in my memories  ♫

708
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:20,800
♫  I'm struggling to find it  ♫

709
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:27,940
♫  Even if I retrace my steps it's blurry  ♫

710
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:35,950
♫  Tell me  ♫

711
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:39,970
♫  One more time  ♫

712
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:48,000
♫  I'll show you my smile  ♫

713
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,890
♫  Our hearts back then  ♫

714
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:56,500
♫  Us back then  ♫

715
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,690
 Even if I die longing for you all my life.

716
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:05,280
 Knowing you has made me happy.

717
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:12,170
♫  Whisper it to me  ♫

718
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:35,690
 I miss you.

719
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:40,340
 I see you and see you, yet I still miss you.

720
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:57,020
 The Essence of Du Mu (Tang Poet)

721
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,530
 Come to the highest point in the palace.

722
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:25,200
 I will be waiting for you.

723
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,840
Why did you run here?

724
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:23,340
What if you trip?

725
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:34,400
After receiving all these presents,

726
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,580
I really could not walk here.

727
01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:40,510
I'm sorry.

728
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:44,620
All I can do for you is merely this.

729
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:47,840
How can you say that?

730
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:53,240
I have received the most precious thing in the world.

731
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:58,030
Haven't I received Your Majesty's heart?

732
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:24,930
It's snowing, Your Majesty.

733
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:31,140
He said it would be the first snow today and it was true.

734
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:35,330
You knew it would snow?

735
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:39,860
I wanted to see the first snow with you.

736
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:53,960
Are you that pleased?

737
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:58,030
Yes. Look at this.

738
01:10:58,030 --> 01:11:03,300
So white and transparent. Aren't they like stars?

739
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,370
 I cannot hide it anymore.

740
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:52,250
 I will not avoid it anymore.

741
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:54,670
 I love you, Your Majesty.

742
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:57,120
 I love you, my queen.

743
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,830
 As though my heart will explode.

744
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:03,470
 It's alright if it explodes.

745
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:10,610
 I love you.

746
01:12:13,870 --> 01:12:15,330
 Even if I die longing for you all my life,

747
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:18,490
 meeting you has made me happy.

748
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:22,050
 The Crowned Clown

749
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:31,870

750
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:42,530
 Preview

751
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:44,250
 Don't say such sh*t!

752
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:47,360
 If it's the heavens' will that a lowborn cannot,

753
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,610
 then I will not obey that will.

754
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:52,220
 I will fight against it.

755
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:54,260
 Since when?

756
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:56,670
 You might be able to be the real king.

757
01:12:56,670 --> 01:13:00,190
 But to the queen, you are forever a fake.

758
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:03,180
 We found the temple where the clown's sister was hiding.

759
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:04,750
 What are you going to do now?

760
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:06,580
 No one follow me.

761
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:08,410
 Whose deceased tablet is this?

762
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:12,400
 You might be able to fool another's eyes but not mine.
