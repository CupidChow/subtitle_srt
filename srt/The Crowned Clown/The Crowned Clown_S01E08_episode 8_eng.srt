 Episode 8

5
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,770
Why did you come back? Did you come to check if I had died?

6
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,610
Go ahead and kill me.

7
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,380
I can't kill you so I could live.

8
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,590
I have to take your head to His Majesty.

9
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,690
Go. Go far away.

10
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,820
The place I have to go has already been decided.

11
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,880
I'm going to return to the palace.

12
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,360
Are you saying you will throw away your chance to live?

13
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,810
Since there is something more important than my life,

14
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,480
I can't leave it behind.

15
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,780
 Don't you ever turn your back away from me.

16
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,730
 If you do, I will kill

17
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,450
 the ones that you cherish and adore more than your own life,

18
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:25,270
 and I will make everything you put your life on the line to accomplish go in vain.

19
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,950
 Imperial edict stating the king knew about the crime the queen had committed. She is ordered to be deposed. Once out of the palace, poison is to be administered to her.

20
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,530
 Since I have found out about the queen's sins,

21
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,250
 there is nothing I can do besides dismiss her from the palace.

22
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,780
 After she's discharged from the palace, I will poison her, so

23
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,750
 prepare.

24
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,200
Your Majesty.

25
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,280
Your Majesty.

26
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,530
Your Majesty.

27
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,510
We're going back to my palace.

28
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,150
What are you doing? Hurry up and go!

29
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,800
Are you alright, Your Highness?

30
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,150
I'm not sure.

31
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,540
Why am I like this?

32
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,840
Why did His Majesty have such a cold gaze?

33
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,470
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

34
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,050
Your Majesty!

35
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,060
Let go!

36
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,910
Your Majesty.

37
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,820
- Everyone leave!
 - Your Majesty...

38
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,190
Your Majesty.

39
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,230
Leave. I will serve him.

40
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,630
Your Majesty.

41
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,810
Your Majesty.

42
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,310
Since the time I decided to serve you with my life,

43
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,490
quite a long time has passed.

44
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,120
In order to fulfill my duty,

45
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:16,550
I did everything to keep my oath of loyalty.

46
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,270
Even though I had to make a decision, I hesitated.

47
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,730
In the meantime, the last chance I was given

48
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,290
disappeared in vain.

49
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,160
I am...

50
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:39,540
now ready to face hell.

51
00:07:54,090 --> 00:08:00,010
 Imperial edict stating the king knew about the crime the queen had committed. She is ordered to be deposed. Once out of the palace, poison is to be administered to her.

52
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,600
Is His Majesty alright?

53
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,680
He fainted and collapsed.

54
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,530
- Then, I will call the royal physician. 
- No, you can't.

55
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,830
What do you mean no? What are you saying?

56
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:54,130
If the royal physician examines His Majesty, he will find out that His Majesty is addicted to drugs.

57
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,380
If His Majesty's condition is known, the entire country will be in chaos.

58
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,840
The queen dowager might use it as an excuse to control the royal court.

59
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,170
But still...

60
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,820
Where is Moo Yeong?

61
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,630
I don't know. While His Majesty was on his way to Her Highness,

62
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,620
he gave him an order in secret.

63
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,940
It seems like he went to fulfill that order.

64
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,270
Until I come back,

65
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,810
don't let anyone in.

66
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,870
 Prohibit the queen dowager from leaving her house. It's the king's order.

67
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,020
 The (faux) edict that orders queen dowager be strictly prohibited from leaving the palace.

68
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,250
 Jeong Saeng

69
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:34,560
 Come to the back door, the side door that servicemen use, at the hour of the tiger (3-5am).

70
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,860
Is anyone outside?

71
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,000
If you go to the brothel in Hwagye-dong, you will find a man named Jeong Saeng.

72
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,970
Deliver this letter to him.

73
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,990
Yes, Sir.

74
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,560
Sir, you were looking for me?

75
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,320
This is from His Majesty.

76
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,650
Proceed with it immediately.

77
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:19,160
As you block the queen dowager from leaving her palace,

78
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,760
go ahead and enhance security around

79
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,020
the Dambum door that the royal family members use and the Geumho door that her servicemen use.

80
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,210
Do this secretly, so there is no fuss about it.

81
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,690
Yes, Sir.

82
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,620
 Sujeongdang (Empress Dowager's Palace)

83
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,470
 Hwaeom Gyeong (The Flower Garland Sutra)

84
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:13,910
 Queen Dowager is "brush meditating" by hand copying part of the Hwaeom Gyeong (The Flower  Garland Sutra)

85
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,550
Your Highness, the guards are blocking the gate and blocking servants from entering.

86
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:27,040
What? It's so late. What's the reason for them to do so?

87
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,500
I'm sorry but His Majesty has... ordered confinement.

88
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,000
 Yoopye: confinement. Keeping an individual locked in deeply.

89
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,770
Why are you here?

90
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,170
- There was a royal command prohibiting any entrance or exit. 
 -  A royal command?

91
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,090
The queen dowager has just been confined under the king's order.

92
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,810
When did he collapse?

93
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,750
It's been a few hours.

94
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:25,150
Then you blocked off the palace and even confined the queen dowager without the king's permission?

95
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:28,560
How are you going to handle this when His Majesty is awake?

96
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,360
Our priority is to take him out of the palace and get him treated without the queen dowager knowing.

97
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,880
His Majesty's birthday is in two days.

98
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,470
If he's not present in the palace, she will find out.

99
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,420
So we need to bring His Majesty—

100
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,760
I mean, we need to bring that fake one back, right?

101
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,530
Ha Seon is dead.

102
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,940
Pardon?

103
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,450
I mean...

104
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,220
How can that?

105
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,750
That bastard...

106
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,500
did not die.

107
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,400
Did you not tell me that he was definitely dead?

108
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:12,050
 Is he alive or dead? What's the truth?

109
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,560
Where is he right now?

110
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,400
Your Majesty.

111
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,200
Your Majesty.

112
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,430
I'm so glad that you're safe.

113
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,850
I'm so relieved.

114
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:16,940

115
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,640
- Is he dead?
 - No.

116
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,280
However, we don't know when he'll wake up.

117
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,960
Why did you call me again?

118
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:48,040
Then, why did you come back even though you knew that you would die?

119
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,040
Because I saw it.

120
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,130
When His Majesty ordered you to kill me,

121
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,630
you hesitated.

122
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,350
 Proceed with it. If you can't do it, should I do it?

123
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,400
 Stop.

124
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,550
You will never know.

125
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:29,640
That horrible feeling of being thrown away by someone you trusted and depended on.

126
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,750
I'm so used to being cold and hungry, but...

127
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,910
For the past few days,

128
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,200
I've been so agonized that I felt it would be better to die.

129
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Cooped up in a pitch black, dark hole,

130
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,140
listening to wild dogs howling, coming to rip my eyes out,

131
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,980
while shivering in the brutally cold wind,

132
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,220
I thought about it and made up my mind.

133
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,820
I really don't want to die like this.

134
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,790
It would be too unfair to die like this, so I can't die.

135
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,720
I also prayed to the heavens

136
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,410
that you would survive.

137
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,320
You can't believe me even if you want to, can you?

138
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,090
Since I've only forced you to the brink of death until now.

139
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,000
If you want me to beg for forgiveness, then I'll do so.

140
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,120
If you ask me to just let you go, I'll send you off.

141
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,150
Just say the word.

142
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,500
What is it that you truly want?

143
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,590
I want to have power...

144
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,810
so that I can protect people who are more precious than my own life,

145
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,250
I want to become a true king

146
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,560
who has that kind of power.

147
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:14,410
Being a king is not a position where you can wield power whenever you want.

148
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,620
It's a position that devours people and bleeds them dry.

149
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,240
It's a savage-like position where you need to cut off loyalty and duty.

150
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,030
Just to protect the throne and the country, just for that,

151
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:33,140
you have to give up everything you have, even your heart.

152
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,990
Do you still want to do it?

153
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,100
Yes.

154
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,930
Engrave this moment in your heart.

155
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,950
From now on, no matter what danger I face,

156
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:55,460
I won't leave your side and will protect you at all costs.

157
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,650
What is wrong?

158
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,120
He fainted again.

159
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,490
I will visit you in a couple of days. Until then, please look after him.

160
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,880
I understand. I will escort him to a location safer than my temple.

161
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:01,770
His Majesty can't go alone. I will follow behind him.

162
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,790
You have to do that for me to rest easy. You do that.

163
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,750
It needs to be examined by the royal physician.

164
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,990
I'm worried it might get worse.

165
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,370
If I end up dying from this small of a wound,

166
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,230
we should just think that it's my destiny to die.

167
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:00,330
There's nothing to do. Don't concern yourself too much.

168
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,390
Since you're making jokes,

169
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:06,320
I feel much more at ease.

170
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,450
Then, I will leave now, Your Majesty.

171
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,940
While you were gone, His Majesty visited Left State Minister Sin Chi Soo and

172
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,910
stated that he will make everything you and I were doing invalid.

173
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:39,860
He has forgiven all those who committed embezzlement?

174
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,760
There must be a way to reverse things, right?

175
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,920
Unfortunately, we can't reverse something that the king says.

176
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,620
So the new appointments will be carried out tomorrow as planned.

177
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,690
Have a drink.

178
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,140
Let's drink up.

179
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:13,020
Congratulations, Left State Minister.

180
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,650
I'm not the one who stands to be appointed tomorrow.

181
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,920
How come you are congratulating me?

182
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,840
His Majesty came here in person.

183
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,190
He showed his trust towards you.

184
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:26,500
We all were able to save our seats.

185
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,750
So this is thanks to you, My Lord.

186
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,770
How could that be because of me?

187
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:34,590
It was all due to the grace of His Majesty.

188
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,150
That, that man.

189
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,460
Come on.

190
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:09,990
My Lord, this is nothing, but please accept this.

191
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,690
What is this?

192
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:16,960
It's something called a telescope.

193
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,280
It's something very fascinating that allows you to see faraway objects as if they were right in front of your nose.

194
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:43,330
 Tojimyeongmun (A contract for prime land)

195
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,020
Your talent is wasted as a county magistrate.

196
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,500
I will take it into consideration.

197
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,520
Thank you.

198
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:03,460
By the way, My Lord,

199
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:07,100
it won't be suddenly postponed, will it?

200
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,160
Are you saying that you can't trust me?

201
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,870
H-How could that be? Of course, I trust you.

202
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,990
It's not a matter of trusting you.

203
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:21,770
Ah, right. I heard you are nominated to be the chief of Ik San County.

204
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,230
Congratulations.

205
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,610
Yes, well...

206
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,390
Since you are the son of the left state minister,

207
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:34,570
it must be that you are getting a nice position.

208
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:39,800
I am planning to do it right and meet His Majesty's expectations this time.

209
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,550
Here is your after breakfast.

210
00:24:55,550 --> 00:25:00,410
I brought some white porridge. Please take your time.

211
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,840
The chief royal secretary has filled me in with what's going on with court affairs.

212
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,530
Did nothing happen here?

213
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,970
No.

214
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,220
Nothing much.

215
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,320
Tell me anything.

216
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,780
I should know everything so I won't make mistakes.

217
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:28,000
Well... There was a night of

218
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:32,120
unification of Her Highness and the real His Majesty.

219
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,160
But His Majesty got sick and

220
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,680
ran out of the room. The unification has failed, so

221
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:48,420
Her Highness must be sad.

222
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:03,840

223
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:25,290
 I haven't given you anything yet, Queen.

224
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:29,250
 So those mere positive feelings, which are not from me,

225
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,450
 get rid of them immediately.

226
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,490
Your Highness, what's wrong?

227
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,200
I feel suffocated.

228
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,890
I need to go out and walk for a while.

229
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:58,300
His Majesty is on his way!

230
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,300
 Daejojeon Palace

231
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,100
Your Majesty.

232
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,900
Queen, follow me.

233
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,020
I missed you.

234
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:09,550
All night, I could only think of you.

235
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:15,010
I was able to endure last night with that thought.

236
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,140
Your Majesty.

237
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:43,210
Your Majesty, what happened to your hands?

238
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,760
Well...

239
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:51,450
I practiced martial arts with Officer Jang late last night. The wounds must be from the practice.

240
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,850
I told him to go easy on me.

241
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,350
It feels like you are a different person from last night.

242
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,260
That's why I like it.

243
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:15,930
I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to see this smile ever again.

244
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:18,090
I was so scared to death.

245
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,150
I felt that way as well.

246
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:26,090
Last night felt so long.

247
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,720
You coming to see me,

248
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,150
I will never forget this until I die.

249
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:39,120
I will make frequent visits from now on

250
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,620
until you say you are sick of me.

251
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,450
You've gone through a lot.

252
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,850
Don't mention it. It wasn't much.

253
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,200
What did you do?

254
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,450
They said we were going to be beheaded until yesterday.

255
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,530
I didn't have to do anything.

256
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:20,930
It was a misunderstanding to arrest you innocent people in the first place.

257
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:24,140
What? A misunderstanding?

258
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,380
What kind of a job are you doing? Huh?

259
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:30,120
Why? You should've come after I'm beheaded and said

260
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,860
"It was a misunderstanding." Huh? Huh?!

261
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,720
I was really scared.

262
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,560
My Lord, is everything truly alright?

263
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,040
Yes. You don't need to worry.

264
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,910
I need to see the members.

265
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,770
I will apologize until they forgive me.

266
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:01,370
I will ask them to come up with a plan together to keep the elder Gil Sam Bong's will.

267
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,540
What's up with this? How come you are guarding the queen dowager's gate?

268
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,430
There was a royal command to prohibit any entrance to the queen dowager's palace.

269
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,330
A royal command?

270
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,790
Do you mean His Majesty has ordered confinement?

271
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,790
The queen dowager has been confined.

272
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,340
My Lord!

273
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,230
How can you confine the queen dowager out of nowhere like this?

274
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,440
What kind of rude behavior is this?

275
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:53,590
Why are you complaining to me when it was His Majesty who ordered it with his own intention?

276
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,480
I just found out too.

277
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,660
Are you saying you don't know anything about this?

278
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:09,760
If you are that worried about the queen dowager, why don't you go beg His Majesty yourself?

279
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,340
Let's go.

280
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:53,770
Your Majesty, these are the government officials designated for promotion and appointment.

281
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:57,760
Your Majesty, please reconsider this.

282
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,440
If you reward those who should be punished,

283
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,740
the order of the court will not stand upright.

284
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:08,110
Your Majesty, if you appoint those who are involved in extortion,

285
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:11,010
the resentment of the people will grow.

286
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:15,400
Please listen to our plea.

287
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,620
Please listen to our plea!

288
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:23,500
Your Majesty, they are being foolish, only knowing part of the situation.

289
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:28,860
If it takes longer for you to appoint regional chiefs, it will be the citizens that suffer.

290
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,680
You should appoint them immediately.

291
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:37,660
I understand you all well.

292
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,730
Chief Royal Secretary.

293
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:46,820
First Officer of the Office of Censors, Sin Yi Gyeom come forward.

294
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,590
I've noticed your abilities for some time.

295
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:27,600
We can't let a person of such worth not be utilized.

296
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,290
I will cancel your nomination as the chief in Ik San county.

297
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:34,670
I will appoint the town magistrate in Moojinmok Dae Jeong Yeon to you.

298
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,600
Does that make sense?

299
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,650
That place is an island full of rocks. Is this not a demotion?

300
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:49,330
This is my turn to get promoted.

301
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:54,220
They said they found a new hot spring there.

302
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,230
A hot spring?

303
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:59,050
That's right. A hot spring.

304
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:03,170
As you all know, I like hot springs.

305
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,160
Go and personally look into the topography

306
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,620
and tell me where to dig to get to the spring.

307
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:16,280
Besides On Yang, I'd like to experience new waters.

308
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,800
Next!

309
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:37,990
Mayor of Jeonju Jeong Hee Myeong, County Chief of Deoksan Lee Soon Il, County Chief of Heungdeok Park Ki Sang, and Chief of Jiksan Kim Ji Bong.

310
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,990
Step forward.

311
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,040
Mayor of Jeonju Jeong Hee Myeong.

312
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:56,360
As a result of an investigation, I found out that you have taken the most tributary payments in all of the eight provinces.

313
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,880
How dare you to commit burglary when you should be an example of the people?

314
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,810
I won't allow your appointment.

315
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:05,540
What's going on?

316
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,810
County Chief of Deoksan Lee Soon Il.

317
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,030
Not only have you stolen tributary payments, but you've also been secretly corresponding with a foreign country.

318
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:18,400
You took petitions regarding this matter from the citizens, and you're shamelessly looking for a promotion?

319
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,260
County Chief of Heungdeok Park Ki Sang.

320
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:26,060
When you were caught stealing tributary payments,

321
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,080
you used bribes to cover up your crimes.

322
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,120
How dare you to cover up your crime with another crime? I won't allow your appointment!

323
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,020
Imprison everyone until I decide on a punishment!

324
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,750
Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Please spare our lives!

325
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:58,120
Forgive us, Your Majesty!

326
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,040
Your Majesty!

327
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,200
Your Majesty, please spare our lives!

328
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,350
Your Majesty!

329
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:19,600
Your Majesty, this was supposed to be a place to reward, but suddenly you've brought up crimes and punishment.

330
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,560
You can't do this.

331
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,680
What do you mean I can't do this?

332
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,660
These are things that you permitted me to do when you came to my home.

333
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,890
You told me to come back to the royal court and stay by your side.

334
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:35,430
You told me to do things I wished. Why are you doing this now?

335
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:38,510
I said that because I trusted your loyalty,

336
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,930
but you let me down.

337
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,300
What do you mean, Your Majesty?

338
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,870
Chief Royal Secretary.

339
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,860
The appointed Chief of Jiksan, Kim Ji Bong.

340
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,390
Yes, yes.

341
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,560
Kim Ji Bong, who has been appointed the chief of Jiksan,

342
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,640
was appointed without taking the high-level exam, although he did take the low-level exam.

343
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,730
It was Left State Minister Sin Chi Soo who appointed this unqualified person.

344
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:04,900
It's only right to hold him responsible.

345
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:11,930
Left State Minister Sin Chi Soo is exempt due to his status as a vassal so I will not punish you separately.

346
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:17,390
But your crime is a serious one, so I will dismiss you from your position as the left state minister.

347
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,560
Your Majesty.

348
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,780
Is this truly what you desire, Your Majesty?

349
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,570
Yes.

350
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,810
 That lowly lad over there...

351
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:02,890
 He's rather good looking contrary to his low status.

352
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,840
Let's go.

353
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,180
Left State Minister.

354
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,930
I should call you Minister Go Seong from now.

355
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,520
Please deliver this message to His Majesty.

356
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,760
I deserve to be deprived of my noble status and everything,

357
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,390
but he graciously allowed me to keep my status as a vassal.

358
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,830
I'll never forget that act of grace.

359
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,050
I will do so.

360
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:27,930

361
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,450
You will regret insulting my innocent family one day.

362
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:56,560
After committing the crime of attempting to kill the chief royal secretary, you still have words?

363
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:03,190
When did I try to kill you? Do you have evidence?

364
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,640
If I report it to the authorities,

365
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:11,260
two days will be enough to get evidence, a witness, and confessions.

366
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,040
Should I do that?

367
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:21,240
If you reject your appointment, I will make you take responsibility for your crimes.

368
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,490
Are you satisfied now?

369
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:38,690
No, not at all.

370
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:41,550
Thinking of what my little sister has gone through,

371
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,350
it wouldn't even be enough making him a slave of government and have him carry feces every day.

372
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:54,290
My Lord, I miss my sister.

373
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:59,110
Woon Sim knows where Dal Rae is. Please let me meet her.

374
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:03,050
Right. So Woon Sim was looking after her.

375
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:06,840
But without revealing your whereabouts to Woon Sim,

376
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,700
I can't ask about your sister.

377
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:14,090
Until I find some way to do this, wait a little bit.

378
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,000
Alright.

379
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,370
Tomorrow is His Majesty's birthday.

380
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:23,870
You will get congratulations from all the civil and military officials of the court.

381
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:28,110
Learn everything from Eunuch Jo and make sure there are no mistakes.

382
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,790
Well...

383
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:33,840
I don't even know my own birthday but getting congratulations...

384
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,560
It feels a bit strange.

385
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,300
Forget about the royal banquet. Can I just cancel it?

386
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:45,160
His Majesty's birthday banquet is a way for court lieges to deliver their congratulations.

387
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:49,880
They must have been preparing for a couple of months. It will be hard to cancel it now.

388
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,380
What about I just get their congratulations without having an actual banquet?

389
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:00,840
I think it would be better giving the food to the citizens instead.

390
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,350
Citizens can stuff their bellies on the king's birthday.

391
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,590
How wonderful that is!

392
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,140
I got it.

393
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:17,070
About the birthday festivities, I will talk to the Minister of Rites and make adjustments.

394
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,500
Okay.

395
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,470
Here comes yeot! Pumpkin taffy!

396
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:26,510
Hey, Auntie!

397
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:31,370
Here! We have yeot! Get some taffy!

398
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:41,020
Where are you going? Come here!

399
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:44,820
What's wrong? You've already made your visit last time.

400
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,200
In order to collect taxes, we have to know the exact prices of products. I can't help it.

401
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,220
This is one my official tasks in the Ministry of Finance, so don't complain.

402
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,500
Hey, hurry, hurry.

403
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,860
This, this. Please try this.

404
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:02,720
You had to choose yeot from all the available candies.

405
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,530
I can feel ill intentions from this plate!

406
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:07,110
No way.

407
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:11,240
I just want you to have some sweets and stay here for a while for fun.

408
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,210
- One, two... 
 - What are you doing?

409
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:16,160
I will count to ten.

410
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,530
I need to know the prices. Bring everything you've hidden in the back.

411
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:22,380
What do you mean hidden? Come on.

412
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,880
After I count to ten, I will double the fine for every product I find.

413
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,310
- Three!
 - Run!

414
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:30,510
- Four!
 - Okay, okay, okay!

415
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,390
Oh, dear...

416
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,670
Well... I need to ask something.

417
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:55,000
Are you the owner?

418
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,280
I wish.

419
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,750
Excuse me?

420
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,760
No, never mind.

421
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:05,890
Go ahead and ask me anything.

422
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:09,360
Ahjussi. Let's just leave.

423
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,670
What's up with you? You don't want to find Ha Seon?

424
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,350
Well...

425
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:20,490
I'd like you to take a look at this.

426
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:23,860
Do you know where it's made?

427
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:27,790
Let me see. How much would I make if I sell this?

428
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,600
I'm just joking.

429
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,660
This girl has such bright eyes. You will become something.

430
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:48,220
This is a dragon design.

431
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,330
Only the king can use this design.

432
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:54,820
Oh my... The k-king, you said?

433
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:59,980
Wait. Where did you get something like this?

434
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:04,700
Well, well... T-That is...

435
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,790
W-Wait!

436
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:09,250
Wait! Wait!

437
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,860
Wait there!

438
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:15,670
Yes, you are still counting, right?

439
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:18,050
I've just counted to 118.

440
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,730
118?

441
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:29,210
Prince Jin Pyeong, you are here to see His Majesty?

442
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:31,560
No, I'm here to see you.

443
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,760
Me?

444
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,690
No matter how much I think about it, I can't understand His Majesty's intentions.

445
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:42,760
I thought it was Left State Minister who persuaded His Majesty to confine the queen dowager, but

446
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,350
I don't think that is the case from what happened in the royal court earlier today.

447
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:50,250
I thought you would know something, Chief Royal Secretary.

448
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:55,390
Well, I'm not sure. How would I know what's in His Majesty's mind?

449
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:59,920
However, regarding the queen dowager, you don't need to worry.

450
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,060
Since it's His Majesty's birthday tomorrow,

451
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:06,310
he has specially ordered the confinement to end.

452
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:08,030
Well, then.

453
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:24,730
He was going to call it off so easily.

454
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:27,830
Why did he order confinement so urgently like that?

455
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:31,420
I'm sure he wanted to humiliate you.

456
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,830
You cannot hold back when it comes to His Majesty's tyranny any longer.

457
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:44,430
If what His Majesty wants is for me to be in fear,

458
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,500
then I should, at least, pretend I am.

459
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,130
What are you planning to do now?

460
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:56,980
Lord! You promised that there wouldn't be any problems this time.

461
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,420
Come out for a second, Lord!

462
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,620
What are you doing? Hurry and take that punk out.

463
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,440
Yes, Sir!

464
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,250
I was told being loyal here would make it all happen, so

465
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,770
I gave you the documents to my land and everything!

466
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:13,100
If things went wrong, you should give me my document! My land!

467
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,530
Shut his mouth.

468
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:16,650
Let go!

469
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:20,100
Lord! My land—

470
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:27,200
Lord! Please spare my life!

471
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,140
I have something to tell you.

472
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:34,050
It's about His Majesty!

473
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:39,420
If you don't listen to me now, you will regret it.

474
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:42,300
Stop it.

475
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:45,680
Father.

476
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,720
Let him in.

477
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:54,950
Since you said it's about His Majesty, I will give you a chance to talk.

478
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:59,780
Recently, I had some clowns perform at my house.

479
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:02,060
But one of the clowns,

480
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:05,970
he looked exactly like His Majesty.

481
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:15,220
Are you trying to fool me with that kind of stupid lie?

482
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,840
Take this bastard away right now!

483
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:20,270
My Lord! I'm not lying!

484
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:23,620
I'm telling you the truth! The truth!

485
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:28,610
This... tsk, tsk, tsk.

486
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,300
But...

487
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,680
Are you sure he looks the same as His Majesty?

488
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,700
How dare I lie to you?

489
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:46,640
If you can't believe me, I will put my life on the line!

490
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:51,660
 Please give us the verdict on the criminal Yoo Ho Jeon's case.

491
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,260
 Exile him to Jeol Island.

492
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:57,860
 He just did it because he was surprised. If he loses his head from one mistake,

493
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,600
 who would survive?

494
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,310
 Since I've never lost trust in you, Left State Minister,

495
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:04,250
 come back to the royal court and stay by my side!

496
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:08,920
 Left State Minister Sin Chi Soo is exempt due to his status as a vassal, so I will not punish you separately.

497
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:14,540
 But your crime is a serious one, so I will dismiss you from your position as the left state minister.

498
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,280
Why did you call for us again?

499
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:37,240
I wanted to give this to you all.

500
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,700
 Daedongjigye

501
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:56,660
This is Daedongjigye that the elder Gil Sam Bong wrote, isn't it?

502
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:01,460
I thought it was burned when he died.

503
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:04,930
Lord risked his life and went into the jail.

504
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:09,340
He stayed with him in his final moments and kept this.

505
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:15,070
I used to think of Hyungnim as an enemy just like you guys but not anymore.

506
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:18,550
I guarantee you that the Dae Dong policy

507
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:23,300
will be a bridge to the new world that we dream of.

508
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:31,180
I remember clearly diligently learning how to read, hoping for the day I would read this book.

509
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:35,770
It's still possible. You don't need to forgive me.

510
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:38,300
It doesn't matter even if you hate me.

511
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:42,750
I will be walking towards the new world you all will live in, so

512
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:45,890
I'm saying, just like the time we were together,

513
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:50,990
we should learn and live together.

514
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:56,160
Fooled once or twice... That's the same thing.

515
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:02,160
Let's just say we were fooled by him one more time.

516
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:07,910
Do it right this time.

517
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:11,560
I will. Thank you.

518
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:25,120
 Engrave this moment into your heart.

519
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:32,570
  No matter what kind of danger I come to face, I will not leave your side and will protect you.

520
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:59,390

521
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:03,410
Your Highness!

522
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:06,740
Have you been well?

523
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:12,200
You've suffered so, Your Highness.

524
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:16,710
The one who was unfilial and persecuted the Queen Dowager is on the king's throne.

525
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:19,880
We are in despair for this country's future.

526
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,460
The sins of a child belong to the parent.

527
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:26,510
It's my fault for not doing anything about His Majesty's tyranny.

528
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:30,040
But for the prosperity and peace of this country,

529
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:34,170
I will not just sit and watch the king's sins any longer.

530
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,500
Will you work with me?

531
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:43,970
It's only right for any righteous person to support our cause to dethrone the corrupt king.

532
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:46,330
Is that not so?

533
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:48,260
Of course!

534
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:51,440
We will follow you, Your Highness.

535
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:57,000
We will follow you! We will follow you!

536
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:14,310
I give my congratulations on your birthday, Your Majesty.

537
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,870
Thank you.

538
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,090
You can leave now.

539
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:40,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

540
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:06,370
 It wasn't a small scar.

541
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:09,720
 How come it disappeared overnight?

542
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:24,550
Your Majesty, are you awake?

543
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:31,720
Where am I?

544
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,850
How come you brought me here?

545
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:37,270
You collapsed, so

546
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:41,600
we brought you here to hide the fact you are ill.

547
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,810
Where is the clown's head?

548
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,110
I could not follow your order, Your Majesty.

549
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:55,530
Since I've committed a crime deserving death, I'm ready to accept any punishment.

550
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:58,340
If it's a crime deserving death, you should die.

551
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:03,410
What are you looking at?

552
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:05,570
Should I kill you?

553
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,330
Since you didn't follow a royal command,

554
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,800
you deserve to die.

555
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:29,390
You should be honored to die in my hands.

556
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:38,030
Your Majesty.

557
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:55,940
Chief Royal Secretary, you've got quite the luck.

558
00:57:57,730 --> 00:58:02,540
I will behead this punk. Watch carefully.

559
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:09,530
Your Majesty.

560
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:11,740
Would you do it?

561
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:22,460
Is it not your birthday today?

562
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:27,110
Don't bloody your hands on such a good day.

563
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:28,910
Birthday?

564
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:33,710
Birthday.

565
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:40,340
Right. It's my birthday.

566
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:46,390
I can't do that. I can't.

567
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:54,640
Lock him up in jail and bring me my birthday banquet.

568
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,210
Let's eat together.

569
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:11,040
Moo Young, go ahead and return to the palace first.

570
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,860
I will serve His Majesty and return.

571
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:39,550
I prepared this birthday food.

572
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:44,080
I know you've rejected having a banquet but please accept this meal.

573
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,410
Did you cook all this?

574
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:51,240
Ladies in the royal kitchen made the side dishes.

575
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:55,550
But you always have the seaweed soup on your birthday, so

576
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,680
I cooked it myself.

577
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:11,480
It's good.

578
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,750
What a relief.

579
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:23,020
Your Majesty, your concubines have requested to see you.

580
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:31,100
They are here to congratulate your birthday. Please bring them in.

581
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:34,940
Let them in.

582
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:54,750
I've brought you a small birthday gift, Your Majesty.

583
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:57,460
Please open it.

584
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:09,140
This!

585
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:14,540
I prepared it for wishing you longevity.

586
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,540
This reminds me of that song.

587
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:29,680
"Hey, Turtle. Hey, Turtle. Give me your head."

588
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:34,310
"If you don't, I will grill you."

589
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:40,560
If it were a real turtle, I could eat it at least.

590
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:44,740
It seems like there is no need for this.

591
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:47,830
It would've been better if you'd given me an actual turtle.

592
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:50,300
- Excuse me? 
 - Right!

593
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,610
I can sell this to purchase rice.

594
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:54,450
Your Majesty.

595
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:04,380
What kind of gift did you give His Majesty, Your Highness?

596
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:09,320
I...

597
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,450
I wasn't able to prepare anything.

598
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:17,120
That could happen. It's okay.

599
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:21,980
I heard that our citizens prefer not to give or receive anything on their birthdays.

600
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:24,770
Let's do that in the palace, too.

601
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,550
I am planning to go to the library.

602
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:39,540
Since it's my birthday, I should go meet my friends the books, right?

603
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:44,160
I'm going to read some books there at the hour of monkey (3-5pm).

604
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,180
So nobody should disturb me!

605
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:53,260
At the hour of monkey. In the reading room. Books.

606
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:08,300
It is someone's birthday today but

607
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:12,000
it's also someone's death day.

608
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:19,350
My mother who died after giving birth to me.

609
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:25,950
I heard that she didn't even have a chance to eat the seaweed soup made for pregnant mothers.

610
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:28,880
Because I killed his beloved concubine,

611
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,700
the previous king didn't even assign me a nanny.

612
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:38,650
Instead of mother's milk, I was fed this seaweed soup, I hear.

613
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:43,190
I wanted to call him Father.

614
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,400
The previous king

615
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:53,100
never allowed me to call him that, not even once.

616
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:02,730
Right. What happened to the queen?

617
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,410
Have you already given her poison?

618
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:10,070
Your Majesty.

619
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:14,910
Your soup will get cold.

620
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:17,240
Please have some.

621
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:20,560
Right.

622
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:24,670
I can poison her after I return to the palace.

623
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,630
Once I return to the palace this time,

624
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:07,340
I will kill everyone who's been disobedient all this time.

625
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:12,570
They will come to their senses when things turn into a bloodbath.

626
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:14,820
They are making me...

627
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:25,020
Your Majesty, before you make your return,

628
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:30,490
let's stop by the beach you used to enjoy when you were the crown prince.

629
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:35,360
I will serve you a drink to celebrate your birthday there.

630
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,260
That sounds good!

631
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:41,900
It's been a while. Let's go together.

632
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:31,740
I was always curious about what there might be on the other side of the ocean.

633
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:38,900
When I was a crown prince, you brought me books from Ming Dynasty.

634
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:42,870
Those books were full of fascinating stories from across the sea.

635
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:46,820
One day, I will definitely

636
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:49,500
cross this sea to those countries and

637
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:52,180
I will bring advanced weapons back.

638
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:56,230
Then, I will make this country stronger than the barbarians,

639
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:59,710
even stronger than Ming Dynasty.

640
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:01,660
You will see.

641
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:09,620
How come you are not saying anything?

642
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:13,980
That strong country that Your Majesty wishes for,

643
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:18,460
you already know that I want the same.

644
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:22,570
That's right. The country you and I wish for.

645
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:24,590
That new world.

646
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:29,020
I will make sure it happens. Just wait a little bit.

647
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:35,530
Didn't you say you have a drink?

648
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:38,390
Give me some already.

649
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:01,050
It would've been nice if you were my father.

650
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,530
Let's go back to the palace now.

651
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,490
How come I'm like this again?

652
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:16,370
That clown punk is alive, right?

653
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:26,120
I was afraid this would happen.

654
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:31,350
That's why I tried to make you kneel in front of me and keep you by my side.

655
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:36,260
How come you are turning your back on me?

656
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:40,280
How come you are abandoning me?

657
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:43,950
I'm not abandoning you, Your Majesty.

658
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:49,210
I just chose this country and its citizens, the new world.

659
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:52,660
Do you think I will collapse like this?

660
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:55,190
No way.

661
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:00,670
As soon I return to the palace,

662
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:06,360
that clown punk, the queen, you,

663
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,990
and even Officer Jang!

664
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:12,080
I will beat you all,

665
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,790
rip your limbs apart, and burn them.

666
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:21,080
I will make sure you suffer

667
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:26,470
in pain that's even more painful than death and regret having treasonous thoughts.

668
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:43,070
You need to spare your words.

669
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:46,240
It will be less painful.

670
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:49,320
Yool...

671
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:54,030
Did Yool that kid...

672
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:58,320
Did he suffer like me right now?

673
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:27,120
When I saw you sacrificing him for my sake,

674
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:31,790
I thought I finally found someone that's on my side.

675
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:37,730
Didn't you say you could die for me?

676
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:43,780
I didn't lie about dying for you, Your Majesty.

677
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:45,820
How interesting.

678
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,970
You decided to die but you live.

679
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:55,000
I decided to live but I die.

680
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:01,630
It can't be.

681
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:04,030
I need to live.

682
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:07,330
I must live.

683
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:12,260
The strong country you wish for.

684
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:18,150
This is the only way for that kind of country to come a day sooner.

685
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:21,720
Do you think it will be possible without me?

686
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,320
Don't worry.

687
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,950
I will put my life on the line and

688
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:30,400
make sure it comes true.

689
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:58,920
I'm scared.

690
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:02,520
I'm so scared.

691
01:13:05,770 --> 01:13:08,390
In the afterlife,

692
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:12,820
the fact that I'm the king won't matter, right?

693
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:15,400
I will stay

694
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:19,060
by your side until the end.

695
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:36,130
 The Crowned Clown

696
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:45,010

697
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,390
 Preview

698
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:58,690
 There is no way you can help me.

699
01:14:58,690 --> 01:15:01,910
 This is my crime. I will be the only one  responsible for it.

700
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:06,480
 You, a hunting dog abandoned by the king... How dare you to come bark at me?

701
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:11,190
 I'm here to put you on the king's throne, Prince Jin Pyeong.

702
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:12,830
 Even if I die missing you, I am happy that I got to know you.

703
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:14,420
 Let's go.

704
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:15,900
 We need to set a trap.

705
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:19,360
 A mere chief royal secretary can't compete with me.

706
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,500
 Can you do it?

707
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,670
 You can't call him a clown if he's choosing where to perform.

708
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:26,690
 You wench, you're asking to die by my hand, aren't you?
