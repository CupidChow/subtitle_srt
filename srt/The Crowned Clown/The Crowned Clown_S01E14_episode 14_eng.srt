 The characters, organizations, locations, and events in this drama are fictional and have no relation to historical facts.

  Episode 14

5
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,420
Eunuch Jo.

6
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,180
Yes, Your Majesty?

7
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,470
Before the queen's father arrives,

8
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,920
I'd like to do something for the queen.

9
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,930
If you have anything in mind, please give your order.

10
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,540
It's nice to see you.

11
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:52,540
Your Majesty, where are we going all of a sudden?

12
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,820
Why? Do you not trust me?

13
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,230
I trust you.

14
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,620
Let us go.

15
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,670
This kind of scenery is a first for me.

16
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,730
What a relief.

17
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,270
I wanted to make you feel better.

18
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:54,530
I was in a lot of pain after hearing the results of my diagnosis from the court female physician.

19
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,520
I feel as if I lost my right to be with you,

20
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,430
and I also lost the way of protecting you.

21
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,220
I was sad and lonely, Your Majesty.

22
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,490
That pain was so severe that I forgot momentarily

23
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:24,640
that there is someone next to me who understands my feelings better than I do.

24
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,980
I will save this scenery in my heart for a very long time,

25
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:54,070
so that even if I go back to the palace, I can picture it again.

26
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,500
In the spring, let's go see the flowers.

27
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,790
In the summer, we'll experience the rain showers.

28
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:07,200
In the fall, it'd be nice if we went to the mountains to pick hazelnuts.

29
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,780
Will we come here again in the winter?

30
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,700
Next winter, I'll make you a beautiful snowman.

31
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,140
You've made your promise.

32
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,950
Of course.

33
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,630
Is this not a locust tree?

34
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,280
That's right.

35
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,160
In the past, when I was on my way to the capital,

36
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,810
I remembered that I passed by here.

37
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,000
I wanted to show you, as well, my queen.

38
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:17,660
How could these two trees that each have their own roots become intertwined?

39
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:24,340
I like to think that these two trees were fated to be together.

40
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:34,020
There is a legend about this tree that's been passed down from a long time ago.

41
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,700
When lovers pass under this tree together,

42
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,480
they say that they will be together for a hundred years.

43
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,650
Will you... be with me for a hundred years?

44
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,910
♫  Something that you realize once,   ♫

45
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,950
♫   something that your heart realizes  ♫

46
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:27,890
♫  Because you shine so definitely brightly  ♫

47
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,670
♫  My heart flutters that much   ♫

48
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,360
♫    I'm scared by that much  ♫

49
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:42,670
♫  Precious things make people hesitate sometimes  ♫

50
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,710
♫  How could you laugh so painfully  ♫

51
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:52,230
I promise you that I will become a good and wise king who will not bring you shame.

52
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:59,320
Could you promise me, too, that you won't cry by yourself again?

53
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,270
Whether it be painful events or happy events,

54
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,710
promise me that you will share them all with me.

55
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,640
I promise you.

56
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,620
♫  If I could be with you in all your nights and all your days  ♫

57
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:21,120
♫  Every single breath would be better  ♫

58
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:29,450
♫  Every single step would be better   ♫

59
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:36,760
♫   Even if it hurts if I could be by your side  ♫

60
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,330
Your Excellency! Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

61
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,990
Your Excellency!

62
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,600
Chief Royal Secretary, you've already arrived?

63
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,540
Where is the queen's father?

64
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,400
Your Majesty.

65
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,000
Your Highness.

66
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,570
The queen's father

67
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,050
has passed away.

68
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,140
There is no way.

69
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,240
He was healthy the last time I saw him.

70
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,980
There must be a misunderstanding.

71
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,740
The news must be false!

72
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,090
I apologize, Your Highness.

73
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,850
Did he really pass away?

74
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,020
How?

75
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,400
He was murdered

76
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,250
by someone.

77
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,110
Father!

78
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,840
Father!

79
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,950
When I heard Yoo Ho Joon was to be released, I was very angry and bitter.

80
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,280
You did well.

81
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,440
You have finally used your power properly, Prince Jin Pyeong.

82
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,030
I am happy that you are pleased.

83
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,240
I must go to see the king and queen's dismayed expressions.

84
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,000
Your Highness, please calm down.

85
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:58,880
The king might catch on, so it would be wise if you hide your true feelings.

86
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,400
Yoo Ho Joon was supposed to die

87
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,510
ever since the king killed my innocent father and Prince Gyeong In.

88
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:09,420
You reap what you sow.

89
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,920
Queen Dowager has incited these matters.

90
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,080
If the queen's father had returned, your power would've grown.

91
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,900
I will never let them get away with this.

92
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,930
The queen dowager and the person who received her orders and killed the queen's father...

93
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:40,480
  Your Majesty. I apologize, but Chief Royal Secretary's request is not right.

94
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,580
  Yoo Ho Joon's crime is obvious, but Chief Royal Secretary wants us to discuss his crimes?

95
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,510
  You cannot grant royal permission.

96
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,270
Prince Jin Pyeong.

97
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:57,050
Prince Jin Pyeong opposed the queen's father being released the strongest.

98
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,240
He must have killed the queen's father. I am sure of this.

99
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,400
I also think the same.

100
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,510
However, if we try to catch Prince Jin Pyeong based on a mere impression,

101
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,420
that could be countered just as easily, so we must be cautious.

102
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,130
Your Majesty, I, Eunuch Jo, am entering.

103
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,600
How did the queen dowager's side look?

104
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,340
Prince Jin Pyeong has been with her since earlier today.

105
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:34,110
Officer Jang, here is the arrow of those who tried to attack the queen and me?

106
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,510
I have it.

107
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,820
This is a different arrow from the one that almost struck you while hunting.

108
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:48,040
We are looking through the blacksmiths' workshops across the capital to find the source.

109
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,820
Search Prince Jin Pyeong's house immediately.

110
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,380
Pardon me?

111
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

112
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,090
Hold on.

113
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,470
Why are you blocking this?

114
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,020
After searching Prince Jin Pyeong's house,

115
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,330
what will you do if you can't find evidence?

116
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,580
We won't even be able to catch Prince Jin Pyeong.

117
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,190
Instead, we'll be letting it be known that we're suspicious of him.

118
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:21,250
Also, it will bring dishonor to your name if people think you are persecuting those who are innocent by framing them.

119
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,050
You cannot succeed if you fear failure.

120
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,600
Should you avoid what you are afraid of?

121
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,310
If we hesitate here, we lose our evidence.

122
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,250
The queen dowager and Prince Jin Pyeong's power will only grow from here.

123
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,450
Then, I will carry out your order.

124
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,910

125
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,480
Moo Yeong, hold on.

126
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,410
If Prince Jin Pyeong's house holds no evidence,

127
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:10,590
plant the arrows you possess as evidence.

128
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,180
Are you telling me to make fake evidence?

129
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,840
Yes.

130
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,030
This is a royal order. Open the door this instant!

131
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,250
- Search the house. 
 - Yes!

132
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,970
Officer Jang.

133
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,450
Go look and see if there are other arrows.

134
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,170
Yes, sir.

135
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,670
What is the matter at this hour of the night?

136
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,230
We were called here by the king.

137
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,290
Did you not hear, Prince Jin Pyeong?

138
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,620
My Lord, you must go with us–

139
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
Stand aside.

140
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,050
Please save my life.

141
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:11,440
Prince Jin Pyeong, what are you doing?!

142
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,870
Stand aside, I said.

143
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,820
Stand aside.

144
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,130
Prince Jin Pyeong!

145
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,620
Prince Jin Pyeong.

146
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,630
My Lord!

147
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,690
What is the matter?

148
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,750
The king's guards suddenly came to the house,

149
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,760
and they discovered the arrows used when you tried to kill the king.

150
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,530
Arrows?

151
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,000
I have never left arrows in my house. How did they...?

152
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,810
The king has laid a trap to make me a traitor.

153
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,690
Call for the soldiers.

154
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,750
Yes, sir.

155
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,110
Minister of Defense,

156
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,600
I heard you were harmed by Prince Jin Pyeong. Are you okay?

157
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,830
Yes. I am grateful for your concern, Your Majesty.

158
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,850
Your Majesty.

159
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:41,440
A traitor has been coming in and out of the palace, and you have been put in danger.

160
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,680
It is our fault for not taking notice of this.

161
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:52,700
I hope that you lay down a heavy punishment upon me.

162
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,120
Please lay down a heavy punishment upon me, as well, Your Majesty.

163
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,070
Please lay down a heavy punishment upon us.

164
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,010
Please lay down a heavy punishment upon us.

165
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,820
Please lay down a heavy punishment upon us.

166
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,800
If you wish to do something for me,

167
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,890
start the discussions for the queen dowager's dethronement.

168
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:20,410
I apologize, Your Majesty, but we cannot follow that order.

169
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,550
Minister of Defense, you were almost killed by Prince Jin Pyeong.

170
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,340
How can you say you won't follow the order?

171
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,580
Though Prince Jin Pyeong did commit the crime, it is not evidence that the queen dowager committed treason.

172
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:47,260
The queen's father was killed and Prince Jin Pyeong escaped.

173
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,520
But the court is hesitant to discuss deposing of the queen dowager.

174
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,780
We have no other choice.

175
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:58,590
At the morning royal audience tomorrow, I will order for the queen dowager to be deposed.

176
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,190
You cannot.

177
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,140
If you order for the queen dowager to be deposed without justification,

178
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,840
there will be strong opposition from society.

179
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,290
- But... 
- After arresting Prince Jin Pyeong and getting the land documents,

180
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,960
then I will lead and request for the deposing of the queen dowager.

181
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,420
Your Majesty, Officer Jang is entering.

182
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,510
Did you catch Prince Jin Pyeong?

183
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,460
I am very sorry.

184
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,980
 Huijeongdang Hall

185
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,540
Your Majesty, the Royal Investigation Bureau has sent a message.

186
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,960
Criminal Sin Chi Soo has said he has something to report about Prince Jin Pyeong.

187
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,570
He has requested to see you.

188
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,340
  Whose ancestral tablet is this?

189
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:54,050
  It is from a great friend who comes and goes like the clouds and wind.

190
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,050
This bastard.

191
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,820
You have arrived, Your Majesty?

192
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,260
Since I'm in this condition,

193
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,510
please forgive me for not being able to show my manners.

194
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,500
I came because you said you had something to report about Prince Jin Pyeong.

195
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,240
Chief Royal Secretary seems to be requesting you depose the queen dowager

196
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,860
since the queen's father died,

197
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,980
but if I were you, I would not listen to him.

198
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:34,050
You will just be doing exactly what Prince Jin Pyeong wants.

199
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:37,530
Did you call me just to tell me that?

200
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,540
Playing the king must be fun for you.

201
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:53,680
Yeah, you must feel as if you truly became king after sitting on the throne.

202
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,150
But you are nothing but Chief Royal Secretary's puppet.

203
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:03,730
You aren't the one playing as king; Chief Royal Secretary is.

204
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,210
Is that not true?

205
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:14,630
You're wrong. My Lord isn't that kind of person.

206
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,640
You are so innocent.

207
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,220
I see why the Chief Royal Secretary killed the king and chose you instead.

208
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,360
What did you just say?

209
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,880
Did you really not know that Chief Royal Secretary killed the king?

210
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,350
- Don't speak such nonsense. 
 - Even though the king was physically and mentally ill,

211
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,010
don't you find it strange that he suddenly died?

212
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:49,860
And, I'm sure that no one saw the king die other than Chief Royal Secretary himself.

213
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:56,810
Since you look like the king and follow what you are told well,

214
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,380
Chief Royal Secretary will serve you like you're the real king for a while.

215
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,510
But if he ever thinks that you are not acting in accordance with what he wants,

216
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:10,430
he'll kill you too someday.

217
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,970
Chief Royal Secretary could easily do such a thing.

218
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,440
What is it that you truly want to say?

219
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,720
If you truly have to continue your role as a puppet,

220
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,470
you don't always have to hold Chief Royal Secretary's hand.

221
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:31,170
How about holding hands with me too?

222
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:38,780
I'll make it so that you'll be able to live in splendor as you've never seen before.

223
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:43,830
I'll give you the taste of power that the Chief Royal Secretary will never let you have.

224
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,720
I'll allow you to enjoy the pleasure of being king.

225
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,520
Shut up! Do you know why you're imprisoned here?

226
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,520
That's because you looked down on me,

227
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,070
and you assumed that Chief Royal Secretary would be a disloyal subject like you.

228
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:04,160
You lowly clown, you're trying to educate me now?

229
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,380
The lowly one is not me but you!

230
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,720
You're trying to cause trouble even when your death day is set.

231
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,220
How pitiful.

232
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,770
Your Majesty.

233
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,820
There is something I must tell you.

234
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,580
Request for an audience with the queen dowager.

235
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,610
Chief Royal Secretary, I didn't think you'd come to see me.

236
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:14,300
I had something to ask you regarding Prince Jin Pyeong, Your Highness.

237
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,750
I've heard about what happened to Prince Jin Pyeong.

238
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,790
He was plotting treason, correct?

239
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:24,990
From what I'm aware of, Prince Jin Pyeong has been seeking your well-being quite thoroughly.

240
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:31,960
Even if it is something small, or perhaps something that's bothering you, please let me know.

241
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,310
Something strange?

242
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:42,940
I am not sure. Prince Jin Pyeong only told me about the worldly news.

243
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,380
He never acted strangely.

244
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,160
Is that truly it?

245
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,460
What is the meaning of that?

246
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:57,090
From what I know, Prince Jin Pyeong would not cause trouble without someone backing him.

247
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:03,730
However, he made multiple attempts to kill the king and even murdered the queen's father.

248
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:11,760
He would never have dared to do so if he wasn't confident that he would be the next king.

249
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:18,230
Since the king killed his father and brother on the basis of treason, he must have wanted to avenge them.

250
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:22,150
How do you know Prince Jin Pyeong's feelings so well?

251
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,430
That's human nature.

252
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:32,240
Oh, right. Prince Gyeong In's death anniversary is coming up.

253
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:43,210
I didn't know you remembered.

254
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,650
How could I forget?

255
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:52,780
I still remember the moment he passed away vividly.

256
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:57,160
He had a delicious supper.

257
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:02,050
What are you saying right now?

258
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:06,070
Coarse multi-grain rice with soft, seasoned vegetables.

259
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:11,170
There was nothing particular about the prince's supper.

260
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:16,690
He even used his chopsticks well with his cute little hands.

261
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:26,280
He didn't even know that would be his last meal in this world.

262
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:42,210
The person who killed my son was not Sin Chi Soo but you.

263
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:49,070
Yes. I took Prince Gyeong In's life away for the king's sake.

264
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,900
After throwing up blood,

265
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,080
he called for you during his last breath.

266
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,150
You bastard!

267
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,480
I should have killed you first instead of the king.

268
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,680
Is that why you ordered for Prince Jin Pyeong to try and kill the king two times and even murdered the queen's father?

269
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:17,720
Yes! I ordered for Prince Jin Pyeong to kill the king and queen.

270
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,950
I ordered that the queen's father die as well. And what about it?

271
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:27,470
I was only punishing those who killed my son, who was my whole life.

272
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:32,450
What did I do wrong?!

273
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:42,900

274
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,530
I listened to your confession

275
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,640
quite well.

276
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:10,010
Since your crimes have been exposed, I will order that you be deposed at court.

277
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:14,630
You bastards. You bastards!

278
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,970
You bastards!

279
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,260
Just wait and see.

280
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,790
I swear on my son's grave

281
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:33,380
that I will rip you bastards to shreds and spread them all across the eight provinces of Joseon.

282
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:37,180
The crows will feed on you and not a trace will remain.

283
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:44,960
I will see to it that you bastards fall to hell and suffer through eternity!

284
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:58,860
You bastards. You bastards.

285
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,170
Bastards!

286
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:13,170
Bastards.

287
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:42,000
I was worried that you wouldn't arrive on time.

288
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,390
  I will go to the queen dowager and receive her confession.

289
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:57,680
  I will send a message through Officer Jang. Be sure to come on time.

290
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:06,840
After hearing my conversation with the queen dowager, you must have things you want to ask me.

291
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,180
Let's go to the side palace.

292
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:43,260
If you killed Prince Gyeong In for the king, who have you killed for me?

293
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,400
Was it the king?

294
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,700
Who said so?

295
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:55,520
Sin Chi Soo. He informed me.

296
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:03,030
He said that you killed the king and that when I am no longer any use to you, you will kill me, too.

297
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,020
Is that true?

298
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,330
Yes.

299
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:16,560
I killed the king.

300
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:23,510
After Officer Jang sent me the message from you,

301
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:32,210
he confessed that Prince Jin Pyeong's arrow was fabricated evidence that he made.

302
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:38,060
Even so, Prince Jin Pyeong was not caught. Officer Jang confessed his sins.

303
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:43,340
It is not Officer Jang's fault. I ordered him to do it.

304
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:50,800
I thought that there needed to be at least one piece of evidence to proceed with the deposing of the queen dowager.

305
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,260
Take this.

306
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,940
What is this?

307
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,800
It's an appeal to change my government position.

308
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:18,600
I will step down from my position as Chief Royal Secretary.

309
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:24,350
Since the queen dowager and Sin Chi Soo have found out about what happened to Prince Gyeong In and the king,

310
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:30,430
my existence will stand in your way.

311
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:35,250
I will deal with my crimes myself.

312
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:38,850
How are those your crimes?

313
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,190
They are not your crimes

314
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,610
but my crimes.

315
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,470
My crimes as the king.

316
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:54,360
Please stop trying to deal with those horrible crimes by yourself.

317
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:07,730
You said that the position of the king is a horrible one in which people are ruined and left bleeding.

318
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,300
  I want to be a true king.

319
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:16,550
 The position of the king is a horrible one in which people are ruined and left bleeding.

320
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:20,210
  It is a beast's position that draws out  loyalty and duty.

321
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,940
  In order to protect the throne and country,

322
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:30,730
  just for those things, it is a horrible position in which you must give your all, even your heart.

323
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:34,440
Since you have dealt with those horrible things by yourself,

324
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,430
Sin Chi Soo misunderstood and believed you were the one playing as king.

325
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:43,120
However, I do not believe so.

326
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:52,650
Although I do not know how you felt while doing such things,

327
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:58,990
I cannot even imagine how pained and lonely you must have felt.

328
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:05,800
After finding out about everything, are you not afraid of me?

329
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,760
Can you still trust me?

330
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,450
How could I fear and doubt you?

331
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,060
I trust you.

332
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,890
That applies to what happened with the arrow as well.

333
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:23,370
While I was acting so hastily,

334
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,650
did you not handle the matter in that way to support me?

335
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,710
I won't allow for your change in position.

336
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:55,040
If you truly believe that I am a king, please stay by my side

337
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,450
and protect this country and its people with me.

338
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,050
In all honesty, I was anxious.

339
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:13,120
Whoever sits on the throne can become drunk on power.

340
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,350
Their temperament and heart could change in an instant,

341
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:21,660
and it would be irreversible in the end. I knew that so well.

342
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,480
I was afraid

343
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:29,370
that you would follow that path.

344
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:33,600
I was afraid that I'd fail again.

345
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:39,010
But now I know for sure.

346
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:42,640
Ha Seon, you are different from him.

347
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,450
After choosing you,

348
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,580
I couldn't completely trust you.

349
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:54,780
Trusting someone is so important.

350
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,670
I came to that realization through you.

351
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:08,950

352
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:22,630
Your Majesty, I will no longer be afraid.

353
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,260
I will protect my duty,

354
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,880
trust in you completely, and serve you.

355
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,680
Please forgive my past mistakes.

356
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:40,640
Your Majesty. From now on, I will serve you with utmost respect and etiquette.

357
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,320
Thank you for trusting me.

358
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,330
 Injeongmun Gate 
 (The main gate leading to Injeongjeon Hall)

359
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,330
 Petition to depose the queen dowager to the West Palace.

360
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:36,570
Your Majesty, I am making an appeal to dethrone the queen dowager.

361
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,090
Please accept it.

362
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:45,960
Your Majesty, if you depose the queen dowager, that unfilial act will remain with your descendants,

363
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,340
and they will curse your reign.

364
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:51,140
Please show your grace.

365
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,170
Minister of Defense's words are correct.

366
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:56,130
Confucian principles of duty must be followed, and we must set an example for the people.

367
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,640
The queen dowager cannot be deposed.

368
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:02,710
Your Majesty, the queen dowager used Prince Jin Pyeong

369
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:07,640
to inflict harm upon you and has already confessed to plotting treason.

370
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:13,570
The queen dowager could also work with other treacherous individuals and cause a rebellion.

371
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:19,040
She should be rid of completely in order to prevent a civil war.

372
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,940
Chief Royal Secretary, please watch your words.

373
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,590
Get rid of her completely, you say?

374
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:27,470
You should not speak so easily of the loyalty between a mother and son, between the Queen Dowager and His Majesty!

375
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:31,170
Your Majesty, since the queen dowager acted as a traitor,

376
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:35,950
she herself gave up on the loyalty between mother and son and her duty to the people.

377
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:39,910
It is only right to dethrone her and make her leave the palace.

378
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:45,520
Your Majesty, she worked with the traitor Prince Jin Pyeong to harm you.

379
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,090
Her crime is clear.

380
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:52,680
I also recommend that you depose the queen dowager.

381
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,610
Please accept it.

382
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,410
Please accept it.

383
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:00,950
Please accept it.

384
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:11,320
I will accept your request.

385
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:30,840
Chief Royal Secretary.

386
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,930
Welcome.

387
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,330
I ran here after hearing that the request to depose the queen dowager was accepted.

388
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:41,070
The opposition to this will be fierce. Will you be okay?

389
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:43,410
The queen dowager's crimes are clear.

390
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:47,220
The king also has a strong will. You don't have to worry.

391
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:50,150
Just trust and follow the king.

392
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,270
I understand.

393
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,030
Also,

394
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:00,530
this is a letter from the clerk in Hamgyong.

395
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,460
You may leave.

396
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,940
 Letter from someone in Hamgyeong Province to Chief Royal Secretary Lee.

397
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:20,080
 It is an update on the situation at the border of  Northern Hamgyeong Province.

398
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:42,790
  Thank you for informing me about the situation at the borders.

399
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:46,120
  I will soon let go of my position as Chief Royal Secretary and go there.

400
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:52,310
 Please report to General Kang In Bok who's at the border security of Northern Hamgyeong Province until I get there.

401
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:11,620
You put a lot of effort into making these clothes for your father, Your Highness.

402
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:14,900
To think that he didn't even get to wear them once...

403
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:18,690
When his casket is sent to the relatives back home,

404
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:23,910
ask for these clothes to be sent as grave goods.

405
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:27,720
Yes, Your Highness.

406
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:32,900
Your Highness, Court Lady Myeong is entering.

407
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:43,140
Your Highness, the king has accepted the deposing of the queen dowager.

408
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:48,330
The king has avenged your father, Your Highness.

409
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:51,640
I must go to the queen dowager this instant.

410
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:56,660
But the funeral service for your father has not been completed yet, Your Highness.

411
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,260
We need to stop the queen dowager from exiting the palace.

412
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,730
Pardon me? Why?

413
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:07,330
If the queen dowager is deposed, that'll pose as a threat to the king's peaceful reign.

414
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,060
Prince.

415
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:46,730
I was going to kill them and avenge your death,

416
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:53,490
but I fell for the schemes of my enemies, and I have just become more bitter.

417
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,690
But do not worry.

418
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:59,380
I will never give up.

419
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:12,310
Your Highness, the queen has requested to see you.

420
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,770
Let her in.

421
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:45,460
Since I am in the period of mourning, forgive me for not showing my utmost manners.

422
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:51,400
Did you hear that I am to be deposed and come to have a look?

423
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:59,930
I will not discuss the witchcraft that you have tried against me or the tea.

424
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:04,980
However, you tried to prevent my father from being released and had him killed.

425
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,650
I will never forgive you for that.

426
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:13,050
However, even though I was desperate to take the lead in deposing you,

427
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:16,760
I held back the urge for the sake of the king.

428
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,000
You're finally letting your true feelings show.

429
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,010
That's better. It was such a drag to hear you speak in such a cringeful manner.

430
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:30,360
Before you are deposed,  you should back down yourself and join a temple.

431
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,270
What did you say?

432
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:35,880
You want me to become a Buddhist nun?

433
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,990
It is for the sake of the king and the royal court,

434
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:44,250
and to avoid further disturbances.

435
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:50,230
If you pray for the heavenly ascensions of your father and Prince Gyeong In until the day you die,

436
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:53,970
for the sins you have committed in this world and the karma,

437
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:57,500
I will give a Buddhist prayer so that they cease to exist.

438
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:02,430
Your Highness, how despicable.

439
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:06,820
Aren't you the one who's supposed to get tortured and stoned to death right now?

440
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:10,680
How will you make up for the crime of dirtying the position as mother of the state?

441
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,120
I have no intentions to conceal my own crimes.

442
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:20,240
If you come forth with your sins and receive punishment, so will I.

443
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,930
What are you so confident for?

444
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:25,330
Because there is no reason for me to not be confident.

445
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,930
What will you do?

446
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:33,290
This won't do.

447
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:38,070
Rather than begging for the preservation of my position to that lowly clown,

448
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:40,990
I'd rather just be deposed.

449
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:51,780
Your Highness, your methods have improved greatly.

450
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:57,970
Your Highness, please think this over again.

451
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:01,680
I have nothing else to say. Leave this instant!

452
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:25,070
 Sujeong Palace

453
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:41,400

454
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:53,870
Your Majesty! You're confining the queen dowager to the West Palace? That cannot be!

455
00:49:53,870 --> 00:50:02,260
Your Highness! Your Highness! Your Highness!

456
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:08,520
This can't be! This can't be!

457
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:14,570
Your Highness! Your Highness!

458
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:17,350
This can't be!

459
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,960
Your Majesty.

460
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:25,090
Since the matters of the queen dowager's deposing have concluded,

461
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:28,590
I have a request to ask of you.

462
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:31,720
What is it?

463
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:35,190
Since the war between the Ming Dynasty and Later Jin is imminent,

464
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:37,850
the borders have never been more chaotic.

465
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:41,630
I would like to step down from my position as Chief Royal Secretary

466
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:44,870
in order to help with the matters at the borders.

467
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:50,550
I will take whatever position you give me and do my very best. Please grant me your royal permission.

468
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:54,990
I still need your help, Chief Royal Secretary. Must you really leave?

469
00:51:54,990 --> 00:52:00,390
I realize the importance of my duty as Chief Royal Secretary.

470
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:05,730
However, at this time, it is most urgent to calm down the situation at the borders.

471
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:11,290
Please accept my request. I am asking this of you.

472
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,850
My Lord, what happened?

473
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:29,660
You are suddenly speaking formally to the king,

474
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,630
and you have requested to transfer to the border.

475
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:35,600
I cannot understand.

476
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:40,140
It was wrong to not speak formally to the king until now.

477
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:44,450
Is there anything wrong with my decision to speak in that way now?

478
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:48,980
I am only letting go of my position as Chief Royal Secretary because the time has come for me to do so.

479
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,280
You do not have to be so surprised.

480
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,840
But...

481
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,510
How is the West Palace?

482
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:55,980
There haven't been any movements in particular yet.

483
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:01,390
Prince Jin Pyeong  could attempt to make contact with the queen dowager at any time. Make sure you tighten the security.

484
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,010
Yes, My Lord.

485
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:08,310
And, from now on, don't report things to me.

486
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,960
Report things to His Majesty himself.

487
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:14,390
I understand.

488
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,020
  Hyungnim.

489
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:25,280
I was about to leave the palace. Why did you call for me?

490
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,980
How are Daedong policy and the land surveys coming?

491
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:36,900
People seem to have lost their minds over the queen dowager being deposed.

492
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,170
But do not worry. Even if I have to swing a whip,

493
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:42,680
I'll make sure things progress as we planned.

494
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:46,460
I'll leave things to you.

495
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,970
Is that all?

496
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:00,960
Why's he being like that?

497
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,410
He looks as if he was told he'd be dying soon.

498
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:09,360
By any chance, does he have a terminal illness that I'm not aware of?

499
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:12,900
It's a joke.

500
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,310
Seems like you get scared quite easily.

501
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:41,380
You look as if you heard some good news.

502
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,350
Yes.

503
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:48,910
I feel great as if I'm about to meet my longtime lover again.

504
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:55,520
I just mentioned seeing my longtime lover again.

505
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,660
How come you are not even jealous?

506
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:06,740
I have prayed that you would find someone to share your heavy burden with.

507
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:11,540
Even if it is not me, if they make you feel at rest,

508
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:15,150
it does not matter who it is.

509
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:20,510
What I said was a lie.

510
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:25,070
But I'm a bit disappointed.

511
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:32,650
Well, why would you lie like that?

512
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:45,930
Until now, I have done my best to not look back on my actions.

513
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:49,070
I had already lived in regret multiple times,

514
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:53,460
so I will no longer hold onto past feelings.

515
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:55,060
That's what I promised myself.

516
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,250
Regrets?

517
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:01,350
Are you talking about the matters regarding Elder Gil Sang Bom?

518
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,800
There's that too.

519
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:07,940
But actually,

520
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:11,480
there were other regrets besides that.

521
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:19,070
When you had just finished your training at the brothel,

522
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:24,090
when you requested I be your first customer...

523
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:31,560
You immediately denied my request, My Lord.

524
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:37,540
I always regretted the fact

525
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:40,060
that I never ran off with you at that time.

526
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,300
And, from time to time,

527
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,410
I thought to myself,

528
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:51,920
"Is it still not too late?"

529
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:58,220
If I ask you to come to the remote, dangerous borders with me,

530
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:01,950
will you come?

531
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:30,770
You have no idea how much I wanted to hear those words from you, My Lord.

532
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:36,240
Even if you say those are your past feelings, that can't be helped.

533
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,710
Since I have heard you speak of it now,

534
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:42,800
I am so happy.

535
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,550
 A note to inform Prince Jin Pyeong that preparation at the four gates (of the Hanyang Fortress Wall) is complete and access can be done without worry.

536
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:02,420
Our secret communications within the capital have concluded.

537
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:05,090
The trainee soldiers and veterans from the five military camps

538
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:08,260
have sent messages that they would join forces with you.

539
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:11,100
If we combine all of those numbers, it will surpass 3,000 men.

540
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,690
If you give the order, things will be moving right away.

541
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:18,100
There is still something that I don't have, and it's in the capital.

542
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,980
I have to get that...

543
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:24,400
in my hands first.

544
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,810
You must have this.

545
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:27,630
 Prison break

546
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:16,290
Did you conclude your father's funeral services well?

547
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:22,390
Yes, thanks to your consideration, Your Majesty.

548
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:28,160
I am sorry. I couldn't keep my promise.

549
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,350
I said for you to share your sadness with me, but...

550
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:37,450
No, that is not the case. I am aware that the matters of the court were urgent.

551
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:44,540
I myself am sorry for not being able to share that hardship with you.

552
01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:50,410
Actually, it was quite hard.

553
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:54,680
I thought I already knew what it was like,

554
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:59,940
but being king is different every single day.

555
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:01,540
Every time I'm confronted by hardships,

556
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:06,280
I'm realizing that I have to withstand them alone.

557
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,440
Are you afraid?

558
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:12,730
I am afraid.

559
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:17,060
Do you wish to turn things back to the way things were?

560
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:20,640
In all honesty,

561
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:24,850
I have had those thoughts from time to time.

562
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:30,110
If you say that you wish to run away, I will run with you.

563
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:34,810
If you say that you will withstand them, I will do so together with you.

564
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:38,460
I am thankful for your words.

565
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:45,460
I will not run or avoid these matters. I'm going to withstand them with all of my strength.

566
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,120
Please watch over me while I do so.

567
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:53,200
I will always offer you my support by your side, Your Majesty.

568
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:58,360
Then, will you help me?

569
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:01,340
Please tell me, whatever it is.

570
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,230
That over there.

571
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:12,840
Are those not the reports from each province?

572
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,200
That's right.

573
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:20,500
Eunuch Jo would rub his eyes in the dim room as he annotated it with the Korean alphabet until now.

574
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:24,400
I'd like for you to do that instead, my queen.

575
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,660
I understand.

576
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:39,880
This is the report from Gyeongsang province.

577
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:43,350
You can take your time,

578
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:47,070
so you should try and read aloud your interpretation.

579
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:50,210
Alright.

580
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:58,390
Those who were caught during the Japanese invasion and returned,

581
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:03,250
it seems they are being harassed by people.

582
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:08,120
Did I read that correctly?

583
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,470
Yes.

584
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:13,810
You did not get a single thing wrong. You read it well.

585
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:18,530
Please continue to read.

586
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:25,930
As I am requesting, please find a solution for me.

587
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:42,180
My Lord, the peddler is here.

588
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:44,310
Where is he?

589
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:47,930
What happened?

590
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,230
Did something happen?

591
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:56,000
After I left you, I was under attack.

592
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,070
Then, what happened to the secret letter?

593
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:02,500
My attackers seem to have stolen it from me.

594
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:06,190
I was knocked out for a few days. I'm here now to inform you of it.

595
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:10,360
That secret letter has His Majesty's seal on it!

596
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:14,320
Who is the one who stole the letter from you?

597
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:17,560
Since I was attacked from the back, I couldn't catch his face.

598
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:22,890
Before I lost consciousness, I could hear my attackers speaking.

599
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:29,180
  The left state minister will be pleased.

600
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:32,420
He surely said that the left state minister would be pleased.

601
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:34,390
Left State Minister?

602
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:38,320
Left State Minister Sin Chi Soo!

603
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:02,700
Why have you come to visit such a shabby place like this, Chief Royal Secretary?

604
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:07,590
How long will you keep causing trouble for His Majesty's peaceful reign?

605
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:13,050
I have no idea what you are saying, so please elaborate.

606
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:23,760
Where did you hide His Majesty's secret letter?

607
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:28,280
Oh, that traitorous letter, you mean?

608
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:33,990
That was a decision made by His Majesty for the sake of this country and its people.

609
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:37,760
How is that different from His Majesty's duty?

610
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,380
I truly do not understand you.

611
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:44,090
Born into a reputable family and

612
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:46,990
having so much more than anyone in life,

613
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:49,730
how could you associate yourself with those lowly people

614
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:53,780
and lived a life misaligned with what the world wanted for you?

615
01:05:54,440 --> 01:06:00,190
I have come this far with my own strength starting from my poor family.

616
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:04,650
If I were you,

617
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:13,860
I would have properly enjoyed what I had and multiplied all of it and given it to my descendants.

618
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:19,010
With the justification that it is for your descendants, you chase after your own self-interest.

619
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:23,350
Is that the justification that you have embraced and embodied?

620
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:29,280
You set up a clown to be your puppet and fulfilled your self-interest, did you not?

621
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,480
I told you.

622
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,820
We are the same kind of people.

623
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,720
Do not deny that.

624
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:42,180
I will not deny it.

625
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:46,760
But my path is different from yours.

626
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:51,720
A different path? What do you mean?

627
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:58,360
Thankfully, I have met two kings who have understood my heart.

628
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:02,630
One of them lost his path and wandered, but this time,

629
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:06,060
this one has decided to not wander.

630
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:09,960
I will step back from that path.

631
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:13,080
Step back? You?

632
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,840
Do you believe you can fool me with those words?

633
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,910
It doesn't matter if you do not believe me.

634
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:24,670
Where is that secret letter?

635
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:28,370
I can't tell you.

636
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:30,640
Just kill me while you're at it.

637
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,060
Will you truly be like this until the end?

638
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:38,660
I'm going to die anyway. It'd be fun to die by your hands.

639
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:43,040
Why do you hesitate?

640
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:47,250
What? Is it because you have no sword?

641
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:46,520
I looked for a sword, and my hands picked one up.

642
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,990
It seems as if the heavens are helping me.

643
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:55,040
Then, those heavens have become rotten to the core.

644
01:09:55,040 --> 01:10:01,380
If they have rotten, so be it. My will is the same as theirs.

645
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:13,450
What-what is that?

646
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:15,560
 Donuimun Gate (also known as The West Gate)

647
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:30,560
My Lord, a huge problem has occurred.

648
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,960
I believe a war has started.

649
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,260
What did you say?

650
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:38,150
I'll look into what happened, so you guys can—

651
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:49,930
- Open the castle gate. 
 - Yes, sir.

652
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:30,880
 Donuimun Gate (also known as The West Gate)

653
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,180
It's a rebellion!

654
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:18,670
The rebels are coming into the palace!

655
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:37,930
 The crowned clown

656
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:48,900

657
01:12:55,930 --> 01:12:57,820
 Preview

658
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:01,650
  Bring me the royal seal and that fake man's head.

659
01:13:01,650 --> 01:13:04,160
  What's lowly and what's fake?

660
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:08,210
  Everything that man did is for the people and its country.

661
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:12,300
  You cannot call that lowly. It's even more false to call it fake.

662
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:15,080
 Thinking that you have to take them on alone

663
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:16,530
 makes me feel anxious.

664
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:18,150
  The secret letter has not come out.

665
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:21,900
  The king is someone who becomes more daring when you threaten him.

666
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,570
  You cannot do this.

667
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:27,230
  Do not worry. I will return safely.
