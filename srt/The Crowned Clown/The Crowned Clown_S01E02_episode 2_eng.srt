1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:07,910

2
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,170
 The Crowned Clown

3
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,870
 The characters, organizations, locations, and events in this drama are fictional and have no relation to historical facts.

4
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,830
"This punk," say it.

5
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,020
This punk.

6
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,180
This punk! Are you not going to play properly?!

7
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,200
This punk! Are you not going to play properly?!

8
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,910
 Episode 2

9
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,450
You cannot leave the palace like this, Your Majesty.

10
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,680
I've found a substitute for myself. Why can't I go?

11
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,820
We don't know yet whether he'll be a shield that protects you

12
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,490
or a sword that hurts you.

13
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:50,390
We need to thoroughly prepare him to substitute for you.

14
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,300
Otherwise, it may cause huge problems.

15
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,950
Everything that low bastard has to do has already been set.

16
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,070
Either be stabbed by a sword for me or die from poison.

17
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,330
What do you mean we need to prepare for such things?

18
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,700
If you understand, proceed with it.

19
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,390
Is it that hard for you to endure?

20
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,370
I couldn't sleep for a minute the last couple of days.

21
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,350
It feels like there are people hiding in every direction, aiming to take my life.

22
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,000
If this continues...

23
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,160
I might get blood on my hands again.

24
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,610
I understand.

25
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:46,110
If that is your command, I will do so.

26
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,530
What? Me as the king's substitute? What do you mean—

27
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,800
Be quiet.

28
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,750
I can't do it. I will not do it. Who am I to—

29
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,320
This is the king's order. Do you think you can just say no?

30
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,710
My Lord just beat me and kick me out of the palace.

31
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,960
If you don't accept this, including you,

32
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,330
your sister and that man you call "Ahjussi" will be dragged here.

33
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,830
You all will feel the wrath of the king.

34
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,850
Are you threatening me right now?

35
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,740
It doesn't matter. I've performed until now with my life on the line.

36
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,330
Do as you please.

37
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,740
It won't take long. It will only take a couple of days.

38
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,910
If I go missing like this,

39
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,670
my Dal Rae will be worried.

40
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,830
I will give you enough wealth

41
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,310
so that you won't worry about eating for the rest of your life.

42
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,090
I shouldn't be like this.

43
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,380
Really.

44
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,930
But it's not like I can reject something that's crucial

45
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,990
to national affairs.

46
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,810
They do say that "He who shits eats his shit,"

47
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,000
and I do have some crimes.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,150
I will consider it as my punishment and give it a try.

49
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,090
So what do I have to do?

50
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,900
Eunuch Jo is the head eunuch.

51
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,780
He waits on the king.

52
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,810
Yes.

53
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,590
What do you think is the biggest problem here?

54
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,760
His coarse speaking manner and attitude.

55
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,340
I think we'll need to fix them first.

56
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,560
We haven't even started yet.

57
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,240
Please speak informally to me.

58
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,580
If I speak informally to you, we might get caught.

59
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,050
It's better to use honorifics like now for both of us.

60
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,770
You... Just like His Majesty did,

61
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,410
please speak informally to me.

62
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,300
I feel assured.

63
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:39,060
I told you to speak informally not act informally.

64
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,690
I will give you a review of the King's daily routines.

65
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,170
You just need to follow as it is.

66
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,060
 The King's day begins before sunrise.

67
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:12,280
 Your Majesty, have you awoken?

68
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,750
Your Majesty.

69
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,490
 Your Majesty.

70
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,460
Yes.

71
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,530
Please blow your nose.

72
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,860
Your Majesty, congratulations.

73
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,410
 After washing your face, Lady Kim will assist you with dressing.

74
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,110
 Lady Kim is an attendant who serves the king from an extremely close distance.

75
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,340
 If you are to be the king's substitute,

76
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,160
 you need to deceive Lady Kim first.

77
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,080
Your Majesty, is there something bothering you?

78
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,070
No.

79
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,830
Continue.

80
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,990
 Regarding the side dishes... You never eat the same one twice.

81
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,790
 This is because of the fear that someone may poison the king's favorite dishes.

82
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,510
 Poison?

83
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,770
 It's a precedent that's been set since the previous king.

84
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,530
 You don't need to worry much.

85
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,750
Forgive me, Your Majesty!

86
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,250
It's fine.

87
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,760
You didn't spill a drop. You don't need to worry.

88
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,370
The water tastes good.

89
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,980
Block and...

90
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,300
You are...

91
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,710
It's great to see you here.

92
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,780
Can't believe you got me.

93
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:09,120
I think I've done quite well. What do you think?

94
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,710
I think you should be more cautious.

95
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,930
Frequently? What do you want me to do more frequently?

96
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,160
No, I mean...

97
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,510
Offering your hand. Revealing your real feelings. Smiling.

98
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,200
You shouldn't do any of that.

99
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,580
So you are telling me to do nothing?

100
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,380
Yes.

101
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,530
Y-Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

102
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,960
Who is that lady?

103
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,720
She's the queen.

104
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:33,180
- What did you just say? 
 - I said she's the queen.

105
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:38,830
Th-The queen? Her Highness?

106
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,710
You should not cross paths with the ladies of the court, especially the queen.

107
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,080
You must avoid her.

108
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,930
Your Highness, over there.

109
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,690
Your Majesty, the queen is making her way over.

110
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,610
What?!

111
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:38,380

112
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,520
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

113
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,910
Your Majesty!

114
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,420
 Although His Majesty does skip out on the morning meetings quite often,

115
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,720
 he would never skip out on the questioning and political affair sessions with his officials.

116
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,590
In the field of law, there are no proper provisions.

117
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,490
We are unable to consider its relative importance.

118
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,430
If we choose someone with a liberal arts background,

119
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,600
the punishments will become fair and just.

120
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:32,570
Yes, I understood nicely. Let the next one in.

121
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,820
Your Majesty, did you rest well last night?

122
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,420
Because of you, I slept well. What news do you have?

123
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,390
Yes, that's a great relief.

124
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:20,490
I had heard that Your Majesty had become restless over recent events regarding Lord Moon Seong.

125
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,950
After the fact, I could not sleep all night.

126
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,350
Then, have you decided on the punishment

127
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,950
for Lord Moon Seong?

128
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,950
The thing is, with that...

129
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:42,000
When it comes to Lord Moon Seong's punishment...

130
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,250
Your Majesty, you must behead Lord Moon Seong and make an example out of him.

131
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,750
That way, the worries of all the citizens will disappear.

132
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,010
Please allow this.

133
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,610
 If someone asks you to allow something to happen,

134
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,830
 you can reply with, "Do so."

135
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,430
- Do so.
 - Pardon?

136
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,400
Ah, yes. Then I'll

137
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,270
believe that you've agreed

138
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,570
and will leave you.

139
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,230
Yes.

140
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,160
I thought I was going to be found out.

141
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,280
Who is that person?

142
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,740
That is the left state minister!

143
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,990
The left state minister, huh?

144
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:46,780
But who is Lord Moon Seong?

145
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,070
The thing is... He's—

146
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,750
Your Highness! Your Highness! There's been a huge occurrence!

147
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,450
What's the matter?

148
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,510
His Majesty has

149
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,590
agreed to the beheading of his father-in-law!

150
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,590
Please tell His Majesty I wish to have an audience with him.

151
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,790
Your Highness, I apologize but—

152
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:25,170
His Majesty has already eaten.

153
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,800
Please return later.

154
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,490
Your Majesty!

155
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,230
Your Highness, you cannot do this.

156
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,160
How insulting. How dare you block my path?

157
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:56,830
Your Majesty, the queen is entering.

158
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,590
Your Majesty.

159
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,840
My Queen.

160
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,840
I will die to prove my father's innocence.

161
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,510
What do you think you're doing?!

162
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,800
When you allowed my father to be beheaded,

163
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,480
did you not predict that I would react like this?

164
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,430
Let me go!

165
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,250
Alright, hold on!

166
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,820
My— My Queen!

167
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,100
Death is my only option now.

168
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,100
But why won't you even allow me to die?

169
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,530
What can I do for you to give up on dying?

170
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,650
I only have one request.

171
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,360
Please save my father.

172
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,840
I understand! I'll do that.

173
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,290
Are you being sincere?

174
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,800
I wouldn't lie in regards to someone's life.

175
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,300
Then... You must promise me.

176
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,140
You must promise me first that you won't do anything like this ever again.

177
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,480
I promise.

178
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,610
Good.

179
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,850
I will promise as well.

180
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,880
I will keep this.

181
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,320
Is this place

182
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,490
a stage for a clown?!

183
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,170
Do you know what you've done?!

184
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:07,000
Are you dodging me? You fool!

185
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,420
You punk!

186
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,880
- Come here.
 - Please calm down.

187
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,220
Hey, you punk!

188
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,160
- Oh, Eunuch Jo, grab a hold of him.
 - What?

189
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,350
I feel wronged. You told me to say "do so" if someone asked me to allow for something.

190
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,900
Who's the one who told me I should reply this way?

191
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:06,250
The left state minister suddenly came in, so I couldn't do anything.

192
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,430
He sounded so loyal, so—

193
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,580
The individual you must be most wary of in this palace

194
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,660
is none other than the left state minister, Sin Chi Soo.

195
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,300
He is the most wicked person in this country.

196
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,820
Then didn't I do the right thing?

197
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,720
- This punk, really!
 - Well, anyway!

198
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,670
We must save the king's father-in-law.

199
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:30,340
I promised the queen this.

200
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,370
When it comes to the king's father-in-law's affairs, it's not for you to get involved in.

201
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,570
- However—
 - You must stop.

202
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,000
So that nothing like this will ever occur again,

203
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,910
please watch over him more carefully.

204
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,350
It might have been better to use a wooden pole

205
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:08,340
in his place.

206
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,050
Ae Young.

207
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,650
I'm looking over the situation currently,

208
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,960
so don't say anything else.

209
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,390
Don't get angry.

210
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,340
It was the only thing I could do.

211
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,840
How could I not know how you were feeling?

212
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,190
But still, how could you?

213
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:45,780
If His Majesty hadn't stopped you, what would have happened?

214
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:50,770
I also did not know this was how His Majesty would react.

215
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:55,080
Do you think His Majesty will follow through on his promise?

216
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,580
Who knows when his mind will change again?

217
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,670
Although

218
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,310
I was reminded of a past event after meeting His Majesty today.

219
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,180
When I first entered the palace, everything seemed foreign to me.

220
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,340
I was crying.

221
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,280
Without asking for a reason

222
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,310
or scolding me,

223
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,220
 So Woon.

224
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:41,530
he just held my hand.

225
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:44,310
That's what I was reminded of.

226
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:27,840
Emptiness is form. 
 (Heart Sūtra)

227
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,320
Emptiness of character neither arise nor cease.

228
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,850
Have you arrived?

229
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,900
Where is he?

230
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,020
He was looking for something that we didn't have at our temple, so I drove him out to the hermitage.

231
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,580
Your Majesty, what should we do?

232
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,780
What did you say?

233
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,200
In regards to your father-in-law.

234
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,340
The left state minister has requested his beheading.

235
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,600
The left state minister is someone who would have requested that and more.

236
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,180
How could he lose an opportunity to

237
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,970
lose the thorn in his eye?

238
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,620
Please make your decision.

239
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,590
I will approve.

240
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,050
Execute my father-in-law.

241
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:52,150
The queen will look at me just like you are now, won't she?

242
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,980
Glaring at me so, that my heart may rip out.

243
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,990
Would she resent me?

244
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,370
You are dismissed.

245
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,900
This is the king's order.

246
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:42,820
 (Looking at it upside down.)

247
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,040
What is it saying?

248
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:55,560
I can't really read Chinese characters.

249
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,980
I will tell you,

250
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,050
so just memorize it.

251
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,350
"Remove the criminal Yoo Ho Joon from his position."

252
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:07,480
Remove the criminal Yoo Ho Joon from his position.

253
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,750
"And execute him."

254
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,500
Execute him?

255
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,270
Then, what about the promise I made with the queen?

256
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:25,510
You make a promise when you have the power to keep it.

257
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:29,910
How can someone who knows nothing and blabbers on have that kind of power?

258
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:34,500
If you want to leave here alive, then keep this in mind.

259
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,250
There are only two ways to survive in the palace.

260
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,610
Either you step on people and crush them to death or

261
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:44,150
you completely turn away and ignore them.

262
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:54,190
"Remove the criminal Yoo Ho Joon from his position and execute him."

263
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,260
Don't forget.

264
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,450
I...

265
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,190
Alright.

266
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,870
Your Majesty.

267
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,760
Please make a decision about the criminal Yoo Ho Joon.

268
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,910
 (Still upside down.)

269
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,900
Remove the criminal Yoo Ho Joon

270
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,980
from his position.

271
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,440
 Criminal Yoo Ho Joon to be stripped of his official position.

272
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:24,660
Send him into exile, under house arrest surrounded by thorns.

273
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,290
 Surround with thorns: create a wall of thorns to prevent a banished offender from escaping exile.

274
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:45,460
Why do you think His Majesty changed his mind?

275
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:51,120
He must have found something that made him consider that it wasn't just treason.

276
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,760
Left State Minister.

277
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:30,030
Alright. I don't know what you told His Majesty to change his mind,

278
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,940
but you will regret it someday.

279
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,310
People regret what they did in the morning at night. That's life.

280
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:41,440
We should accept the things that should be accepted. Don't you agree?

281
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:47,780
Right. That's life.

282
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:57,030

283
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,820
What do you mean he let his father-in-law live?

284
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,690
Isn't our plan to get rid of Sin Chi Soo going in the wrong direction?

285
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:09,990
This might actually be better for us.

286
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,260
What do you mean?

287
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:17,090
The king letting his father-in-law live also means that he doesn't believe Sin Chi Soo.

288
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:22,090
Do you think Sin Chi Soo will keep his head down? They will soon fight among themselves.

289
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,540
They will fight among themselves.

290
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,320
Even the dogs on the street can say such things.

291
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,230
Don't test my patience.

292
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:37,280
If you don't have a clear plan to seize the throne,

293
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,630
just tell me now.

294
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:42,380
I apologize for worrying you.

295
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:49,920
I have a clear plan, so please trust me.

296
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:56,260
What are you doing? Serve Prince Jin Pyeong tea already.

297
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:10,140
 Your Majesty, Chief Royal Secretary requests to see you.

298
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,810
Lord...

299
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,310
You wicked boy!

300
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:38,930
How dare you lay down a royal command and deceive the court.

301
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,630
Do you want to die?

302
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,580
Then what can I do?

303
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,710
I made a promise.

304
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,990
You said you were illiterate. How did you know the term "surrounded by thorns?"

305
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:23,640
He asked me what the next best punishment after execution was.

306
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,610
I thought he was simply curious.

307
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,900
I will make sure this doesn't happen in the future.

308
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,720
Wait.

309
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:46,470
If this happens again, your position will not be in the king's palace

310
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,860
but in a bathroom.

311
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:45,250
When is the queen's father leaving for exile?

312
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,090
The verdict is out, so he will be leaving tomorrow.

313
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,450
Why are you asking?

314
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,160
Well...

315
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,090
Her father is going far away,

316
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:04,430
I thought she should see him off at least.

317
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,930
Are you talking about Her Highness?

318
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,680
Isn't that what you noblemen like? Duty?

319
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,320
A daughter seeing her father off.

320
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:20,640
Once a lady enters the palace, she cannot leave unless she dies.

321
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,880
That is a law of the palace, and the king's women need to follow it too.

322
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,190
But doesn't filial piety come before the palace rules?

323
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,940
Did Eunuch Jo tell you that too?

324
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,710
No, I overheard it somewhere.

325
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:43,060
I apologize. I just wanted to ask you.

326
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:49,100
Okay. I will escort Her Highness myself.

327
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,100
Are you serious?

328
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,040
Father.

329
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,730
Father.

330
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,180
Your Highness.

331
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:32,880
No, Father. Please.

332
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,180
It pained me to think  I wouldn't be able to see you before I leave.

333
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:43,160
I am so happy to see you, even if it's like this.

334
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,010
I am so happy to see you, too.

335
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:52,640
Don't cry, So Woon.

336
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:59,060
I'm able to walk on my two feet. It's all because of His Majesty's grace.

337
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,120
Father...

338
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,500
My lord.

339
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:15,900
These... Her Highness made them herself.

340
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,770
Thank you.

341
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:33,670
I will wear them well.

342
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:39,030
Father, please be well.

343
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:42,360
Don't you worry about me.

344
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,430
Until the day you come back safely,

345
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,760
I will serve His Majesty well.

346
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:06,750
Your Majesty's grace is boundless.

347
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:11,070
Until I see you again,

348
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,200
please be well.

349
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,790
Thank you.

350
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:40,240
Thanks to you, I was able to send my father off.

351
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:44,050
I apologize, Your Highness.

352
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:49,070
I just followed His Majesty's orders. That's all.

353
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:51,300
His Majesty?

354
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:04,620
Your Majesty, we have brought a late night refreshment.

355
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,550
 Let her in.

356
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:33,600
Yes, I felt really good today.

357
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:38,190
What's your name? How old are you?

358
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:41,610
My name is Gae Hwan.

359
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:44,060
I'm fifteen years old.

360
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,200
It's exactly the same.

361
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,810
Excuse me?

362
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,250
It's nothing!

363
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,140
What's tonight's snack?

364
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:00,640
It's a porridge, Your Majesty.

365
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,160
What's that sound?

366
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,540
I'm so sorry, Your Majesty!

367
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,060
Have you skipped your meals?

368
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,190
That...

369
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:17,260
It's because Your Majesty had eaten your breakfast so well.

370
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:20,830
We tasters, take the leftovers from His Majesty's breakfast table,

371
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:24,080
as our dinner so...

372
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:31,720
Taste this for me.

373
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

374
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,780
Wait!

375
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:45,780
If you eat so quickly, you'll burn the roof of your mouth, so eat it slowly while cooling it off.

376
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,450
Of course, Your Majesty.

377
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:03,930
Try it again.

378
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,410
How does it taste?

379
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:20,590
It's good.

380
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,640
Keep eating it.

381
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

382
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:37,490
 Is Dal Rae eating well, too?

383
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:44,570
Please, save my brother. Please!

384
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:47,680
Don't worry, Dal Rae.

385
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:51,640
Your brother was not taken away by the authorities.

386
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:56,000
If it wasn't to the authorities, where was he taken?

387
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:04,600
Is he already dead?

388
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,090
Why are you saying useless things? What do you mean he's dead?

389
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:12,220
Stop this. I don't think Woon Sim knows either.

390
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:17,340
Oh my, oh my! My brother!

391
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,460
Brother!

392
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:25,800
What do I do about my brother?

393
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:33,960
How noisy! It's driving all of our clients away! Stop it right now!

394
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,530
Brother...

395
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:37,090
This wench!

396
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:39,500
Ah, mistress. Please!

397
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,710
She's going to cry herself out soon, so don't worry.

398
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:46,260
Make her stop immediately, or else I'll beat her until she leaves.

399
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:50,460
Ah, of course. Of course. Also, when I was here earlier in the day,

400
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:55,860
I saw that the trees had all been knocked down. I'll take care of all that tomorrow.

401
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,530
Dal Rae, don't cry, okay?

402
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,850
I'll look for news about Ha Seon, so stop crying.

403
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:06,720
You're being serious, right?

404
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,310
Of course.

405
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:32,270
You're here, sir?

406
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:34,220
Who is that girl?

407
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:40,930
That girl's name is Dal Rae and she works for the entertainers.

408
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:44,470
Whatever she is, isn't she here?

409
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:48,140
I apologize, but she is not a part of the brothel.

410
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,260
So that child is off limits?

411
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,560
Then I'll return another time.

412
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,470
What are you doing, dallying around?! Bring my horse over!

413
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:22,870
Young Master, should I bring Dal Rae over?

414
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:24,420
This guy...

415
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,390
Well, if you pay a decent price,

416
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:30,550
I'll bring her over to your house.

417
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:46,740
I will bring her over soon.

418
00:47:53,070 --> 00:48:01,580

419
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:22,550
Your Majesty, what are you going to use those hazelnuts for?

420
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:29,500
I have a little sister named Dal Rae. I want to give them to her as a present.

421
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:34,170
If you had given me the order, I would've packed much better ones.

422
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:37,220
Why would you—

423
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:44,110
These are also really precious items of the palace that the king eats.

424
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:46,030
These are fine.

425
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:56,360
What's over that way?

426
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:02,540
Oh, that over there is the back gate where the palace servants come in and out.

427
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,850
The back gate?

428
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:14,290
What's over that way?

429
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:16,240
Your Majesty!

430
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,010
Why have they all gathered in that location?

431
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:47,460
That is where the palace servants make a wish.

432
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:50,590
- A wish?
 - Yes.

433
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:54,890
A long time ago, a palace maid of the king's palace, who serviced him in bed,

434
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:57,270
wished for a son to be born

435
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:00,390
and threw a rock. Legends say that

436
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:03,030
she conceived a son afterward.

437
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:13,170
But why wouldn't the queen ask for a wish there?

438
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:15,780
She has to uphold her dignity as the queen.

439
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:20,620
How could she ask for wishes along with the lowly palace servants?

440
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:27,980
Wait a moment.

441
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,010
My queen, His Majesty is here.

442
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:53,020
Your Majesty.

443
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,710
It looks like I've interrupted you, my queen.

444
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:03,570
No, you haven't. I was on my way to see you as well, Your Majesty.

445
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:06,290
Me?

446
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:12,670
Yes, thanks to you, I was able to send my father off.

447
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:15,800
What? That's—

448
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,480
You don't need to thank me.

449
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,640
Hold out your hand.

450
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,460
Aren't these hazelnuts from the hazel tree?

451
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,770
Even if you want to ask for a wish,

452
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:07,670
you have to uphold your dignity as the queen. Isn't that difficult?

453
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:14,440
If you bite into the nut of the hazel tree, the goblin that protects homes will be alarmed at the sound.

454
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,450
And legend says that it'll grant your wish afterward.

455
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:23,230
When you're alone, bite into it lightly and make your wish.

456
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:26,370
Who knows? Maybe your wish will come true.

457
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:23,630
 Seonpyeong Gate: the main entrance to Queen So Woon's abode.

458
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:40,630
These are His Majesty's late night refreshments tonight.

459
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:45,470
You can bring them to him just like this when the time comes.

460
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:47,650
Yes, Madam.

461
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:28,380
Your Majesty, today you'll be having a sweet rice dessert and cinnamon punch.

462
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:31,460
Alright.

463
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:38,190
Gae Hwan, how did you come to be a palace servant?

464
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:40,150
That...

465
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:47,480
I apologize, but it was because my father could not pay his taxes.

466
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,020
His taxes?

467
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:53,290
What does that have to do with the reason why you entered the palace?

468
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,520
Tell me slowly.

469
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,560
Is that the truth?

470
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,200
You know where my brother is?

471
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:06,100
That's what I'm saying. Come with me. I'll take you there.

472
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:10,440
Wait, can't you wait for a little bit?

473
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,750
Ahjussi has gone into the mountain for some lumber and hasn't returned yet.

474
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:18,020
If you don't want to, then don't! I took time out so that I could take you there but—

475
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,850
No!

476
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:27,430
Let's go. Lead the way.

477
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:38,480
Oh my.

478
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,410
What's taking him so long?

479
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,210
Brother?

480
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:16,430
Who are you?

481
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:45,350
Brother...

482
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:47,330
But we were in a mountain village.

483
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:52,180
How could we find enough abalones that are found in the sea?

484
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,910
But because of the pressure the magistrate put on him,

485
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:58,640
my father had to borrow money

486
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,340
to purchase the abalones to offer to him.

487
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:03,160
These kinds of incidents kept on happening,

488
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:06,880
and he couldn't borrow any more money.

489
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,560
And eventually, he ended up selling me off to become a palace servant.

490
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,640
You seem to have suffered a lot.

491
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,290
I don't blame my father.

492
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:18,600
Starting with my brother who's a year younger than me

493
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,820
to an infant relying on milk. He has six children to look after.

494
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:24,270
Since there's one less mouth to feed,

495
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:29,400
and I helped out in paying off my father's debt. I think that's enough to be thankful for.

496
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,130
You think of it that way.

497
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:34,450
How great of you.

498
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,270
To say such things to Your Majesty,

499
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:47,580
I think I was out of my mind.

500
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,150
The person who is out of their mind isn't you, Gae Hwan.

501
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:53,230
It's those officials that were put in charge!

502
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:56,630
How dare they feed on the suffering of our citizens!

503
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:59,560
They're worse than pests!

504
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:06,500
Eat them.

505
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,870
Ah, how could I?

506
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:11,280
No, that's not it. When I see you, you remind me of my younger sis—

507
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,720
What? A younger sister?

508
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:18,650
Sis... see, as I was saying...

509
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:21,680
Tasty food is not as good unless you share.

510
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,900
I can eat this whenever I want, so you can eat all of these.

511
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,440
Your Majesty.

512
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,820
Be strong.

513
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:46,370
Don't eat quickly and get indigestion. Chew thoroughly.

514
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:06,120
What's going on?

515
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:13,320
I told you to eat slowly.

516
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,380
I'm sorry.

517
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:37,540
Is there— Is there anyone out there?

518
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:40,160
Eunuch Jo! Eunuch Jo!

519
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:49,640
Your Majesty!

520
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,390
Call the royal physician! Immediately!

521
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:53,240
Yes, Your Majesty!

522
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,150
Gae Hwan! Gae Hwan!

523
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:59,120
Gae Hwan! Gae Hwan!

524
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:27,910
Physician!

525
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:29,980
Where is the royal physician?!

526
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:31,690
Physician!

527
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:37,200
Your Majesty! What happened?

528
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,920
Please, save this child immediately.

529
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:57,980
Your Majesty, I'm sorry, but it's too late.

530
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:01,350
Too late? What do you mean?

531
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:04,770
She has stopped breathing.

532
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:08,750
There's no way!

533
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:14,300
She was just talking and laughing with me! How?!

534
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:16,760
Examine, examine her again!

535
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,850
Examine her thoroughly!

536
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,540
Gae Hwan. Gae Hwan!

537
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:30,300
Get up, okay?

538
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,050
Gae Hwan!

539
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:49,090
Your Majesty.

540
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:04,570
My lord, that is—

541
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:06,560
Stay quiet.

542
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:19,390
Leave with His Majesty. Don't leave him alone.

543
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:21,440
I understand.

544
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:32,000
Your Majesty, please get up.

545
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:04,140
What do you think happened?

546
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:07,330
I'd have to examine her carefully to know, but

547
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:11,810
from what I can tell, it seems to be poison.

548
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:27,340

549
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:37,890
Don't ever have the same dish twice.

550
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:43,520
Someone can poison dishes that the king enjoys.

551
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,100
 I can have this at any time,

552
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:54,920
 so eat all of this.

553
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:39,170
- Your Majesty.
 - Don't touch me!

554
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:42,870
But, Your Majesty, how can you remain like this?

555
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:44,450
Please at least change your clothing.

556
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:46,620
Leave immediately!

557
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,590
Everyone, get out!

558
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:17,220
My queen, my queen!

559
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:22,680
Why are you causing chaos in front of the queen?

560
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,890
I'm so sorry, Your Highness.

561
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:27,390
What's going on?

562
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:31,420
That...

563
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,790
Why have you arrived just now?

564
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:46,040
Go inside quickly.

565
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:51,790
Until you have my command, don't let anyone inside.

566
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:53,880
Yes, sir.

567
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,760
This is why you needed me!

568
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:21,550
So that I could die in the place of the king! Am I wrong?

569
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:22,690
Calm down.

570
01:06:22,690 --> 01:06:24,890
Please let me out immediately.

571
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:28,000
No, I'll leave with my own two feet!

572
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,840
If you leave now, I'll have no choice but to kill you.

573
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:46,590
Whether I die one way or another, the end result is the same. Just kill me now.

574
01:06:46,590 --> 01:06:51,990
If you die, your younger sister and the old man

575
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:54,640
won't be safe either.

576
01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:58,390
Do you want that?

577
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,790
You decide. What will you do?

578
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:15,940
Your Majesty, the queen requests an audience.

579
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:19,190
Let her in!

580
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:22,490
His Majesty has allowed you to enter.

581
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:43,800
You've arrived, Your Highness.

582
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:01,300
Queen.

583
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:03,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

584
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:07,010
I'm sorry.

585
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:19,210
Are you insane?

586
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:22,320
The queen is in there. How could you?

587
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:29,020
Your Majesty, I'm coming in.

588
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,310
Your Highness.

589
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:46,550
Your Highness!

590
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:58,210
 I can't stay in the palace anymore.

591
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:04,830
 Your Majesty, please calm down.

592
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:07,150
 I can't do this anymore.

593
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:11,250
 I must... I must leave right now.

594
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:14,700
 Your Majesty.

595
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:24,440
 When you were the crown prince, you told me this.

596
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:28,750
 That you feel like you could do anything as long as I'm by your side.

597
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:30,570
 Until the day our world ends,

598
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:35,710
 don't let go of the hand you're holding, laugh together, cry together,

599
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:39,330
 and live our whole lives as best friends.

600
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,520
 You asked why I'm here tonight.

601
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,050
 I'm here to be with you, Your Majesty.

602
01:12:58,050 --> 01:13:02,010
 I'm here to laugh with you

603
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:04,340
 and cry with you.

604
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:07,680
 I'll stay and endure with you, Your Majesty,

605
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,770
 so please don't give up.

606
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,200
 I can't do this.

607
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:16,790
Before this gets out of hand, we need to find His Majesty.

608
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:17,780
Hurry!

609
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:19,590
Yes!

610
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:24,510
Just in case, search the palace's outer perimeter.

611
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:26,530
Yes, Lord.

612
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,870
You can't come in!

613
01:14:49,870 --> 01:14:52,770
Dal Rae! Ahjussi! Wait!

614
01:14:52,770 --> 01:14:54,020
- Don't move!
 - No!

615
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:56,850
Ahjussi!

616
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:00,470
Hey, it's me! It's me!

617
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:02,670
It's me, Ha Seon!

618
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:04,780
Let him go.

619
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:09,670
Ha Seon!

620
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:12,630
This punk!

621
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:15,770
Where did you go, that you are only back now?

622
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:20,190
Where's Dal Rae?

623
01:15:20,190 --> 01:15:24,840
You bastard!

624
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:29,640
How can you come looking for Dal Rae now?

625
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:34,080
Do you know how long Dal Rae waited for you?

626
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,200
Dal Rae! Dal Rae?

627
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,880
Dal Rae!

628
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,850
Dal Rae.

629
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:04,970
Alright.

630
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:13,110
Hey, Dal Rae.

631
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:16,170
What is this?

632
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,120
Who did this?

633
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:25,270
It'll be okay. Tell me.

634
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:27,220
Who did this?

635
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:30,330
Why is she like this?

636
01:16:30,330 --> 01:16:32,510
Say something.

637
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:37,240
She must be too shocked to speak.

638
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:42,470
Some man came by and persuaded her to go with him, saying you were looking for her.

639
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:47,160
He took her to a man who frequents brothels.

640
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:53,350
She resisted, so he...

641
01:16:55,700 --> 01:17:00,280
I'm the one who deserves to die.

642
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:04,530
Since you were not here, I should've been watching out for her.

643
01:17:04,530 --> 01:17:06,860
I'm the one who deserves to die.

644
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,500
What...

645
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:16,500
What...

646
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:21,300
Dal Rae...

647
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,450
I'm sorry.

648
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,830
Dal Rae...

649
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:48,410
Dal Rae...

650
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,940
Who is the dirty bastard?

651
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:05,770
He's not someone you can do anything about.

652
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:09,630
Don't say anything stupid and just tell me his name!

653
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:13,180
Sin Yi Gyeom.

654
01:18:13,810 --> 01:18:19,180
He's the son of Lord Sin Chi Soo, who has just been appointed left state minister.

655
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:37,630
Ha Seon!

656
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:40,180
What are you going to do?!

657
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:46,790
 Dragon Tiger Gate

658
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:51,260
No!

659
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,780
What's going on?

660
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:02,500
Who is Sin Yi Gyeom?

661
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:04,220
Sin Yi Gyeom!

662
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:06,330
What is going on?

663
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:15,480
What is going on?

664
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:19,460
Lord, please save me.

665
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:22,610
Is he someone you know?

666
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:26,100
Yes. He works for a brothel.

667
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:31,740
I told you so many times. Who is it this time?

668
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:34,390
She's not even from the brothel.

669
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:36,770
A clown troupe.

670
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:42,800
I was wondering about those masks.

671
01:19:43,810 --> 01:19:45,890
- Hey, foreman.
 - Yes?

672
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:48,060
How much was that b*tch worth?

673
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:50,890
She won't be more than two nyang.

674
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:52,570
Give him two nyang, and send him on his way.

675
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:54,340
Yes.

676
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:57,280
How dare you?!

677
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:10,110
My sister is not a dog!

678
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:15,220
You little piece of sh*t!

679
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:18,180
Piece of scum!

680
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:21,220
Punk! Do you know where this is?

681
01:20:21,810 --> 01:20:22,720
Take that!

682
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:26,110
Got it?

683
01:20:26,110 --> 01:20:27,990
Stop!

684
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:38,220
You should know that you've been spared by His Excellency's mercy.

685
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:14,010
Did Ha Seon stop by here?

686
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:18,470
You're the one who took him, so why are you asking me now?

687
01:21:18,470 --> 01:21:20,730
Is he here or not?

688
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:26,110
I have not seen him since you took him away.

689
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:30,440
If he ever shows up, make sure you keep him, understand?

690
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:32,570
I will do that.

691
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:11,380
Chief Royal Secretary.

692
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:17,080
His Majesty has returned.

693
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:53,840
Your Majesty, you're here

694
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,280
without notice?

695
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:37,500
You said there are only two ways to survive in the palace, right?

696
01:23:50,610 --> 01:23:54,940
You ran away to survive. Why are you here?

697
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:57,770
I'm here to learn the way.

698
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:02,160
Tell me how to step on people mercilessly

699
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:11,050
and crush them to death.

700
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:26,760
 The Crowned Clown

701
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:35,420

702
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:50,080
 Preview

703
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,140
 Why did you return?

704
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:54,470
 I'm here to return what I have received.

705
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:57,520
 That country-boy has dared to present a condition.

706
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,920
 So what if he has all the powers of a king

707
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:03,170
 when his head is filled with thoughts that are worse than beasts'!

708
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:08,600
 Since when have you been able to shoot arrows that well?

709
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,640
 I was born with it.

710
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:12,610
 Please wait just a bit.

711
01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:16,580
 I'll find a way to rescue you, my queen.
