1
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:14,930

2
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,420
 The Crowned Clown

3
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,190
 The characters, organizations, locations, and events in this drama are fictional and have no relation to historical facts.

4
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,080
 Previously

5
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,080
 It's already been decided, what that lowly one will do.

6
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,940
 He'll be stabbed by a sword or consume poison in my stead.

7
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,950
 I can eat this whenever I want,

8
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,480
 so you can eat all of this.

9
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,660
 Out there? Is there anyone out there?!

10
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,220
 Gae Hwan! Wake up.

11
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,390
 My Queen, I'm sorry.

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,190
 Dal Rae! Dal Rae!

13
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,850
 How much for that dog?

14
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,850
 My sister,

15
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,750
 is not a dog!

16
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,760
Why have you returned after running for your life?

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,350
I came to learn the way.

18
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,830
The way to thoroughly crush them to their dying breaths.

19
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,640
Please teach me that way.

20
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,860
 Episode 3

21
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,010
Useless words.

22
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,670
I'm going to behead you right now, getting rid of all the evidence.

23
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,370
You cannot kill me, my lord, for the sake of His Majesty.

24
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,850
Am I incorrect?

25
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,320
What is it that you truly desire?

26
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,670
Whether I get stabbed by a sword, consume poison, or get completely ripped to shreds...

27
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,140
It doesn't matter.

28
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:36,750
I'll do as you say and become His Majesty's perfect shadow

29
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,450
if you promise me one thing.

30
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:45,810
Using your power as an impersonation of His Majesty, you want to end someone's life?

31
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:51,170
Who is it, the man you wish to kill by putting your life on the line?

32
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:57,020
The Left State Minister's son, Sin Yi Gyeom.

33
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,550
My sister, Dal Rae,

34
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,960
by that bastard who's less than a beast...

35
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,760
She was brutally crushed by him.

36
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,900
I will make him regret ever being born into this world.

37
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,600
I will make him beg for his life as he struggles with the pain of being torn apart.

38
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,600
Decide. Are you going to kill me here and now,

39
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,860
or will you let me die in His Majesty's stead?

40
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,020
Your Majesty.

41
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,530
Eunuch Jo.

42
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,270
It's me.

43
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,310
Let him stay in his quarters for today.

44
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,860
If anyone requests an audience, tell them it's His Majesty's command.

45
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,180
I understand.

46
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,530
Sir.

47
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,720
There's something I must report to you regarding the food taster who was poisoned.

48
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,090
Have you found any clues?

49
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,860
He's rejected seeing anyone, including the court ladies, and will only see Eunuch Jo.

50
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,300
Has the cause of death for the food tester been announced?

51
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,930
Another food tester who shared a room with her

52
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,970
was found hung to death that night.

53
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,340
What?

54
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,280
I think she was taking orders from someone

55
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,260
to put poison into His Majesty's late night refreshments.

56
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,000
They were trying to shut her mouth.

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,460
Do you think it's the queen dowager's doing?

58
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,000
It must have been done by someone with a grudge against His Majesty.

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,840
But... it's times like these when he should need you.

60
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,610
Why has he rejected seeing you?

61
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,370
To be honest, for these past few days, he hasn't been asking for the medicine.

62
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:45,350
No wonder. The reason he let his father-in-law go was because of that!

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,340
Either way, you really mustn't trouble His Majesty.

64
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,810
Don't forget that your duty

65
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,060
is to make His Majesty comfortable.

66
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,110
 Cheongwol (clear moon) Pavilion

67
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,530
Come here.

68
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,190
Come here!

69
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,420
My lord.

70
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:05,280
I heard that Ha Seon's sister left the brothel last night. Do you know where she went?

71
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,140
Why are you interested in that child?

72
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,440
Do you know or not?

73
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,260
She left late at night as if she was escaping.

74
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,410
How should I know where she has gone?

75
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,700
It wouldn't be good for it to be known

76
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,490
that the chief royal secretary who serves His Majesty visits a brothel so early in the day.

77
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,990
What if a dirty rumor were to spread?

78
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:32,630
Seeing how you're avoiding to answer, you know where she is.

79
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,970
Even if I know, I should act like I do not. Even if I do not know, I should act like I do.

80
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,740
You said that's how I would survive.

81
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,600
Did I say something like that?

82
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,010
You said that when the Gil Sam Bong passed away.

83
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,460
Why are you surprised?

84
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,480
You survived by acting as if you did not know, too.

85
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,500
Woon Sim, if your tongue were a sword,

86
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,220
I would already be dead.

87
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,900
 Why are you helping me?

88
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,060
 Because I'm in the same situation as you, Ha Seon.

89
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,600
 I cannot act like I do not know any longer.

90
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,400
 If the chief royal secretary found out, he would not stay put.

91
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,080
 It'd be best if Dal Rae and the man hid away in another place.

92
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,440
 Hour of the tiger (3-5am).

93
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,250
 Hour of the tiger (3-5am).

94
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,790
 Hour of the tiger (3-5am).

95
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,150
 My Dal Rae.

96
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:59,720
 This is killing me.

97
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,170
 Ha Seon,

98
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,800
 do you really have to go?

99
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,900
 Old man...

100
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,580
 Alright. Alright.

101
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,570
 Even I want to crack that noble lord's head and kill him too.

102
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,360
 How horrible this must be for you.

103
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,040
 This is something that warrants curdling his blood and killing him.

104
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,500
 But lowly beings like us...

105
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,100
 Can we actually pick bones and fight with nobles?

106
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,390
 If I do well, I live. If I don't, I die.

107
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,780
 If a clown is picky about making his move,

108
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,300
 that's the same thing as dying.

109
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,800
 Didn't you say that?

110
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,700
 Yes, yes.

111
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,990
 I'm not going  to die. I'll live and come back,

112
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,750
 so don't worry, okay?

113
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,690
 Yeah, yeah, you have to.

114
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:26,020
 People's lives are tough,

115
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,510
 but so are they.

116
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,500
 You're going to get caught.

117
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,530
 Leave quickly.

118
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Yes.

119
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,200
 My.

120
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
 Okay then.

121
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,700
 Ha Seon, be careful, okay?

122
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,800
 Take care of your health, okay?

123
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,330
 Ha Seon.

124
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,700
 Be careful, okay?

125
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,020
Why didn't you just run away when you had the chance?

126
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,170
Why have you come back?

127
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,210
I came to return what I have received.

128
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:48,120
What are you saying?

129
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,650
Until when do you think the chief royal secretary will be gone?

130
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:57,350
Since he's forbidden you from seeing anyone today,

131
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,840
I think it'll be all day.

132
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,230
That country bumpkin dared put a condition?

133
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,030
And you agreed?

134
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:03,840
Your Majesty, in the situation where we don't know who, when, or how

135
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,760
someone will try to harm you,

136
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,110
he is someone who has come, in your place, to be killed.

137
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,810
In order to find the people who are trying to harm you,

138
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,600
don't you think we need him?

139
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:24,310
He broke my command to execute my father-in-law.

140
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:28,120
He exiled him instead, on his own.

141
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,750
How can you be sure that that bastard doesn't have traitorous intentions?

142
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,780
Or is it you

143
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,850
who has traitorous intentions?

144
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,880
Your Majesty, how can you say that?

145
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,340
How could y—

146
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,520
Someone outside could hear you.

147
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,080
If you are talking about the owner of this place, then you don't need to worry about him.

148
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,280
I am not worried about the owner.

149
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,620
Yool.

150
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:06,080
Yool, that bastard, is back.

151
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,360
That bastard tricked me into thinking he's dead, and he is definitely alive.

152
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,670
Where is Court Lady Kim?

153
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,900
Go.

154
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,660
Go and bring me my smoking pipe.

155
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,660
Your Majesty.

156
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,510
We took away his smoking pipe, and he left the temple to look for his medicine.

157
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:00,960
He got lost and we found him collapsed early in the morning and brought him here.

158
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,760
Since then, he kept saying he could hear things.

159
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,850
Since you were a doctor,

160
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,720
surely you can find a way to treat him, right?

161
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,820
Just who is he for you to be so concerned about him?

162
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,480
When Gil Sam Bong passed away

163
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,890
and you were about to die in prison,

164
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,680
he is someone who collected his body

165
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,330
and helped you to escape.

166
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,460
You must be determined to find a cure for him no matter what.

167
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,810
Your Highness.

168
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:52,360
Today, it would be better for you to return.

169
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,620
Does he refuse to see me as well?

170
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,200
I apologize.

171
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,710
Ask His Majesty one more time, please.

172
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,630
Her Highness took special effort to come.

173
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,890
Sir.

174
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,190
Court Lady Park, it's okay.

175
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,340
I entrust him in your care then.

176
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:25,580

177
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,910
My apologies, Queen Dowager.

178
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:40,460
I should've checked more carefully.

179
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,720
How is it your fault that the king does not eat his late night refreshments?

180
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,880
We still have a long way to go. Prepare your heart.

181
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,970
Did you prepare that?

182
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,940
I see you hid your sister well.

183
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,540
It was obvious that you'd take her hostage, so...

184
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,350
how could I just leave her there?

185
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,310
Did His Majesty agree?

186
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,610
What do I need to do from now on?

187
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,940
We must find those who are trying to kill His Majesty.

188
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,370
If it's finding the people who killed Gye Hwan, then that's what I want, too.

189
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,640
Who shall we get first?

190
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:06,450
Tomorrow after your breakfast, go visit the queen dowager.

191
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,960
When you say the queen dowager...

192
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,700
She is the previous king's wife and the eldest ranking person in the palace.

193
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:18,230
She also has the authority to appoint the next ruler in case of the current king's death.

194
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,300
 Seonpyeong Gate

195
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:31,310
 It doesn't matter what you do, but make sure you turn her palace upside down.

196
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,320
 Sujeong Hall (Queen Dowager's Palace)

197
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,990
 The king is here!

198
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,700
Your Majesty.

199
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,120
My Queen.

200
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,170
Since His Majesty is here, we'll go in together. Go and announce us.

201
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:14,270
Queen Dowager, the king and the queen are here to see you!

202
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,300
 Let them in.

203
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,080
It's been a long time since your last visit.

204
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,340
It seems like it's been two years.

205
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,670
You look much better than before.

206
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:44,320
Thank you for taking it like that.

207
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,110
Serve tea to the king and queen.

208
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,590
Yes.

209
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,860
Why aren't you drinking it?

210
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,190
Are you worried it might be poisoned?

211
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,540
I feel better since you've said that first.

212
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,070
May I order to have it tasted for poison?

213
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:45,280
It seems you've been quite shocked since the taster died.

214
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,900
You are taking my joke too seriously.

215
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:54,320
Queen, what should I do?

216
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,980
Then I'll drink it first.

217
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,410
Hot!

218
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,890
What are you doing?!

219
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:14,740
It could be poisoned! It hasn't even been tested. How could I let the queen drink it first?

220
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,270
Your Majesty.

221
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,810
Do you really suspect me?

222
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,840
If I shouldn't be, then tell me so.

223
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,130
In this country, being unfilial is a bigger crime than treason.

224
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:30,700
I turned a blind eye on all of your crimes until now because I was trying to fulfill my motherly duty.

225
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,240
I can understand you ignoring my feelings,

226
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,060
but I can't take you suspecting me of trying to poison you!

227
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,860
Answer me, Queen. Am I wrong?

228
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,600
It's understandable that you are upset.

229
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,260
It's my fault that I caused friction between you two. I will take responsibility.

230
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,860
Please blame me, and lighten your heart.

231
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,740
Your words are quite cunning!

232
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:04,770
You are pretending you are on my side, but you are hoping that I won't blame the king.

233
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,720
I am sorry if you understood it to be so.

234
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,580
I am sorry. I apologize. Forgive me.

235
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,790
Are those words all you know?

236
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,960
You keep repeating yourself every time.

237
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,360
I can't listen to you anymore because it makes me want to puke!

238
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,360
Tell me how you really feel!

239
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,550
Do you even think of me as a mother or—

240
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,540
Stop it!

241
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,700
- What did you just say? 
- I said stop it.

242
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,590
Your Majesty, please don't.

243
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:37,180
If I don't stop, then what? Will you strike my neck—

244
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,180
Let's go, Queen.

245
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,760
Your Majesty.

246
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,650
Kill me before you leave! Your Majesty!

247
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,800
Your Majesty!

248
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:30,950
Your Majesty, why didn't you hold it in till the end?

249
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,690
She was blatantly being rude to you.

250
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,320
She made me so angry that I couldn't hear it any longer.

251
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,770
Then, are you saying you did that for my sake?

252
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,160
That's right.

253
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,040
Then, I'll be clear.

254
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,190
If it's really for my sake, don't ever do that again.

255
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,960
Are you asking me to not do anything even if you are mistreated worse than that?

256
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,730
What better excuse than this for those who want to harm you?

257
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:05,480
If this gets out, you'll be bombarded with petitions to treat the queen dowager properly.

258
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,980
I don't want you to deal with that kind of criticism.

259
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:18,110
Instead, do as you've done before. Send someone else and do not step foot in the queen dowager's palace again.

260
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:22,440
I will go and serve the queen dowager in your place.

261
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,280
Then I will be on my way.

262
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:51,190

263
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,830
Why do you look like you've lost the world?

264
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,190
It must be because I used up all my energy at the queen dowager's palace earlier.

265
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,840
I see. How did she react?

266
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,150
It was exactly like you expected.

267
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,840
When I acted like I was crazy and suspected her of poison,

268
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,730
she got even more upset and made such an uproar.

269
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,820
I flipped the table over and left.

270
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,230
Good.

271
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,610
Was that really good?

272
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,160
What do you mean?

273
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,530
The queen was worried

274
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,860
that it might be held against me.

275
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,520
I'm going to take care of that.

276
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,700
Just do as I say, understood?

277
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,760
How have you made things so much more difficult?

278
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,490
If you had done your job properly,

279
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,470
then I wouldn't have had to get myself involved.

280
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:05,290
His Majesty has started to suspect me. Do you have any plans?

281
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:11,030
Don't worry. I'll put my plan into place when we go on our hunting trip.

282
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,680
Hunting?

283
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,280
Knowing the dangers, do you think His Majesty will go?

284
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,210
He'll show up just to prove his good health.

285
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,580
Your Majesty.

286
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,890
Why are you just looking at your food instead of eating it?

287
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:38,670
Are you worried that there might be poison in it again?

288
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:43,620
No. I'm not afraid that I'll die of being poisoned.

289
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,760
But when I'm in front of something this delicious,

290
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,450
I can't help but think of my sister Dal Rae.

291
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,520
And even Gae Hwan, who died unjustly.

292
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,240
I just can't seem to touch it.

293
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,310
Would you like to eat one?

294
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,170
You're talking about it like that, so

295
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:07,380
how could I eat it?

296
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:10,680
I will have it first.

297
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,130
It's delicious, isn't it?

298
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,550
Gae Hwan, that child.

299
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,220
Since she died in place of His Majesty, I'd like to take care of whoever's left behind.

300
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,930
Don't worry about that.

301
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:54,140
The queen has already delivered the news to her hometown,

302
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,190
and ordered that her family be looked after.

303
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,690
The queen?

304
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:05,060
In situations like these, she is most astute.

305
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,150
Even though you distance yourself from her palace,

306
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:13,980
it is one of the reasons no one can take her lightly.

307
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,610
I can't believe I caused dislike in someone like that...

308
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,160
I'm so...

309
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,820
There's nothing you can do about it.

310
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,870
It's because you look like His Majesty.

311
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:40,310
I shouldn't have shared my food with you. I should've just eaten it all by myself.

312
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:04,080
Since you've had some tea, you'll be much more comfortable when you sleep.

313
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,860
Thank you.

314
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,330
I'm sorry.

315
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:39,060
This... isn't this the hazelnut that His Majesty gave you a while ago?

316
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,330
Is it?

317
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,500
I'm not really sure.

318
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,620
I guess a squirrel snuck in when I left the windows open to let the fresh air come in

319
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,950
and left it here.

320
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,480
Then I'll go take this and throw it away.

321
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,570
It's mine, so give it to me.

322
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,160
You should've just said so.

323
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:25,810
You care about His Majesty so much, yet why were you so cold to him this afternoon?

324
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:29,860
He even went against the queen dowager for you.

325
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,800
- It's because I'm afraid.
 - What?

326
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,530
That I'll be disappointed again.

327
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,570
I'm just barely hanging on, but I'm afraid that I'll break down.

328
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,000
Your Majesty.

329
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,190
Left State Minister has requested a private audience. Will you receive him?

330
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,130
Let him in.

331
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,230
What brings you here at this time of night?

332
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,490
I'm sorry.

333
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:13,110
I came to tell you something urgent about the queen's father.

334
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,590
My father-in-law?

335
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:18,920
His position as head of the border defense council is empty.

336
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,820
We don't know when there might be an uprising,

337
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,770
so we cannot keep that position empty.

338
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,630
I think we should speed up an appointment.

339
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,490
Do you have someone in mind as a replacement?

340
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:35,540
Don't you think someone experienced in the military should be promoted to that position?

341
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:39,230
I understand. Return and allow me to think.

342
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,780
I also request that those who were appointed to positions

343
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:47,180
when he was the head of national defense be fired,

344
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,380
and replaced with new appointees.

345
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,370
So...

346
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:57,130
Are you saying to fire all those people and fill those positions with new people?

347
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:02,290
Because you wrapped up the case by exiling traitor Yoo Ho Joon before,

348
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:07,490
many people think the government and the ruler have lost discipline.

349
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:13,530
The national defense needs to be reformed, and Your Majesty's dignity and discipline righted.

350
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,350
I thought it would be cumbersome for you, so

351
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:26,970
I picked names and brought you the three potential candidates.

352
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:30,300
You just need to approve them as is.

353
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:49,460
 Border Defense Council (Bibyeonsa):
Superintendent (Jejo), Park Hyeon Soo

354
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:53,140
Assistant Superintendent (Bujejo), Lee Jeong  Mook 
Administrative Director (Yusadangsa), Kang Seon Dong

355
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:59,230
  Your Majesty, Chief Royal Secretary requests an audience with you.

356
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,640
Let him in.

357
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,830
Your Majesty.

358
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,460
Take a look at this.

359
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:28,940
My lord, you didn't even go through the discussion process, and

360
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,520
changed the personnel of national defense?

361
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,130
Your Majesty, if my request is difficult to approve,

362
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,560
then there is only one thing left to do.

363
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,830
What is that?

364
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:43,240
You should behead the traitor Yoo Ho Joon.

365
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,480
Your Majesty, all this is for your own good,

366
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,270
so please agree to this.

367
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,510
 Heejeong Hall

368
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:21,980
 What do you mean I have to accept it?

369
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,970
I know I am lowly and ignorant.

370
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:27,040
But I still understand what this is!

371
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,640
Isn't the Left State Minister doing the job of His Majesty?

372
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,690
Is he this country's king?

373
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,250
If you don't accept this,

374
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,320
he'll immediately order the beheading of your father-in-law.

375
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:43,530
If you take one, then you need to give one.

376
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,090
That's politics.

377
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,960
What if His Majesty says no? Then isn't it fine?

378
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,450
Even for the king,

379
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:59,250
his work is sometimes doing things that he doesn't want to.

380
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:10,170
Then things going the left state minister's way, is that the ruler's job?

381
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,700
Lord!

382
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:16,110
He pushed out the queen's father, so he is placing his people in national defense as he wished.

383
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:21,380
He's probably nervous since the queen's father is still alive.

384
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,650
 Your Majesty.

385
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,250
That is Prince Jin Pyeong.

386
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:05,180
Prince Jin Pyeong, what's the matter?

387
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:11,160
I came to ask if we can postpone the hunting trip that we had scheduled a few days from now.

388
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,950
Seeing your face, it seems your health is frail.

389
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:23,030
You don't need to worry about His Majesty's health.

390
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:26,940
Then shall we go ahead with the hunting trip as scheduled?

391
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,770
Do that!

392
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,590
I will do as you command.

393
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,940
He can not do that!

394
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:47,840
His Majesty is a skilled hunter, so surely he'll get caught.

395
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:52,700
He must go in order to show that he's in good health.

396
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:09,990
So isn't it fine if I go hunting and don't get caught?

397
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:27,150

398
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:46,280
Bull's eye!

399
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,000
Bull's eye!

400
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,630
Bull's eye!

401
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,250
How are my skills?

402
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:28,640
It seems your skills are better than most archers.

403
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,240
Were you perhaps training without me knowing?

404
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,110
Ah, that's...

405
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:43,210
I sometimes would bring only Eunuch Jo to train. Isn't that right?

406
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:47,330
Yes, of course.

407
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:50,550
He did only take me to practice...

408
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,310
Ah, yes.

409
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:58,260
This is enough for me, so you guys try now.

410
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,860
Your Majesty.

411
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:11,930
Since when have you been able to shoot so well?

412
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,760
Ah, that's...

413
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,050
 What?

414
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,500
 This young man isn't bad.

415
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,190
 Aigoo, what is this?

416
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,950
 Amazing!

417
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:02,460
 What just happened?

418
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,000
 It's five multiples of two, so give me 10 poons.

419
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:13,930
 I've never been robbed so blind in my life!

420
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,080
I was born with it.

421
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:53,880
Do you think it's alright to send him hunting?

422
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,100
It's obvious he'll be the target for those who are waiting to harm him.

423
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:03,580
He must accept the danger to play His Majesty's role.

424
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,190
He already knows that.

425
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:11,040
Must we go this far?

426
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:16,700
I've been waiting for the right time and method all this time.

427
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,370
And do you know what the results of that were?

428
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:24,320
Sin Chi Soo. It only made him stronger.

429
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,090
All this is for His Majesty,

430
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:33,460
so don't have any useless thoughts.

431
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:57,130
Your Majesty,

432
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:02,200
how about if you tell them you feel ill and

433
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,280
don't go hunting tomorrow?

434
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:10,390
Are you afraid I'll die?

435
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:12,190
No—

436
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,930
Did you know?

437
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,560
I didn't know.

438
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:26,440
Just now I saw your reaction and found out.

439
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:41,350
Thank you for worrying about me.

440
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:44,020
It's nothing.

441
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,830
There is no use in

442
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:50,450
my hundred words of concern.

443
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,530
Eunuch Jo,

444
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:44,410
I do have something where you can be of use. Will you help me?

445
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:05,630
His Majesty has arrived.

446
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:24,420
Don't even think about doing something funny.

447
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,280
I don't have those kinds of thoughts.

448
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,880
Your Majesty, you are here.

449
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:52,820
Your Majesty, I should escort you personally, but

450
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:56,940
my knees are acting up again.

451
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:01,410
My son will escort you today instead.

452
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:05,170
My name is Sin Yi Gyeom. It's an honor to meet you, Your Majesty.

453
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:17,590
Your Majesty, my sons are still young, so I brought my hunting dogs instead.

454
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:20,350
- Hunting dogs?
 - Yes.

455
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,930
You gifted them to me.

456
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:58,750
It seems that they've forgotten your scent already.

457
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,580
You punks!

458
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:13,010
You punks, why are you like this?!

459
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:40,860
Okay, okay.

460
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:43,580
Now you recognize me.

461
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:46,960
Have you been well?

462
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,600
Good dog.

463
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:06,770
How did you make the hunting dogs so calm?

464
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:11,320
I've stayed with guys from the southeastern areas before.

465
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,770
Do you mean tiger hunters?

466
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:17,200
Yes. When you're going tiger hunting,

467
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,870
even hunting dogs are useless.

468
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:23,740
When they catch a whiff of a tiger, they pee and run away.

469
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:26,230
Then that before was...

470
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:33,110
It's the skin of a tiger.

471
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:37,220
I wore it just in case,

472
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:40,210
since we were going hunting.

473
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,390
Then where did you get that tiger fur?

474
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:48,700
It was hung up on my bed.

475
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,320
That's weird.

476
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:01,170
Until this morning,

477
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:04,720
it was definitely attached.

478
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:20,030
I will go this way. Who wants to follow me?

479
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,820
I will escort you, Your Majesty.

480
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,860
Your Majesty, today—

481
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:28,440
You must be very confident in your hunting skills.

482
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,120
- You may do so. 
 - Thank you.

483
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,210
Then I will go this way.

484
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:48,280

485
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,740
Stop!

486
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,060
A deer! A deer has appeared!

487
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:53,310
It's this way, Your Majesty.

488
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,580
You go straight that way to Prince Jin Pyeong.

489
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,860
Alright, my Lord.

490
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,530
You guys go this way.

491
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:07,970
Okay.

492
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:36,200
Your Majesty, it seems that we have lost the deer.

493
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,760
Your Majesty.

494
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,500
Your Majesty!

495
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:18,020
Your Majesty.

496
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,690
Your Majesty.

497
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,880
Your Majesty.

498
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:16,520
Your Majesty!

499
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:04,340
Did I scare you? I was trying to aim for a pheasant...

500
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:12,950
This...

501
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:17,380
It's alright, Your Majesty. I'm okay.

502
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:51,220
I warned you. How dare you try to carry out your own agenda first?

503
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,440
Do you know what you almost ruined?!

504
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,960
Seeing that bastard right in front of my eyes, I got so angry and just couldn't help myself.

505
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:03,080
With your skills, surely you could've killed him. What stopped you?

506
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:07,640
I did try to kill him! But at the last moment...

507
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:13,000
I thought that if I killed him, pretending as if it were a mistake,

508
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,190
then I would cover his dirty crimes with my own hands.

509
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,170
It won't end with just his death.

510
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:24,110
The ones who let his crimes slide by.

511
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:27,900
The ones who give him power. I must get rid of all of them.

512
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:30,230
That thought came to my mind.

513
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:36,170
At that moment, my desire to kill him faded.

514
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:47,120
Your Majesty.

515
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:52,620
Lieutenant Jang! Where have you been?

516
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:54,660
My apologies.

517
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,110
My Queen.

518
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:16,380
Has His Majesty already returned?

519
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:18,230
That isn't it...

520
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:21,660
I came to deliver his orders.

521
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:25,500
His orders? What is that?

522
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,770
He stated that for the meantime,

523
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:32,320
you should stop visiting the queen dowager's palace.

524
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,680
That's what he ordered.

525
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:38,270
His Majesty has truly given such orders?

526
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:42,210
I'm sorry, My Queen.

527
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:54,180
Good job today. You may leave now.

528
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,810
Yes, Your Majesty.

529
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:05,110
The queen is coming.

530
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,080
Queen.

531
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,670
Your Majesty!

532
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:50,680
Are you okay?

533
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,140
Your Majesty, your health—

534
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:57,870
I'm-I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

535
01:00:57,870 --> 01:00:59,980
There's nothing wro—

536
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,700
Your Majesty.

537
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:05,610
Court Lady Park, bring a physician. Quickly!

538
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:09,140
How dare it harm His Majesty?

539
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,040
Don't!

540
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:20,450
Your Majesty. When a dog bites a human, we need to make sure it never does so again.

541
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:23,510
Since it's the dog that I brought, I'll be the one that deals with it.

542
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:25,660
He was probably shocked too!

543
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:30,010
If we end his life just because he made one mistake, would there be any living soul left on earth?

544
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:33,700
- But Your Majesty! 
 - His Majesty is right.

545
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,100
Hearing what His Majesty has said, it's correct.

546
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:41,310
Prince Jin Pyeong, you're only here due to the His Majesty's grace and benevolence.

547
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:44,400
Isn't that so?

548
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,270
It's an order.

549
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:49,100
Put your sword away.

550
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:54,240
I will accept your order, Your Majesty.

551
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,400
Your Majesty.

552
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:37,750
If you hadn't been wearing the tiger leather,

553
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:41,010
your arm would have been broken.

554
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:42,980
Your wound can still fester,

555
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:47,610
so please refrain from using this arm for a while.

556
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,760
It seems the heavens have helped me.

557
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,830
You may go now.

558
01:03:54,610 --> 01:03:56,830
Stop!

559
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:59,180
I'm sorry.

560
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:02,540
Your Majesty.

561
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:06,890
 The queen and Seon Hwa Dang wish to see you.

562
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:08,920
Let them in.

563
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:33,090
Your Majesty.

564
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:39,960
I came as soon as I heard.

565
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:45,220
According to the physician, something awful almost happened to your arm.

566
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:50,370
I thought I would die of worry after hearing so.

567
01:04:55,810 --> 01:05:00,080
The physician appears to have said something quite useless.

568
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:03,140
You may return.

569
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:09,090
Didn't you hear? He told you to go.

570
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:13,240
I believe he was talking to you.

571
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:17,590
Your Majesty!

572
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:21,150
Hurry and escort her out.

573
01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:24,290
Let's go.

574
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:28,450
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

575
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:30,860
Your Majesty!

576
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:45,850
Please don't be concerned with what the physician said. He meant for me to be more careful.

577
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:48,610
That's how I understood it as well.

578
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:52,420
You must have been very surprised.

579
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:55,950
But why did you come to the stables?

580
01:05:55,950 --> 01:06:00,160
I went to ask you about you blocking my visits to the queen dowager.

581
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:04,420
Why did you give such orders?

582
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:08,870
Whether I go visit her with you or not

583
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:13,390
seems to be a reason for her to give you a hard time.

584
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:17,570
So I ordered you to just not visit her.

585
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,230
I know. I probably thought wrong.

586
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:25,110
No.

587
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:28,990
I failed to consider your feelings all this time and

588
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:31,600
only thought of my duties.

589
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:34,890
Now I understand.

590
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:42,170
I only act through words, but you are someone who acts when the time is right.

591
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:45,970
What do you mean?

592
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:51,680
What... did I do?

593
01:06:58,930 --> 01:07:01,990
It's not the effects of the medicine,

594
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:04,230
but His Majesty's heart has changed.

595
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:06,840
There might be more to it than that.

596
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:10,660
You were so absorbed in bribing and accepting bribes from government officials,

597
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:12,730
you didn't check His Majesty's feelings properly.

598
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:16,790
Isn't that something that you approved of?

599
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:20,150
I am saying you shouldn't forget who you are!

600
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:23,420
If you continue to disappoint me,

601
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:28,160
you will not only lose the niceties of the palace but also your position.

602
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,890
So get your head on straight.

603
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:38,270
And don't forget His Majesty has always been an intelligent man.

604
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:42,570
Yes, my lord. I will keep that in mind.

605
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,920
 That wench! Seon Hwa Dang, you wench!

606
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,710
 Get away from His Majesty this instant!

607
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:15,860
 Your Majesty.

608
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:25,090
 I will endure with you

609
01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:28,120
 so please don't give up your will.

610
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:32,310
 Death is my only option now.

611
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:35,870
 But why won't you even allow me to die?

612
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:46,160
Not knowing the truth,

613
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,820
I blabbed carelessly only believing rumors.

614
01:08:50,670 --> 01:08:53,930
How lonely and difficult was it for her?

615
01:09:57,830 --> 01:10:02,090
 They won't go in if you throw them that way.

616
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,630
Want me to throw them for you?

617
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:14,350
N-No.

618
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:18,060
I just threw it for fun.

619
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,840
Yes.

620
01:10:35,290 --> 01:10:38,140
Did you see that? It went in at once!

621
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:45,000
I forgot to make a wish.

622
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,490
Don't worry, I will throw another one so you can make a wish this time.

623
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:44,550
Queen, make a wish.

624
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:29,160
Don't you think it'll look like this if the stars fall from the sky?

625
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:39,840
Queen, what did you wish for?

626
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,830
Is it a secret?

627
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:48,490
Then don't say it. I won't ask further.

628
01:12:56,510 --> 01:13:00,360
I guess I should make a wish as well.

629
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:36,800
Your Majesty.

630
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:41,020
What did you wish for?

631
01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:48,460
My Queen...

632
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:55,710
I wished to see you smile brightly one time.

633
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:59,870
That's what I wished for.

634
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:29,790
 The Crowned Clown

635
01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:42,560

636
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:50,290
 Preview

637
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:54,170
 Has the palace already become comfortable for you?

638
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:57,000
 Don't let your guard down.

639
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,090
 What's this?

640
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:00,200
 Pretend not to know.

641
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:03,440
 - There are talks petitioning to depose the queen. 
- Be quiet!

642
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,670
 You are committing all sorts of deeds just to save your queen.

643
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:09,260
 What's the use of dressing in silk and wielding power

644
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:12,250
 when the head is full of thoughts less than an animal's.

645
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:13,790
 Why are you doing this?

646
01:15:13,790 --> 01:15:16,690
 Not even a little bit of humane thought!

647
01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:20,880
 Today is your funeral day.
