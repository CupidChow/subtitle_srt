1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:09,940

2
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,270
  The Crowned Clown

3
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,630
 The characters, organizations, locations, and events in this drama are fictional and have no relation to historical facts.

4
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,070
That's right.

5
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,800
I'm that two-nyang dog from back then.

6
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:42,490
I couldn't find you wherever I looked. So you were hiding inside the palace.

7
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,110
If you lay a finger on my sister Dal Rae,

8
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,930
I will never leave you alive!

9
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,070
Look at you playing this role so well.

10
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,710
I knew, but for a moment I thought you were the king.

11
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,930
Alright.

12
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,350
Is there anyone else who knows your identity besides Chief Royal Secretary?

13
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:24,230
Well, then again, it's a secret that you would never dare share.

14
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,430
Where is His Majesty right now?

15
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,250
When did he say he would return?

16
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,360
  Where is His Majesty?

17
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,160
  He is far away.

18
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,920
  Far away?

19
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,890
  Then, when...?

20
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,030
  I do not know myself

21
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,610
 whether he will approach as lightning does,

22
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,260
  or return as faintly as the strays of light during dawn.

23
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,560
Whether he will approach as lightning does,

24
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,660
or return as faintly as the strays of light during dawn,

25
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,930
I do not know.

26
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:59,010
Well, even if he returns right away, it does not matter.

27
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,950
You are fake.

28
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,660
If it gets revealed that Chief Royal Secretary used you to monopolize the government,

29
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,270
even His Majesty, who approved of all this, will find it difficult to keep the throne.

30
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,930
But I will have to hurry.

31
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:20,990
I will let you know how to save your sister.

32
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:26,910
Give an order right now that you will personally interrogate the criminal.

33
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:34,580
Then, I will punish Chief Royal Secretary who put a lowly clown on the throne and monopolized the government.

34
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:40,330
And I will expel the traitorous subject who played around as the king from the throne.

35
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,380
Before that,

36
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,120
I need to see if my sister, Dal Rae, is safe.

37
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,170
Alright.

38
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,340
Of course, you must want to save your sister.

39
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,120
First, get down on your knees.

40
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,860
Do you not want to save her?

41
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,110
When you go to the interrogation, call Chief Royal Secretary as the criminal.

42
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,910
Then, I will call your sister forth as a witness.

43
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,130
I understand.

44
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,840
I will do so.

45
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,130
  Episode 13   
 Your Highness.

46
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,080
Something big has happened.

47
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,640
What happened?

48
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,650
The king has ordered an interrogation.

49
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,600
Interrogation?

50
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,740
If it's regarding the crimes that broke the moral principles, the authorities should be the ones who deal with the matter.

51
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,400
Did he really order an interrogation?

52
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,220
Yes. They're already setting up the rack in the yard of the empty palace.

53
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,180
Sir.

54
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,100
I was on my way to find you.

55
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,520
After Sin Chi Soo left the palace, there was an order for an interrogation.

56
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,970
- An interrogation? 
 - They are already preparing for it in the yard.

57
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,600
The judges have already arrived.

58
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,380
 His Majesty has arrived.

59
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:16,320
Your Majesty, since the criminal to be interrogated, has arrived, please speak his name aloud.

60
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,950
Chief Royal Secretary.

61
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,490
Chief Royal Secretary, come forth.

62
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,570
Call forth the witness.

63
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,610
Chief Royal Secretary, receive this royal command.

64
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,860
Sin Chi Soo, head of the appointed judges,

65
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,280
bring forth the criminal, Sin Chi Soo!

66
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,030
Let go! Let go!

67
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,710
I am not a criminal.

68
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:40,710
The criminals are Chief Royal Secretary and that man, who played for him!

69
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,690
I warned you.

70
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,200
If you lay even a finger on my sister Dal Rae, you wouldn't live.

71
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,480
I am going to play with you properly now.

72
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,220
You bastard, you lowly clown.

73
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,090
How dare you say you'll play with me?

74
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,840
You bastard, even a ghost would spit in your face.

75
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,890
  You bastard,

76
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:53,130
  even a ghost would spit in your face.

77
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,640
  You are a bastard who spouts nonsense with no basis.

78
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,920
You are a bastard who spouts nonsense with no basis.

79
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,650
How dare you show contempt for me, the king of this country?

80
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,940
You must truly wish to die!

81
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,150
Everyone, you must not be fooled by this bastard's clownish act.

82
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:23,850
This man is only a clown who has the same face as the king.

83
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,000
That treacherous Chief Royal Secretary

84
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,960
is hiding the true king and put this lowly clown on the king's throne.

85
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,890
We should bring the true king back as soon as we can,

86
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,410
and expose the crimes of these two men!

87
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,230
Who on earth would believe you?

88
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,230
I have definite evidence.

89
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:49,080
That girl is this clown's sister.

90
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,050
You can just ask her.

91
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,080
If you do not wish to die, answer truthfully.

92
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,110
This man is your older brother, correct?

93
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,080
My older brother,

94
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,620
the thing is...

95
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,630
My older brother

96
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,270
no longer exists in this world.

97
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,340
He already died.

98
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,490
It is a lie! This is a lie.

99
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,020
She is lying. This wench!

100
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,910
Are you not afraid of the heavens?

101
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,290
Do you know where this is? How dare you lie!

102
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:54,060
It is the truth. Would I dare lie in front of the king?

103
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,510
Your Majesty, it is not right to treat this pitiful child as a criminal.

104
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,540
Eunuch Jo, take this child away.

105
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

106
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,110
No. No! Everyone, come to your senses!

107
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,530
We cannot just let that child go!

108
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,280
Prince Jin Pyeong, what are you doing?

109
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,340
Prince Jin Pyeong, do you also believe what this man says?

110
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,780
No, he is saying utter nonsense.

111
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:45,490
How could we think the same as that wicked man?

112
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,390
You will regret this!

113
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,560
When the true king returns,

114
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,740
- not only these two men but none of you will be forgivenâ€”
 - Shut up!

115
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,700
I cannot listen to your nonsense any longer!

116
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,500
What are you all doing? Tie the criminal to the rack!

117
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,150
Yes, Your Majesty!

118
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,770
I am not a criminal. I am not a criminal!

119
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,340
The criminal is Chief Royal Secretary!

120
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:21,170
And the man sitting on the throne is a lowly clown!

121
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,140
How impertinent! Cover his mouth up this instant!

122
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,050
He is a clown.

123
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,800
That man's name is Ha Seon!

124
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,520
I'm not a criminal.

125
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,320
That bastard... That bastard...

126
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:51,260
Start the interrogation against the traitor, Sin Chi Soo.

127
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:56,920
Your Majesty, there is a witness who will expose all of Sin Chi Soo's hidden crimes.

128
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,980
Bring them in this instant.

129
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,410
 As Your Majesty already knows, Court Lady Kim was previously

130
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,760
the one that tried to check if there were any scars on your body.

131
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,470
So to find the mastermind behind that plot,

132
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,990
I sent her to Sin Chi Soo's house, and she disappeared.

133
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,060
How dare she?!

134
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,460
How dare you try and examine the king's body?

135
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,710
He doubted the king.

136
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:43,690
But, thankfully, Officer Jang found that Court Lady Kim was alive.

137
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,810
 Call Sin Chi Soo.

138
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:56,210
  I have to demand and ask him how much longer he will keep me like this.

139
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,770
Start the interrogation of the witness.

140
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,600
Is it true that Sin Chi Soo put you up to slandering the king?

141
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,060
Yes.

142
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,770
He asked me to see if the king was fake or not by examining his scar.

143
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,940
You!

144
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,040
He killed the royal artist Song Ji Sang.

145
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,620
He made posters of His Majesty's face and posted them all over the city.

146
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,940
It was all Sin Chi Soo.

147
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,890
Goodness...

148
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,620
This is shocking.

149
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,290
From a long time ago, Sin Chi Soo made me

150
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:56,790
burn medicine around His Majesty's bed that caused him to have hallucinations.

151
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,410
He also bribed the court physician and the court ladies.

152
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:04,690
This led to false reports of Court Lady Park from the Queen's palace attempting to kill Seon Hwa Dang.

153
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,350
Did Seon Hwa Dang have a part in this ploy?

154
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,850
Seon Hwa Dang does not know of this event.

155
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,110
Sin Chi Soo was worried that the plan might fail

156
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,320
and ordered me to feed her actual poison.

157
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,720
You are indeed a vicious and cruel person.

158
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,200
Regarding your punishment, I will decide on it after discussing it with the judges.

159
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,220
Until then, confine her in prison.

160
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,790
Yes, sir.

161
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:52,010
Until criminal Sin Chi Soo confesses, torture him.

162
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:04,370
You clown! You jerk!

163
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:17,010

164
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,170
Will you confess to your crimes now?

165
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,040
I have committed no crimes.

166
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,340
He says he has committed no crimes.

167
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,740
What do you think?

168
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:43,790
Your Majesty, there is a witness and clear evidence of Sin Chi Soo's sins.

169
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:48,200
And his crimes are so serious that we cannot even bring them up one by one.

170
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,030
In particular, scorning Your Majesty by putting up posters

171
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:55,070
and throwing public sentiment into chaos are high crimes that must not be forgiven.

172
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,920
The Minister of Justice is right.

173
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,120
Conforming to the Great Ming Laws,

174
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,590
it is only right to order his beheading.

175
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,390
You bastard.

176
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,450
The sentence of beheading for criminal Sin Chi Soo

177
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,330
has been granted royal permission.

178
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,100
Uncle!

179
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,730
You cannot enter.

180
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,040
I came to see my uncle. Please give me a little bit of time.

181
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,150
Uncle.

182
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,940
It's not true, right?

183
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,990
Tell me that you didn't give me poison on purpose.

184
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,470
Right. Aren't I right?

185
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,390
Come close.

186
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:01,360
In my room, there is a plant that I cherish a lot.

187
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,940
Take the item inside it for safe keeping.

188
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,320
What are youâ€”

189
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,580
What are you saying? What plant?

190
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,580
If you want to live,

191
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,710
hurry up.

192
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,960
Do you understand?

193
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,140
You must leave now.

194
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,650
What are you doing, instead of dragging the criminal out?

195
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,250
Yes, sir.

196
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,970
You've worked hard.

197
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,780
I'll take her from here.

198
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,040
You must have been surprised to be called to the palace.

199
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,060
Why aren't you asking anything?

200
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,940
I know you wouldn't answer.

201
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,410
So why would I ask?

202
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,510
Dal Rae.

203
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,000
Ma'am.

204
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,900
I'll explain everything later.

205
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,040
Please take care of Dal Rae.

206
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,180
What's going on? How are you inside the palace?

207
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:20,370
Please don't ask me.

208
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:24,040
My brother will only be put in more danger.

209
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,060
I won't ask anything, so don't cry.

210
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,350
I have something to give you.

211
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:55,120
Ha Seon, he collected these for you.

212
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,900
Brother...

213
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,340
How is Dal Rae doing?

214
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,550
I brought in Woon Sim to look after Dal Rae, so she should be alright.

215
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,870
I finally feel at ease.

216
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,940
Why are you looking at me that way?

217
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,050
It was my mistake for leaving you alone last night and going to the Royal Judiciary Office.

218
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:50,680
Still, you revealed your identity to Sin Chi Soo right away. That was incredibly thoughtless.

219
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,210
One wrong move and everything could've gone downhill.

220
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,610
It was a matter that concerned Dal Rae's life, so I didn't have time to think of any other way.

221
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:02,500
That's why I'm saying this. You should've waited for me.

222
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,800
When it comes to individuals like Sin Chi Soo, instead of being patient like you,

223
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,530
it's better to dive right in like me.

224
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:15,300
If I thought about this and that, things would've gone awry, right away.

225
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,120
What will happen to Gap Soo?

226
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:25,600
The king is here!

227
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,640
  Geumocheong Hall

228
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:03,500
Tell His Majesty why you attacked Sin Yi Gyeom.

229
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,810
The thing is... I had a reason why I had to do it.

230
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,650
How dare you! Do not lie.

231
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,040
You attacked without reason.

232
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,490
Is what Sin Yi Gyeom says the truth?

233
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,150
That's not true.

234
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,530
From a very long time ago, I decided

235
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:30,840
I was going to break his head before leaving this world.

236
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,270
Do you hold a grudge against Sin Yi Gyeom?

237
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:38,760
The child I cherish like my own daughter,

238
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,530
this bastard ruined her...

239
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,770
when she didn't know anything...

240
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:52,950
I'm just a lowly clown and so I could not report it to the authorities.

241
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,010
Thatâ€™s why I held everything inside.

242
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:58,790
Then, the moment I saw him...

243
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:10,150
I have nothing more to say and will gladly receive any punishment.

244
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:17,450
Your Majesty, the Great Ming Law states that a commoner who attacks a noble

245
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,500
must be sentenced to eighty floggings.

246
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:25,470
Instead of eighty floggings, send him to the south and conscript him to the navy.

247
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,590
As you wish.

248
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:49,720
So what punishment must be given to the man who wronged a young child?

249
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,960
I believe it should be repaid with death.

250
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,150
However, this is not the case for a noble.

251
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,930
Yes. She is a commoner and a victim, so there is no crime.

252
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:09,070
So you're saying that your crime was not a crime?

253
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:14,080
Well, the Great Ming Law states it isn't.

254
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,050
I have reviewed the precedents set by the late king.

255
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:29,380
In order to bring justice to the people who have been wronged, he established a new law with a royal order.

256
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:34,250
As such, I too shall make a new law.

257
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:42,130
Your Majesty, you cannot create a punishment for something that does not exist. That's absurd.

258
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:48,430
You are not trying to punish me because of my father's doings, are you?

259
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,690
I will not punish you for your father's crimes!

260
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,210
The crime you committed is worth its own punishment.

261
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,500
Your Majesty, you cannot do so.

262
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,820
There is no such law!

263
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,530
The reason why I am on the throne is for the people.

264
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:12,990
How is making a law to protect those without power or wealth wrong?

265
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,580
I sentence Sin Yi Gyeom to be marked.

266
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:23,370
Embed his crime on his face so that he will never forget it until the day he dies!

267
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,870
- Your Majesty, thatâ€“ 
 - Proceed right away!

268
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,540
Yes!

269
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:32,920
Your Majesty, spare me!

270
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,910
I was wrong, Your Majesty!

271
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:38,820
Your Majesty, spare me! Your Majesty!

272
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,810
 Who is that rotten bastard?

273
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,580
 You cannot do anything.

274
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,650
 Tell me immediately who it is.

275
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:52,950
 Sin Yi Gyeom. The son of Sin Chi Soo, who just became left state minister.

276
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:53,050

277
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,540
Oh, Your Majesty!

278
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,770
Gap Soo, it's me.

279
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,380
Is it really you, Ha Seon?

280
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,690
Why would I lie to you?

281
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:46,110
Oh my, oh my, of course, it's you.

282
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:49,050
I saw you earlier, and it had to be you, Ha Seon!

283
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:53,620
Anyone could tell you're Ha Seon.

284
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:58,060
But what happened?

285
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:01,650
Does the king know that you're playing as him?

286
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,810
Did you get permission?

287
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:10,420
Don't worry. How could I come to be here without his permission?

288
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:14,950
Yes, of course. I am so honored.

289
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:19,910
You have to tell the king that I'm so grateful, okay?

290
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:23,230
Oh Ha Seon, Ha Seon.

291
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:26,680
Now, you will be sent to serve at the navy near Mu Ahn Hyeon.

292
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,110
What?

293
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,470
Mu Ahn Hyeon?

294
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:36,010
That's the place where you and Dal Rae were raised, right?

295
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:39,700
That is the best place to live with Dal Rae.

296
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,370
You head there first.

297
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:46,250
Yes, of course. I get what you're saying.

298
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:50,210
Don't worry about Dal Rae. I will take care of her.

299
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,820
You just think about yourself.

300
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:57,150
You must not lose favor with the king. Alright?

301
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,550
Oh, Ha Seon. You are so great.

302
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:07,660
You truly are. Is this a dream or is it a reality?

303
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,860
How do you feel?

304
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:41,510
It's barely been a day, but it feels like a year or longer has passed.

305
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:49,440
On one hand, I feel lighter, as if I put down a big burden.

306
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,940
On the other hand, my heart feels heavy.

307
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,010
If that's how you feel...

308
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,260
it's a relief.

309
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,690
What do you mean?

310
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,700
It's nothing.

311
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,560
I'm not a guest who came to the brothel.

312
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:56,620
You don't have to sit next to me and take care of me.

313
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,350
Did something happen at the palace?

314
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:06,910
Something... happens every day.

315
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:13,320
Ha Seon isn't playing his king act properly, right?

316
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,990
Did Dal Rae say so?

317
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:22,250
She is just afraid of her older brother getting hurt.

318
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,880
She wouldn't say a word.

319
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,760
Then who...

320
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,560
I've been by your side for a dozen years.

321
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:36,200
How do you think I would have been by your side if I were so clueless?

322
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,430
I apologize.

323
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,680
Don't.

324
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:48,380
I don't think about sharing everything with you.

325
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:53,390
You are much too high of a person for me to do so.

326
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,690
Just please don't push me away.

327
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,390
In good times and in bad times,

328
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:06,950
just being by your side... is enough for me.

329
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,620
Would you pour me another glass?

330
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,280
Yi Gyeom.

331
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,200
Where are you taking him?

332
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,180
He will be exiled to the northern borders by His Majesty's command.

333
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,360
 Criminal: Rapist

334
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,990
Look.

335
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:23,300
I'll give you my jade headband buttons.

336
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,360
Do me a favor.

337
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,890
Your Excellency, Sin Chi Soo sent a request through an officer at the Royal Investigation Bureau to see you.

338
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:47,970
How dare he ask to see me? He's surely insane.

339
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,090
I apologize.

340
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,070
No.

341
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:59,190
He could confess that I'm a traitor.

342
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,760
I'll have to see him. Take me to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

343
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,720
Yes, Your Excellency.

344
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,640
I knew you would come.

345
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,450
Why did you ask to see me?

346
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:43,130
You aren't trying to make me take the fall with you, are you?

347
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:46,910
That depends on how you act.

348
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,600
Let's not exchange useless talk.

349
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:54,960
Everyone in the country knows that we are each other's worst enemy.

350
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,000
Who would believe you?

351
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,360
Would His Majesty not?

352
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,550
Are you threatening me?

353
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:11,620
I'm only saying that we survive together or we die together.

354
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,820
"Survive together?"

355
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,040
Are you still holding onto such useless dreams?

356
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,310
It is not a useless dream.

357
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:27,470
I have the perfect justification to remove the king from the throne.

358
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:52,960
What are you doing instead of eating? Aren't you hungry?

359
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,770
You don't like it? Would you like something else?

360
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,720
I can't even swallow water right now.

361
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,790
How can I eat all of this?

362
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:15,470
Since Gap Soo is waiting, I just want to leave quickly.

363
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,880
Oh, my hazelnuts.

364
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,630
What are you doing? I said, let's go quickly.

365
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,670
Dal Rae.

366
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:35,690
I can't go.

367
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,970
I still have things to do here.

368
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:42,380
Things to do? What are those?

369
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,610
Are they more important than me?

370
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:52,180
There is nothing in this world that is more important than you.

371
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,360
Then, why can't you go?

372
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,750
Are you not even afraid of this place?

373
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,980
Dal Rae. You saw, too,

374
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:05,290
what kind of things I'm doing in the palace.

375
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:09,410
I have to see the end of what I started, don't you think?

376
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:12,890
But you can't act as the king for all of your life.

377
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,620
Do you think that'll work?

378
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:21,900
I can't leave you here.

379
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:27,360
Orabeoni, I can't. I'm scared you'll end up dead.

380
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,010
Go with Gap Soo first. I'll be there shortly, alright?

381
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:39,960
That's a lie.

382
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:46,070
Last time, you said you'd come quickly and you didn't.

383
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:49,080
Dal Rae, can't you trust me?

384
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,910
I do trust you.

385
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:53,630
I do, but...

386
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,720
I'm sorry.

387
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,990
You have to come quickly.

388
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:13,800
Of course. I will.

389
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:34,030

390
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:10,920
Let's go.

391
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,530
Come.

392
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,930
Come quickly.

393
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,520
Let's go.

394
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,950
Your Majesty.

395
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:03,700
My queen.

396
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:06,440
Thank you for coming.

397
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:10,700
Did you see your sister off well?

398
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:17,270
I'm not sure if I did the right thing.

399
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,550
Please don't say that I'm being weak saying this.

400
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:29,510
If I'm to handle this position,

401
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,730
I know I have to endure at least this much pain.

402
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:38,750
My sister left smiling for my sake in the end.

403
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:44,970
But I am not sure why my heart feels so heavy and scared after sending her off.

404
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:47,220
Of course.

405
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:50,230
You are not feeling that because you are weak,

406
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:54,390
but because you are human.

407
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:19,310
I know how it feels to say goodbye to your family.

408
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:25,290
The people who leave, and the people you send off,

409
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:28,390
it all rips your heart apart.

410
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:37,760
One day, when things get peaceful,

411
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,700
let us go on a spring day to see your sister and Gap Soo.

412
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:55,830
I want to see them up close.

413
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,440
I will not forget.

414
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,060
I'll make sure I'll ask you to come see them.

415
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,870
How did you get here?

416
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,660
The queen dowager sent me here.

417
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:05,050
She underestimates me so much that she thought such useless methods would work?

418
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:11,000
Is she so afraid that I'll make a confession?

419
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,110
Hold on.

420
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:20,050
I'll have to accept that I wasn't forgotten.

421
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,660
I don't have anything to repay her with,

422
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:28,230
but I have a last gift for the queen dowager.

423
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:52,840
She said that if you like the gift, for you to call on her again.

424
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,920
You expect me to believe this?

425
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,100
I apologize.

426
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,550
I am merely reporting what I heard.

427
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:17,150
How impertinent.

428
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:21,790
She gave me a big gift on her last path.

429
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:41,000
Sin Chi Soo put up posters scorning the king and committed treason.

430
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,760
It's so terrible even thinking about it.

431
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:46,630
This won't do.

432
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:53,290
If the king is to solidify a peaceful reign, you must give birth to a baby crown prince as quickly as possible.

433
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:55,290
A baby?

434
00:51:55,290 --> 00:52:00,220
Yes. A baby to give the king good fortune!

435
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:05,110
There's a court lady physician I am close with. How about you get your pulse checked for a diagnosis?

436
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:16,260
I'll have her come by tomorrow right away!

437
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,180
How is it?

438
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:44,910
Your Highness, as a result of your tachycardia, your pulse is too weak and rapid.

439
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:48,970
Since you are lacking in energy, it would be best if you protect your body.

440
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:53,340
I'll have herbal medicine prepared for you within the next few days.

441
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,430
Thank you.

442
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,790
It must be the tea.

443
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:03,350
Could I examine it?

444
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:05,420
Yes.

445
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:31,230
I apologize,  Your Highness, but could you allow me to see your tea leaves?

446
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:32,880
Why do you ask?

447
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,100
I wish to examine if you are eating the right food for your body.

448
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:42,100
But I don't think you'll have to examine this tea for that.

449
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:47,570
The royal physician specially sent this tea for the queen.

450
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:49,760
Oh, is that so?

451
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:54,420
However, I wish to examine them personally.

452
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:57,630
You may take them.

453
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:09,450

454
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:22,010
Your Majesty, the beheading of Sin Chi Soo will take place at the end of the month.

455
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:23,350
Please approve it.

456
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:25,280
Proceed.

457
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:31,270
What about the punishment for Court Lady Kim?

458
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:34,730
She has committed terrible crimes since she tried to harm you and the queen.

459
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,530
It is appropriate to hang her.

460
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:39,950
However, she assisted by revealing the crimes of Sin Chi Soo.

461
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:44,570
Therefore, she should be flogged forty times and sent to the borders as a slave.

462
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:46,630
Proceed.

463
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:54,800
Your Majesty, I have something to say about Yoo Ho Joon, the queen's father.

464
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,910
Go ahead.

465
00:54:55,910 --> 00:55:02,970
The queen's father's confession regarding his attempt to murder you is false.

466
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,010
Do you have any evidence or witnesses to confirm what you are saying?

467
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,270
Yes, Your Majesty.

468
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:14,870
The man who testified against him at the time is now dead,

469
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:17,980
but we still have his statements listed.

470
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:23,460
I would like the court to discuss ways to bring justice for Yoo Ho Jun.

471
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:26,900
So, please approve it.

472
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:31,750
Your Majesty, I apologize but Chief Royal Secretary's request is not correct.

473
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:36,530
Why should we talk about his innocence when he has been found guilty?

474
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,690
You cannot approve this.

475
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,690
Then, whether Chief Royal Secretary or Prince Jin Pyeong is correct,

476
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:50,560
the court will discuss and report.

477
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:07,730
 If they're just going to discuss it, it's impossible to defeat Chief Royal Secretary.

478
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:11,840
 It's obvious His Majesty will side with him in the end.

479
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:18,010
Your Highness!

480
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:23,140
Your Highness, you'll be happy to hear this.

481
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:28,900
His Majesty ordered the court to discuss your father's matter.

482
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,940
I'll have to go see the king right away, then.

483
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:39,930
Your Highness, the court lady physician is requesting to see you.

484
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,780
Allow her to enter.

485
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:59,120
Your Highness.

486
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,520
Do you carry bad news?

487
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,360
What is it that's making you act like that?

488
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:16,490
Your Highness, I apologize,

489
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:22,310
but the tea that you were drinking was to cause infertility.

490
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:37,110
How could the royal physician send me tea with such effects?

491
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:39,790
I am not sure of that,

492
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:44,020
but I looked into whether the concubines were taking that tea, just in case.

493
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:47,640
It was only you who had the tea, Your Highness.

494
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:52,660
May I ask how much of this tea you have consumed?

495
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,950
Ae Yeong.

496
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:01,760
She has consumed it for at least three months.

497
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:06,770
What is the matter?

498
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:08,930
I apologize,

499
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:12,900
but even drinking it for a month will hurt the flow of energy in your body and in the womb.

500
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:18,310
The blood in your womb will thicken and you will not be able to conceive.

501
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:25,270
Your Highness! Your Highness!

502
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:34,060
I will call for the royal physician.

503
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,130
No, you cannot.

504
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:40,010
- If the royal physician arrives, the king will find out. 
 - But...

505
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:43,860
Your Highness, how can we not call for the royal physician?

506
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,620
The palace has only just now become calm.

507
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:49,830
I can't cause more trouble for him again.

508
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:54,520
So you can never inform him of this truth.

509
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,620
Do you understand?

510
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:59,030
Yes, Your Highness.

511
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:33,260
We have looked through Sin Chi Soo's house.

512
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:36,780
We could not find what you were looking for, Your Excellency.

513
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:41,590
Alright. You may leave.

514
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:54,210
 A justification for rebellion? What is it?

515
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:59,890
 I have evidence that His Majesty communicated secretly with the emperor of Later Jin.

516
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:02,840
 Evidence of their communication?

517
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,290
 That's right.

518
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:10,430
 Chief Royal Secretary delivered the king's secret letter to a spy under Later Jin.

519
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:12,710
 I intercepted it.

520
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:14,780
 The king would never do this.

521
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:19,780
 What if it was Chief Royal Secretary's actions and not His Majesty?

522
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:29,100
 His Majesty was manipulated by Chief Royal Secretary who secretly communicated with Later Jin?

523
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:32,500
 When this is revealed,

524
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:38,740
 government officials and scholars from all over the country will rise against His Majesty.

525
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:45,170
 What do you think you'll be able to do while you are locked up in here?

526
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:49,760
 If you help me, don't you think it's possible?

527
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:54,720
 If you really want to become the owner of the throne,

528
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,080
 decide.

529
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:05,590
It is impossible for him to possess His Majesty's secret letter.

530
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:10,940
No, wait.

531
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:15,560
If this were a lie, he would not be so confident.

532
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:22,340
What should I do next?

533
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:39,720
 Official letter with a personal message from faux King Yi Heon to  Nurhaci, the First Khan of Manchu, Later Jin Dynasty: 
To notify...

534
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:44,880
  Nurhaci that Joseon is forced by the Ming to deploy 10,000 soldiers against Later Jin, but he will block and delay it. (Historically, this is known as The Liaodong Campaign)

535
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:56,990
 Search him.

536
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,830
 His Excellency will be delighted.

537
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:23,330
Lowly clown, just wait.

538
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:28,330
I will not go down to hell alone.

539
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,340
Your Majesty.

540
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:36,250
What a shame. I was trying to scare you.

541
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:38,770
I was scared quite enough.

542
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:42,910
Why are you at the library at this time?

543
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:46,530
I came to give you good news.

544
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:47,700
By chance...

545
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,310
Yes.

546
01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:52,970
Your father's record has been expunged.

547
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:02,370
Thank you, Your Majesty, for clearing my father's name.

548
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:08,020
I wish it was me, but it was Chief Royal Secretary who did everything.

549
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:13,110
Please thank him for me.

550
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:27,010
My queen, is something wrong?

551
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:28,720
Pardon?

552
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:33,010
What makes you say that?

553
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:37,460
In my eyes, you appear to be strangely sad.

554
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:40,480
I was so surprised by the good news.

555
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,110
That may be why.

556
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:45,680
Please, don't worry.

557
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:51,610
Right. I chose books that we could read together.

558
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:11,370
I forgot, but I have something to discuss with Chief Royal Secretary.

559
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:13,450
I'll be right back.

560
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:16,560
Alright, Your Majesty.

561
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:48,420
Let's talk for a moment.

562
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:50,020
Pardon?

563
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:52,970
Alright, Your Majesty.

564
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:09,270
Tell me the truth.

565
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:12,250
Why does the queen look unwell?

566
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:17,380
Your Majesty, please kill me.

567
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:20,880
Why do you want me to kill you?

568
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,760
The truth is...

569
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,400
What is the matter?

570
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:42,600
Your Majesty.

571
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,060
I heard about the tea.

572
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:49,100
You weren't going to tell me?

573
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:13,490
I'm sorry.

574
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:18,550
You must be the one who is in the most pain right now.

575
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:27,400
I will find who is responsible and I will punish them.

576
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:32,080
I could not tell you because I feared you would react this way.

577
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,060
What do you mean by that?

578
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,690
Do you know who did this?

579
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:48,920
Your Majesty!

580
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:02,250
Royal Physician, come out immediately!

581
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:04,970
Come out at once!

582
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:07,580
Your Majesty.

583
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,330
Your Majesty.

584
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:14,990
Tell me the truth. Who is it?

585
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:18,660
Who told you to give that tea to the queen?

586
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:21,980
What do you mean?

587
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:24,770
I really do not know.

588
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:26,270
How dare you!?

589
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:30,510
Your Majesty, I have committed a crime deserving of death!

590
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:33,690
Please, spare my life.

591
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,700
Who gave you the order?

592
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:45,240
It was...

593
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:49,450
It was the queen dowager.

594
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,600
When the queen fell ill,

595
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:08,020
I was told she needed to leave the palace to recuperate.

596
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:12,480
But when she returned, more tea was sent to her.

597
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:16,130
Was it all the queen dowager's command?

598
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,120
Yes.

599
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:26,520
I did not dare go against the queen dowager's orders.

600
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,600
Where is this tea?

601
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:45,040
Here.

602
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:55,300
I will accompany the king. Call Chief Royal Secretary.

603
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:57,260
I understand.

604
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:11,120
 Sujeong Hall

605
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:22,810
Your Majesty, this has become a habit.

606
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:25,700
You have neither manners nor shame.

607
01:10:33,690 --> 01:10:36,240
Have you decided to use outright violence now?

608
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:42,520
This is the tea you ordered the royal physician to give to the queen.

609
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:43,590
So what?

610
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:47,700
Some things can not be forgiven in this world,

611
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:49,380
some things a human should not do.

612
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:52,040
That's exactly what I mean to say.

613
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:56,500
If you had an ounce of reason, you would not forgive the queen so easily for

614
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,890
leaving and returning to the palace as she wished.

615
01:10:58,890 --> 01:11:00,630
Why do you hate her so much?

616
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:03,030
I do not hate her.

617
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:07,700
I merely hate the sin and not the person.

618
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:13,390
At least pretend to be sorry for your crimes.

619
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:16,520
Could you do the same if it were you?

620
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:23,970
In front of my family, my husband, and your brother, Prince Gyeong In,

621
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:27,470
could you pretend that you were sorry?

622
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,940
Do you intend to see it to the end?

623
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:35,020
What will you do if I do?

624
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:38,230
Then I will have no choice.

625
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:41,980
The queen dowager... the queen dowager...

626
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:43,790
Your Majesty!

627
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:49,460
Your Majesty, please calm down.

628
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:50,590
If you don't know what happened, stay out of this matter.

629
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:52,070
I know what happened.

630
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:55,300
So please, calm down.

631
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,750
How can you tell me to calm down when you know?

632
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:00,240
Chief Royal Secretary, His Majesty is right.

633
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:03,040
Your Majesty, please continue.

634
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,720
What did you want to tell me?

635
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:08,720
Your Majesty, you cannot.

636
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,230
How can you tell me I cannot?

637
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:12,360
Your Majesty!

638
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:15,370
How fun.

639
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:20,990
A clown's show in the streets couldn't be as entertaining.

640
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:32,080
Your Majesty, now that the queen cannot have a child,

641
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,850
it's right for you to depose her.

642
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:36,960
What do you think?

643
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,460
If I must depose her,

644
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:42,330
I will depose you first.

645
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:50,740
Go ahead and try.

646
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,960
Why couldn't you hold back?

647
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:12,960
Did you not know that the queen dowager was waiting for you to mention deposing her?

648
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,510
I did, but I had no other choice.

649
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:22,760
You know that I was planning to depose her from the beginning.

650
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:25,760
It was for the sake of His Majesty.

651
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:30,260
If I had asked for her deposition then, he would have accepted easily.

652
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:34,260
But her supporters would have been against it.

653
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:37,370
They would have attacked the court and His Majesty so.

654
01:13:37,370 --> 01:13:42,900
My strategy to protect His Majesty would have ended up hurting him.

655
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,600
Why are you telling me this right now?

656
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:51,490
The one who prevented me from making this mistake was you.

657
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:55,650
It's because I did not know what the palace was like back then.

658
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:57,850
But now, I know.

659
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:59,880
You once told me this.

660
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,860
There are only two ways to survive in the palace.

661
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:07,510
It's either to trample them and kill them, or totally ignore them.

662
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:11,760
I have only one way left.

663
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,630
In order to depose the queen dowager, you need definite evidence and witnesses.

664
01:14:15,630 --> 01:14:19,760
Moreover, the court's discussion on the matter comes first.

665
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:26,180
Once the queen's father returns to the court, I will begin.

666
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:30,740
When the time comes, the court will make a request.

667
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:33,260
So you just wait until then.

668
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,380
Then, please hurry up.

669
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:39,870
I'm going to escort the queen's father when day breaks.

670
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:49,290
Your Excellency.

671
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:52,650
Your Excellency.

672
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:07,010
Your Excellency!

673
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,430
 The Crowned Clown

674
01:16:14,430 --> 01:16:24,540
