 I am in love with you, My Queen.

 Enough for my heart to feel as if it will burst out of my chest.

♫  It was a dream.  ♫

22
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,230
Isn't it difficult reducing repast?

23
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,320
No, it's not difficult at all.

24
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,460
If it is a task that aids you,

25
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,230
I will happily do it, Your Majesty.

26
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,470
Tell me what you want, My Queen.

27
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,730
I'll give you anything.

28
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,200
Didn't you give me the most precious gift?

29
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,380
 I miss you my entire life. Even if I die, I'm happy that I was able to meet you.

30
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,930
I'm talking about your heart, Your Majesty.

31
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,950
Besides that, is there anything else?

32
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,670
Since you're asking like that,

33
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,830
I did think of something just now.

34
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,230
What is that?

35
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:48,820
To be honest, from what the queen dowager said last time,

36
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,550
one of those things has been on my mind.

37
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,610
That is...

38
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,390
The thing is...

39
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,020
What she said about if there was someone to carry on your lineage,

40
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,290
when the public sentiment was rough because of the posters,

41
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,130
it would have been a source of strength for you.

42
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:25,980
I would like to have Your Majesty's child.

43
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,760
 Ha Seon

44
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,330
 Eunuch Jo, thank you.

45
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,180
Chief Royal Secretary.

46
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,490
I thought you had already left the palace.

47
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:26,910
I came to tell him the royal command for him to recite tomorrow at court.

48
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,820
But where is Ha Seon?

49
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,000
That is... Uh.

50
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,540
Where is Ha Seon?

51
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,350
Chief Royal Secretary.

52
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,760
Your Majesty, I came to deliver an urgent report.

53
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,090
Does it really have to be right now?

54
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,100
Yes, you must listen to it immediately.

55
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,260
It's an urgent matter, regarding life and death.

56
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:39,360
I did not know you had work left, Your Majesty.

57
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,140
I will leave you now.

58
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,500
Let's listen together, My Queen.

59
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,150
No, it's alright. I believe it is not a place for me.

60
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,760
You two should discuss this matter.

61
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,230
Your Highness, I will escort you.

62
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,410
Since when?

63
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,840
When did you become so close to the queen?

64
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,890
Wanting power to protect someone special and wanting to become the king.

65
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,380
Was this all because of the queen?

66
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,330
It's not solely because of the queen.

67
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,770
But...

68
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,510
Yes, she is.

69
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,170
You're out of your mind!

70
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,010
You are deceiving the queen.

71
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:46,800
She is looking not at you but at someone's shadow.

72
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,120
Even if you become the real king,

73
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,970
you will forever be a fake to the queen.

74
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:02,950
Then I'd rather confess the truth to her.

75
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:07,490
If you confess the truth, do you think she would accept you?

76
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,640
She is not that kind of person.

77
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,190
She is more proper than anyone.

78
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:18,390
Once you reveal your identity, both of you will fall to the lowest of points.

79
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,530
When you escaped the palace,

80
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,540
think of how you returned.

81
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,320
Wasn't it because of your younger sister?

82
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,140
To punish the ones who did that to your younger sister and to change the world.

83
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,220
Isn't that why you became the king?

84
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,390
We have mountains of work to do.

85
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,350
During the moments you hesitate and can't sever your heart,

86
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:45,020
not only the queen but this country and its citizens will also face danger.

87
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:51,990
Severing your feelings, that is the only method you can choose.

88
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,850
In the beginning, I tried to stop it as well.

89
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,570
But how can you block the exchange of feelings?

90
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,770
If it's really for Ha Seon,

91
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,930
then you should have stopped this using whatever means necessary.

92
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,740
It's not too late now. We must get a hold of Ha Seon.

93
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,900
For Ha Seon,  for the queen, and for the all of us,

94
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,970
it's the best path. Do you understand?

95
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,420
I understand.

96
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,960
 I want to have Your Majesty's child.

97
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,670
 During the moments you hesitate and can't sever your heart,

98
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:25,340
 not only the queen but this country and its citizens will also face danger.

99
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,160
 Severing your feelings,

100
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,080
 that is the only method you can choose.

101
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,790
I don't think I can.

102
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,760
Let's just go back.

103
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,280
I am afraid we might run into that damn monk.

104
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,230
Woon Sim is the only person who knows where Ha Seon is.

105
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,710
Let's go.

106
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,250
 The night air is so chilly. Oh.

107
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,110
You come here, here.

108
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,180
You guys are from Yongmun, right?

109
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,840
What took you so long to get here?

110
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,900
Where did you hide my brother?!

111
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,650
What do you mean I hid your brother?

112
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:32,930
My, don't act like you don't know. I saw it all.

113
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,020
Wait, wait.

114
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:39,030
Jeong Saeng, who can't even kill a fly had locked up a person?

115
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,910
I can guarantee you saw it wrong.

116
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,370
I only believe what I saw.

117
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,290
Of course! Why would she lie about it?

118
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,240
Dal Rae!

119
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:01,540
Why have you only come now? I've been so worried.

120
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,060
I'm here now because of this monk!

121
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,980
He locked my brother up.

122
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,200
Monk Jeong Saeng did?

123
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,270
I think there must be a misunderstanding.

124
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:23,220
Then, where did my brother go?

125
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,680
Let's go inside.

126
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,880
Let's go.

127
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:45,260

128
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,490
Did you just return from the palace, Lord?

129
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:01,100
Is the child in that room Ha Seon's sister?

130
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,270
Yes.

131
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:07,010
She was shocked after seeing the posters. She was looking for Ha Seon.

132
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,110
She came to me, I guess.

133
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:16,040
My Lord, why don't we have Dal Rae and Ha Seon meet each other?

134
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,900
You know where Ha Seon is, don't you?

135
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,040
I can't tell you.

136
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,030
Even if I say it, no one's going to believe me.

137
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:26,520
Even if Dal Rae finds out, it would just put her in danger.

138
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,010
But still...

139
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:32,230
If you trust me, don't ask me further.

140
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:42,580
Among the monks, someone might remember Ha Seon so having them stay here in the brothel is dangerous.

141
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,470
I think it would be better for them to stay at the temple.

142
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,520
You go with them.

143
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,280
I won't go to the temple.

144
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:56,500
Dal Rae, if you stay here, someone might think that the man in the posters is Ha Seon, and

145
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,420
try to harm you and Gap Soo.

146
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,350
How sad will your brother be if that happens?

147
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,490
Do you know where my brother is?

148
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,710
I heard that he's doing well.

149
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:15,690
Your brother is fine, so don't worry.

150
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,980
Then, why isn't he coming?

151
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,840
It's not that I can't trust you, Woon Sim.

152
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,520
It's driving me crazy.

153
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:33,060
If you go and stay at the temple, Ha Seon will reach you there.

154
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,710
Trust me and leave.

155
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,920
Lord, we got a message from the brothel.

156
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,380
That clown's sister went to the Beop Jeon temple where Monk Jeong Saeng is located.

157
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,350
The Beop Jeon temple?

158
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,840
I've never heard of it. Where is that?

159
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,030
It seems like a small temple where only the chief monk stays.

160
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,160
I will find out soon.

161
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,170
Hurry up.

162
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,750
I brought some ginger tea for His Majesty.

163
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,580
Yes, Your Highness.

164
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,000
 You are deceiving the queen.

165
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,460
 She is looking not at you but at someone's shadow.

166
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:31,590
 Even if you become the real king, you will forever be a fake to the queen.

167
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,310
Your Majesty.

168
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,230
Please drink it before it gets cold.

169
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,400
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

170
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,250
My queen, actually...

171
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,870
I hate ginger.

172
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,450
Pardon?

173
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,930
What do you mean?

174
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,160
Have you suddenly come to dislike ginger?

175
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,900
Or is what I made not to your liking?

176
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:28,370
No, it's not that. I think my appetite changed because I've been tired lately.

177
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,380
Don't mind it too much.

178
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:35,600
National affairs are important but please take care of your body.

179
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,240
Please keep an eye on His Majesty so he doesn't push himself too much.

180
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,770
Don't worry, Your Highness.

181
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:24,290
Your Majesty, have you decided to end your feelings?

182
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,210
I don't know.

183
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:33,230
I really don't know what to do.

184
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,230
Chief Royal Secretary's definitely right, and

185
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,070
I should do as he said, but

186
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,260
I've never experienced these kinds of feelings.

187
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,250
I've just learned how to love.

188
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,730
I don't know how to not love.

189
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,950
I wish someone would teach me.

190
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:09,140
 Your Majesty, it's Chief Royal Secretary.

191
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,830
I'll tell you what to say at the court.

192
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,840
We are going to enact the Dae Dong Policy starting from the Gyeonggi province.

193
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,090
We must start on the land survey before that happens.

194
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:51,250
Promote Ho Geol to a fifth level official in the Ministry of Finance.

195
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:56,740
Also, since we have many vacancies due to the local officers who embezzled,

196
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:01,610
order an ad hoc state examination.

197
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,460
I understand you are trying to block Sin Chi Soo's wealth with the Dae Dong policy, but

198
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,580
I am not sure what difference the ad hoc state examination would make.

199
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,290
This ad hoc state examination will be special.

200
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,300
Not only for the noblemen and commoners,

201
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,480
but we'll give testing rights to illegitimate sons as well.

202
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,190
Should I be telling you all this?

203
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:31,410
If you haven't made up your mind, then don't go out to court.

204
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:36,260
No, I'll do it.

205
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,810
 Your Majesty, that can't be!

206
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:44,620
This is a matter in which we will be recruiting people in the government that will be supporting you from close by.

207
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,580
So how can we open the state examination to commoners?

208
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,910
This will infuriate the heavens and shock the earth!

209
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:54,330
And to give to a government slave a fifth level position.

210
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,990
This is also against the law.

211
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,470
So please recant that awful command.

212
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,510
Are you saying you are rejecting a command I have given?

213
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:08,620
We are requesting you to recant it since it's not right.

214
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,530
I can't do that.

215
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,290
Your Majesty, there are many talented people in the Ministry of Finance.

216
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:19,520
Why is Joo Ho Geol the only man for the position?

217
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,230
Minister of Finance, give me your answer.

218
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,090
Do we have a better person than Joo Ho Geol in the Ministry of Finance?

219
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:29,510
The land survey project will take at least two years.

220
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:33,970
The person who can do the job as fast as you want

221
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,020
is Joo Ho Geol. No one can do better.

222
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:47,390
I am appointing Joo Ho Geol as a fifth official in the Ministry of Finance, so proceed as such!

223
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,390
Yes, Your Majesty.

224
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,850
 He's becoming more and more absurd.

225
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,050
The king seems to be going insane.

226
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:07,080
First, he collected taxes from the royal family members, and

227
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,220
now he's acting as if he is going to break the rigid, sacred laws.

228
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,450
All of this is probably a part of a strategy from Chief Royal Secretary.

229
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,270
So he wants to collect taxes from the landowners.

230
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,260
He'll utilize talented people vastly.

231
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,570
He made the justification in front, but

232
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,250
he's trying to take my wealth and get rid of my people, then fill the court with their people.

233
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,200
What are you planning to do now?

234
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,000
Let's wait and see.

235
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,320
If the noblemen and Confucian students are against him,

236
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,520
let's see if His Majesty and Chief Royal Secretary can do what they want.

237
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,580
 I miss you. I see you and see you again, but I keep wanting to see you.

238
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,710
 I miss you. I see you and see you again,

239
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,260
 but I keep wanting to see you.

240
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,400
It's white flower tea sent by the royal pharmacy.

241
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,870
Please drink it while it is warm.

242
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,470
I am worried that His Majesty is too focused on government affairs.

243
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,180
I want to do something for him

244
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,580
even if it fails, as long as it can comfort him.

245
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,650
Since you received a love letter, how about you write one back?

246
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,360
Write back?

247
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,860
Will His Majesty like it?

248
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,510
If you write him back with your lovely handwriting,

249
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:55,810
His Majesty will like it.

250
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,720
 Pear Blossoms Pavilion Records - Top Volume.

251
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,270
 My beloved, even if we are apart for a millennium,

252
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,450
 my faithful heart will remain steadfast.

253
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,420
 Seonghak Jibyo (Essentials of the Studies of the Sages)

254
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,750
This is by the previous king—

255
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:43,430
He personally transcribed this "Essentials of the Learning of the Sage" book.

256
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:48,660
If you practice using this as a textbook, it will be quite helpful in many ways.

257
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,340
 Chapter Three: On Exercising Restraint.

258
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,120
 Selections from the conversations of Master Zhu Xi.

259
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,240
 Master Zhu Xi, on conduct...

260
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,960
His writing is quite amazing.

261
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:14,490
No matter how hard I try, I don't think I can follow.

262
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,940
But I should still try, right?

263
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:47,580
 Ha Seon's random writing practices on Confucian Classics.

264
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:52,150
 Ha Seon's random writing practices on Confucian Classics.

265
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,820
 His focus on the Four Books...

266
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:14,280
 The Great Learning, Doctrine of the Mean, Analects...

267
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,960
 Mencius...

268
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:44,410
Where did you learn such baseless swordsmanship?

269
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,500
I thought you quit. How are you back?

270
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:01,400
I was going to, but I was uncomfortable just leaving the situation here like this.

271
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,360
But why are you suddenly speaking in honorifics to me?

272
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,840
The royal palace is a place with eyes and ears everywhere.

273
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,310
I need to speak in honorifics for my own safety

274
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:14,780
and so Your Majesty's safety can be secured as well.

275
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,160
Now I understand.

276
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,570
You have also fallen for me.

277
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:35,200
I know you want to deny it, so I will feign ignorance.

278
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:40,170
However, you said my swordsmanship was baseless. What in the world do you mean?

279
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:43,320
I learned from the best clown in Joseon.

280
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,390
Both your method and your posture

281
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,230
are pathetic and uneven.

282
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,640
Then teach me a stroke.

283
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,250
Fencing isn't something one can master easily.

284
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,540
First, after you learn how to hold the sword—

285
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,820
You are so talkative!

286
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,810
Do it again.

287
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,240
What is all this?

288
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:04,210
I made it to celebrate your promotion, My Lord.

289
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
Thank you.

290
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,620
 Let's try it on.

291
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,310
The clothing gives you wings.

292
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:22,910
Am I a fairy? What wings?

293
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:26,940
The face puts the final touch to the clothes.

294
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:32,860
I'm going to the royal court first, so come on time. Don't be late.

295
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,920
Do you think I'll be late on a day like this? Don't you worry.

296
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,880
The face?

297
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:48,100

298
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,150
My.

299
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,390
What is this?

300
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,690
You are...

301
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,680
What are you?

302
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,530
 Your Majesty, may you understand.

303
00:31:55,530 --> 00:32:00,540
What is this noise?

304
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:06,990
Your Majesty, the Sungkyunkwan scholars are outside Injeong Gate, blocking Joo Ho Geol's way.

305
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,720
What?

306
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:14,280
 Your Majesty, may you understand.

307
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:19,960
 Your Majesty, may you understand.

308
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,150
Your Majesty, the laws of nobles and commoners are strict.

309
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,220
To give commoners the right to take the state examination?

310
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,130
It cannot be.

311
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:55,260
May you please take back the royal command and make right the discipline and law of the nation.

312
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,790
May you understand.

313
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:01,530
May you understand.

314
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:14,180
 Injeong Gate

315
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,830
 Petition by Scholars

316
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,320
 Signatures by scholars

317
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:45,190
Your Majesty, I ran here upon hearing the news.

318
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,220
Is it so wrong to bring talented men

319
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,600
into the royal court?

320
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:05,240
It is not right for a lowly person like him to take on such an important task as supporting Your Majesty.

321
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,210
It will cause disorder in the royal court's discipline and bring disturbance to the entire nation.

322
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,990
We hope to protect the royal family and the nation.

323
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:19,010
Please do not ignore our devotion to upholding duty.

324
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:23,450
May you enforce the will of this nation's pillars.

325
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:26,230
May you enforce it.

326
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:31,220
Your Majesty, may you understand.

327
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:37,430
A man of low-status cannot do important work?

328
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,450
Have you given him the chance?

329
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:43,320
Have you watched whether or not those men can or cannot do important work?

330
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,800
It is work that serves Your Majesty in governing the nation.

331
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,270
We ask you to obey the heavens' will and practice proper politics.

332
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,820
If you recklessly give out chances to them,

333
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,650
it will be a failed policy that collapses this nation's discipline and order.

334
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,730
Proper politics?

335
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,400
The heavens' will?

336
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,070
Stop your dog crap!

337
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:17,640
If it is the heavens' will that low-borns cannot be, then I will not follow their will!

338
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,920
I will fight against it!

339
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,640
Move back!

340
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,470
Your Majesty, you cannot.

341
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,100
Truly, I cannot?

342
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:42,510
If you must go, step on our backs and go.

343
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,850
Your Majesty.

344
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,870
Your Highness,

345
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:07,740
I think I've misunderstood His Majesty until now.

346
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,800
For the benefit of a low-born,

347
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,700
I had no idea he would go to this extent.

348
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,630
Go on without me.

349
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:43,140
You sure roam around widely like a dog at a funeral house.

350
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,840
What is it that you want to say?

351
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:50,840
Since you were kicked out of the royal court, you should practice self-restraint to repent.

352
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:55,090
But you are supporting the views that oppose His Majesty.

353
00:37:55,090 --> 00:38:00,440
I don't know for how long I can turn a blind eye to your crimes.

354
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,040
The pot is calling the kettle black.

355
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,890
That clown, does His Majesty know about it?

356
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,070
The clown who has the same face as His Majesty

357
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:18,450
was entertaining at the brothel you frequent, and then disappeared.

358
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:23,730
Whoever hears that would raise the same doubts I have.

359
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:27,610
Such as, does the chief royal secretary have traitorous intent?

360
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,690
I'll ask as well.

361
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:32,400
Where is Court Lady Kim?

362
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,380
Why are you asking me about Court Lady Kim?

363
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,880
Court Lady Kim is a palace servant and is His Majesty's person.

364
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:45,130
For your own gain, not only did you conspire, but you also killed her privately.

365
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:48,150
If that gets out, it's akin to rebellion.

366
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:52,650
His Majesty will not just sit idly.

367
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:55,680
Something I don't know anything about and it hasn't even occurred,

368
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,620
you sure do speak of it in detail.

369
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,450
They say death is just outside the front door.

370
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:06,990
If you want your life preserved, you should take care to not leave your home and wander about.

371
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:09,980
And you,

372
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,500
you better take good care of that neck of yours.

373
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,730
You do have many more years left to live than me.

374
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,170
Right?

375
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,410
What you told me not to do,

376
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,190
I did it again.

377
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,260
You did well.

378
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,930
That's what a sovereign is.

379
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:51,230
Doing what others can't do, and taking responsibility for it.

380
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:55,050
Holding the hands of the people and carrying their weight.

381
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:58,560
That is the path of the king.

382
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,100
What if all the scholars and the ministers turn their backs?

383
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:07,720
In exchange, all the people will follow you.

384
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:21,730
 Post.

385
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:23,730
 Year of the Swine (1623).

386
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,460
What is written here?

387
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,500
A state examination will be held.

388
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:41,000
Anyone who wishes, without regard to status, can take the exam.

389
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,080
Anyone can take the state examination? What is this nation coming to?

390
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,150
Really?

391
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:53,740
Anybody can become a noble.

392
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:57,790
I had no idea that this day would come before I died.

393
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:03,090
Let's go buy exam paper right away.

394
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,730
Your Majesty, the queen over there...

395
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:27,190
Your Majesty, why don't we go now?

396
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,430
Just a little longer...

397
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,420
Let's stay a little longer before we go.

398
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:52,520
 Public Notice: list of names of civil servants who passed the humanities and military ad hoc state exams

399
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,650
Wait.

400
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,440
My Lord!

401
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,770
If you've read it, please step aside.

402
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:05,600
Oh! It's there.

403
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,580
Woo Jeong Lim.

404
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,980
What a day...

405
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,180
Your name is there too.

406
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,650
Where? Where?

407
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:18,030
Seo Jae Goo. Jae Goo!

408
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,160
 Imperial Notice: announcement of ad hoc state exam result

409
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:55,470
 Woo Jeong Lim, one of twenty-two civil servants who passed the ad hoc state exam.

410
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,450
 Your Majesty, the powerful nation that you hoped for...

411
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:06,440
 For that nation to come one day sooner, this is the only way.

412
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:09,660
 Do you think that's possible without me?

413
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,380
 Please do not worry.

414
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,900
 I'll put my life on the line,

415
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,260
 and definitely make it happen.

416
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:32,940
 Imperial Notice: Woo Jeong Lim, one of twenty-two civil servants who passed the ad hoc state exam.

417
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:45,170
These are the civil servants that passed the examination this time and have been appointed to a probationary position.

418
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:49,730
Ninth-level inspector in the Ministry of Rites, Woo Jung Lim.

419
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:55,050
Ninth-level officer in the Ministry of Foreign Relations, Seo Jae Woo.

420
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:12,080
Do your best so that the ministers who opposed you will have to flatten their noses.

421
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:18,650
Thank you, Your Majesty.

422
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,660
Please stand up now.

423
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,490
You're about to drool.

424
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:42,380
You must be happy.

425
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,710
You get to see His Majesty at this distance every day.

426
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:49,580
He is such an amazing, kind person.

427
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,730
 Your Majesty,

428
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:20,750
 I have something to confess to you.

429
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,830
Your Highness,

430
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:46,900
shall I bring it over secretly?

431
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,420
It's all right.

432
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,250
I'll go in and deliver it, so you wait here.

433
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,630
Yes.

434
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:17,650
 Ha Seon's random writing practices on Confucian Classics.

435
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,900
Your Majesty.

436
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:48,880
My Queen.

437
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:52,860
What are you doing in the library at this time?

438
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:59,090
I came by to see if you were here.

439
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:01,010
I see.

440
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:10,380
Your Majesty, are you worried about something?

441
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,470
Your face is full of worry.

442
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,330
Is that how I look?

443
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,230
I am not, though.

444
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:23,950
I don't know precisely, but I can feel it.

445
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:31,240
Please tell me even if you are worried about something, even if it is the size of a speck of dust.

446
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:36,200
If there's anything I can do to help you, I will.

447
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:52,440
 Your Majesty. This is Eunuch Jo.

448
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:06,440
Your Highness.

449
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,730
Your Majesty, the discussions will start soon.

450
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:21,550
So let's go to the side palace.

451
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:36,250
I should get going.

452
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,160
 Ah, do you really need to do that?

453
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,900
Eat slowly.

454
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,500
Why did you take the examination when you don't even know the Chinese characters?

455
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,300
Good work.

456
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,590
Let's all drink.

457
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,420
You have one, too.

458
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:14,190
You should drink on a day like this.

459
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:20,120
Today's guests of honor...

460
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,450
Good work.

461
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:24,000
You worked hard, too.

462
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,760
To the brim.

463
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,010
Good work.

464
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:29,920
You, too.

465
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,460
 Just one drink.

466
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:32,920
 Here, here.

467
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,050
 Me too, me too.

468
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:43,300
Take this with you. I've packed some food.

469
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:48,280
Gap Soo and Dal Rae will enjoy it.

470
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,340
I'll get going then.

471
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,870
 Cheong Wolgag (courtesan pavilion)

472
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,750
Are you back?

473
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:29,090
I brought some food. Eat with Dal Rae.

474
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:30,570
Yes.

475
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,940
Dal Rae! Dal Rae!

476
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:47,580
What's taking you so long? Come out quickly.

477
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:52,140
Dal Rae.

478
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:59,450
Looks good, right? Let's go in and eat.

479
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:07,730
My Lord, I found Beop Jeon Temple where that clown's sister is hiding.

480
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,340
Should I go now and drag her here?

481
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,170
No.

482
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:16,110
I'll go check myself.

483
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:36,300
What brings you here?

484
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:39,700
Foreman.

485
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:43,170
Go search the place thoroughly so that not even a rat can escape.

486
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:45,000
Yes!

487
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:49,560
What kind of behavior is this, in a temple that serves Buddha?

488
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:00,360
Let go. Let go of this.

489
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,650
I said let go!

490
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:15,950
Foreman.

491
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:19,150
Open it.

492
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:35,300
 Beop Jeon Temple

493
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:54,040
Sit down.

494
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:00,140
Are you comfortable here?

495
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,520
Look, Officer Jang.

496
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:14,050
Why do they have to stay at my house and not at the temple?

497
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:19,240
Chief Royal Secretary said he'll set a rat trap at the temple and told me to come here.

498
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,750
A rat trap?

499
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,560
How many rats could there be in that small temple?

500
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:29,100
He said we need to entrust these two people to someone we could trust, so I came here.

501
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,280
Please look after them for a while despite the inconvenience.

502
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,370
Then...

503
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:38,640
Officer Jang.

504
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,850
Sleep over.

505
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:41,470
Excuse me?

506
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:46,790
Look at the looks in their eyes.

507
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:51,170
They didn't seem to take me kindly.

508
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:54,870
So if you leave, they might attack me at night.

509
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:55,930
Let go of this.

510
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:59,240
Please, uh? Please...

511
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,420
Do you need anything else?

512
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:13,200
No.

513
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:36,030
I never thought I'd see you here.

514
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:40,090
Have you come to pray for Buddha's mercy?

515
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:44,310
Mercy? What can you do with something like that?

516
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,480
I came to find a girl named Dal Rae.

517
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,150
Have you seen her?

518
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:53,330
When you say Dal Rae... ah!

519
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:58,780
Isn't that the clown's sister you asked Woon Sim about?

520
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:03,150
Are you by chance looking for that clown on the poster?

521
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:07,750
You are searching for the clown who looks like His Majesty so desperately.

522
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:12,970
Some may think you hold treasonous intent.

523
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:18,750
Aren't you here to find that clown, too?

524
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,030
I came to pray.

525
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:27,240
Seeing that you are here and saying it like that,

526
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,740
it verifies my hunch even further.

527
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,380
I heard the fox only sees the chicken in his dreams.

528
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:40,220
Since your heart is full of treasonous intent,

529
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:43,480
you must think all the others are like you.

530
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:48,690
You are the same as me.

531
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:51,690
You may fool other people, but you can't fool my eyes.

532
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:55,710
Even pleasant words are sickening if you keep hearing them.

533
00:56:55,710 --> 00:57:01,320
Before I report what you've been doing to His Majesty in detail,

534
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,230
you should stop here.

535
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:23,510
But whose plaque is this for?

536
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:28,470
It's for my friend who came like the cloud and wind, then left this world.

537
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,280
Have nice prayers.

538
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,360
Let's go.

539
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,450
 The Classic of Poetry

540
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:06,420
 Essentials of the Studies of the Sages

541
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:28,970
 Essentials of the Studies of the Sages

542
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:42,530
 Pages of "Essentials of the Studies of the Sages" book.

543
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,650
 A page of "Essentials of the Studies of the Sages" book.

544
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:01,580
 Ha Seon's random writing practices on Confucian Classics.

545
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,800
 Ha Seon's random writing practices on Confucian Classics.

546
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:24,560
 Ha Seon's random writing practices on Confucian Classics.

547
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,170
 Essentials of the Studies of the Sages, Book Three

548
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,780
What happened?

549
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,670
 My beloved, even if we are apart for a millennium, my faithful heart will remain steadfast.

550
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:41,920
 Even if we are apart for a thousand years,

551
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:46,340
 how could my feelings of love be changed?

552
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:10,680
Your Highness, you hid your love letter properly this time, right?

553
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:20,410
Your Highness, did something happen in the library?

554
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:25,430
Your Highness.

555
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:50,270
 My beloved, even if we are apart for a millennium, my faithful heart will remain steadfast.

556
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:54,460
 My queen, the truth is...

557
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,710
 I don't like ginger.

558
01:01:57,710 --> 01:02:00,680
 What do you mean?

559
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:03,560
 Did you suddenly come to dislike ginger?

560
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:09,070
 Or is what I made not to your liking?

561
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:10,960
 No.

562
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,920
 My tastes must have changed as I've been tired of late.

563
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,360
 Don't worry about it.

564
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:22,650
 What is joy?

565
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:25,450
 And what is happiness?

566
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:31,970
 I haven't given you anything yet.

567
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:36,210
 So the joy and happiness I didn't give you,

568
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,640
 erase them immediately.

569
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:42,420
 I'll let you know for sure

570
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:46,360
 whose woman you truly are.

571
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:51,660
 You seemed like a different person last night.

572
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:55,290
 That's why I like it.

573
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:02,300
 Now that I see you again, you really are handsome.

574
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:07,130
 Isn't it amazing to know there's another handsome face like this?

575
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:34,380
 The Daejojeon Hall (Hall of Great Creation)

576
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:40,860
No one follows me.

577
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,060
Your Highness.

578
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,550
 Essentials of the Studies of the Sages

579
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:07,530
 Your Majesty, I have something to confess to you.

580
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:13,050
 I actually didn't want to become the queen.

581
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:19,700
 I never once let my heart in this place.

582
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:28,740
 But one day, Your Majesty suddenly became different.

583
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,710
 You made me smile.

584
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:37,950
 If you are to live here, which house would you pick?

585
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:40,520
 You made me dream.

586
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:45,120
 I'd like that house.

587
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:53,290
 If it's that small, we can just turn our heads and see each other.

588
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:57,720
 And it is at the end of the street.

589
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:03,670
 If we lived in that house, the path I walk with you will be the longest.

590
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:10,230
 I fell in love with you, and I deeply respect you.

591
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:18,110
 Hence, I want to live with you now,

592
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:24,030
 be at your side, and bear your children.

593
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:26,530
 And as we hear their laughter,

594
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:31,730
 I want to be with you like that for a very long time together.

595
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:49,370
 If you are worried about something,

596
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:52,550
 tell me.

597
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,800
 Even if it is the size of a speck of dust.

598
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:00,360
 If there's anything I can do to help, I will.

599
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,660
I came to see the queen. Tell her.

600
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:23,010
I am sorry, but the queen is not here.

601
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:25,610
Then where is she?

602
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:32,780
Your Majesty, the queen is at your palace now.

603
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:42,920
It's okay.

604
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,460
You all leave now.

605
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:16,520
My queen.

606
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:28,300
I didn't know you were here, so I went to your palace.

607
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:38,670
I read your love letter.

608
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:49,230
I also have something to confess to you.

609
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:54,860
I couldn't bring myself to say it all this time.

610
01:08:57,090 --> 01:08:58,460
But I must tell you today.

611
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:04,640
Before that, I'd like to ask you something.

612
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:17,050
Your Majesty, do you remember

613
01:09:17,050 --> 01:09:19,510
the day you met me for the first time?

614
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:24,830
You can't remember?

615
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:30,770
That is...

616
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:38,460
Since you are asking me suddenly, I can't remember it well.

617
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:42,870
That can happen.

618
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:48,880
I sometimes forget many things, too.

619
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:56,920
Let me ask you one more question.

620
01:09:57,850 --> 01:09:59,530
Your Majesty.

621
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:04,380
What is my name?

622
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:17,160
Your Majesty.

623
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:21,400
Please call out my name.

624
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:54,390
 My beloved, even if we are apart for a millennium, my faithful heart will remain steadfast.

625
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:15,680
Who are you?

626
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,890
Who are you?

627
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:38,800
 The Crowned Clown

628
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:49,480

629
01:11:57,130 --> 01:11:59,320
 Preview

630
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:02,130
 All of this is my crime.

631
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:04,630
 That was the first time I've seen that look in her eyes.

632
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:06,300
 I shouldn't have approached her in the first place.

633
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:08,180
 It's none of my business to know your crimes.

634
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:10,660
 I wish to never see you again.

635
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:14,980
 I think the heavens are determined to help Prince Jin Pyeong.

636
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:18,050
 It's only right to dethrone the queen and order her to drink the poison.

637
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:20,820
 I said never!

638
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:25,350
I vowed to myself to make you the king and swore to keep you there.

639
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:27,370
 Seal the stamp.
