1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:09,890

2
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,620
 The Crowned Clown

3
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,990
 This drama and its characters and events are all part of  a fictional work.

4
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,970
There is no way for me to hide any longer

5
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,360
the reason why my heart flutters so.

6
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,900
I have come to love you, Your Majesty.

7
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,620
Your Majesty.

8
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,360
Your Majesty.

9
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,500
Your Majesty, are you okay?

10
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,420
I'm... fine.

11
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,690
Your Majesty.

12
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm... fine.

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,230
Your Majesty.

14
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,470
I'm... fine.

15
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:15,200
Your Majesty, please hold your breath.
  Episode 6

16
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:27,620
I already did, many times earlier, didn't I? It's useless.

17
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,750
Then, I'll have to use a last resort.

18
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,030
Extend your tongue out all the way.

19
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,860
And gather it up at the front while holding your breath.

20
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,950
Forget it.

21
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,190
Then, there is another method too.

22
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:55,670
Lie like this and pull your legs to your chest.

23
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:01,040
While holding your breath.

24
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,330
Eunuch Jo. Eunuch Jo.

25
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,880
Never mind. It'll probably stop on its own.

26
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,990
It's already been one branch hour (two hours). Shouldn't we summon the royal physician?

27
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,910
It's alright. It will stop soon.

28
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,600
Perhaps it is caused by me?

29
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,370
No! Definitely not!

30
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,700
The weather's been rather chilly so my body was probably startled.

31
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,450
Are you going to be alright?

32
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,190
Of course.

33
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:44,360
I wish to lie down, so may you return now.

34
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,090
I understand.

35
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,990
Then, I will leave.

36
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,620
Your Majesty, it stopped!

37
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,100
I think it ran its course.

38
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,410
Thank goodness.

39
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,920
I will have them prepare your sleeping wear right away.

40
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,550
The more days pass, the more I lie.

41
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,120
Your Highness, are you unwell?

42
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,230
No.

43
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,960
I just wish to distance myself slowly.

44
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,600
What?

45
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:17,250
Tonight, it seems both the moon and the stars are brighter than ever.

46
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,820
But there are so many clouds.

47
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,450
 Joo Ho Geol

48
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,060
 Joo Ho Geol

49
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,390
Good job.

50
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:44,050
Summon me whenever you need me again.

51
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,020
Father.

52
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,020
Father, I apologize for plotting something without your approval.

53
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,140
I thought that Joo Ho Geol needed to disappear in order to stop Chief Royal Secretary.

54
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,740
So this is evidence Joo Ho Geol is dead?

55
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,590
Yes.

56
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,280
You paid without even seeing a corpse?

57
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,150
How can you do your work so haphazardly?

58
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,990
I apologize.

59
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,550
Yi Gyeom, if you've started something, you need to see it to its end so you don't leave any secrets.

60
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,340
Mark my words.

61
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,930
Yes, Father.

62
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,260
 I've come to love you, Your Majesty.

63
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,910
 I've come to love you, Your Majesty.

64
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,210
 I've come to love you, Your Majesty.

65
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,350
Why in the world?

66
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,630
Your Majesty?

67
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,640
Do you have some sort of problem?

68
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,700
How outrageous!

69
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,680
I apologize.

70
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,150
I merely thought that Your Majesty hadn't slept well.

71
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,360
I wasn't saying it to you.

72
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,530
I was just thinking of something else momentarily.

73
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,140
Eunuch Jo.

74
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,580
Do His Majesty and I really look so much alike?

75
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,810
Well, that...

76
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:39,340
I was startled the first time too, but when you returned upon being injured by the sword,

77
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:45,270
even I, myself, wonder if the real king has returned, at times.

78
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,580
I am fooled.

79
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,530
Fooled?

80
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,860
Fooled.

81
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,740
You are right.

82
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,870
It's not me. It's the king.

83
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,150
Your Majesty.

84
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,280
This is the path toward the queen's palace.

85
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,880
How did I end up here?

86
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:16,710
Your Majesty. The queen is coming.

87
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:37,940
Your Majesty, I was actually on my way to greet you.

88
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,140
By chance, are you on your way to visit me?

89
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,710
Actually, I was on my way to the side palace.

90
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,310
I was lost in thought and lost my way, it seems.

91
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,860
You appear a bit gaunt.

92
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,560
Did you have hiccups all night?

93
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,540
 I've come to love you, Your Majesty.

94
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,520
Your Majesty?

95
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,720
No. It stopped right away.

96
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,500
I was confused, but then I thought of something while seeing you hiccup last night.

97
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,270
I plan to make the tea with ginseng you used to love when you were the crown prince.

98
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:40,730
It's effective for digestion too, so you will not suffer from hiccups again.

99
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,690
Please do so.

100
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,600
Then, I have urgent matters waiting, so ...

101
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,330

102
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,420
 Hanseong Manor 
(Hanseong was the former name of Seoul)

103
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,230
How is the preparation for tomorrow's morning audience?

104
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:45,710
The inspection found no issue with Haeyu Certificates.

105
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,300
We should see no trouble in finding the Minister of Finance, Lee Han Jong's crimes.

106
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,900
But it's that rascal Joo Ho Geol that worries me.

107
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,890
If somehow the chief royal secretary assigned him to find evidence of embezzlement,

108
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,220
then the power will flip over at once to our disadvantage.

109
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,440
Do not worry since that will never happen.

110
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,490
Is there still no contact from the chief royal secretary?

111
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,230
No, not yet.

112
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,850
 I am sorry, Your Highness.

113
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,300
 His Majesty is not present at his palace.

114
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,200
This is fresh ginger tea sent in by the queen.

115
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,420
It seems to have chilled, so shall I have it heated?

116
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,110
No. You may leave.

117
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,670
I can't eat ginger.

118
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,650
Was it when I was seven? I went with old man Gapsoo to a noble lord's manor.

119
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:32,020
I stole and ate a ginger biscuit and almost died from acute indigestion.

120
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:37,660
It was so pungent and at times I can still feel that spicy taste come up.

121
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,050
It was because it wasn't mine.

122
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,310
It's best not to lay a hand on

123
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,240
things that don't suit your body in the first place

124
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,330
since you can get sick.

125
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,620
I understand.

126
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,510
Then allow me to take the tea away.

127
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,050
You drink it in my stead at least, please.

128
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,070
What?

129
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,630
If I just send out this precious thing,

130
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:09,470
wouldn't the queen's sincerity be put to waste?

131
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,080
I think you stood at His Majesty's courtyard for too long.

132
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,830
I will take care of sending ginger tea to His Majesty from now on.

133
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,980
I think it's best to reduce your standing in the cold.

134
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,390
Thank you for your worry.

135
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:38,420
But I wish to present the ginger tea to His Majesty personally.

136
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,950
Shall I bring you tea to melt away the chill?

137
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,550
Yes.

138
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,120
- Left State Minister. 
- Left State Minister.

139
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,830
Yes, Minister of Finance. Minister of Rites.

140
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,330
But I don't see the chief royal secretary?

141
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:32,810
I heard he has not arrived at court yet.

142
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,620
Chief Royal Secretary is absent from the morning audience?

143
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,620
I am having to report more and more incidents of Chief Royal Secretary to His Majesty, and that's quite a problem.

144
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:02,560
Your Majesty, it's time to go to the side palace.

145
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,820
But the chief royal secretary is still not here?

146
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,950
Yes.

147
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,050
Let's go.

148
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,520
Your Majesty, upon inspecting the Haeyu Certificates seized from the Ministry of Finance,

149
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,140
it's revealed no issues were found.

150
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,230
Using the perfectly fine Haeyu Certificates and hiding them to stir up trouble in the royal court

151
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,310
is an act for which the minister of finance should be punished.

152
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,160
Your Majesty, as the minister of finance,

153
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,650
I have only done my utmost to carry out my duty.

154
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,490
If it's a crime to exhaust myself to find corruption and embezzlement done by provincial governments,

155
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:44,220
I shall seek to vacate myself from my duty and retire to my hometown.

156
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,440
That cannot be.

157
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:54,520
Your Majesty, you must severely punish Minister of Finance, who is trying to escape his punishment with a nonsensical excuse.

158
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,250
Your Majesty, Minister of Justice is right.

159
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:03,230
It is only correct to severely punish the minister of finance to uphold the discipline of the court.

160
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,980
Your Majesty, please understand.

161
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,710
Please understand.

162
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,690
I shall...

163
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:19,520
 Your Majesty, the chief royal secretary enters.

164
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,520
Your Majesty, I beg your forgiveness for my late arrival.

165
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,380
Come on in. What's kept you delayed?

166
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:49,050
I was late due to finding evidence of embezzlement in Haeyu Certificates.

167
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,900
Evidence of embezzlement?

168
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,980
Your Majesty, there is no existence of such a thing.

169
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,840
Together with Chief Royal Secretary's crime of negligence to your morning audience,

170
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,210
please also charge him of making false accusations.

171
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:08,420
Your Majesty, whether the evidence of embezzlement is true or false,

172
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:12,310
may you hear it from the one who found the evidence personally.

173
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,240
Allow him in.

174
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,210
I greet Your Majesty.

175
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,390
Chief Royal Secretary, what are you doing?

176
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:44,520
How dare you bring a slave into the audience of His Majesty and high ministers of the court.

177
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,490
Your Majesty! He has brought down the discipline of the court.

178
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:52,870
May you add this to the chief royal Secretary's crimes and send out this slave.

179
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:59,140
Though he is a government slave, he is also an official in the Ministry of Finance and found evidence of embezzlement in Haeyu Certificates.

180
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,460
He is well qualified to be in His Majesty's attendance.

181
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,790
Report to His Majesty.

182
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:09,070
Your Majesty, after looking through the Haeyu Certificates and the tribute ledgers,

183
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,590
I found that rice tributes were received at prices higher than market price

184
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:17,320
and evidence of profit from it.

185
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,480
Stop lying.

186
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,120
You claim the tributes were priced higher than market price but these tributes do not have a market price.

187
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,220
How could you know?

188
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,440
Your words are correct.

189
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,570
Hence it was difficult, and I had to convert each tribute good into the price of rice

190
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,410
and compare that to market price.

191
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,380
What nonsense! That is not something one can do alone.

192
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:48,720
Your Majesty, I have recorded the evidence of embezzlement

193
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,610
found in Haeyu Certificates and tribute ledgers here.

194
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:26,370
 Listing of paper trail evidence of grains being sold at higher prices without authorization from the  Royal Treasury which manages the Bureau of Royal Supply (of grains, for instance)

195
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,910
Minister of Finance's claim was right.

196
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:52,870
Your Majesty, though evidence has been shown, it is the Ministry of Finance's failure to carry out its duty properly

197
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:56,980
which allowed embezzlement by the provincial governments, and that is a fact that has not disappeared.

198
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,860
Hence, before you look into the embezzlement matter,

199
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,380
it shall be proper to hold Minister of Finance accountable for his crime first.

200
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,860
Your Majesty, Minister of General Affair's words are just an excuse.

201
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:12,590
He seized the Haeyu Certificates from the Ministry of Finance and exonerated provincial governments.

202
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:16,160
It is proper to hold Minister of General Affairs accountable for his crime.

203
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,320
Left State Minister is right.

204
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,430
I shall punish severely Minister of General Affairs as well as the provincial governments who committed embezzlement.

205
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,660
Your Majesty.

206
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,060
I apologize, but I have a plea.

207
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,790
Speak.

208
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,840
Last night, someone tried to kill me.

209
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:25,620
 Who is it? Who hired you to kill Joo Ho Geol?

210
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,050
 The son of Left State Minister.

211
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,740
 I will give you ten-fold what he's paying you.

212
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,860
 Go and say to him what I instruct you.

213
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,220
Your Majesty, someone tried to hire an assassin to murder me.

214
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,020
Please punish him.

215
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,120
Who is that man?

216
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:08,910
It was the son of the Left State Minister, Sin Yi Gyeom.

217
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:14,580
How dare you. Who do you think you are to lie in front of His Majesty?

218
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,910
The man who tried to murder me is currently being detained in the prison cells at the Royal Investigation Bureau.

219
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,830
Should I call for him?

220
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,350
Drag in Sin Yi Gyeom!

221
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,990
What is the punishment for a failed attempt at murder?

222
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:59,570
Just for harboring the intent of killing someone, he deserves execution,

223
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:03,390
but Sin Yi Gyeom is the son of a trusted servant and a sixth rank government official.

224
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:07,090
We may lay down his punishment, but if Left State Minister and Office of Censors were to collude with one another,

225
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:13,250
it's obvious they'll make it appear as though he were checking the king, and ask for amnesty.

226
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:17,150
You're saying they'll turn a blind eye to his crime?

227
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,730
That can't be!

228
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:23,910
If executing is too hard, then we should at least order him to be flogged until he excretes blood!

229
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:31,010
There is a way to humiliate Sin Yi Gyeom and teach him a good lesson.

230
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:33,010
What is that?

231
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,650
 Munjeongjeon Palace
(Council Palace used by the king for state affairs)

232
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,570
Your Majesty!

233
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:21,470
Sixth rank officer of the Office of Censors, Sin Yi Gyeom, raise your head.

234
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:25,570
The crime of having the intent to kill another

235
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:29,930
is a grievous crime that deserves to be dealt with according to the Royal Mandate for Punishments.

236
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:36,120
However, as your father is a distinguished retainer who is second to none in his services towards me and the court,

237
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:41,850
and as Joo Ho Geol has not been harmed, I will forgive your crimes.

238
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,170
However, in order to give the world a warning against such attempts,

239
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:51,610
I will give the father an opportunity to punish the son.

240
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:58,040
Left State Minister Sin Chi Soo, step forward and give 100 whippings to your son Sin Yi Gyeom.

241
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,320
Father...

242
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:29,340
Your Majesty, how could you punish a distinguished retainer for his inability to morally train his household?

243
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:33,380
This is a humiliation like no other. I plead with you to withdraw your orders!

244
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,320
Your Majesty.

245
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:48,810
I would rather have you punish my son according to the Royal Mandate for Punishments.

246
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:54,710
Your Excellency, how can you refuse His Majesty's unending grace in such a way?

247
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,970
Proceed as ordered!

248
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,360
One!

249
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,320
Two!

250
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,090
Three!

251
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,230
Four!

252
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,730
Five!

253
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,120
Six!

254
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,210
Stand up straight.

255
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,580
Seven!

256
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,790
Seventeen!

257
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,810
My Lord, what will happen to me now?

258
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,470
My Lord!

259
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:51,400

260
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:06,190
You must have worked hard to calculate all that over one night.

261
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,070
What is this smell?

262
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:38,970
I apologize.

263
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:44,210
I was lying in between corpses laid out at the magistrate all night,

264
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:49,230
so even after washing myself, the odor isn't going away easily.

265
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,700
Your courage... is extraordinary.

266
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,710
I didn't muster up that courage from the beginning.

267
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:07,020
When Chief Royal Secretary first suggested the plan, I jumped up telling him to stop the nonsense.

268
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:12,100
If Officer Jang hadn't appeared, I wouldn't have dared.

269
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,770
The credit shouldn't be mine.

270
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:17,200
I just followed Chief Royal Secretary's orders.

271
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:29,280
Just in case, I suggested that he watch Joo Ho Geol's back.

272
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,470
I wish to release you from your status as a slave-servant and give you a government post.

273
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,090
What position would you like?

274
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:49,450
I would like the position of Arithmetic Tutor. 
(A 9th rank officer part of the Ministry of Finance)

275
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,350
Arithmetic Tutor.

276
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:56,710
You could ask His Majesty for a slightly higher position.

277
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,410
Why are you asking for a mere 9th rank officer post?

278
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,690
You've chosen a good position.

279
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:07,540
If His Majesty were to assign you to a higher post, there would be some opposition from both the Ministry of Finance and the court.

280
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:11,550
But if you were to become an arithmetic tutor, you won't need to butt heads with higher-ranking officers

281
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:14,450
and will just need to educate prospective Ministry of Finance officers,

282
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,830
which will be extremely helpful for the administration of the Dae Dong Policy in the future.

283
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:24,780
If Joo Ho Geol will educate people properly, we can administer the Dae Dong Policy even sooner.

284
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,580
Administer the Dae Dong Policy?

285
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:35,250
Your Majesty! Are you really only going to take rice as tax, from only those with land?

286
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,730
Well...

287
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,950
Yes. That has been a lifelong dream of mine.

288
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:02,510
I will do my very best with all my energy to educate the officers!

289
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,530
Queen.

290
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:36,920
Your Majesty, I heard that you were able to gather rice for the impoverished and have been waiting for you here.

291
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,710
I don't know how I can show my gratitude.

292
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,570
The one who should be showing gratitude is me. Thank you.

293
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:46,700
Thanks to you, I feel like I've acted like a king for the very first time.

294
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,240
What do you mean the first time? You're being too humble.

295
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,690
Just... a figure of speech.

296
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:08,630
Your Majesty, today's incident is nothing but pain deeply engraved into my very bones.

297
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,150
What pained you so?

298
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:14,990
All along, there have been those jealous of me who would slander me with false claims,

299
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:18,950
but yet, you have always trusted me and allowed me to manage the nation's affairs.

300
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:21,260
I wasn't able to repay your grace

301
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:27,270
but have imposed on you and the court, and I know not how to atone for my sins.

302
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:33,250
If you had asked me to hand over my government position and my head,

303
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:37,090
it would be better than how I feel at this moment.

304
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,260
So what is it that you want to say?

305
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,360
Just because of a lowly slave-servant, not only I, but also my son

306
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,590
had to endure humiliation so severe that we can't hold our heads up.

307
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:52,700
I'm just worried that, perhaps, it will cause the dignity of your court to crumble.

308
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,780
If a state councilor like myself can have something like this happen,

309
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:01,490
who would be willing to loyally advise you and take care of the nation's affairs?

310
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:06,880
I plead with you, for the sake of the dignity of both the court and this nation,

311
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,360
today's humiliation should rightfully be rectified.

312
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,990
Left State Minister, I have something I must ask.

313
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:22,020
Yes, Your Majesty. Please ask.

314
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,570
With your mouth, you say you are a loyal servant,

315
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:30,930
then how do you turn a blind eye to the sighs and moans of pain of our weak people?

316
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:36,820
How can you remain deaf to the resentful cries of the innocent?

317
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,060
Did you just say, a mere "lowly" slave-servant?

318
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:44,550
That dignity you so dearly wish to protect

319
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:48,790
is nothing more than the horns on an insect when compared to Joo Ho Geol's life.

320
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:52,850
If it is something that harms my people, no matter how small it may be,

321
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:57,030
I swear to the heavens that I will not let them pass lightly!

322
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,130
But, Your Majesty, that was—

323
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:04,320
I don't wish to hear this! Take your leave!

324
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:09,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

325
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:30,970

326
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:41,520
You must be heading out to collect donations.

327
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,460
I'll be back before it gets dark, so don't worry about preparing dinner.

328
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,990
That sounds good to me.

329
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,540
Have a safe trip.

330
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,980
It sounds like he's going to bring us something tasty again!

331
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,760
Let's go chop wood.

332
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:02,690
No. You're not allowed to stay on your own.

333
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:06,690
You need to be right in front of me for my mind to be at peace.

334
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,030
Come on. Let's go.

335
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,100
Why? What's wrong?

336
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,370
Right now?

337
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,910
What to do?

338
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,980
We need to chop a bit more wood.

339
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,340
Oh, alright. Go quick.

340
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,420
If you go that way, there's a cliff.

341
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:02,200
So go this way. This way.

342
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,750
Go on.

343
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:10,530
You can't go about your business on the roads where people are, alright?

344
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,590
Please, one coin.

345
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,110
Just one coin.

346
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:20,290
Please donate just one coin.

347
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,400
Thank you, My Lord.

348
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:37,340
Head over there and say you were sent by Hak San, and they'll give you a meal.

349
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,400
They'll prepare a nice—

350
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,840
Why would you...

351
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:53,580
I was told to wish you pleasant travel to the afterlife.

352
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,380
Let's go!

353
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:07,680
Sheesh, he could have woken me up and gone with me. Headed to the office first, now is it?

354
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,530
Lord! Are you alright?!

355
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,270
Lord.

356
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,650
What's wrong?

357
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,690
Hyungnim! Hyungnim!!

358
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:22,010
Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

359
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,890
Hyungnim.

360
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:32,050
I'm so stupid. I've got to go and call a physician.

361
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,240
No need.

362
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,690
Are you awake?

363
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:43,210
Hyungnim, why wouldn't I call a physician?

364
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,200
Nothing good will come out from hearing that the chief royal secretary,

365
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,640
who serves His Majesty directly, has been stabbed.

366
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:54,120
Jeong Saeng. Call Jeong Saeng.

367
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,890
Jeong... You mean Jeong Saeng Hyungnim?

368
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,210
Yes.

369
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:07,360
My Lord. We will send someone to get Jeong Saeng,

370
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:11,620
so please hold on for a bit.

371
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,740
You're saying that Chief Royal Secretary took a day off?

372
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,720
Yes, I was surprised as well.

373
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,830
But then again, he hasn't had a rest in a while.

374
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:27,990
It is time for him to rest a bit as well.

375
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,430
Well...

376
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:07,730
It seems like you didn't sleep very well all night. Your complexion...

377
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,940
I've felt a bit frustrated as of late,

378
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:13,060
so I haven't been able to fall asleep. That may be why.

379
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,340
Your Highness! Are you alright?

380
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:29,160
I wonder why this could be. I need to go see His Majesty.

381
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:32,950
Your Highness!

382
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:43,740
 Seonpyeong Gate

383
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:08,300
Your Majesty.

384
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,790
I apologize.

385
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:16,390
No, what should you apologize about?

386
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:21,580
Don't worry. It's just a simple ache that will pass.

387
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:24,030
No need to say anything.

388
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:27,280
Just rest comfortably.

389
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,320
Why did the queen faint?

390
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:15,790
It seems she has been weakened in both heart and body due to various incidents of late.

391
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:20,180
But if she stays like this, things will only be worse,

392
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:23,180
so I wonder if she could go somewhere for a change of air.

393
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,720
Go somewhere?

394
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:37,270
Your Majesty, isn't it for Her Highness' health?

395
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:39,720
Why are you hesitating?

396
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,150
That may be so,

397
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:47,750
but I don't know if I can make that call without Chief Royal Secretary being here.

398
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:53,100
Even if he were here, he would agree.

399
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:02,850
It will be a good opportunity for both you

400
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:06,090
and Her Highness.

401
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:10,110
I understand.

402
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:23,140
Well done. How is the queen's condition?

403
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:28,550
All her energy and bloodways are blocked, and she is very weak.

404
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,270
How about this, then?

405
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:34,430
Is there any way the queen will be able to bear His Majesty's heir?

406
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:39,070
How could I dare to speak of such a thing so lightly?

407
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,050
- However.
- However?

408
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:45,800
If we maintain this state, it will be difficult.

409
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,060
Take your leave.

410
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:05,820
With the excuse that tax officers in Houjin are crossing our borders,

411
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,500
Ming is asking us for our military to help them.

412
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,550
The borders becoming chaotic is beneficial for us as well.

413
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,850
Even if they were to notice the soldiers after the king's death,

414
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:19,250
we can just tell them our forces are for the purpose of defending our country from Houjin.

415
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:25,400
These two failed the exams.

416
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,960
Did you get their oath in writing that they are willing to offer up their life once they enter here?

417
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,890
Yes. One is a butcher, and the other is a runaway slave.

418
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:43,680
They seek to be released from their status.

419
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:52,220
We will only let the one who holds this sword survive.

420
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,580
I won.

421
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,060
Well done.

422
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:34,430
You should have done that from the very beginning.

423
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:37,490
Then you would have avoided failing.

424
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:52,510
Queen Dowager, the queen is here to see you.

425
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:55,250
 Let her in.

426
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:01,200
  Sujeong Hall
(Empress Dowager's Palace)

427
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,240
His Majesty cherishes you very much, Queen.

428
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:30,430
Don't worry about the palace and take good care of yourself while you are away.

429
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:36,710
I will make a full recovery and return to support His Majesty, so do not worry.

430
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:39,270
Of course.

431
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:43,020
Go on and drink. The tea will get cold.

432
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:51,130
♫  One flower petal out of reach  ♫

433
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:57,850
♫  It leaves, pushed away by a harsh wind  ♫

434
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:06,860
♫  It hovers, under the cold moonlight  ♫

435
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:12,860
♫  Memories of you  ♫

436
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:19,660
♫  Keep lingering in my mind, without realizing it  ♫

437
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:26,900
♫  With a frozen heart, if I stop and turn around  ♫

438
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:35,550
♫  I hope that everything is a dream and try to endure  ♫

439
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:42,480
♫  But only my regrets grow  ♫

440
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:49,550
♫  Just once, just once, if I could see you again  ♫

441
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:56,600
♫  Even if I have to throw away everything I have  ♫

442
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:04,260
♫  I can't forget, can't forget, until the day the world ends  ♫

443
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:11,090
♫  Clutching my empty heart  ♫

444
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:20,240
Who is escorting the queen?

445
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:27,520
Other than the reserved guards to protect His Majesty, I sent the elites to escort her, so don't worry.

446
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,160
Good work.

447
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:34,160
My Lord, when will you tell His Majesty about your condition?

448
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,450
I am not going to tell him.

449
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:40,130
You must find the person who tried to kill you and bring him to justice.

450
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:46,620
If he really wanted to kill me, he wouldn't have sent those beggars.

451
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:50,290
I am sure he has a different intention.

452
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:54,900
If I say it carelessly and reveal it, it'll cause chaos in the court and

453
00:52:54,900 --> 00:53:00,130
that'll be just what the culprit wants.

454
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:05,530
So you must not tell this to His Majesty.

455
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:06,800
Understand?

456
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,020
Yes, My Lord.

457
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:43,190
 Aren't they hazelnuts?

458
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:46,420
 If you bite down on a hazelnut, the goblin that protects the buildings

459
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:51,020
 will be startled by the sound and will grant you a wish.

460
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,090
 I came to be with you.

461
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:01,850
 We laugh together. We cry together.

462
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:08,040
 I will endure it with you, so please don't give up on your will.

463
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:14,230
 Your Majesty, what did you wish for?

464
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:18,800
 Seeing you smile big and bright,

465
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,470
 I'd love to see it once.

466
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:27,070
 That what I wished for.

467
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:52,620
I see you with my eyes, so it would seem I see you with my heart as well.

468
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:22,300
The weather is quite chilly, so why don't you go inside now?

469
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,470
Ae Yeong, get ready to go back tomorrow.

470
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:29,330
Excuse me?

471
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:33,020
We've only stayed for three days and you want to go back already?

472
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:37,210
Your complexion has only gotten brighter now, how about we stay a little longer?

473
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:39,160
I am feeling much better.

474
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:43,620
You heard the physician say I am making a fast recovery.

475
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:45,340
But still...

476
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:53,710
I think I must return to the palace to make a complete recovery.

477
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:58,400
Do you miss him already?

478
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:03,510
I am getting energized just by thinking about going back to the palace.

479
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:21,550
When is Chief Royal Secretary coming?

480
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:23,160
Not sure.

481
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:28,820
He said he is taking five days off, so I guess he'll be off all five days.

482
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,490
You still haven't heard any news about Dal Rae?

483
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:36,040
No.

484
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:40,840
Actually, that...

485
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:46,090
I couldn't deliver the letter at the time.

486
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:48,780
Why did you not tell me until now?

487
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:54,310
Actually the brothel you asked me to deliver the letter to,

488
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:57,400
the chief royal secretary lives there.

489
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,350
The chief royal secretary?

490
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:01,350
Yes.

491
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:05,140
I think it'll be difficult for a while.

492
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,820
I'll go there myself.

493
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,690
Your Majesty.

494
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:15,940
Why not just give it up?

495
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:19,530
I'm her brother. Shouldn't I at least have news of my sister?

496
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:23,260
I'll come right back after hearing that she's alright.

497
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:27,230
I understand. I'll get ready.

498
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:29,120
I'll go alone.

499
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,280
It's cumbersome if you come with me and it'll only draw attention.

500
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,800
I can't.

501
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,600
Don't worry. I'll be quick like the wind.

502
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,820
This can't be...

503
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:07,920
Your Majesty, what brings you here?

504
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,770
You didn't come alone, did you?

505
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:14,320
That is...

506
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,390
I just came out for a short while.

507
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:20,550
By chance, did you come to see Chief Royal Secretary?

508
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:22,280
No.

509
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:28,160
I just came out to watch the people enjoying the Double Ninth Festival.

510
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:32,660
Your Majesty, let me escort you.

511
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:35,520
Okay, you may.

512
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,500
It's quite busy outside.

513
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,010
Is something happening?

514
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:17,580
It's the Double Ninth Festival. It seems there's a party.

515
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:20,290
I see it's that time already.

516
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:23,250
Your Highness, do you remember?

517
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:27,800
When we were young, we all made flower pancakes and went to the back hill to play on Double Ninth Day.

518
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,450
Of course, I remember.

519
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:33,610
It was the first time you got drunk on chrysanthemum liquor, wasn't it?

520
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:36,500
It was quite fun then.

521
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:42,330
Your Highness, how about if we go there and have a quick look?

522
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:46,570
Please, Your Highness. We don't know when we can come out again.

523
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:49,000
Very briefly, please.

524
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,150
I understand.

525
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:56,540
Stop.

526
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:05,310
Because it's the Double Ninth Festival, everyone's so excited. It's good to see.

527
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:10,190
Your Majesty, I'm nervous that I'm your only escort.

528
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:13,690
I think it would be best to return to the palace as soon as possible.

529
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:16,770
I feel very assured that you are here though.

530
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:21,040
I don't know how to react hearing those words.

531
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:25,830
Children, let's let our wishes fly. Write down your wishes.

532
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:27,450
I want to eat every day.

533
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:30,560
I want to eat meat side dishes.

534
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,760
 Meat

535
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:37,030
That looks like fun. Shall we also write down our wishes and let them fly?

536
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:39,960
My apologies, but I don't have any wishes to ask for.

537
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,950
You have no wishes?

538
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:43,860
Is that possible?

539
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:47,110
Don't be like that and just tell me.

540
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:49,580
What's your wish?

541
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,950
It's not a wish.

542
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:54,950
But I do have one thing in mind.

543
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:56,130
Then, what is it?

544
01:01:56,130 --> 01:02:00,490
Like the hyungnim who left this world while protecting you during the last rebellion,

545
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:04,340
I wish to dedicate my life and loyalty to protecting Your Majesty

546
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:06,860
and to die honorably.

547
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:09,940
Dedicating your loyalty and dying.

548
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,930
That's a good and magnificent deed.

549
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:19,760
But for me, instead of you dying magnificently for my sake,

550
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,910
for your sake,

551
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:25,980
if you were to live for what you want would be better.

552
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,080
Your Majesty.

553
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,570
Ah, yes.

554
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:57,620
I'm imagining things again.

555
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:44,840
Your Majesty.

556
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:47,360
Is it really you?

557
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:57,040
Have you been well, Your Majesty?

558
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,900
I've been well.

559
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:03,180
My Queen, you should have rested longer. Why are you out so soon?

560
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:05,150
Three days are enough.

561
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:09,110
If it were any longer, I felt like I would fall ill so I rushed out.

562
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:15,370
Are you here to see the people of the capital?

563
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:19,590
Yes! I heard that there will be festivities for the Double Ninth Festival,

564
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:22,600
so I stopped by to see for a moment.

565
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:26,690
Now that we've met up like this, we can return to the palace together.

566
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:32,010
Your Majesty.

567
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:37,770
Can't we stay a bit longer before returning?

568
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:40,990
Just a little bit will do.

569
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:47,580
I can't be either a bird soaring high in the heavens or a fish swimming in the deep waters

570
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:51,890
since we don't know when we can come out again.

571
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:55,830
Can't we?

572
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:00,170
Sounds good.

573
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:34,580
Dal Rae!

574
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:37,130
Dal Rae!

575
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:41,240
Monk! Monk!

576
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,560
Have you seen my Dal Rae?

577
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:46,440
She was definitely here not that long ago.

578
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,820
I think I know where Dal Rae is.

579
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,370
Let's go to the capital.

580
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:52,050
Yes.

581
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:54,010
The capital, you say?

582
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:56,070
Dal Rae!

583
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:35,490
Are you the new concubine that His Majesty selected?

584
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:38,430
Let's see that face, face, face!

585
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:41,390
Let's see that face!

586
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:44,830
Your Highness, why are you doing this to me?

587
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:46,420
  Seon Hwa Dang, you wench!

588
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:49,910
 Get away from His Majesty this instant!

589
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:53,970
 How dare you put your butt there?

590
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,910
 The queen is killing me!

591
01:06:56,910 --> 01:06:59,820
 Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

592
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:01,970
Your Majesty!

593
01:07:01,970 --> 01:07:03,630
Why are you like this?

594
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:07,560
I'm going to tell His Majesty!

595
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:09,780
Why are you doing this?

596
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:17,620
This bitch of a queen is this evil and full of jealousy,

597
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:22,980
so the heavens have been angered and the country is becoming more and more chaotic.

598
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:25,260
Isn't that right?

599
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:28,530
Take this, take this.

600
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:31,580
It's red beans, enough to boil away ghosts.

601
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,790
Take that, you wench!

602
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:52,130
That's right, you wench!

603
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:28,090
Where did His Majesty go?

604
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:32,660
He was here just a moment ago!

605
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:53,770
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

606
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:04,520
I couldn't keep you there any longer.

607
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:07,860
I just thought we had to go somewhere with no one.

608
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:10,840
I'm sorry.

609
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:15,870
It's because I am imperfect. Why are you apologizing?

610
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:21,260
Your Majesty, I'm fine.

611
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:24,990
I'm just blissful that I am here with you

612
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:28,760
as if I'm in a dream.

613
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:37,510
If this is a dream. If it indeed is a dream,

614
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:41,810
then no matter what I do, it won't be a sin.

615
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:43,560
Is that not so?

616
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,480
Your Majesty.

617
01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:54,590
Let's go.

618
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:32,400
 Orabeoni (Older brother - mouthed).

619
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:37,650
Orabeoni.

620
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,430
Orabeoni!

621
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,750
Orabeoni!

622
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:54,430
Orabeoni!

623
01:11:49,130 --> 01:11:52,600
 The Crowned Clown

624
01:11:52,600 --> 01:12:02,890

625
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:13,000
 Preview

626
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,590
 He has disappeared.

627
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:16,350
 Have you forgotten formalities already?

628
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:18,420
 There is someone who risked his life after believing me.

629
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:22,330
 If I don't go, he will die in His Majesty's hands.

630
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:25,780
 Drag him to the mountains and throw him to the tigers to be eaten.

631
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:32,200
 Order the royal astronomy observers to make tomorrow the day for the queen and I to share her sleeping quarters.

632
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:35,910
 Although you may wander from time to time, wander over to me.

633
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:38,730
 I'll always be there at the end of your road.

634
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:40,470
 It's already been decided where I have to go.

635
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:42,720
 I'll return to the palace.
