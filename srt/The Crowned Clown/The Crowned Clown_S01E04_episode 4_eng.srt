1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:09,200

2
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,660
 The Crowned Clown

3
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,510
 The characters, organizations, locations, and events in this drama are fictional and have no relation to historical facts.

4
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,090
 Episode 4

5
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,570
What's wrong?

6
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,710
It's nothing.

7
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,090
Your Highness, I was startled because you were missing while I was gone for a short time.

8
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,230
I felt stifled so I went out for fresh air.

9
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,460
You should've at least taken Ae Yeong with you. Why did you go alone?

10
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,170
I'll make you some tea to warm you up.

11
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,790
Your Highness.

12
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,170
I don't think I need it today.

13
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,490
I received a lot of warmth just now.

14
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,840
While I was gone for a short time,

15
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,530
where did you go?

16
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,900
I went to the outhouse to pee.

17
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,620
The outhouse?

18
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,110
I didn't want to bother people every time I need to go.

19
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,360
I'll be sure to call someone next time.

20
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,350
Bring the chamber pot. Ready the pot.

21
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,850
I'll even call someone when I fart.

22
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,050
Has the palace become comfortable for you already?

23
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,530
Yeah, well, somewhat.

24
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,600
Then again, a young pup doesn't know to be scared of a tiger.

25
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,490
Don't let your guard down. Some people might already be thinking

26
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,830
His Majesty is acting strange, or His Majesty has changed.

27
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,700
Exiling the queen's father on your own and

28
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,530
saving the hunting dog are not

29
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,780
things His Majesty would have done.

30
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,230
It's not me who let my guard down, but you who did so first, isn't it?

31
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,270
What are you talking about?

32
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,980
Someone was targeting me with that arrowhead at the hunting grounds today.

33
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,010
Why are you only telling me this now?

34
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:25,340
When were you going to tell me that I could die as a walking target?

35
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,820
Although I did come back determined to die,

36
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,720
I never told you I'd die in vain.

37
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,220
If you deceive me once more, I won't stand for it any longer.

38
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,240
Okay.

39
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,080
When the time comes to use you as bait,

40
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,010
I'll be sure to tell you.

41
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:52,440
I'll tell you, "Today will be your memorial day." Will that work for you?

42
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,580
That's better than being deceived.

43
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,150
It was my carelessness.

44
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,610
I was too busy following Prince Jin Pyeong.

45
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,050
I'll confess to His Majesty and take my punishment.

46
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,670
It's not too late to tell him later.

47
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,260
You need to find out who shot the arrow aiming for His Majesty.

48
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,570
Find that out first.

49
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,410
To be honest, I was attacked by arrows while following Prince Jin Pyeong and lost him.

50
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,470
I am positive the assassin was sent by Prince Jin Pyeong.

51
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,310
We can't tell His Majesty things based only on suspicion.

52
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,240
We need definitive evidence.

53
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,560
I'll first confirm the source of this arrowhead.

54
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,080
Move quietly so that no one catches onto what you're up to.

55
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,260
Yes, My Lord.

56
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,770
 Goryeo successor Wang Won was deposed and banished, and Wang Lin, who is a full Goryeo-blood, was named successor.

57
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,080
Eunuch Jo.

58
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,180
I have a favor to ask of you.

59
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,470
Please tell me.

60
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,300
Would you teach me how to read?

61
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,570
Yeah? How to read?

62
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:40,080
I was able to somehow fake it on the hunting grounds with the experience of being a clown,

63
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,370
but in this palace, it's all useless.

64
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,750
I need some sort of a weapon to protect me.

65
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,220
No matter how much I think about it,

66
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,530
I don't think there's any other way but learning to read.

67
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,830
But I...

68
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,560
have never taught anyone to read before.

69
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,250
You might be better off asking the chief royal secretary—

70
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,660
There's no point in asking him.

71
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:09,060
"Don't do anything useless!" It's obvious he'll say it like this.

72
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,390
I am not ambitious. I don't want to learn to read all this.

73
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,260
Please teach me slowly, step by step.

74
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,160
Fortunately, I am confident in memorization.

75
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,760
I even memorized the alphabet right away after being taught a few times by a joker when I was young.

76
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,560
I understand.

77
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,800
Thank you.

78
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,440
What is all this?

79
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,280
These are the books His Majesty was reading recently.

80
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,290
He read all of these?

81
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,120
Articles of law, expositions, and even sometimes certifications.

82
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,080
The king's seat is one that one must study to death for.

83
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,790
I asked you to teach me to read.

84
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,010
When did I...?

85
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,790
We don't have enough time to start with the Thousand Character Classic.

86
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,190
So if I translate it into the Korean alphabet, you could read it,

87
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,020
and memorize it. That's how we'll be studying.

88
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,840
How is that?

89
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,330
It won't work. This is too much...

90
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,670
Let's start with the Lesser Court Hymns in Classic of Poetry.

91
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,010
Eunuch Jo.

92
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,440
I asked you to teach me slowly, step by step.

93
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,780
Beautiful millet rice is moistened by the monsoon rain.

94
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,750
Beautiful millet rice ...

95
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,670
is moistened by the monsoon rain.

96
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:59,770
 The noisy fly sits on the hazelnut tree.

97
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:03,060
 The sly person's words have no end.

98
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,530
 They plant division between people.

99
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:11,470
 Perhaps you will rest by the lush willow tree.

100
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,540
 Then, Your Majesty.

101
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,220
 I shall fetch tea.

102
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,900
 It is dangerous, and may you not go near it.

103
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,570
What are you doing right now?

104
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,670
He said he wanted to learn how to read.

105
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,620
Then, I shall tell him to stop.

106
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,600
No. Just leave him be.

107
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,570
For the time being, is His Majesty

108
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,400
not thinking of returning then?

109
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,050
Tea fetcher, it seems your duty

110
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,920
is not to inquire about His Majesty's return

111
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,530
but to monitor that rascal well.

112
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,850
I understand.

113
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,430
 A small section of The Classic of Poetry

114
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,510
 The lush willow tree...

115
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,430
In past days, when I left

116
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,830
the willow tree was lush.

117
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,390
As I think to return now,

118
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,350
snow.

119
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,800
Yes.

120
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,000
So snow and rain come fluttering down.

121
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,900
My return is slow.

122
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,180
I'm thirsty and hungry.

123
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,700
The bitterness and the heartache,

124
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,640
no one knows of it.

125
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,940
 Older brother.

126
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,590
 Oh my! I almost died right there.

127
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,160
 Hey, Ha Seon, you do this now.

128
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,260
 Oh my, I'm so tired. I can't do this anymore.

129
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,920
 Oh my.

130
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,730
 Oh my.

131
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,880
 Really, old man.

132
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,890
 You're tired after that?

133
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,110
 I guess you really have aged, old man.

134
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,880
 Oh my, what did you say?

135
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,820
 Is that all you have to say?

136
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,850
 Ah, did I say anything wrong?

137
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,160
 Hey, Dal Rae. Aren't I right?

138
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,360
 You're the one who messed up, Brother.

139
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,400
 The reason why the old man is this aged

140
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,260
 is because he's been feeding and keeping us alive.

141
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:52,170
 Oh my, our old man can't even get married. So sad, what do we do?

142
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,950
 These two, really.

143
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,830
 Saying all this nonsense!

144
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:20,070

145
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,980
Dal Rae.

146
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,550
Dal Rae...

147
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,760
Old man...

148
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,530
Your Majesty.

149
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:59,550
Your Majesty, what is the matter?

150
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,380
Eunuch Jo.

151
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,300
Could you do me a favor?

152
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,830
 The red bean soup was all ready,

153
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,080
but a bit flew out from the pot and stuck to the eye!

154
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,210
And as he said, "Oh my, save this tiger," and that's how his eyes ended up this way.

155
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,290
Dal Rae, take a look at this.

156
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,160
And so, the tiger was saying, "Oh my, save this tiger!" But he ended up stepping in a pile of dog poop.

157
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,670
So after he stepped into it, he fell over and rolled into--

158
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,290
Dal Rae.

159
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:33,130
Dal Rae, I said take a look at this. Come on.

160
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,460
What are we going to do with you?

161
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,960
You have to get better before Ha Seon comes to see you.

162
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,570
Oh my.

163
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,730
Oh my, I'm going crazy.

164
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,150
It's okay. It's okay.

165
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,170
She's a bit shy.

166
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,480
Thank you so much for letting us stay.

167
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,070
But we won't be here for long.

168
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,790
Even if you're here for only a day, stay comfortably.

169
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,280
Yes.

170
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,910
Oh my, this is!

171
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,440
Isn't this... a pheasant?!

172
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,870
Oh my, I thought this was a temple that served Buddha?

173
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,830
You are correct. You two are my Buddha.

174
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,360
What?

175
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,920
What kind of pheasant nonsense is he spouting?

176
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,650
Ah, excuse me.

177
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,770
Is there a gisaeng named Woon Sim here?

178
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:03,960
Ah, yes.

179
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,610
But if this is your first visit, it'll be hard to meet her.

180
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,740
I only need to see her briefly.

181
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,740
Could you just deliver this to her?

182
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,560
 Chief Royal Secretary, did you just leave the court?

183
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:32,870
 Many years have passed, and I've forgotten the day we promised to meet again.

184
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,130
 I long for news of my dear members.

185
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,520
 Once again, I pick up this brush.

186
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,250
You've arrived, My Lord.

187
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,430
Writing a letter that'll receive no response.

188
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:54,170
Why do you keep sending them?

189
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,460
Because you don't know what will happen in the future.

190
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,980
Having that much lingering attachment is also a disease.

191
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,060
You should let it go now.

192
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,800
You've become quite unbearable.

193
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,600
What happened to the open-minded young master that the elder favored so much?

194
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,160
Where has he disappeared to?

195
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,400
When you approach, you become miserable.

196
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,120
And when you part ways, you become regretful. That is what life is.

197
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,040
Woon Sim, you too.

198
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,790
Just do as much as I do.

199
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,680
The queen says to enter.

200
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,140
Though I am lacking, I have used all of my skills for His Majesty and Your Highness.

201
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,200
This is so beautiful.

202
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,350
You must be happy that you have this sort of talent.

203
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:39,010
Well, since she was a court lady in charge of the bedroom for ten years,

204
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,940
she must be able to make something like that with her eyes closed.

205
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,700
Even if I were in the bedroom for 20 years and not 10,

206
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,110
I would never have acquired skills such as this.

207
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:54,590
Could you pass down some tips on making towels such as this?

208
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,070
Anytime, Your Highness.

209
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,500
The tea will get cold. Go ahead and drink.

210
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,360
Why am I like this?

211
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,770
Call the physician immediately!

212
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,890
Yes, my queen.

213
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,160
 Seonpyeong Gate

214
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,950
Seon Hwa Dang drank tea at the queen's palace and collapsed?

215
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,980
Is the queen alright?

216
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,360
Yes.

217
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,760
The queen and the other consorts are all safe.

218
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,620
It's only Seon Hwa Dang that became ill.

219
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,510
Last time I checked, she looked strong enough to chew through iron.

220
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,710
His Majesty is coming through!

221
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,220
My Queen.

222
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,060
Your Majesty.

223
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,200
Why are you standing out here, instead of going in?

224
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,650
I heard the left state minister had come first, so I'm waiting here.

225
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,470
Left State Minister?

226
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,130
Your Majesty.

227
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:44,430
Your Majesty, you've arrived.

228
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,310
You should head in as well, Your Highness.

229
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,160
If it is difficult, you don't have to force yourself to get up.

230
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,380
I apologize, Your Majesty.

231
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,960
What happened to her?

232
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,760
I must examine her more thoroughly, but

233
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,040
from what I can tell, she seems to have consumed a poisonous herb.

234
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,880
A poisonous herb?

235
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,290
Your Majesty, to be honest, I

236
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:50,990
have been having fevers and pains for the last few days.

237
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:54,360
I didn't know what the cause of it was so I was trying to hold in the pain, but

238
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,830
after today, I know the exact reason behind it.

239
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,770
Are Seon Hwa Dang's words true?

240
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,970
It is true that she's been having slight symptoms for the past few days.

241
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:08,840
And after drinking the tea at the queen's palace, it is true that her symptoms have gotten worse.

242
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,200
Whether the poison is in the tea,

243
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,790
we haven't checked yet.

244
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:20,630
I will have them bring you the teacup and tea used by Seon Hwa Dang and we'll check them right away.

245
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:24,750
What's the point in examining the cup and tea now?

246
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,520
You don't need to do that.

247
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,010
Don't need to? What do you mean?

248
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,290
Court Lady Jo, show His Majesty.

249
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,280
No!

250
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,720
What is this?

251
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:09,430
Someone is trying to kill me.

252
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:12,760
It's evidence of witchcraft.

253
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:18,420
Someone found someone else burying this beneath where I sleep.

254
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,250
Tell His Majesty what you saw, every single detail.

255
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,490
It was a few days ago, on the night when the full moon was out.

256
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,890
I was heading out of her room when

257
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,330
I saw someone burying that box in the dark.

258
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,330
Who was it?

259
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,460
It was Court Lady Park.

260
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,130
Look at it again carefully and answer.

261
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,490
Are you certain the individual you saw that night was Court Lady Park?

262
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,220
Yes, Your Highness.

263
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,340
It was definitely her face.

264
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,030
My queen, I've been unjustly framed!

265
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:14,090
Please believe in my innocence!

266
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,980
Your Majesty.

267
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,760
I beg you.

268
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,050
Please find the one who cursed and tried to kill me,

269
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:32,350
and give them severe punishment for their crimes.

270
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,470
Act as if you know nothing.

271
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,410
The queen could be wrongly framed.

272
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:51,120
How could I act as if I know nothing?

273
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:59,390
What if it's not a wrongful accusation and Seon Hwa Dang is the victim?

274
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,770
Ladies of the court. Your Majesty's women and their families.

275
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:10,200
It's a fierce battle between the forces they belong to.

276
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,050
One incorrect step and it could be a bloodbath.

277
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:16,590
And it can lead to a threat to His Majesty's reign.

278
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:20,170
So instead of standing on one of their sides,

279
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:23,020
His Majesty has chosen to be neutral.

280
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,920
I don't understand what you're trying to say!

281
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,990
Do you remember when I said that there were two methods of survival in the palace?

282
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,670
Yes. Either crush them to their dying breaths or

283
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,630
thoroughly...

284
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,670
ignore them.

285
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:46,500
Exactly. The action you can and must take

286
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,900
is to thoroughly ignore it.

287
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,280
That's your only choice.

288
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,720
My Lord!

289
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,910
 Seon Hwa Dang

290
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,220
Arrest Court Lady Park.

291
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,650
Yes.

292
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:49,590
I've been framed! I've been framed!

293
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,490
Let me go! Let me go.

294
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:57,670
Court Lady Kim, don't you know?

295
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,500
Please believe in my words.

296
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,520
I never did such a thing to Seon Hwa Dang.

297
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:08,010
Do not stop until she reveals who ordered her to do it.

298
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,320
Yes.

299
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:14,720
No, no, no!

300
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:34,000
My queen, they say that despite all the torture,

301
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,790
she hasn't said anything.

302
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,450
Your Highness.

303
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,420
I must go to see His Majesty.

304
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,950
If Court Lady Park does not confess who ordered her,

305
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:53,620
the queen will be in danger?

306
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,150
What do you mean?

307
00:28:55,150 --> 00:29:00,040
Inside the palace, once you're guilty, you are guilty until you die.

308
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,950
Whether or not someone is actually guilty depends on the circumstances.

309
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,590
So, if Court Lady Park continues to withhold her confession,

310
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,960
it'll appear as if the queen commanded her to do so.

311
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,120
And everyone will speculate and become suspicious of her.

312
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:43,370
 Your Majesty, I beg you.

313
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:47,060
 Please find the one who cursed and tried to kill me,

314
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,370
 and punish them for their crimes.

315
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:03,720
My queen, why are you like this?

316
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,840
I don't think this will work. Let's just go back.

317
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,000
But my queen, you've already made your way over here. How could we—

318
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,520
Your Highness!

319
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:41,540

320
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,080
If you throw that there,

321
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,750
the goblin won't grant you your wish.

322
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,350
Your Majesty.

323
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,250
If that's not it,

324
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,420
were you just trying to throw it away?

325
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:31,690
Your Majesty, what brings you here?

326
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,260
I saw you came to my palace

327
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,780
and just left, so I followed you here.

328
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,110
You probably made your way over because you had something you wanted to say.

329
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,030
But why did you just leave?

330
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:51,960
As you saw, I wanted to ask you to believe me.

331
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,890
I visited you to beg for this.

332
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:59,130
But... thinking about actually seeing you

333
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,220
made me afraid.

334
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:05,740
I wondered what to do if you didn't believe me.

335
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,260
I believe that you are not at fault here, My Queen.

336
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,260
From the beginning, I never thought it was you.

337
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:27,540
I'm even more afraid because you are speaking like this.

338
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,610
That you'd say you believe in my innocence

339
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:33,850
but that you cannot stand by my side.

340
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,760
The thing is...

341
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,220
- My queen.
 - You don't have to say anymore.

342
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:54,690
Right now, I'm satisfied with your words, saying that you believe in me.

343
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,920
Wait just a little longer.

344
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,290
I'll definitely find a way to prove your innocence, My Queen.

345
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,920
I was impressed once again by you, My Lord.

346
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,290
There's nothing you can't do with bribes.

347
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:39,380
 If you take this more than three times a day, your life will be in danger.

348
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,840
 Seon Hwa Dang

349
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:41,710
 Hide this in Court Lady Park's room in the queen's palace.

350
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,930
 Serve this to her three times a day.

351
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:19,920
It seemed quite significant that Seon Hwa Dang really ate poison.

352
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:24,630
That child appears ambitious but is more innocent than you'd think.

353
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:28,790
If you told her the truth and tried to fabricate the lie,

354
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:31,440
we would have been exposed immediately.

355
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:38,690
I had thought you were considering Seon Hwa Dang as the new queen.

356
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:44,820
I have many beautiful and obedient nieces.

357
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,310
There's one more thing you must take care of.

358
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,700
Take care of Court Lady Park.

359
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,170
It's fine if we leave her as is. Why?

360
00:35:55,170 --> 00:36:01,200
A queen who uses witchcraft to curse the consorts and takes a faithful life.

361
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,400
What better reasons are there to overthrow her?

362
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:19,450
Deliver it to each precinct and officer.

363
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,330
Yes, My Lord.

364
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,940
So have you found the source of the arrowhead?

365
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,150
I've searched everywhere in Anyang, Doseong, and other nearby public forges.

366
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,190
None have made such an arrowhead.

367
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:41,340
I checked the arrows that Prince Jin Pyeong and the other royal family members use.

368
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,990
None of them were the same either.

369
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:48,300
It seems we won't be able to find them so easily.

370
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,820
What should we do now?

371
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,940
There have already been three assassination attempts on His Majesty.

372
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,360
Heaven's providence has protected His Majesty.

373
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,240
We can't just keep leaving His Majesty's safety up to fate.

374
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,860
Monitor Prince Jin Pyeong and the other royal family members' movements.

375
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:06,550
If you see anything suspicious, report it to me right away.

376
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,610
Yes, My Lord.

377
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,370
It appears a bloodbath is about to begin.

378
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:25,100
It may spread all around the court ladies, so if there is anything I need to know, please tell me beforehand.

379
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,630
- Prince Jin Pyeong?
 - Yes, Queen Dowager.

380
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,520
I'll take care of the court ladies.

381
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,580
You take care of your own business.

382
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:38,310
Like that last hunting incident, you can't just use words

383
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:41,360
and return empty-handed, right?

384
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,620
I understand, Queen Dowager.

385
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,240
What should we do?

386
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,530
Proceed with it.

387
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,940

388
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,990
What are you going to do if someone sees?

389
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,300
Just have some.

390
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,110
Thank you.

391
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:15,200
Please tell the queen dowager

392
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,890
I won't say anything that pertains to the queen.

393
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:23,320
So tell her not to worry.

394
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,240
What is this?

395
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,400
You've worked well until now.

396
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,700
Think of this as the queen dowager's grace and leave peacefully.

397
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,110
Why are you doing this to me?

398
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,540
Why?

399
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:56,390
Why? Why are you doing...?

400
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:11,770
Your Majesty, it's time for you to go to sleep.

401
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,600
I can't let things remain this way.

402
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,070
No, but where are you trying to go?

403
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,800
In the middle of the night, Court Lady Park died?

404
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,190
Yes, Your Highness. I apologize, but that's what occurred.

405
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,450
How did that happen?

406
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,960
If it was because she suffered through the ordered torture,

407
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,870
I won't forgive you.

408
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:34,880
How could I have done that

409
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,200
in the palace that His Majesty and my queen dwell in?

410
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,040
I'm not certain, but someone seems to have fed her poison

411
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,080
to prevent her from speaking.

412
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,320
Your Highness...

413
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:04,680
It's obvious that someone killed her to falsely frame the queen.

414
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,900
That's what you think.

415
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,930
Everyone else will think that in order to stop Court Lady Park's confession,

416
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:14,550
the queen did something.

417
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,760
 Your Majesty, Officer Jang requests an audience.

418
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,080
Let him in.

419
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,920
Your Majesty, the cause of Court Lady Park's death has been determined.

420
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,510
- Was it poison?
 - Yes.

421
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:44,650
But they say it's the same poison that killed your food taster.

422
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,800
Are you certain?

423
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,570
Just to be certain, we checked it three times.

424
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,660
We are certain.

425
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:00,910
Do you think this was orchestrated by the queen dowager from the very beginning?

426
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:05,430
The person who orchestrated this and the individual who killed Court Lady Park could be different.

427
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:10,000
It seems the queen dowager is hiding something she's done as well.

428
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,560
After committing a crime, there's now a way to avoid punishment.

429
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,910
They've been given wings to fly up to their heart's content.

430
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:29,550
You were not the one to kill Court Lady Park?

431
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:33,550
Was it perhaps the queen?

432
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:35,900
That's not it.

433
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:40,950
When I told her the news, she didn't know about it at all.

434
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,720
Really?

435
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,690
Things are getting even more entertaining.

436
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:05,090
Alright, it's time for us to get involved.

437
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:07,520
Yes, My Lord.

438
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:16,860
Your Majesty, the sudden death of Court Lady Park of the queen's palace

439
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:20,290
is the same as the queen exposing her crime herself.

440
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:24,060
There is precedence of deposing a queen who employs crafty measures to persecute the consorts

441
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:27,320
out of heavy jealousy. Hence, if only for the sake of our ancestors,

442
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,150
you must make a decision.

443
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:37,850
Your Majesty, many high ministers are seeking to submit a proposal to depose the queen.

444
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:41,790
If the decision is delayed, the Confucian scholars and the nobles will submit their pleas.

445
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:45,140
If so, Your Majesty's reign will be in danger.

446
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,290
Your Majesty, please make a judgment.

447
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:52,720
Please make a judgment.

448
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:57,240
Please make a judgment.

449
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:03,000
Please make a judgment.

450
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:18,700
Please make a judgment.

451
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:23,190
Please make a judgment.

452
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:27,270
 Wait a little longer.

453
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:31,660
 I'll definitely find a way to prove your innocence.

454
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:39,770
Uncle, please tell me again.

455
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,930
What did you just say?

456
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:45,030
I am going to gather the court ministers to come to the same opinion

457
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:48,410
and submit a request for the king to depose the queen.

458
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,740
I will get new clothes ready right away.

459
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,800
No, I can't look too pale, so I'll start taking medicine.

460
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,400
Court Lady Jo!

461
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:08,630
Court Lady Jo, where are you?

462
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,750
Is she so delighted?

463
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:16,410
How are the pleas I told you to gather?

464
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:18,700
They are all prepared.

465
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:24,600
However, Chief Royal Secretary will surely block the pleas from being presented, so what should we do?

466
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,100
It doesn't matter.

467
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:32,500
We don't need the chief royal secretary. I'll take the pleas myself and go to His Majesty.

468
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:37,250
I must receive His Majesty's approval this time,

469
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:41,060
so you get the Confucian scholars ready to protest.

470
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:43,160
Yes, Father.

471
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,390
Ae Yeong, don't cry.

472
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:02,320
Forgive me.

473
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,100
Your Highness, I will go to His Majesty

474
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:09,300
and inquire about His Majesty's mood from the servants.

475
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,700
Do not do so.

476
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,200
But, Your Highness.

477
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:22,580
As soon as daylight breaks, make a trip to Court Lady Park's private home.

478
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,160
Why there?

479
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:29,480
Though she died as a criminal, she is someone who took care of me for many years.

480
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,400
She had an elderly ill mother living alone at home.

481
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,910
As soon as daylight breaks, go and send my condolences.

482
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,500
This is the kind of queen you are.

483
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,400
How could they frame you like this?

484
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:52,840
It's definitely right here.

485
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:01,170
What do you want?

486
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:07,220
Well, is this Court Lady Park's house? I came from the palace.

487
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:11,470
Are you from the queen dowager's palace?

488
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:13,950
I've never seen you before.

489
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:15,860
Pardon?

490
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:19,630
Yes, everyone is busy.

491
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:23,290
Please wait a moment. I'll bring it out.

492
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:25,000
Yes.

493
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:49,150
Court Lady Park's mother mistook you as someone from the queen dowager's palace

494
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:52,460
and she gave you this letter and this scroll?

495
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:56,790
Yes. I thought it was strange so after I gave her the items you said to give her,

496
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:59,150
I received these.

497
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,320
 Central Palace (Queen)

498
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:32,530
Who committed such an act?

499
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,590
Your Majesty, you should see it yourself.

500
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,710
It's a letter.

501
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:59,530
 To Queen Dowager.

502
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,010
Queen Dowager, as Your Highness commanded,

503
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:12,710
I carried out witchcraft inside the queen's palace.

504
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,360
 This scroll that's buried under the main hall

505
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,550
 contains a curse from a skilled shaman.

506
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:22,520
 So you must pay me more.

507
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:29,480
So you mean, Court Lady Park's witchcraft wasn't intended for Seon Hwa Dang,

508
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,630
but it was for you?

509
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:33,140
Yes.

510
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:41,730
Perhaps we can shed the wrongful accusation against you with this.

511
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,530
Your Majesty. Seon Hwa Dang's matter has a witness.

512
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:48,940
So it would be difficult to shed the accusation with these.

513
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:55,300
They are useless to me but I thought they may be of use to you so I brought them.

514
00:50:55,300 --> 00:51:00,520
Do not worry about what you said to me and use them for Your Majesty's sake.

515
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,850
No, we must undo your wrongful accusation first.

516
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,870
I shall do so, so please wait.

517
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:18,420
Chief Royal Secretary.

518
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:22,030
Chief Royal Secretary, where are you?

519
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,740
Your Majesty.

520
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,970
 How are you...

521
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:37,590
What matter brings you here?

522
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:43,700
Here.

523
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:48,080
Take a look at this.

524
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:05,840
What do you think?

525
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,540
Well done.

526
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:11,410
We can depose the queen dowager with this.

527
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:13,800
His Majesty would be pleased too.

528
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,060
Pardon?

529
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,090
Depose the queen dowager? What do you mean?

530
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:23,890
I'm asking you if this is a way to save the queen.

531
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:27,000
The first priority is His Majesty's safety.

532
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,050
She may harm His Majesty at any time again, so it's right to depose the queen dowager first.

533
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:34,720
But what about the queen?

534
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,180
It doesn't matter what happens to the queen then?

535
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:39,010
Did I not tell you already? Politics...

536
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:41,870
If you take one, you give one.

537
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:44,230
Are you trying to say that?

538
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:49,460
There are times when you have to give up ten or a hundred for one thing!

539
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:53,630
Damn it! What's the use of dressing in silk and wielding power

540
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:57,190
when the head's full of thoughts less than an animal's?

541
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:01,160
Not one bit of humane thought!

542
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,330
I don't know why I'm listening to you.

543
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:13,520
It's something His Majesty will decide anyway.

544
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:19,990
I will bring His Majesty here so prepare yourself.

545
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:34,340
 Central Palace (Queen)

546
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:41,070
 We need to undo your wrongful accusation first.

547
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:45,260
 I shall do so, so please wait.

548
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:59,460
 Classic of Poetry

549
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:13,520
 Pages of Chinese quatrains by Du Fu, a great Tang Dynasty poet

550
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,790
 The bluish green river makes the waders appear whiter.

551
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:19,360
 The mountain and luscious greenery seem to showcase  the flowers as flaming red as a burning fire.

552
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,520
 The spring this year will soon be over. 
When will I be able to return home?

553
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:31,870
Queen Dowager. As you instructed.

554
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:35,240
Queen's witchcraft.

555
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:52,400
 Dowager.

556
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:05,990
 Queen Dowager.

557
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,920
 Sujeong Hall

558
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:28,220
Your Majesty, what brings you at night without notice?

559
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:32,950
Queen Dowager, His Majesty is entering!

560
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:48,090
Your Majesty, how rude.

561
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,260
What is this?

562
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:08,040
 Central Palace (Queen)

563
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,940
Court Lady Park seemed to have worked hard to make that.

564
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:19,540
Seeing how she left you a letter asking for more pay than usual.

565
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:34,700
 To Queen Dowager.

566
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:40,720
I won't ask a second time. Give me the criminal who killed Court Lady Park.

567
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:45,200
If you do so, I will forget your crimes.

568
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,500
If you don't do so, I will notify the royal court

569
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,640
and order the left state minister to petition for your deposing.

570
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:02,010
Your Majesty.

571
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:05,680
You're doing all sorts of things to save the queen.

572
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:11,230
Just notify the royal court. I fear nothing.

573
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:17,440
Even if more evidence comes out from Court Lady Jang's rooms?

574
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:27,790
I will give you two sijin (2-hour time segments/4 hours). Afterward, I won't be able to do anything else.

575
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:50,060

576
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:07,620
Your Majesty, is your mind alert now?

577
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,880
Your Majesty.

578
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:25,390
Your Majesty!  What has happened?

579
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:34,090
Yool that punk keeps whispering in my ear.

580
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:49,900
Your Majesty!

581
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:52,330
Your Majesty!

582
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:55,330
Why are you like this?

583
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:57,500
Please...

584
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:00,620
Please don't be like this.

585
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:05,240
What am I supposed to do?

586
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:09,940
What am I supposed to do?

587
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:25,660
I am reminded of the time I first entered the palace.

588
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:30,920
At the tender age of 16, you came all alone as a young maiden.

589
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,950
I was by myself, but not alone.

590
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:36,630
You were always with me.

591
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:43,120
By Heaven's providence, I bore Grand Prince Kyeong In.

592
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:46,000
But that bliss could not last long.

593
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:52,090
I lost my father and I also lost Grand Prince Kyeong In who was my life.

594
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:58,640
If I did not have you, how would I have survived such cruel years?

595
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,190
I tremble just thinking of it.

596
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:06,390
I have lived until today through your grace.

597
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:12,240
Dying for you is also a blessing.

598
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:36,970
The day I rip apart the king's limbs to sate my vengeance,

599
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:41,340
I will carry out a proper memorial for you.

600
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:47,850
Queen Dowager, until you get your vengeance,

601
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:52,080
may you be healthy.

602
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,500
 Huijeong Palace

603
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:08,870
Your Majesty, I have received the queen dowager's order

604
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:12,180
to come and confess my crime to Your Majesty.

605
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:14,370
Tell me.

606
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:18,940
Please keep your promise to the queen dowager.

607
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:45,790
Sir.

608
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:58,500
 Queen Dowager's Palace's Court Lady . . .

609
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:07,260
Father, what's the matter?

610
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:12,200
A fire broke out in a rabbit hole.

611
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,960
It looks like the fox is about to die as well.

612
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:33,310
Chief Royal Secretary clearly said

613
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:36,350
he would bring His Majesty here.

614
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:40,150
I am not sure why he is so late.

615
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:45,010
Your Majesty, the left state minister is entering.

616
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,310
Your Majesty.

617
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:54,250
Let him in.

618
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:17,290
Your Majesty, the queen dowager has defied the duty of a mother,

619
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:19,570
and that is known to the world now.

620
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:26,070
The queen dowager's crime is a grave crime that not even Your Majesty's filial duty can cover.

621
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:30,110
As your subject, I cannot sit and watch either.

622
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:35,540
Hence, I shall lead the way and seek the queen dowager's deposing.

623
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:38,880
Please approve it.

624
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:47,780
If it is the opposition from the nobles and the Confucian scholars that worries you,

625
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:53,170
I shall take the lead and properly erect the justification for the cause, for Your Majesty's sake.

626
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:59,320
Therefore, what you've wished for so long and the opportunity to obtain everything you desire,

627
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:02,140
don't let it go, please.

628
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:22,740
It's not enough to kick out the queen who is innocent.

629
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:26,470
Now you're going to kick out the queen dowager as well?

630
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:29,290
Is what you really want, Left State Minister,

631
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:33,560
to make me into the worst bastard in the world?

632
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:40,820
Your Majesty, what you're saying is not correct.

633
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:44,680
During the last uprising, I followed you, who were all alone,

634
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:48,730
and my knee was injured by a sword, an injury that cannot be fully healed.

635
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:51,690
You know that already, don't you?

636
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:56,170
So how can you diminish my loyalty?

637
01:04:56,170 --> 01:04:59,690
This must be due to the chief royal secretary trying to come between us—

638
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:01,980
Shut up!

639
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:10,610
Court Lady Jang from the queen dowager's palace did commit the crime, but that has nothing to do with the queen dowager.

640
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:14,090
Also, with Court Lady Jang's confession,

641
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:16,850
it has been revealed that the queen is innocent.

642
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:19,840
I will no longer be bringing an issue to that matter.

643
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,490
Understand and leave!

644
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:01,200
It doesn't seem like the matter of deposing the queen will come up anytime soon.

645
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:06,990
But why do you think His Majesty hasn't put the blame on the queen dowager?

646
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:11,580
Don't you think he doesn't want it to be known that he was unfilial by deposing the queen dowager?

647
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:14,690
Don't you think so, Left State Minister?

648
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:56,460
 To the queen dowager

649
01:07:58,850 --> 01:08:03,000
 Your Majesty, what did you wish for?

650
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:10,130
 My queen, I would like to see you smile brightly once.

651
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:15,680
  I hope you will.

652
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,930
Don't smile.

653
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:37,110
Don't smile, please.

654
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:35,890
Eunuch Jo, come here and take a look at this.

655
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:53,030
 Thank you, Eunuch Jo

656
01:09:57,550 --> 01:10:00,520
Is this the time to be doing this?

657
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:05,540
The chief royal secretary will soon be escorting His Majesty here.

658
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:10,730
Isn't it fun? I drew it so you would laugh.

659
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:13,590
Your Majesty.

660
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:20,030
If done well, you live and if not, you die.

661
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:25,330
No matter what you do, you're going to die someday in this lifetime.

662
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:31,290
Don't worry too much.

663
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:30,470
Take off the king's clothes and change into civilian clothing.

664
01:11:46,730 --> 01:11:51,010
If you do not want to die, please step back.

665
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:41,210
My Lord. My Lord.

666
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:44,200
Why do we keep climbing?

667
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:55,190
Is His Majesty at the top of the mountain?

668
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:52,790
I said I would tell you beforehand.

669
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:58,720
Today is your funeral day.

670
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,470
W-Wait...

671
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:04,040
My Lord. My Lord...

672
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:43,000
The clown Ha Seon has died.

673
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,380
Now, you...

674
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:49,920
You are the king of this country.

675
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:08,360
 The Crowned Clown

676
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:17,510

677
01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:26,550
 Preview

678
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:32,050
 We've come a long way, but it's time.

679
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:33,730
 There is no way to hide this any longer.

680
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:35,990
 The reason why my heart trembles.

681
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:39,940
 Let's try to make the world that the elder and the members dreamed of once more.

682
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:42,190
 The one who received the rice first...

683
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:44,060
 The one with extraordinary calculating skills.

684
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:45,380
 There is someone.

685
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:47,320
 Will you do it with me?

686
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:50,270
 It seems I took the king's work too lightly.

687
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:52,560
 Step down from the position of left state minister.

688
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,790
 He told me to tell you to enjoy watching from the afterlife.
