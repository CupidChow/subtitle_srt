1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:10,620

2
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,230
 The Crowned Clown

3
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,610
 The characters, organizations, locations, and events in this drama are fictional and have no relation to historical facts.

4
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,020
I said I would tell you beforehand.

5
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,220
Today is your funeral day.

6
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,350
W-Wait...

7
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,840
My Lord. My Lord...

8
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,550
The clown Ha Seon has died.

9
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,110
Now, you...

10
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,330
You are the king of this country.

11
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,980
 Episode 5

12
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,290
What happened?

13
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,370
I need a clean cloth and aclean set of the King's sleeping attire.

14
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,680
Yes, I will bring some right away.

15
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,200
 I can't find a pulse. Has this happened before?

16
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,040
 There were times when he was troubled as he could not fall asleep,

17
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,680
 but he has never harmed himself before.

18
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,400
 Don't worry about his ear.

19
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,070
 It's a good thing he stabbed it where he did. It looks worse than it is.

20
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,140
 I haven't seen you this way since the Elder passed away.

21
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:42,900
 Do you remember when I said that I would take on a government position?

22
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,400
 You tried to dissuade me

23
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,500
 and asked me what I was going to do in such a rotten royal court.

24
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,100
 You were angry at me.

25
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,250
 We've come a long way, but I feel it is finally time.

26
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,140
 I wish to try creating the new world again, the one that the elder and the other members had dreamed of.

27
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,550
 Why is now the right time?

28
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,840
 It's now or never.

29
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,980
 We cannot delay it any longer.

30
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:21,580
 This may be the last chance given to me.

31
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,790
Am I alive or dead?

32
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:03,090
Stop complaining. It isn't even a deep wound.

33
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,760
Complain? You half murdered me!

34
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,730
Seeing you speak, it looks like you won't die.

35
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,010
What was that?

36
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:19,540
When you said... I... was now the king.

37
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,680
Where is His Majesty?

38
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,380
Far away.

39
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,980
Far away?

40
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,390
Then, when...

41
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,250
When he will return is a secret. Even I'm not allowed to know.

42
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,910
Whether he will return suddenly like thunder and lightning,

43
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,720
or quietly like the kill of a dawn hunt...

44
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,950
Until then, you need to protect the throne.

45
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:51,120
You cannot flee or die.

46
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,500
You say not to flee or die.

47
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,310
But why did you stab me?

48
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,200
His Majesty has a scar on that very spot, from the uprising.

49
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:11,020
You must be a true king in order for both you and me to survive.

50
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,040
Mark my words.

51
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,010
His Majesty is refusing his health examination,

52
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,160
so just send in medicine that helps nourish the body.

53
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,870
Why are you refusing the physicians when His Majesty is unwell?

54
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,800
I'm not refusing them; His Majesty is.

55
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,770
His Majesty is?

56
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,840
Don't make a fuss.

57
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,430
If someone were to hear, they'd think something has happened to His Majesty.

58
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,120
Is His Majesty alright?

59
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,620
If something was wrong, does that mean you can act so rashly like this?

60
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,280
My apologies. I was just concerned.

61
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,440
There have been a lot of rumors inside and outside of the palace due to the incident with the court lady.

62
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,760
In order to set things right again, he is taking a bit of rest.

63
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,120
So don't think useless thoughts.

64
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,010
Yes, sir.

65
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,630
  Huijeong Hall

66
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,450
I'm not to go to his bedroom. Is that what His Majesty commanded?

67
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,690
So it would seem.

68
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:36,010
If His Majesty needs you, he will call for you. So stay put for now.

69
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,310
I need to see His Majesty.

70
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,960
- Please announce my arrival. 
- My apologies, My Lord.

71
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:56,760
His Majesty has declared that he will not accept visits today.

72
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,440
We heard that it was just a light cold and that he even refused to see his physicians.

73
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,470
Has he awakened? Is it really a cold?

74
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,220
Oh, the thing is...

75
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,390
Move aside. I'll meet him myself and ask.

76
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,940
Ah, I—

77
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,470
The queen has arrived!

78
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,910
Your Highness, you're here.

79
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,230
I was on my way here and coincidentally heard.

80
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:33,350
You should know that His Majesty is weary both in his heart and in his body from taking care of multiple incidents as of late.

81
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,880
Yes, Your Highness. I just—

82
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,850
Yes. I'm sure you were concerned about his well-being.

83
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,980
I will relay your loyalty to His Majesty,

84
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,580
so please leave for today.

85
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,290
Then we will leave and return another day.

86
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,580
Let's go.

87
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,690
Don't worry too much. It's a light cold.

88
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,550
This is a medicine to replenish your energy.

89
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,560
If you drink some, your cold may subside a bit.

90
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,700
 Don't smile like that.

91
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,180
 Please don't.

92
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,650
Your Majesty, what is the matter?

93
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,130
Are you in pain?

94
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,610
No, it's nothing.

95
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:37,170
Your Majesty, the queen dowager is here.

96
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,530
Will you be alright?

97
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,800
Don't worry about me.

98
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,770
Your Majesty, no need to rise.

99
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:09,430
You are sweating so much. I fear your illness is worse than I thought.

100
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,960
Don't worry.

101
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,850
It just looks like that because I have a fever. It's just a passing cold.

102
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,140
Your fever is this high, and you say it is a mere cold?

103
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,430
Your well-being is this country's well-being!

104
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,530
Queen, how could you not take care of His Majesty's health?

105
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:39,580
I apologize. It is my fault for not fulfilling my duties.

106
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,990
Good that you know.

107
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,690
Therefore, from now on

108
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:52,270
I plan to serve His Majesty with all my heart and strength.

109
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,620
If it's something that may bring harm to him, I will not let anything pass.

110
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,270
And also for attempts to use me to harm His Majesty,

111
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,020
I will not let that pass either.

112
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,860
So Queen Dowager, please don't worry.

113
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:37,050
You must be heartbroken after what happened to Court Lady Jang.

114
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:42,860
If I could measure up in any way, please call upon me should you feel lonely.

115
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:04,990

116
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,140
It appears as if your fever is worse than before.

117
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,630
Your face is all flushed.

118
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,220
This is not that kind of a fever.

119
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,600
When the queen dowager hid her own wrongdoings

120
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,690
and turned on you,

121
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,420
I became angry.

122
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,190
But when I saw that before I even got the chance to speak,

123
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,290
you went ahead and said everything that needed to be said, I was relieved.

124
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:48,990
I... wanted to say more, but held my tongue because you were there.

125
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:54,390
Hearing you tell me so is like a heavy weight off my chest.

126
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,660
Is that so?

127
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,230
I'm relieved now.

128
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:04,930
Your countenance was dark, so I was quite worried that you weren't happy to see me.

129
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,360
That's not true!

130
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,430
It's because I don't feel too well.

131
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,390
Now that I think of it, you've been sitting up for quite some time now!

132
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,690
Hurry and lie down.

133
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,720
I'd better sleep for a bit.

134
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,580
I'll stay by your side until you fall asleep.

135
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,880
Do you have anything you wish to ask of me?

136
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:17,350
Nothing. I am tired, but I don't think I'll fall asleep too quickly.

137
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:22,350
In that case, I'll read a book for you.

138
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,460
No, I'm fine!

139
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,010
 Odes of Wang: Gathering Artemisia

140
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:44,630
Your Highness! How is it that the Book of Odes is annotated in common characters?

141
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,170
Well, that...

142
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,780
I wanted to learn common characters.

143
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,960
I heard that many of our people use it.

144
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,580
I had no idea you had such thoughts

145
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:07,950
and advised you to try to be closer to our people.

146
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,740
I'm quite embarrassed.

147
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:16,160
Don't be. Your words helped me.

148
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,110
Then where should I read from?

149
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,210
There, from where you opened up.

150
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,130
The overgrown kudzu vines,

151
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,600
it feels like three months have passed if I don't see them for even one day.

152
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,450
Prince Jin Pyeong.

153
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,720
I came to seek an audience with His Majesty. Is someone already with him?

154
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,890
The queen is with him.

155
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,180
How is His Majesty doing?

156
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:02,640
Thanks to your concern, I'm sure he will be alright soon.

157
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:08,470
I'll have to escort His Majesty to the hunting grounds once he's recovered.

158
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,650
We'll have to hunt down that deer we missed last time.

159
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:16,550
If he were to go hunting again, perhaps this time he will hunt down a savage beast instead.

160
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:21,080
For example, the wolf who preys after something

161
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,510
that the tiger caught.

162
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,430
We can look forward to it.

163
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:42,390
Use Her Highness as an excuse to turn away all visits today.

164
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,200
Yes, sir.

165
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:49,210
 Huijeong Hall

166
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,790
That can't be...

167
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,840
Chirp, chirp, loud is the buzz of the insects.

168
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,900
Jump, jump, the grasshoppers are at play.

169
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:38,500
My heart that yearns to see my lover is restless.

170
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:43,570
If I were to see my lover, and if I were with my lover,

171
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,150
would this heart be at peace?

172
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:52,270
Such a happy way to read a sad ode.

173
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,570
My apologies.

174
00:19:54,570 --> 00:20:00,330
I was suddenly reminded of a forgotten past.

175
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,420
The past?

176
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,340
Have you forgotten?

177
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:17,400
When you were a crown prince, we had just married, and I couldn't fall asleep.

178
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,920
You caught me a cricket.

179
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,550
I did that, did I?

180
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:30,330
You told me that I would fall asleep easily listening to the sounds of the cricket.

181
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,990
Later I found out that, His Majesty who fears nothing in this world,

182
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:41,220
the only thing you feared were bugs.

183
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:46,790
I was very surprised

184
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,290
and very happy.

185
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:02,960
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

186
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:09,940
I'm sorry. I feel I need to be alone to fall asleep.

187
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:16,100
I apologize. I'll leave now so you can rest well.

188
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,550
I must have been pierced in the heart.

189
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,370
My heart aches so much and feels as if it is weighed down.

190
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,010
 Seonpyeong Gate (King's Quarters)

191
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:10,610
Your Highness, should we head back towards the king's palace?

192
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:16,750
No need. Let's come back tomorrow. Show the way back.

193
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,980
Yes, Your Highness.

194
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,750
He's only letting the queen in and turning away all others?

195
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,630
The queen dowager visited for a short while as well.

196
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:34,150
She probably used her status to barge in, using the excuse to check on the king's health.

197
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,050
What will you do now?

198
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,380
His Majesty seems to plan on protecting the queen.

199
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,370
Did His Majesty say so?

200
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,190
Not quite. Just my thoughts.

201
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,910
Did anyone ask for your thoughts?

202
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,600
My apologies.

203
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,690
The king's mind changes twenty times a day.

204
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:04,880
You just do your best to regain your post as the king's court lady,

205
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,480
so that I can decide whether to continue holding your hand

206
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,370
or to let go.

207
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,030
Got it?

208
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:35,090
Your Highness, we can do it.

209
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,920
No.

210
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,390
From now on, I will personally prepare medicine for His Majesty.

211
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,960
Pardon?

212
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,390
Yes, Your Highness.

213
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:26,320
Have you thought about what I told you last time?

214
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,690
Do you mean your offer to go back to the times when we worked together?

215
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,890
Look here.

216
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,600
In order to properly serve His Majesty,

217
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,270
you need to know how to make alliances with people.

218
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,620
There is no reason for us to quarrel this way, is there?

219
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,090
What you said is not wrong.

220
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,250
If you were to yield on one thing, I will consider it.

221
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:54,020
Alright, what is that?

222
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,780
Step down from your post as the left state minister.

223
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,250
If you do so, I will join hands with you

224
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,150
and make the king one who will be praised throughout history

225
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:09,100
and will make sure you are recorded as the one and only, most loyal of servants.

226
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,780
Was that such a humorous suggestion?

227
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:28,020
In order for His Majesty to be seated on the throne, not a day went by when I did not bloody my hands.

228
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,090
A treacherous servant who brought bloody winds wherever he went...

229
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:34,960
A hideous ghoul who is less than a beast, but wears the mask of a human...

230
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,180
A hound dog who doesn't hesitate once before committing a dirty deed.

231
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:43,420
With every additional demoralizing nickname I got, I became all the more proud.

232
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,400
For His Majesty, I was prepared to withstand any insult

233
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,360
and any pain.

234
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,640
Such is the loyalty of Sin Chi Soo.

235
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:01,520
But what about you?

236
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,730
While I was standing in the middle of those bloody winds,

237
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:12,560
you were hiding behind His Majesty's father-in-law, so dignified and clean, without so much as a drop of blood on your hands.

238
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:18,580
Even when His Majesty ordered the execution of the queen's father, you did nothing.

239
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:24,500
From the mouth of a coward who can stomach neither sacrifice nor shame,

240
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,980
the fact that I heard you say that you would make me the most loyal servant of His Majesty...

241
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:33,830
How could I not laugh at that?

242
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,820
Is that why you went behind His Majesty's back

243
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,040
and squeezed the sweat and tears of the citizens to fill your desires

244
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,680
and coveted power unceasingly?

245
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:51,520
Is that something a loyal servant that would suffer both sacrifice and shame would do?

246
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,980
Perhaps for you,   "choong"  does not mean the  "choong"(忠)   in loyalty, where you devote yourself for the one you serve,

247
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,700
but the  "choong"(蟲)   where you live like an insect, living, a maggot that feeds off of human flesh?

248
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:06,390
They say dust and greed, the more it piles on, the dirtier and more foul it becomes.

249
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,710
Even if you wrap yourself in silk clothes,

250
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:13,880
and adorn your rooms with all the precious things money can buy, that foul stench...

251
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:18,500
cannot be hidden.

252
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,880
If you have even an ounce of loyalty left for His Majesty,

253
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,610
don't tarnish His Majesty's regime with that dirty greed of yours,

254
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,920
and step down of your own accord.

255
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,710
To honor the times we once worked together,

256
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,410
I am giving you this last chance.

257
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,790
My Lord, did something happen?

258
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,840
Yes, many things. This and that.

259
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,210
They don't appear to have been good things.

260
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:25,540
Does it seem so? Then you read me wrong.

261
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,930
I feel like my vision has cleared and my footsteps are lighter.

262
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:33,590
I feel as if I can fly away. I should have done this a long time ago.

263
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:37,840
Any replies from the members?

264
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,800
Why do you ask that?

265
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,650
I've realized that I also have regrets, just like you.

266
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,850
You mean—

267
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,470
Send news to the  members.

268
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:56,820
It is time for another gathering.

269
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,680
It's been exactly a week

270
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,870
since I've seen you with such a bright countenance.

271
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,680
There's no need to go through the trouble of preparing my medicine.

272
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,410
I've never thought of it as trouble.

273
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:32,770
I'll be preparing medicine for you for another 10 days, so please don't refuse.

274
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:46,500
Your Majesty, how about you rest for a few more days before attending court matters?

275
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:50,200
Don't worry. I'll take it easy.

276
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,470
Your Majesty.

277
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:57,620
I... actually have a request.

278
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:01,990
The memorial day of your birth mother is fast approaching.

279
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:06,590
I heard that the tributary rice that we gave out to the people for the annual memorial has run out.

280
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:11,320
I apologize for bothering you, but please find a way for us to share rice with the impoverished.

281
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,730
I will.

282
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:18,110
What could possibly be hard about finding rice to save the impoverished people of this nation?

283
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:34,250
Your Majesty. I apologize, but it will be hard for me to honor your order to prepare the rice.

284
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,610
Hard? What do you mean?

285
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:40,050
Traditionally, the rice that we shared to honor the annual memorial service

286
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:43,530
has never come from the court budget and resources.

287
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:46,260
Every year we would use those of the Ministry of Finance,

288
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:52,510
but this year we're expecting a large number of resources to be used in the building of the additional palaces, so that won't be easy either.

289
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:56,580
Can't we postpone the building of the palaces, and prioritize procuring rice for the people?

290
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:01,670
How could I not be aware of your concern and care on behalf of the people?

291
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,990
Due to the chaos that the court went through due to incidents of late,

292
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:08,730
restoring your honor as the king has become of utmost priority.

293
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,840
This cannot be delayed longer.

294
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,310
So you're telling me that there is no way at this time?

295
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:18,520
For me, carefully serving you

296
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,600
and serving the people are the same.

297
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,840
It is just that there are priorities.

298
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,620
I feel that serving you should be first at this time.

299
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:33,480
If you really wanted to prepare rice for the people, the only way is to command the Ministry of Finance

300
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,490
to increase tax rates.

301
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,440
Understood.

302
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,150
I'll consider this. You may leave.

303
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:51,710

304
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:03,430
There are people starving, and yet he wants to build palaces first?

305
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:06,930
Are those words or sh*t? Nonsense!

306
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:14,230
The left state minister oversees much of the palace's resources.

307
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:18,200
As he has the good excuse of building a palace on your behalf,

308
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,310
he probably won't budge.

309
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,720
Then what do we do now?

310
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:31,220
Call for the minister of Finance, Lee Han Jong.

311
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,720
The left state minister advised me to order your ministry to raise taxes in order to prepare rice to be donated.

312
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,910
What do you think of that?

313
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:46,130
Your Majesty, that can't be.

314
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:50,160
If we were to raise taxes on the people, saying that we're trying to help them,

315
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,230
what difference is there in outright deceiving them?

316
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,680
My thoughts exactly.

317
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,390
I have no desire to prepare the rice by raising taxes.

318
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:05,300
To be honest, there is rice that has been gathered by various provinces for this very purpose.

319
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,960
But officers from those provinces confiscated it for various reasons,

320
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,880
and it is not being used to help the people.

321
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,870
Is there really no way for us to obtain rice?

322
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,150
There is a way.

323
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,580
What is that?

324
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,860
To ask for tributary payments.

325
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,690
Tributary payments?

326
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:24,970
Gae Hwan, how did you end up in the palace?

327
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:30,590
I apologize, but my father was unable to pay tributary payments...

328
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:35,910
I heard that some had to sell their own children because they were unable to make tributary payments.

329
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,790
When I was performing on the streets—

330
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,540
When... I heard news from the streets, I heard that some offerings were rejected

331
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:53,810
and some were forced to sell their rice and pay for expensive items.

332
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,670
Court officials receive bribes and reject them on purpose,

333
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:01,080
so that merchants can profit from the transactions.

334
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:06,940
Then we should receive it as rice in the first place! Goodness.

335
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:16,740
Your Majesty, are you suggesting that we bring back the Dae Dong policy?

336
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:20,610
 (Dae Dong Policy was when the decree to offer specialty produce from a subject's province as a tribute to the court was changed, so everyone paid with rice.)

337
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,520
Yes!

338
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,300
Hearing Your Majesty's thoughts,

339
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,500
I feel the weight on my shoulders melt away.

340
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,040
Of course, to bring the Dae Dong policy back, there are a series of mountains to climb.

341
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,120
Dae Dong policy is only applied to those who own land,

342
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:40,280
so you will no doubt be met with powerful opposition from those who own a lot of land.

343
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,850
They'll oppose claiming that if we were to administer the Dae Dong policy, rice prices will go up

344
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:47,100
and will cause increased strain on the people.

345
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:51,160
So if you were to go from receiving prized specialty produce from each province to receiving rice,

346
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:55,510
you should analyze the value of those items and make sure you calculate the right amount of rice to receive.

347
00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:02,030
But unfortunately, in the Ministry of Finance, we have yet to see one who is able to do such calculations.

348
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,920
Then you're saying there's no way.

349
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,930
Although he isn't a government officer, there is one who possesses extraordinary mathematical skills.

350
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,260
Who is that?

351
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,650
A man named Ho Geol from the Joo family.

352
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,480
I had no idea you would remember the name Joo Ho Geol.

353
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:24,990
After I met with him at the request of Lord Joo a long time ago, I have never forgotten his name.

354
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:29,020
Those otherworldly calculation skills... How could I forget?

355
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,780
If we had him, we would be able to vanquish those who siphon away resources meant for the people

356
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:36,160
to fill their own bellies.

357
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,410
We could also cut off all connections and funding that goes to the left state minister.

358
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:44,900
If the left state minister were to find out, he would exert all his energy to prevent it.

359
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,960
Before then, would you be able to find Joo Ho Geol?

360
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,330
I've already sent word out here and there, so we should be able to find him soon.

361
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:57,540
I'll first review the human resources records in the Ministry of Finance

362
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,830
to figure out who may cause trouble.

363
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,570
That sounds good.

364
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,530
  (Two eights)

365
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,220
All in.

366
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,970
 (Nine)

367
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:23,140
Two nines. I'll take this pot.

368
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,580
There is no way.

369
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:30,710
What do you mean no way? Even after seeing my hand, you don't believe me?

370
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,610
I've been counting each card.

371
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:38,320
Let's see here. You have a three and a six.

372
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,080
 (Three &amp; six)

373
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,260
You have a four and an eight.

374
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,300
 (Four &amp; eight)

375
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:48,780
And you? You don't have two nines. You have a nine and a seven.

376
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,630
Let's see here.

377
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,160
If I indeed have two nines, I'm going to hack off your wrist.

378
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,990
If it is a nine and a seven, I'll hack off your head.

379
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:10,690
Don't make me laugh. How could you possibly memorize 40 cards?

380
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,060
Try mixing 80, let alone 40.

381
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,430
I can memorize it all with just one look.

382
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:20,650
  (Nine &amp; seven)

383
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,490
Look at this.

384
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,330
Nine and seven.

385
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,560
I have eight and a zero.

386
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,540
I've played too much.

387
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,610
Here, I'll pay for the drinks and leave.

388
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,070
Get him!

389
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:44,980
Why are you acting like this?

390
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,890
I was wrong, please save me.

391
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,570
I see you were just a pretty faced coward.

392
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,610
Let go!

393
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,820
You're still the same.

394
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:20,480
You can't even fight, and yet you just take people on without a thought.

395
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,800
You haven't changed a bit either!

396
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,550
Your bad habit of crushing someone without even giving them a chance.

397
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:33,820
How come you didn't even visit me once when you have such a grudge against me?

398
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:40,220
I tried. I heard that you were a court official, so I wanted to see if I could take some of that wealth.

399
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,150
But, not only do you not have any wealth accumulated,

400
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:47,130
I also heard that you didn't get any inheritance, so I gave up.

401
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,150
You've become a thief since then?

402
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:54,680
What is there that a wandering low-class man can't do?

403
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:58,340
If there was a way for you to hold your ground in this world,

404
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:04,460
and if there was a way for you to contribute to making a new world that Elder Gil Sam Bong and our members dreamed about,

405
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,760
would you join me?

406
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,430
Do you think such a thing would exist in Joseon today?

407
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,190
Nonsense!

408
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:17,520
Just for harboring such a dream, you would get killed for treason.

409
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,470
Like Elder Gil Sam Bong and the members.

410
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,600
Ho Geol.

411
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,340
Don't you dare follow me? I don't want to see blood.

412
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,380
How long could I just meander around as a rural officer?

413
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,600
I request it of you.

414
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,790
How could I act like I don't know about

415
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:53,190
your caring loyalty to His Majesty?

416
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:59,820
You will be promoted to the provincial governor's post, so rest assured.

417
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,920
I'll leave it up to you then, Left State Minister.

418
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:26,420
My Lord, I received a letter from the members.

419
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:32,210
I think it would be good if I went and met them alone.

420
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,320
There's no need for that.

421
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,730
Where are you to meet them?

422
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:49,110
I wonder if it would be alright to meet them in broad daylight like this.

423
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,680
If the members are seen and suspected of plotting treason,

424
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,690
if someone were to see us all together...

425
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:59,030
Isn't the spirit of Dae Dong to live together in harmony, in a bright world?

426
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:02,320
There is no need for us to meet while hiding in the dark.

427
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,320
However...

428
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,950
Don't worry.

429
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:09,560
I won't let such a thing happen ever again.

430
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:21,080

431
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,790
Look here, Woon Sim. How is the royal chief secretary here with you?

432
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,650
I called all of you here.

433
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:41,690
Woon Sim, I'm disappointed in you.

434
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:45,230
How could you team up with a traitor and fool us?

435
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,070
Let's all go.

436
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,350
Wait a moment.

437
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:05,990
Back then, when Elder Gil Sam Bong and the members

438
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,740
were being tortured to death for treason,

439
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:13,110
I came here today to confess my crime of not doing anything.

440
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,620
Please,

441
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,860
forgive me.

442
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,090
Bring Elder Gil Sam Bong and the members back to life.

443
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:26,690
Then you'll be forgiven.

444
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,850
Don't send us a letter ever again.

445
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,730
My Lord.

446
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,490
I didn't think it would be easy to get their forgiveness.

447
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:56,780
It just shows how much they miss the Dae Dong Society.

448
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,110
Don't worry.

449
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,770
I won't ever give up.

450
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:16,030
 (Writing in common characters.)

451
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:24,690
I think I took the tasks of a king too lightly.

452
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:28,760
I thought that all I needed to do was memorize a few books.

453
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:35,270
How could there be so many letters from rural officers and secret royal inspectors?

454
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:37,490
When am I supposed to read all of this?

455
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,040
Exactly.

456
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:45,360
When will I ever be able to write all of these in the common characters?

457
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,930
What I'm saying is...

458
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:56,600
You're suffering a lot because of me.

459
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,820
Go rest.

460
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,240
It's okay.

461
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,360
You'll only be able to read this if I'm here.

462
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,670
After I memorized the Book of Odes, I began to recognize characters here and there.

463
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:13,100
I'll figure out the documents somehow,

464
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,670
so rest for a few hours.

465
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,070
It's an order.

466
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:27,880
Alright. I'll follow your order.

467
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:09,750
Your Highness, it seems like the Chief Eunuch has stepped out for a moment.

468
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:12,230
Should I announce your arrival to His Majesty?

469
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:13,550
No.

470
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:18,260
I'll just hand him the medicine and come right out, so wait here.

471
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,290
Why did you so return so quickly?

472
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,800
Hurry and look at thi—

473
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:19,080
I'm sorry.

474
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,360
I thought you were Eunuch Jo.

475
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:25,520
Were you very shocked?

476
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,350
Yes. A little.

477
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,620
What brings you to the library?

478
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:35,910
It's time for you to take your medicine.

479
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:40,380
I went to your palace and heard you were here, so I came.

480
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:44,630
I hope that I'm not intruding.

481
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:45,910
No.

482
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:50,340
I was going to go to bed once Eunuch Jo returned.

483
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:14,470
What should we do? It has already cooled.

484
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:17,260
I'll go and make a new one, so—

485
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,920
No.

486
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,290
It'll still have the same effect even if it's cool.

487
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,430
I drank it well.

488
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:50,010

489
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:36,760
This is my first time in the library.

490
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:42,410
There are more books than I had imagined.

491
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:48,550
I had no idea you enjoyed books this much.

492
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:54,130
I'll allow it, so come in whenever you please.

493
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:57,160
I'm grateful.

494
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:14,120
What is your favorite book?

495
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:20,710
I enjoy the works of the poet Do Hyeon Myeong.

496
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:27,190
Like the birds soaring in the high skies and the fish swimming in the deep waters,

497
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:30,670
I like things that are pure and close to nature.

498
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:34,450
If you like things that are pure and close to nature,

499
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:38,130
living in the palace must be a bit stifling for you.

500
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,120
I apologize, but

501
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:45,260
in the past, I have had such thoughts.

502
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,280
And if I were to be even more honest with you,

503
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:54,590
there were times when I've dreamt of living somewhere that's not the palace.

504
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:01,970
But not now.

505
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:07,340
I can't bear to imagine living somewhere that is not the palace.

506
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:27,400
Your Majesty.

507
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,600
Eunuch Jo!

508
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:52,200
Aren't you the court lady from the queen's palace?

509
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,160
Why are you here?

510
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,670
Perhaps, is the queen here?

511
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:02,980
I was just looking for you.

512
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:05,250
His Majesty asked for some tea,

513
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:08,170
but I have no idea what tea he drinks.

514
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:10,510
So, please.

515
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:12,550
I'll take care of it.

516
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:14,890
Sir!

517
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:26,280
Your Majesty. It is I, Eunuch Jo.

518
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:44,740
Welcome back. I told you to rest. Why did you return so quickly?

519
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,200
I knew that you were alone.

520
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,190
How could I rest comfortably?

521
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:54,490
Your Highness.

522
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:03,320
Your Majesty, I'll take my leave now.

523
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:06,940
Alright.

524
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:26,020

525
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:56,520
Your Highness, your cheeks are as rosy as if they were soaked in gardenia flowers.

526
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:01,250
Were you thinking of His Majesty?

527
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:05,460
Does it show that much?

528
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:19,020
If it weren't for the Eunuch Jo, it would have been perfect!

529
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:24,370
He's so slow with everything else, yet so quick when it comes to serving His Majesty.

530
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,390
I agree.

531
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:31,790
I don't know if I should reward him

532
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:35,390
or punish him.

533
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,090
How dare you. Coming in here without being summoned.

534
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:50,620
Then you should have turned me away. Why did you call me in?

535
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,160
 Diamond Sutra (Geumgang Gyeong)

536
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,400
I've heard many things about you.

537
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,570
Eight out of ten of them are most likely false. Who did you hear them from?

538
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:17,070
I heard from the late king.

539
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:24,270
He said that he hadn't seen anyone as effective in resolving issues as you are.

540
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:28,790
When he had to send you to the crown prince's palace, he was so disappointed.

541
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:31,760
If he were to find out that immediately after the late king's death

542
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,650
you turned to stand on the new king's side,

543
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:40,820
he would be grinding his teeth with anger, even in the afterlife.

544
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,790
Your Highness...

545
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:49,240
Don't worry.

546
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:53,040
I meant to say that I value your talents.

547
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,950
- Then...
- Go on and do what you do best.

548
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:02,490
I'll be judging you myself to see how good you are

549
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:05,300
at resolving my issues.

550
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:34,740
Gosh! So prickly!

551
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:37,000
Yikes, this is prickly.

552
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:43,230
So prickly.

553
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:54,140
I told you to pick chestnuts, but you're picking up hazelnuts.

554
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:57,040
Hazelnuts are too small!

555
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,000
You do whatever you want. I'll roast and eat all the chestnuts myself.

556
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,540
Look for big, sturdy chestnuts like these, got it?

557
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,220
What are you doing here?

558
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:36,460
Didn't I tell you to stick by my side?

559
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:40,710
Why won't you listen?

560
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:45,960
I tell you to pick up chestnuts, and you don't.

561
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:00,270
Here.

562
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,150
85... 86...

563
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:11,840
I have 86.

564
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,010
I have 83.

565
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,470
Wait.

566
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:21,710
86, 88, 90...

567
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:25,030
You should be at 93. I won.

568
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,690
A commoner like you. How are you so good at playing games for nobles?

569
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,140
My dad was an expert at this game.

570
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:40,520
I grew up watching my father play this and have played ever since.

571
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:46,010
You commoner, you're crossing a line. Don't lie to us.

572
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:47,720
I'm speaking the truth.

573
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:50,860
A truth that sounds like a lie.

574
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,650
Don't speak nonsense, and set up the next round.

575
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:54,430
First, the betting money.

576
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:56,760
Here.

577
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:00,620
What is this?

578
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,980
Aigoo, what is this?

579
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:09,670
Are you Joo Ho Geol?

580
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:12,750
Yes?

581
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:16,520
I've received a report that you hacked off a person's wrist as payment for a gambling match.

582
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,390
- Drag him out immediately!
 - Yes!

583
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:20,570
No, no! Let me go!

584
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:23,750
Let me go! No!

585
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:40,390
Is this your doing?

586
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:43,490
Can you misuse your authority as a chief royal secretary like this?

587
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:47,450
Can you lock up an innocent citizen like me under such a ridiculous claim?

588
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:51,460
Tit for tat. I'll use my power like this,

589
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:55,620
and you will waste your talent through gambling.

590
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:58,480
Is that it?

591
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,940
What will you do? Will you join me?

592
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,160
First, get me out of here,

593
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,920
and pay me the money I was about to win today.

594
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,740
How much do you want? Name an amount.

595
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:20,430
Such big talk from someone who doesn't have any accumulated wealth.

596
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:24,650
The one who will compensate you is not me.

597
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:27,540
If not you,

598
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:30,070
then who?

599
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:40,810
Please show your respects to His Majesty.

600
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:46,390
I'm Ho Geol from the Joo family.

601
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:48,930
How dare you.

602
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:52,990
Chief Eunuch Jo, that will do. Leave him be.

603
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:59,110
I heard that you can make calculations that ten minds cannot, in just one moment.

604
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:02,220
You must have heard some false rumors.

605
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:09,290
To my memory, be it 10 or 20, I never did such a thing.

606
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,560
Aren't you interested in using talents for the affairs of your country?

607
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,960
I had such thoughts for a short while in the past,

608
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,460
but now,

609
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:27,130
I have no desire whatsoever.

610
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:32,710
I heard you like bets. How about you make one with me?

611
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:38,410
The loser must yield to the wishes of the winner. Do you accept?

612
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:40,130
I hope you don't regret this.

613
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:44,590
I have never lost.

614
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:01,150
 (Two sevens)

615
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:06,590
I have two sevens.

616
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:08,990
I think I won.

617
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,740
Two nines.

618
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:13,690
Two ni—

619
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:32,430
 (Two threes.)

620
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:36,230
- I have two threes.
- I have two fours.

621
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:38,360
Why in the world are the fours—

622
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:41,370
 (Eight and two)
(Eight and six)

623
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:42,590
Four strokes.

624
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:44,230
You have won.

625
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:44,950
 (Six and seven)

626
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:48,740
You can't possibly have... three strokes?

627
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:57,100
Come on, come on.

628
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:59,340
I got it!

629
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,280
Two nines!

630
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:06,410
Two tens! 
 (In this game of Tujeon, two tens, or two "jangs" was the highest possible combination.)

631
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,990
There is no way...

632
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:12,520
Now, will you follow my wishes?

633
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:17,170
How can I not follow your royal command?

634
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:21,400
I need your talents, but I have no desire to force you to do anything.

635
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:25,930
Once you decide, come on your own accord.

636
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:28,150
You may take your leave.

637
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,960
Have you seen someone like him?

638
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,360
A mere government officer, yet he didn't even pay any respect to me.

639
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:20,820
Wait a moment. Where have I seen that face before?

640
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:24,510
He is—!

641
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:34,450
You won all the games.

642
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:37,130
What trick did you have up your sleeve?

643
01:04:55,830 --> 01:05:00,190
Didn't I tell you? I never lose.

644
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:06,960
What if he leaves like that and never returns?

645
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:11,800
Don't worry. You've already won him over.

646
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:22,520
You won't understand even if I were to tell you. I'm just born with it.

647
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:36,110
You saw the commoner son of former Minister of Finance Joo Se Woong in the palace?

648
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:38,250
Yes.

649
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:41,410
I thought I had seen him somewhere,

650
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:46,300
then after some thought, I recognized that he was the commoner son

651
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:49,540
of Joo Se Woong who brought upon the downfall of his clan due to the revolt of Dae Dong Society.

652
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:51,840
Dae Dong Society...

653
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:53,690
Are you sure about this?

654
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:55,420
Absolutely.

655
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:59,230
Upon hearing the words of the minister of general affairs, I also remembered.

656
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:04,040
Though he was born of a commoner mother, he is a genius with supernatural mathematics ability.

657
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,110
I've heard the late Lord Joo boast about him before.

658
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:14,310
After the minister of fFinance reviewed the human resource records, such a character entered the palace.

659
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:20,540
It seems they plan on using his talents to look through the records to reveal embezzelment.

660
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:28,660
I feel it is time for you, Minister of General Affairs, to step up.

661
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:37,680
What are you doing?

662
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:42,690
Gather up all the records, not a single one should be left behind!

663
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:44,420
Yes, sir!

664
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,120
Minister of General Affairs, what is all this about?

665
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:03,670
Your Majesty, due to the delayed assignment of rural officers,

666
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:07,980
I'm receiving reports that the citizens are being extremely inconvenienced.

667
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:10,760
This is because officers are holding on meaninglessly

668
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,770
to the records without handing them over to the Ministry of General Affairs.

669
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:18,020
It was to right this wrong, so please understand.

670
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:21,180
Please understand, Your Majesty.

671
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:26,430
Your Majesty, the minister of finance is the one in charge of the reassignment of rural officers.

672
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:30,200
Minister of General Affairs stepped out of line in trying to address this issue.

673
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,190
No matter how I think of this,

674
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:35,950
I can't see it any other way than  as a trick to cover the crimes of certain parties.

675
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:39,010
Trickery? Stepping out of line?

676
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:43,650
If the minister of finance had done his job properly from the beginning, there would have been no need for this rush from the Ministry of General Affairs.

677
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:46,110
Why don't you answer in front of His Majesty?

678
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:49,840
What exactly was the issue with the records that it took so long for you to take care of this?

679
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:51,340
That...

680
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:54,390
Are you saying there is an issue or not?

681
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:57,800
Your Majesty, you must command an investigation by the Office of the Inspector General

682
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:02,390
and clarify who is at fault in this situation.

683
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:18,160
If we carry out an investigation, what happens?

684
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:23,830
If the Office of Inspector General concludes that there is nothing wrong with the records,

685
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:26,520
for the fault of delaying processes and not meeting deadlines,

686
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:30,290
they will ask for you to punish the minister of finance.

687
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,330
If Finance Minister Lee Yeon Jeong is fired from his office,

688
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:36,820
it'll be difficult to administer the Dae Dong policy.

689
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,780
Is there any way to prevent that from happening?

690
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:46,520
We can prevent this by finding evidence of embezzlement from the records.

691
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:52,750
I'll meet with Ho Geol tonight and end this here.

692
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,410
How could one initiate a meeting, yet be so late?!

693
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,660
Would you look at that?

694
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:23,110
If you had been but 15 more minutes late, I was going to just leave.

695
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:31,710
Ho Geol!

696
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:51,420
I went through an entire bunch of medicine to prepare them.

697
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:58,080
As one would look upon the stars or the moon, I would look towards the king's palace for long stretches of time.

698
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:02,250
Be it the garden or library,

699
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:06,780
I don't know how many times I went in and out.

700
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:13,980
I think... I needed an excuse.

701
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:22,560
There is no way for me to hide any longer

702
01:12:23,830 --> 01:12:27,010
the reason why my heart flutters so.

703
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:41,020
I have come to love you, Your Majesty.

704
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:46,590
I have finally

705
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:50,420
come to love you.

706
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:33,550
 The Crowned Clown

707
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:43,560

708
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:54,000
 Preview

709
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:59,950
 Don't be delusional. She doesn't love me. She loves the king.

710
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:02,980
 Did you just say a mere government official?

711
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,950
 How could you do this?

712
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:08,420
 Do you think we'd be able to see an heir from the queen?

713
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:12,450
 I see you often, so my heart feels it too often as well.

714
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:14,850
 Why are you hesitating?

715
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:17,560
 If this was a dream. If this really was a dream.

716
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:20,000
 No matter what I do, it won't be a crime.

717
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,820
 You there!

718
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:28,020
♫  I will wait for your heart  ♫
