 Episode 7

5
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,310
Orabeoni.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,280
Orabeoni.

7
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,200
Orabeoni.

8
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,390
Orabeoni!

9
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,830
Orabeoni!

10
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,030
Orabeoni.

11
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,900
Look behind that closet.

12
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,940
Orabeoni.

13
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,380
Water.

14
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,130
Give me some water.

15
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,730
Orabeoni.

16
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,410
 Dal Rae!

17
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,720
 Dal Rae!

18
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,650
I'll go to the brothel first and ask for help, so you find Dal Rae.

19
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,100
Okay.

20
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,990
Dal Rae!

21
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,640
Dal Rae!

22
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,240
Dal Rae!

23
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,000
Ahjae. (Ahjussi)

24
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,410
Oh my! Dal Rae!

25
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,190
Where have you been?!

26
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,590
Do you want to see me die from worry?

27
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,480
Ahjae, listen to me.

28
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,170
Ha Seon is gone and now you, too...

29
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,900
How could you make me worry about you so much?!

30
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,280
But...

31
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,730
You can speak now?

32
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,390
Oh my, my...

33
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:28,210
Ahjae, my orabeoni is here.

34
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,790
We have to find my orabeoni!

35
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,100
What are you saying... I don't know.

36
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,790
I came with the monk, so let's quickly go to Woon Sim.

37
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,480
Hold on. Do you know who was keeping him?

38
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,930
It was that Buddhist bastard.

39
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,300
How could that bastard do that to my brother?

40
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,290
What the heck are you talking about?

41
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,150
I'm telling you the truth. I saw him!

42
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,070
Are you sure?

43
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,000
 Come stop by.

44
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,860
 What are you doing? Make way!

45
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,090
Sorry!

46
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,160
Are you okay?

47
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,520
Yes.

48
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,510
Delicious!

49
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,810
Enjoy the food.

50
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,300
Your Majesty.

51
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,510
Are you hungry?

52
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,930
Enjoy your food.

53
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,750
Thank you.

54
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,310
What is this?

55
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,570
It's a pig's heart.

56
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,820
Then what is this?

57
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
That's intestine.

58
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:39,380
I am sorry. You probably can't eat things like this.

59
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,310
Let's just go.

60
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,350
It's so chewy.

61
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,020
Excuse me?

62
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,690
This is the first time I've ever tasted something so delicious.

63
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,570
I am glad you think so.

64
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,770
Have you eaten this before, Your Majesty?

65
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:47,010
A few times when I come out in disguise like this.

66
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,490
It's hard to act like something tastes good when it's not to my liking.

67
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,820
Being alone with you like this,

68
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:09,000
it feels like I've become an ordinary wife who lives in this alley.

69
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,840
If you were to live here, which house would you like?

70
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,800
I'd like that house.

71
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,830
It looks like the smallest house on this street.

72
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,180
So why that house?

73
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,580
That's why I picked that house.

74
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,700
In a house that small, we'll see each other just by turning our heads.

75
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,090
Furthermore, since it's at the end of the street,

76
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:53,230
it'll be the longest distance I walk with my husband.

77
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:12,000
 "When chrysanthemums are in full bloom, wear them on you fully before making your return home."

78
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,950
I really liked looking around the marketplace when I was young.

79
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,730
A precious lady from a noble family?

80
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,730
I liked it because I could smell various living things.

81
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,000
I liked that energy, so I used to take a deep breath to take it in.

82
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:01,720
The smell of fish from the ocean. The smell of malt to make alcohol.

83
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,090
The smell of the people's sweat.

84
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,980
Do you smell the sweat on me too?

85
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,750
No.

86
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,750
You smell very warm, Your Majesty.

87
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:31,600

88
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,830
Your Majesty, look over there.

89
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,250
Welcome!

90
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,620
- May we look around? 
- Yes.

91
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,470
If you are looking for a compass to navigate the stars

92
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:02,040
or to find a good site for your home or burial, you've come to the right place.

93
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,310
Are these all you have?

94
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:09,600
Shall I show you the expensive ones? Hold on a minute.

95
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,570
What is this for?

96
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,410
I want to give you a present.

97
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,860
A p-present... what for?

98
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,790
You don't have to. I didn't do anything.

99
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,420
You've done a lot.

100
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,180
You understood my heart and did much to make me happy.

101
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,150
And I keep thinking about it, and it feels like you'll need this.

102
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,430
The last time at the palaceâ€”

103
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,300
I mean...

104
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,210
at the house, too. You got lost, didn't you?

105
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,840
 Your Majesty, I was on my way to see you anyway.

106
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,660
 Were you coming to see me?

107
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,250
 I was actually on my way to the side palace.

108
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,880
 I seem to have been in deep thought and lost my way.

109
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,680
If you even get lost at home,

110
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,220
you must have the worst sense of direction in all eight provinces of Joseon.

111
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,690
Take a look.

112
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,150
I'll give you a good price so take one.

113
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:29,850
The one you are holding has the best pattern. Do you want that one?

114
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,870
How much is it?

115
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,880
Give me three nyang.

116
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,740
Hold on!

117
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,910
What do you take us for? Two nyang!

118
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:49,820
What? Do you know how much labor went into making this?

119
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,570
-  Two nyang and seven jeon. 
-  Two nyang and five jeon!

120
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,160
- Two nyang six jeon. 
 - Two nyang four jeon.

121
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,790
Forget it then!

122
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,130
Hold on a minute.

123
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,060
Two nyang four jeon. Okay.

124
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,260
Hurry and give it.

125
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,410
 Ssajeon (Grain Store)

126
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,990
I didn't know you were that good at bargaining.

127
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:35,000
I was trying to imitate it, but I didn't know it would work.

128
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,970
It appeared as though you'd done it hundreds of times.

129
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,020
Of course not.

130
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,550
Thank you. I'll keep this with me at all times.

131
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,220
I am giving it to you so you won't get lost again.

132
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,370
It really was a mistake then.

133
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,460
I have a pretty good sense of direction.

134
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,490
I am talking about the path towards me.

135
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,460
Even if you struggle sometimes

136
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,240
or slowly come in a roundabout way,

137
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,730
come to me, please.

138
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,610
I'll always be waiting at the end of your path.

139
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,970
Your Majesty.

140
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,480
I am relieved you are okay.

141
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,990
Right, I'm very relieved.

142
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,000
Your Highness, just where have you been?

143
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,530
I've been looking all over for you.

144
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,410
I am sorry.

145
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,400
Your Majesty, I think it's best to return to the palace.

146
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,000
Will you be alright?

147
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,600
 The reason I'm sending this letter to you all is

148
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,490
 not to ask for your forgiveness.

149
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,880
 It's to convey my deepest request

150
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,990
 not to lose the opportunity to spread the meaning of Dae Dong.

151
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,400
 Sir, are you inside?

152
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,140
You came at the right time.

153
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,950
I was about to write a letter to send to the members.

154
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,130
He disappeared.

155
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,190
He...

156
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,590
Do you think he went to meet the king?

157
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,110
When did you find out?

158
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,420
I had my suspicions from the beginning.

159
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,950
If I made it obvious that I knew, I thought I wouldn't be able to help save him.

160
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,240
So I pretended not to know.

161
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,400
If I don't come back by daybreak,

162
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,070
take Woon Sim and Ho Geol and leave this place.

163
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,720
Don't enter the palace. The king won't leave you be.

164
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,660
Are you telling me to run away again?

165
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,350
Back then, didn't you do it because of the dying wishes

166
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,850
of Elder Gil Sam Bong to save the rest of the members?

167
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,570
There's a person who believed me and has his life on the line.

168
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,320
If I don't go, he will die by the hands of His Majesty.

169
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,740
I can't let that happen.

170
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,830
Why do you look like that?

171
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,540
Are you mad because I'm very late?

172
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,320
I'm sorry.

173
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,800
 The Diaries of the Royal Secretariat: a diary that records documents and events handled by the Royal Secretariat

174
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,980
Have you been well, you lowly clown?

175
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,270
Have you forgotten your manners in that short while?

176
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,990
Your Majesty.

177
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,800
Lift up your head.

178
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,770
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

179
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,360
Your Majesty!

180
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,800
Back off!

181
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,850
Y-Yes.

182
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,100
Y-Your Majesty!

183
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,020
Your Majesty, what is going on?

184
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,500
Your Majesty!

185
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,190
Your Majesty!

186
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,640
During that time, did this lowly clown become Your Majesty?

187
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,050
Clown?

188
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,990
Your Majesty, Officer Jang does not know anything!

189
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,090
Your Majesty!

190
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,060
Can you still not guess who the real king is?

191
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:54,480
Fine. I'll kill you so that you know who the real king is!

192
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,500
Your Majesty!

193
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,090
Your Majesty! Officer Jang did nothing wrong.

194
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:05,750
If there was a crime committed, it's by me who tricked Officer Jang,

195
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,520
so please spare his life.

196
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:16,500
Your Majesty, I deserve to die for not recognizing you.

197
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,790
Please kill me.

198
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,290
Go and get the chief royal secretary.

199
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

200
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:52,450
Looking at the diaries of the royal secretariat, it appears the queen left the palace to recuperate.

201
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,130
Is that something you did as well?

202
00:22:55,130 --> 00:23:00,380
Y-Yes. The royal physician said that would be good.

203
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,890
If she's recovered, it's correct for her to inform the king's palace.

204
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,830
However, because a lowly clown is sitting on the throne,

205
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,700
even that upright queen has become slack.

206
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,750
Send notice to the queen's palace!

207
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,310
Yes, yes, yes, Your Majesty.

208
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,820
Yes.

209
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,320
 Your Highness, this is Ae Yeong.

210
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,120
I see. Come in.

211
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:46,110
Your Highness, a message came from the king's palace asking you to come for a visit.

212
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:50,030
It seems that His Majesty wishes to see you again already.

213
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,880
Prepare for it.

214
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,040
Escort the chief royal secretary.

215
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,150
What are you doing?

216
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,380
It's His Majesty's command.

217
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,840
I'm talking about the real king.

218
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,890
Hurry and escort him.

219
00:24:54,290 --> 00:25:00,150
Your Majesty. I'm here to inform you that I have safely returned to the palace.

220
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,470
How are you feeling?

221
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,620
Don't worry.

222
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:11,220
Through Your Majesty's grace, my illness has been cured like a miracle.

223
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,850
Have you been well all this time, Your Majesty?

224
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:18,860
I have been well.

225
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:30,590
Your Majesty, you were exposed to many cold winds in the streets earlier.

226
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:33,450
You haven't caught a cold, have you?

227
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,340
Your Majesty?

228
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,260
I'm perfectly fine.

229
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:45,160
Rather, you are the one who was returning to the palace.

230
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,460
Are you alright?

231
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,780
Instead of feeling tired,

232
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,730
both my mind and my heart feel lighter.

233
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,790
Spending time with Your Majesty

234
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:02,530
was a tonic more effective to me than my time away from the palace.

235
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:06,750
What did I do that made you so happy?

236
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:12,180
Merely walking with you,

237
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,900
speaking comfortably with you,

238
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:19,260
and simply spending time together made me happy.

239
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,630
Since first coming to the palace,

240
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,600
I've never felt so at ease.

241
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,070
Your Majesty, is something the matter?

242
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,450
I guess...

243
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,510
I am a bit tired after all.

244
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:48,360
Would you like me to call the royal physician just in case?

245
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,700
No. You may leave.

246
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,850
Then I shall take my leave.

247
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:29,650

248
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,840
Is something troubling you, Your Highness?

249
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,660
It's nothing.

250
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:11,990
But should something happen to His Majesty, please inform my palace immediately.

251
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,850
Yes, Your Highness.

252
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,960
Chief Royal Secretary.

253
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:05,660
The queen has changed quite a bit since I've been gone.

254
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,650
What tricks did you use?

255
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:12,330
It's not like that, Your Majesty.

256
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:16,460
What do you think I'm asking about, for you to say that?

257
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,070
What exactly did you do?

258
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,220
I swear nothing happened.

259
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,770
Please believe me.

260
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:31,920
She said she walked the streets with you.

261
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,570
She said being with you was better than any tonic.

262
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:39,000
She said she liked everything.

263
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,870
The queen left to recuperate first.

264
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:47,380
Then you went out in disguise and promised to meet her?

265
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,740
Is that not so?

266
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:52,450
No, Your Majesty. That's not what happenedâ€”

267
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:55,110
Should I go and ask the queen

268
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,250
if you are telling me the truth or not?

269
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:10,860
How should I punish your crimes, you who are no better than an insect?

270
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:14,520
It's not enough to kill you.

271
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,990
Right.

272
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,720
Your family will be killed for sure,

273
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,310
but everyone who knows of your identity as well

274
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:26,690
as payment for your crimes.

275
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:36,430
 Your Majesty, the chief royal secretary has entered.

276
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,520
Enter.

277
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,100
You look like you've seen a ghost.

278
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,690
Did you not know that I would return?

279
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,750
You've returned, Your Majesty.

280
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,390
I read your records well.

281
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:22,120
You kept me confined at the temple like a criminal.

282
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,580
And what fun you had with this lowly clown!

283
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:30,070
Why would I regard Your Majesty as a criminal?

284
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,670
Your Majesty was in a semiconscious state,

285
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:37,520
I was afraid you would harm yourself so I used the last resort.

286
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,490
You did it for my sake?

287
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:43,100
Then was the Dae Dong Policy for my sake as well?

288
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,040
The Dae Dong policy was something Your Majesty

289
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,930
had your heart set on to try again one day.

290
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,620
Your Majesty and this country,

291
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,180
and for the sake of the people,

292
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:59,290
I did so because I believed it to be the right time to review it again.

293
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,310
How eloquent you are.

294
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:10,170
Of all times, why is it that you are restarting a deed that's for my sake while I'm gone?

295
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,660
This important matter.

296
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,570
While I'm gone, of all times.

297
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,790
You carry it out while using this fake one.

298
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:23,100
Wouldn't anyone who saw this situation think that you are committing a treasonous act?

299
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,490
Try making your excuses that you didn't have treasonous intentions.

300
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:34,390
Your Majesty is already holding suspicions against me.

301
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:39,490
What use will a hundred or a thousand words have?

302
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:43,520
If you can no longer trust me,

303
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,160
just kill me.

304
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:50,820
Just say anything.

305
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,380
Just yak away!

306
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,690
Try to convince me.

307
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,510
Are you saying it truly isn't?

308
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,580
It isn't.

309
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,390
Right.

310
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,960
Of course, you wouldn't.

311
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,090
You are someone who would die for me. You wouldn't betray me.

312
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,040
This bastard is the cause of all the trouble.

313
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,250
This bastard put on the king's robe and sat on the royal throne.

314
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,290
And he thought he became the real king and held treasonous intentions.

315
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:37,350
Am I right?

316
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,630
Kill him.

317
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:52,740
Kill him! Then I will believe your loyalty.

318
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,850
This bastard is only a puppet Your Majesty used.

319
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,230
Those who are trying to kill Your Majesty are still out there.

320
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:08,670
If we kill him, we will never catch them.

321
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:12,400
So then, why haven't you caught even one of them after putting this bastard up instead of me?

322
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,710
I've had firm convictions but no evidence yet

323
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:19,530
Keeping him alive at least until we capture them,

324
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,610
Your Majesty will benefit from it.

325
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:27,500
Funny. When I was about to kill you, you didn't make a single excuse.

326
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,290
But now that I'm telling you to kill him, why do you have so much to say?

327
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,960
What's that look in your eyes?

328
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,260
Now that you are holding a sword, do you wish to stab me?

329
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,940
In the palace full of Your Majesty's guards,

330
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:51,060
how could I dare hold those intentions?

331
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,950
Kill him.

332
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,620
My Lord.

333
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,760
If you won't, I will!

334
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,850
Stop.

335
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,620
You can stop now.

336
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:49,200
We can't have a low scum's blood taint the grand palace.

337
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,960
Are you outside, Officer Jang?

338
00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:59,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

339
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,600
Drag that clown out of here.

340
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,200
Where to?

341
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,130
We cannot reduce his suffering by killing him with a single sword stroke.

342
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,690
Leave him on the mountains as food for the tigers.

343
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:23,820
Until the moment he dies, make sure he trembles from the cold and fear so that he reflects on his crimes.

344
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,090
Yes, Your Majesty.

345
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:53,650
Then, shall we have a proper conversation now?

346
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,290
Summon the Left State Minister, Sin Chi Soo.

347
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:05,320
 Summon: King's command to bring to court.

348
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,860
 Dragon

349
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,240
Where do you think this place is? Who are you?

350
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,860
I came to deliver a royal command.

351
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,720
Father.

352
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,050
 Seungjungwon: Office in charge of King's commands

353
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:46,250
Father, His Majesty sent a nameplate.

354
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,010
Put it away.

355
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,880
Are you not going to go to the palace?

356
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,090
How can a vassal who has caused inconvenience

357
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:02,350
answer summons right away?

358
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,160
Excuse me?

359
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,500
But, Father...

360
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,980
 Your Majesty, I apologize, but I've fallen ill.

361
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,750
 I dare not answer Your Majesty's command.

362
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:30,660
 I'll come and visit as soon as the illness goes away.

363
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:35,190
 Please forgive my faults.

364
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,060
He dares to weigh his odds against me?

365
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:48,870
This probably isn't because of a few whippings to his son,

366
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:51,850
but ultimately it's because of the Dae Dong policy?

367
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:55,510
Should we summon him again?

368
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,860
Just let him be.

369
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:08,140
I'm tired. Let Court Lady Kim in.

370
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,140
Your Majesty, thisâ€”

371
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,200
How impertinent.

372
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,230
My apologies.

373
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:18,490
When is the date the royal observers have chosen for my night with the queen?

374
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:22,720
I believe early next month, in nine days, is the earliest.

375
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,310
Tell them to change it to tomorrow.

376
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

377
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,850
He's been dragged to the mountains in this cold weather.

378
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:45,730
His Majesty most certainly will not survive tonight.

379
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,460
His Majesty?

380
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,840
The real His Majesty has returned.

381
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,570
Is Ha Seon still His Majesty?

382
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,960
Be careful.

383
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,000
One slip of a tongue in front of His Majesty

384
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,710
could put even you in danger.

385
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,410
I understand.

386
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:10,100
I'll be careful.

387
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:29,670

388
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:40,050
Officer Jang.

389
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,520
I'm sorry.

390
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,910
I didn't mean to deceive you.

391
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:54,740
Because I entered the palace by royal command,

392
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,690
I couldn't reveal my identity.

393
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,240
It doesn't matter.

394
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:07,080
Because I, too, am only carrying out a royal command.

395
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,130
Where is Ha Seon right now?

396
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,860
Ha Seon? Is it the name of that clown bastard?

397
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:53,180
- Moo Yeong.
 - Call me Officer Jang.

398
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:57,740
I understand how you must feel.

399
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:02,310
The reason why I didn't tell you was because of His Majesty's command.

400
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:06,400
Ha Seon was simply carrying out His Majesty's command as his substitute.

401
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,290
His only crime, if there is one, is that he carried out a royal command.

402
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:15,590
Is that so? Does His Majesty also know your thoughts about this?

403
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,980
Eunuch Jo said

404
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:24,610
that your life was spared thanks to Ha Seon.

405
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:30,030
Please speak correctly.

406
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:32,520
I almost lost my life because of that bastard.

407
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,310
You must want to think that way.

408
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,580
But you and I both know

409
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,330
what kind of person Ha Seon is and

410
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:43,690
how he behaved while substituting for His Majesty.

411
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:48,850
Do you really think he committed a crime deserving of death?

412
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,310
Where is he?

413
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:54,490
Why are you trying to look for him?

414
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:57,760
Do you have treasonous intentions against His Majesty?

415
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,940
Moo Yeong.

416
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,770
It's too late.

417
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:02,590
What do you mean too late?

418
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:07,830
Has he died? Are you sure?

419
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:11,390
Yes, I'm sure.

420
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,340
 Find the way.

421
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:45,780
 The way to crush them all and protect me.

422
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,220
 Hurry.

423
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,680
 Before I really become insane.

424
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,640
 It looks like His Majesty's madness has returned.

425
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:00,570
 There seem to be people hiding everywhere who want my neck.

426
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:05,260
 I feel like I might stain my hands with blood again.

427
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:10,820
 Yool, that kid, keeps on whispering in my ear.

428
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:17,100
 What that lowlife will have to do is already decided.

429
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,010
 He'll either get stabbed or collapse from poison in my stead.

430
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:22,020
 He just did it because he was surprised.

431
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:26,590
 If he loses his head from one mistake, who would survive?

432
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:29,620
 Isn't the left state minister doing the work His Majesty should be doing?

433
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,290
 Is that man the king of this country?

434
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:35,350
 There are times when ten or even a hundred must be given for the one.

435
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:38,220
 What is the purpose of wearing silk or yielding power

436
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,650
 when the head is filled with thoughts worse than beasts,

437
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:44,860
 when the mind has no thoughts worth being a human!

438
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:50,430
 I came back determined to die, but I never said I'd die in vain.

439
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:30,570
What? Dal Rae disappeared? How did that happen?

440
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:32,910
It's not clear what happened.

441
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,560
I'm supposed to see Gap Soo here when he finds her,

442
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:39,560
but he's not back, so he must not have found her yet.

443
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,990
Making me go back and forth...

444
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,980
Hyung Jeong Saeng,

445
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:52,200
what did you want to see me for?

446
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:59,270
What do you mean we have to leave if Chief Royal Secretary isn't back?

447
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:03,310
No way... did someone falsely accuse the Dae Dong society again?

448
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,990
 Chamso: Framing someone to make him/her responsible for a crime and reporting him/her to a high-ordered person.

449
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:08,360
Is that right? Then, we should leave right now.

450
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,290
There is no reason to wait for the daytime.

451
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:14,310
We can go first and wait for him.

452
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:20,020
If that's the case, I won't leave.

453
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,090
Aigoo, Woon Sim!

454
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:24,200
You can go first.

455
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:29,130
When Chief Royal Secretary gets here, I'll leave with him.

456
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:22,930
 The clown Ha Seon is dead.

457
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:29,230
 You are now this nation's king.

458
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:06,590
I was on duty last night and was ordered to bring the royal secretariat records, so I delivered them to the palace.

459
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,220
I see.

460
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:11,090
How is His Majesty?

461
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:14,450
The thing is, he was quite strange.

462
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:15,310
How so?

463
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:17,980
Although he did not look to be in a bad mood,

464
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:22,300
he asked and checked things he already knew a few times.

465
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:25,250
Was there anything else?

466
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:30,170
I also saw the chief royal secretary being dragged to the royal palace.

467
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:33,410
The chief royal secretary entered the palace?

468
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:37,990
- Are you certain? 
 - Yes.

469
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:40,840
I saw it clearly with my own two eyes.

470
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,180
Good work. You may go now.

471
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,210
Call me anytime, My Lord.

472
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:01,480
Shouldn't we go to the palace right away?

473
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:04,910
Right now, we shouldn't answer His Majesty's summons.

474
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:07,810
It's best to remain still.

475
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:23,760

476
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,890
 Even if you struggle...

477
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:39,950
 even if you come in a roundabout way, come to me, please.

478
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:44,050
 I will always be waiting at the end of your path.

479
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:46,540
Queen.

480
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:50,810
It seems I've lost my way again.

481
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:59,490
You, I have returned.

482
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:03,190
What did Court Lady Kim of His Majesty's palace want?

483
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,010
This...

484
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:16,030
It is a notice to spend the night together.

485
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:18,260
Spend the night together?

486
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:24,730
I'm sorry but the date is for tonight.

487
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:26,990
Tonight?

488
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,530
So quick?

489
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:38,330
Who is behind those assassins and the poison sent to kill me in the night?

490
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:40,340
As I mentioned last night,

491
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:43,620
I have convictions that Queen Dowager and Prince Jin Pyeong are behind it, but

492
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,740
I don't have solid evidence yet.

493
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:49,070
A conviction is good enough for me.

494
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,220
Your Majesty.

495
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,210
Welcome, Your Majesty.

496
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:51,190
Receiving attention from the king and the royal family all together like this,

497
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:56,490
it seems this country's royal family has a bright future. It makes me happy.

498
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,830
As someone who wishes for the prosperity of this palace and the country,

499
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:06,520
how could you have planned such a thing?

500
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,130
What do you mean by such a thing?

501
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:13,020
If you want to get respect from the royal family and live the natural span of your life,

502
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:16,020
you must be more careful.

503
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:19,020
If you keep planning something behind my back,

504
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:23,290
I will chase you out to annex without any regard for bloodlines or proper procedure.

505
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:25,390
Are you threatening your mother right now?

506
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:29,060
What makes you my mother?

507
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,950
My biological mother passed a long time ago.

508
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:33,720
We've already had more than ten memorial ceremonies.

509
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,690
Your Majesty!

510
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:38,810
Why is it that you pretend you don't understand?

511
00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:40,180
I meantâ€”

512
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:42,650
So what I meant!

513
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,780
That talk of being filial and disloyal

514
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:50,320
is not going to work on me anymore.

515
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:53,580
Do you understand?

516
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,180
Your Majesty.

517
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:08,200
How can you be so ill-mannered towards the queen dowager?

518
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:14,720
I already know why you've been going in and out of the queen dowager's palace, Prince Jin Pyeong.

519
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,490
I'm not sure what kind of misunderstanding you may have,

520
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:21,960
but I am only trying to do my best for you and for the love of my country.

521
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,940
That's why. That's why I'm warning you.

522
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:29,860
Do you want to commit treason just like your father and your brother,

523
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:32,720
and get executed?

524
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:57,290
Seeing His Majesty raging fearsomely like that,

525
00:58:57,290 --> 00:59:00,280
I think he has heard something.

526
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:05,060
Did you not know that a tiger eats raw meat?

527
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:07,960
The fact that he's been focusing on running the country recently,

528
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,660
it was his plan to make us lower our guards.

529
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:14,090
What are you planning to do now?

530
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:20,520
It seems as though His Majesty's mind is not easy.

531
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:24,260
I guess I should visit a temple for worship.

532
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:36,440
Your Majesty, without any alternate plans,

533
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:40,230
if you pressure Prince Jin Pyeong and the queen dowager, it could backfire.

534
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:42,170
That's even better.

535
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:45,720
Then I will dethrone the queen dowager and execute everyone

536
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,130
including Prince Jin Pyeong and their families. That's it.

537
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,490
Left State Minister Sin Chi Soo still hasn't entered the palace?

538
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,700
No, Your Majesty. I believe

539
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:04,140
that even if we call him in again, he'll use his illness as an excuse and won't respond.

540
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:08,510
Really? Even if I call, he won't come?

541
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:13,220
I guess it can't be helped.

542
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:19,160
Your Majesty!

543
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:28,740
Your Majesty! What brings you to my humble abode?

544
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:32,370
I had no choice but to come personally since you wouldn't come to me.

545
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:34,960
Why haven't you been responding to my summons?

546
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:41,110
The reason why I used illness as an excuse to not respond to your call was

547
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:44,490
that I had no face to confront you, Your Majesty.

548
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:47,530
But you coming all the way to my home to see me...

549
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:51,200
I don't know how to repay your grace, Your Majesty.

550
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:55,120
If you truly think that you have been given my grace,

551
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:57,030
then come back to the royal court.

552
01:00:57,030 --> 01:01:01,600
Your Majesty, does that mean

553
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,920
you still trust me and will entrust me with tasks in the royal court again?

554
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,820
That's right.

555
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:12,890
If I attend the royal court again, I'll be moving forward with the reorganization of

556
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:18,000
magistrates and the government offices that was opposed by the Ministry of Finance.

557
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,740
May I do so?

558
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:24,980
Your Majesty, he can't do that.

559
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:29,650
It's something decided by the royal court. It's only right to go through discussion in the court again.

560
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:31,750
Do as you please, Left State Minister.

561
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:35,440
Then the Dae Dong policy being reviewed by the Ministry of Finance,

562
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,660
may I order them to stop?

563
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,730
That's all?

564
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:43,710
I will leave everything you'd been in charge of in your hands alone.

565
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:46,830
- Your Majesty, you can'tâ€” 
 - Shut up!

566
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:53,080
Don't ever say I cannot in front of me ever again.

567
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:57,310
If you go against my will one more time,

568
01:01:57,310 --> 01:02:00,780
even if you are my chief royal secretary, I will not let you live.

569
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:12,260
Keep that in mind. My will comes before the royal court's discussion.

570
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:17,570
I've never lost trust in you, Left State Minister.

571
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:19,950
Come back to the royal court and stay by my side!

572
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:21,440
Your Majesty.

573
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,400
Your Majesty's grace is boundless!

574
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,960
Your Majesty.

575
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:56,850
These are matters that should go through proper court procedures.

576
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:59,930
You can't just change things like this.

577
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:05,200
It'll end up giving a cause to those who disagree with the court's decisions.

578
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,030
Don't worry.

579
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:13,090
I'm bringing the left state minister back to take those who disagree out.

580
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:18,790
Then, even though you bring the left state minister back,

581
01:03:18,790 --> 01:03:20,720
please take back the order

582
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:24,930
of reappointing the government officials who have been determined guilty.

583
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:27,590
If you allow those who have embezzled government funds for personal gain

584
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:30,380
to take their posts without looking into their crimes,

585
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:33,190
Your Majesty and the court will lose the trust of people,

586
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:37,630
and their resentment will grow.

587
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:47,020
Yes, you're right.

588
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:50,960
All those decisions are also right.

589
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:56,070
But that's not my will.

590
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:59,240
It's that puppet clown's will.

591
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:03,790
How can I leave them alone just because they're right?

592
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,120
If that's what you're going to do,

593
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:11,400
there's nothing for me to do.

594
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:23,950
I ask for my resignation, so please allow it.

595
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:27,950
I won't allow it.

596
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:39,860
Do whatever you want.

597
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:42,790
You'll be back anyway.

598
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,780
Let go! What's going on?

599
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:59,010
What's the reason for arresting us?

600
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:01,450
It's for violating the king's order.

601
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:03,150
The king's order?

602
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:06,210
There's no way we violated an order!

603
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:09,070
Let go! Woon Sim!

604
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:18,290
Does Chief Royal Secretary know about this?

605
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:22,960
Arresting innocent people like this. You should be ashamed!

606
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,410
Proceed with the king's order.

607
01:05:24,410 --> 01:05:26,100
Drag them!

608
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:33,180
Chief Royal Secretary!

609
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:39,310
My Lord, a notice arrived from the authorities.

610
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,200
 Jo Ho Geol from the Bureau of Royal Treasury (naesusa) and ginyeo Woon Sim from the Cheongwolgak brothel are sentenced to death by execution for their treasonous crimes.

611
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,940
My Lord.

612
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:08,860
Hyungnim, do something, huh?

613
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:12,000
They said they will execute us tomorrow for violating the king's order.

614
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,210
Is this really what His Majesty has ordered?

615
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:16,820
Are we really going to die?

616
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:20,720
My Lord, don't worry about us.

617
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:24,690
I will not let you be locked up here for long. Hang in there.

618
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:29,650
Hyungnim, Hyungnim!

619
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:32,350
Hyungnim!

620
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:48,140
Your Majesty, Chief Royal Secretary has requested to see you.

621
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:50,240
Let him in.

622
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:14,450
Don't you ever turn your back away from me.

623
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:19,290
If you do, the people you cherish and adore

624
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:24,350
as much as your own life, I will kill every single one of them.

625
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:27,940
Everything that you wish to accomplish with your life on the line,

626
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:31,180
I will let them go in vain.

627
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:33,340
Do you understand?

628
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:38,340
I will keep that in mind, Your Majesty.

629
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,050
Proceed.

630
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:36,280
Officer Jang.

631
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:41,760
There's something you need to do.

632
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,180
Please give me your order, Your Majesty.

633
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:48,790
Go confirm that the clown is dead,

634
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:52,060
and bring his head as evidence.

635
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:14,740
 His Majesty is entering!

636
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:31,520
Your Majesty.

637
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:02,020
Let me pour you a drink.

638
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:36,730
Your Majesty, did something happen this afternoon at the side palace?

639
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:41,220
That's what I want to ask you.

640
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:43,400
What do you mean?

641
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:47,090
Where did the queen that was like ice go,

642
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:52,250
that such a warm woman is sitting next to me?

643
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:55,950
If I should be happy or sad about it,

644
01:11:56,990 --> 01:11:59,640
I really don't know.

645
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:05,330
I haven't fulfilled my duties towards you until now,

646
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:08,020
and I know that now.

647
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:13,830
But now I will gladly fulfill my duties as queen.

648
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:17,910
If you'd accept my heart,

649
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:22,550
I couldn't be any happier.

650
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:30,420
What are you so glad and happy about?

651
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,360
Your Majesty.

652
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:46,450
I haven't...

653
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,960
given you anything yet.

654
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:56,430
So any positive feelings I might have given you,

655
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:59,320
get rid of them.

656
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:00,420
But Your Majestyâ€”

657
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:03,280
I will make you realize clearly,

658
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:08,300
exactly whose woman you are.

659
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:31,350
 The Crowned Clown

660
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:40,590

661
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:51,750
 Preview

662
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:55,590
 Proceed quietly, without any fuss.

663
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:58,270
 I'm so relieved.

664
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:01,920
 I don't know why I am like this.

665
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:06,860
 One of the clowns looked exactly like His Majesty.

666
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:08,660
 What are you planning to do now?

667
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:11,650
 Are you laughing at me? Did I say to kill me?

668
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:13,280
 I want to become the real king.

669
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:16,370
 If you want my apology, I will apologize.

670
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:20,400
 If you ask me to let you go, I will let you go.

671
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,620
 Just say the word.
