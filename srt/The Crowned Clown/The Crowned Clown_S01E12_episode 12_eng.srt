 Episode 12

5
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,140
Can you not live for my sake?

6
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,390
After I entered the palace,

7
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,890
I almost died on several occasions.

8
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,860
Every time I thought I would really die,

9
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,850
I desperately wanted to survive.

10
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:10,000
Even if I could only live one more day, I wanted to live with you.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,080
Next to you, while listening to the sound of your laughter,

12
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,620
together like that...

13
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,300
 Together like that,

14
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,180
for a very long time.

15
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,270
 for a very long time.

16
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,520
Please live.

17
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,390
For me, please.

18
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,110
Your Majesty?

19
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,900
Your Majesty!

20
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,370
Your Majesty!

21
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,700
Move out!

22
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,190
Please wake up, Your Majesty!

23
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,240
 Taepyeonggwan ( Hall of Great Peace)

24
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,560
 Vice Minister of War.

25
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,250
 Please stop for a moment.

26
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:26,610
I will apologize for his rude behavior.

27
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,230
Please forgive Chief Royal Secretary's crimes.

28
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,830
He's the one who needs to beg for his crimes.

29
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,630
Why are you the one asking for forgiveness?

30
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,940
What are you doing? Ask for forgiveness, quickly.

31
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,430
I cannot.

32
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,360
What?

33
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,880
I came here as the king's subject and

34
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,760
not for personal business like my lord, who doesn't even have a title.

35
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,710
I can't do something that will soil His Majesty's name and this country to save my neck.

36
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,050
Aren't you afraid of death?

37
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,140
How can you be this brazen?

38
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:08,540
If my death can preserve the peace  between Joseon and Ming Dynasty, then what would I fear?

39
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:13,060
Your emperor probably doesn't want his relationship with Joseon to go sour either.

40
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,230
Isn't that right?

41
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,390
They say the tongue is better than the sword.

42
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:30,390
I see that there are vassals like you among the Joseon subjects.

43
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,730
What praise.

44
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:37,340
There are countless people better than me in Joseon.

45
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,430
I'll come to the palace tomorrow.

46
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,030
Instead, as an envoy escort,

47
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,730
I will take him with me.

48
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,110
I understand. Please do so.

49
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:14,210
 Taepyeonggwan ( Hall of Great Peace)

50
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:20,150
I was wondering why he forwent etiquette and arrived a day earlier.

51
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,080
It was your doing.

52
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:29,630
Don't make His Majesty's failure and your mistake my fault.

53
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,890
There's a crisis approaching this country.

54
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,400
I'm only showing my loyalty as Joseon's subject in front of it.

55
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:42,510
Is acting like a minion to the Ming envoy something that a Joseon subject would do?

56
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,020
You should go and send a messenger to His Majesty.

57
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,540
If he's not in the palace tomorrow,

58
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,760
the problem will grow so big it will get out of hand.

59
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,070
Hurry along now.

60
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,240
Were you not hurt?

61
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,720
I'm uneasy.

62
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,450
Since you're not talking,

63
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,780
perhaps I am dreaming?

64
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,950
I was very scared.

65
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,890
Because I thought I would lose you,

66
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,540
everything in front of me was dark

67
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,770
and my heart fell down a bottomless pit.

68
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,290
To be scared of something more than death itself,

69
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:12,310
I realized what it was like.

70
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:19,390
Then, have you given up on dying?

71
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,770
The guilt of not knowing I committed a sin when I did,

72
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,840
I thought that I had to pay for it with my death.

73
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,070
However, now,

74
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:43,990
even if the whole world points fingers at me, curses me, or throws stones at me,

75
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,310
I will endure it.

76
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,520
I will live. Next to you, Your Majesty.

77
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:16,070
You have saved two lives.

78
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:21,260
If you had not given up on dying,

79
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,920
I would have followed you and died.

80
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,300
Please lie down now.

81
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,280
I'm worried that your wound will get infected.

82
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,410
Close your eyes and get some sleep.

83
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,500
I don't think I can fall asleep

84
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,660
because it seems like you will disappear.

85
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,300
Don't worry.

86
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,590
I will not go anywhere.

87
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,360
I will stay by your side.

88
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,060
Please promise me.

89
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,360
Yes, I promise you.

90
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,540
An attack?

91
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,550
Where is His Majesty right now?

92
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,440
Officer Jang escorted him to a physician nearby.

93
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,740
Did you catch the criminals who attacked His Majesty?

94
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,130
We pursued them but lost them.

95
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,970
Is His Majesty seriously injured?

96
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,470
He was still unconscious when I left him.

97
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:52,130
I understand. Return and protect him.

98
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,140
Don't you need to go yourself and bring him back?

99
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,130
Early tomorrow morning, the Ming envoy will arrive.

100
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,850
I will need to protect the palace until Ha Seon returns.

101
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:23,670

102
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:18,160
What is this, Chief Royal Secretary?

103
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,120
You said that the king would be here if I came today.

104
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,450
This is different from what you promised.

105
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,070
Joseon has been called the country of courteous people in the east.

106
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:35,610
Does the king of Joseon not know his manners?!

107
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,710
Your Korean is very fluent, Ambassador.

108
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,020
When did you learn to speak Korean?

109
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,620
To become an ambassador of the emperor,

110
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,060
you have to be at least this good.

111
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,140
You should have been aware that I was coming.

112
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,450
Why did you leave the palace?

113
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:40,180
Disrespect to the emperor's envoy

114
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:46,000
is the same as looking down on the emperor. You should know that.

115
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,140
You could think of it that way, ambassador.

116
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,190
You there! Bring it in.

117
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,450
This is the skin of a tiger, is it not?

118
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,020
I went to catch a beast as a welcoming present for you.

119
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,570
I was late because I caught a tiger.

120
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,840
It's the best I've hunted recently, so please offer it to the  emperor.

121
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,310
But...

122
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,200
the tail?

123
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,690
You saw?

124
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:50,720
I only found out he had no tail after I caught him.

125
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,640
Isn't it surprising? A tiger missing a tail.

126
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,630
It's a precious item that's difficult to find.

127
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,740
Please report this as such to the emperor.

128
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,650
Yes.

129
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,240
The emperor heard that you disposed of a loyal subject like Sin Chi Soo.

130
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,590
The emperor heard that you disposed of a loyal subject like Sin Chi Soo.

131
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,720
He was quite surprised.

132
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,570
As there is filial piety between the superior nation  (Ming)  and the uncivilized nation  (Joseon) ,

133
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,620
there is also loyalty that needs to be kept between those who act loyally.

134
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,590
It is right to bring him back to the court.

135
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,150
Those are his words for you.

136
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,160
That is right.

137
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,710
I heard that he welcomed you in my absence.

138
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,960
I will give him a government post again.

139
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,700
This immense grace from His Majesty the Emperor and Your Majesty the King,

140
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,720
I shall not forget it.

141
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,970
You did well.

142
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,910
Were you hit by the arrow here?

143
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:09,390
I thought you weren't going to make it.

144
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:13,710
Didn't I promise to return?

145
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,170
If Eunuch Jo hadn't let me know in advance,

146
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,540
when the ambassador told me to bring Sin Chi Soo back into court,

147
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,710
I wouldn't have held back my anger and would've caused chaos.

148
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,560
It was good you held back.

149
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,240
Since the ambassador arrived a day early,

150
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,560
it's very likely that everything, including bringing in Sin Chi Soo,

151
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:54,200
were all part of Sin Chi Soo's scheme to come back into the court.

152
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,590
To even use the Ming envoy...

153
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:01,030
it becomes harder and harder to forgive Sin Chi Soo.

154
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,980
Did you find Ha Seon and the queen's attackers?

155
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,390
I apologize.

156
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:13,000
We chased them but failed to catch them in the end.

157
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,610
To go after them...

158
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,430
Who exactly are these impertinent men?

159
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,270
I don't know who executed the plan,

160
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,560
but I might have an idea who the mastermind is.

161
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,000
Who is that?

162
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,800
The only person who knew you left the palace.

163
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,100
It's the person who came into the grand palace

164
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,310
demanding the royal seal and military badge.

165
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:41,530
You can't mean... the queen dowager?

166
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:52,990
How could you not even do something so simple?!

167
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:59,070
"The king would have followed the queen to his father-in-law's exile house."

168
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,980
"So chase after him and stab him to death."

169
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:07,080
I told you where and even how to do it.

170
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,220
So answer me! Can I really trust you

171
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,650
and continue to work with you?

172
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,140
Is there any other way?

173
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:22,570
Besides me, who else would take up your will to protect this nation and its traditions?

174
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,460
If you had put your words into actions,

175
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,810
you would've already been seated on the throne and then some!

176
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,980
Queen Dowager, Prince Yeong Hwa is here.

177
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,240
Let him in.

178
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,250
You may leave.

179
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,410
Welcome, Prince Yeong Hwa.

180
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:06,330
I was happy when you said you would be returning to the palace because I thought you meant your palace.

181
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,020
Why are you staying in this ruined Youngchun Pagoda? People say there are ghosts here.

182
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,130
I will finish the tea rites and return to my palace.

183
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,370
So just bear it for three days.

184
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:23,450
Who are the rites for?

185
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,000
Someone you don't know.

186
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,150
Your Highness...

187
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,620
Over there...

188
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:25,200
Your Highness, for your grace in returning safely,

189
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,630
I don't know how I can repay you.

190
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:32,240
Grace is not the correct word.

191
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,810
I ran away to avoid my sins,

192
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:40,700
but I only returned to face them in their entirety.

193
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,790
Now the duty that's left for me

194
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,440
is solely to protect him.

195
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,270
If it is to protect him,

196
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:57,480
I will do whatever it takes.

197
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:04,950
I've heard something similar before.

198
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:13,370
Upon returning after a near-death experience, the one who is in the grand palace said the same thing to me.

199
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:18,740
That he wanted to have power in order to protect what's precious.

200
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,870
I will swear as well.

201
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:29,490
I will protect you, His Majesty, and this nation with my life on the line.

202
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:49,090
I will never forget your grace, and I will repay it until my death.

203
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:53,550
The only reason I put you back in the court

204
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:59,410
was to get the 10,000 Joseon soldiers for the emperor.

205
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,750
Don't forget that.

206
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:05,240
Of course. Please do not worry.

207
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,880
Now.

208
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,230
You should still be resting.

209
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,430
Why did you come all the way here?

210
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:11,540
For me to be the only one lying in a warm chamber, I came because of an apologetic and worried mind.

211
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,690
Please give me your hand.

212
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,350
 Please give me your hand.

213
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,980
Do you remember?

214
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,760
If you bite on the hazelnut and make a wish,

215
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,650
the goblin that protects your home will appear and make that dream come true.

216
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,380
When you're bored, bite them one by one, and make a wish.

217
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,580
Who knows, maybe a goblin lives here.

218
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,400
How much longer will you be formal with me?

219
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,720
What?

220
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,720
Since we have returned, please speak informally like you used to.

221
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,610
It is more comfortable to me and safer for you.

222
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,210
How could I dare...

223
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:31,640
Then I will do as you wish.

224
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,110
When are you going to return to your palace?

225
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,560
Please give me three days.

226
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,600
Three days?

227
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,380
I understand.

228
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,550
So Woon.

229
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:16,550
My name is Yoo So Woon.

230
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,460
So Woon.

231
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,260
Yoo So Woon.

232
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,570
It is a beautiful name.

233
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,830
Please tell me yours.

234
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,870
I'm Ha Seon.

235
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,830
Ha Seon?

236
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:44,220
It is a warm name.

237
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,160
The Ming are demanding an army? What do you mean?

238
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:09,730
Over the last few years, Ming and Later Jin's relationship has been worsening.

239
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:14,360
It will be difficult for the Ming to defeat Later Jin with just their army.

240
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,280
So they will be telling us to send our military as well.

241
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,090
And if we say no?

242
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:24,140
Before they engage in a war with Later Jin, they will probably attack us first.

243
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:29,850
But if we give our troops to the Ming, Later Jin won't just sit idly either.

244
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:33,340
They are already infiltrating our borders to threaten us.

245
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:37,570
So in the end, we will see blood no matter which side we take.

246
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:42,410
There may be another war on this land again.

247
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:46,090
It's fine if they want to fight with each other but why pull us in?

248
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:49,700
Is there no way to avoid a war?

249
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,900
Have you ever walked on a tightrope before?

250
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,660
Since I'm a clown, of course I've done it.

251
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,790
But what about the tightrope?

252
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:03,280
From now on, you and I are about to walk on a tightrope.

253
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,400
Are you ready?

254
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,050

255
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,340
Congratulations on becoming a level-one minister.

256
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,680
You've gone through a lot.

257
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:42,270
Thank you. This is all thanks to His Majesty's grace.

258
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:59,660
In the end, he's even brought his son, Sin Yi Gyeom?

259
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,770
You would think he's been reinstated as left state minister.

260
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,540
There's nothing we can do.

261
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:11,710
His Majesty can't ignore the Ming emperor's request.

262
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:45,670
Your Majesty, the barbarians have abandoned their allegiance to the superior nation (Ming) and have launched a full-scale offense.

263
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:50,200
So to fulfill our duty as the subjugation nation,

264
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:56,210
we must not think it's a waste if we give them not 10, but 20 or 30,000 soldiers.

265
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:10,770
Your Majesty, it is proper to decide on giving military support after careful discussion in the court.

266
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,820
Chief Royal Secretary is right.

267
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:17,690
The superior nation's matters are urgent but we were struck with a drought and a cold wave this year,

268
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,920
and so it is difficult to gather enough grain for the army.

269
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,620
We should ask the superior nation for their understanding.

270
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,910
What ill-fitting words!

271
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:29,890
Your Majesty, during the last rebellion, the Ming gave us an army.

272
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:33,340
The rebellion was suppressed. You cannot forget that.

273
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,720
If we show any sign of reluctance,

274
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,990
we will be deemed as defying our duty to them as their subjugated nation.

275
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:44,380
May you,  may you, please understand.

276
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,850
May you understand.

277
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:53,650
I cannot do so.

278
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,660
Your Majesty.

279
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:02,060
Your Majesty, why are you trying to be a son who knows no grace?

280
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,160
If our nation and Ming nation are son and father,

281
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,870
then I am the father of my people.

282
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:10,960
As their father, knowing full well they will die,

283
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,850
how can I send my children into the flames?

284
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:20,900
Even if I become a criminal to the Ming emperor, I cannot become a criminal to my people.

285
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:26,720
Those are horrendous words that cut away our duty and loyalty.

286
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,820
How will you handle the opposition from the nobles and Confucian scholars?

287
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,510
How can you spew such unfavorable and heartless words so lightly?

288
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:38,070
Are you so tormented that you cannot offer your full allegiance to the Ming?

289
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:44,340
Then I shall approve for you to personally march off to war with the nobles and the scholars!

290
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,490
How are you all standing quietly?

291
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:00,790
I said I will approve, so are you going or not?

292
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:05,570
Your Majesty, you are saying such unreasonable words. We only—

293
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,560
Shut up!

294
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,630
Which country do you belong to, ministers?

295
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,740
You value your own bloodline,

296
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,680
but you don't know how to cherish the people!

297
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,040
Shame on you!

298
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,830
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

299
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,150
- Your Majesty!
 - Your Majesty!

300
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:32,230
How can you dare to defy the superior nation's order? You cannot.

301
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:36,690
Your Majesty, how will you handle the emperor's reproach?

302
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,950
May you please reconsider.

303
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:42,960
May you reconsider.

304
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:49,210
 Taepyeonggwan (Hall of Great Peace)

305
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,620
What are you dawdling about? Hurry up!

306
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,390
Yes, sir.

307
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:00,490
I came to give my greetings, Ambassador.

308
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:04,520
I don't think you're here to beg me to kill you.

309
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,190
What brings you here then?

310
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:11,060
I came to deliver His Majesty's orders.

311
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:18,250
If it's nonsense, I will slay you and take your head to the emperor.

312
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:22,420
First, please hear His Majesty's message before you slay me.

313
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:29,970
Unlike the Ming Nation, Joseon does not train soldiers and farmers separately.

314
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:34,660
If we are to send soldiers to you, we would have to draft them into the army and train them.

315
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:37,170
And there is not enough time for that.

316
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:42,450
Moreover, due to drought and the cold wave this year, we were not able to collect many taxes.

317
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:47,590
Hence, that is why His Majesty cannot send soldiers.

318
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:52,560
If you will give us time, we will draft soldiers and train them.

319
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,000
His Majesty also thinks we will be able to secure grain for the military.

320
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,390
What would you like to do?

321
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,780
How much time do you need?

322
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,220
We will need at least two years.

323
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,860
One year.

324
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,890
I will grant you one year.

325
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,400
Alright. I will inform His Majesty.

326
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,200
What is this?

327
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,730
It's a secret letter to be sent to Later Jin's emperor.

328
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:40,250
We will not give the Ming an army. And even if a war breaks out,

329
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:44,120
we will not attack Later Jin. That's what's written.

330
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:49,940
If we send this secret letter, we can stop the Later Jin from attacking for the meantime.

331
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,680
If you, Ha Seon, feel the same way I do,

332
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,300
please stamp this with the royal seal.

333
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:02,480
I don't know if I am really allowed to stamp it.

334
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,210
If not you, then who else can wield the royal seal?

335
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:17,000

336
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:31,970
 Official imperial letter with a personal message from faux King Yi Heon to Nurhaci, the Jurchen Chieftain of Later Jin: 
To notify...

337
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:36,340
 Emperor that Joseon is forced by the Ming to deploy 10,000 soldiers against Later Jin, but he will block and delay it. (Historically, this is known as The Liaodong Campaign)

338
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,180
It's His Majesty's secret letter. I put my trust in you.

339
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,110
Please leave it to me.

340
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:08,070
Why did you ask me to come here? What if somebody sees?

341
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:13,320
I invited you here because there's someone who wishes to meet you quietly.

342
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,590
What is this about?

343
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:45,730
This is something Prince Jin Pyeong prepared for you.

344
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:58,390
I heard that your heart to serve the Ming is different from the others. You were right.

345
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:02,120
I am nothing compared to His Majesty.

346
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,640
Chief Royal Secretary asked for a year.

347
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,920
I was very upset.

348
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:13,540
After seeing you two, I now feel at ease.

349
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,950
Please tell the emperor

350
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:21,620
that there is a great subject in Joseon, who will serve the Ming properly.

351
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,920
Do not worry.

352
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:30,620
Instead, within half a year, you will have to give us 20,000 soldiers.

353
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:35,300
If I can ascend to the throne,

354
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,090
there is nothing that I cannot give you.

355
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:55,090
 Sujeong Palace

356
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:13,870
Your Majesty.

357
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:18,670
Queen Dowager, we have come to give our greetings since the queen has returned to the palace.

358
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,890
Queen Dowager, have you been well?

359
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,770
Do you not have shame, Your Highness?

360
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:37,750
If you left the palace like that, it is only right for you to kill yourself to rid yourself of your shame.

361
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,870
But you return to the palace like some cat burglar?

362
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:44,280
Please do not insult the queen. I gave her permission for everything.

363
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,580
Isn't that the problem?

364
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:51,770
Because you are soft, she dares to humiliate the position of mother of the palace.

365
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:56,200
That's why I cannot ignore the queen's actions anymore.

366
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,750
Queen, if you have shame as a person,

367
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:04,420
before the court takes your title away and orders you to take poison,

368
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,490
you should step down on your own.

369
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:11,740
I apologize, but I cannot.

370
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,050
What?

371
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:18,900
In the end, you're going to live shamefully and cause trouble to His Majesty and the royal family?

372
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:24,470
All this time, I didn't doubt your loyalty in the least but looking at it now, all of it

373
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:30,220
appears to be a wicked plan to save your traitor of a father and to preserve your position.

374
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,210
Please stop.

375
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:38,110
If you continue bothering the queen like this, I will not stand for it.

376
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:40,030
And what will you do?

377
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:43,870
Are you planning to chase me out again?

378
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:50,000
I know very well that you do not think of me as a mother and that you are not afraid of lacking filial piety.

379
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,230
If you want to chase me out of the palace, try as you please.

380
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,450
Let's see who'll be ruined, me or Your Majesty.

381
00:44:55,450 --> 00:45:00,530
Even if you ordering Chief Royal Secretary to bring you the royal seal and military badge in my absence,

382
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:03,590
becomes known to the court and to the people?

383
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:11,250
About that... You were away from the palace so I was forced to make such a command.

384
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,170
You probably want to make such an excuse.

385
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:18,160
However, if they find out that I was attacked by an assassin while outside the palace,

386
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,290
who will believe you?

387
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:27,360
Do not insult the queen further.

388
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,810
If you do so again, even if you are the queen dowager,

389
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:33,510
I will not forgive you.

390
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:48,470
Then, I'll take it that you allowed the queen to return to her palace, and we will leave now.

391
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,810
Your Highness.

392
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:22,060
 Letter from an observer to Haksun, the pen name of Chief Royal Secretary, to notify him of the success of the new tax code.

393
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:27,250
To think that the enforcement of the Dae Dong policy is approaching so quickly,

394
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,550
you did amazing work.

395
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,950
Thank you for your recognition.

396
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:40,590
Although Chief Royal Secretary may not agree,

397
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,000
I think I did amazingly as well.

398
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:55,250
I can do so much more, so please look forward to it.

399
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,670
Alright. You may leave now.

400
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:02,570
Already?!

401
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:07,150
If there is anything else you're curious about, you are welcome to ask anytime.

402
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,220
Didn't he tell you to leave?

403
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,750
I just want to explain a bit...

404
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:26,100
Your Majesty... Your Majesty...

405
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:28,530
Your Majesty...

406
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:41,120
Before we enforce the Dae Dong policy, it would be nice to know what the people think of it

407
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,740
since it has failed before.

408
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:47,250
Then, would you like to go on a royal tour?

409
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,860
A royal tour?

410
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:53,730
You can go out to the streets and listen to the people's opinions regarding the enforcement of the Dae Dong policy.

411
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:56,540
If you comfort the people's negative feelings,

412
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:00,380
it will help you as well. Do you want to try?

413
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,930
Yes, let's do it.

414
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,990
Where are Dal Rae and Gap Soo?

415
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:12,510
You want to see them.

416
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,920
Although I truly want to see them,

417
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:19,760
I probably cannot see them anymore.

418
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:23,560
Did you think that?

419
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:29,060
For the people who follow and the things I have to handle on the throne,

420
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,580
for Dal Rae and Gap Soo,

421
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:37,640
the precious connections I have protected until now,

422
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,230
I realized that the time will come for me to cut them away.

423
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,110
That way, Dal Rae will also be safe.

424
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,470
Please send Dal Rae and Gap Soo to a safe place as fast as possible.

425
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:56,960
That way, it will be easier for me to cut them away.

426
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,640
I understand. I will do that.

427
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:35,070
Please send this to my sister Dal Rae.

428
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:40,890
Okay. I will make sure to send it.

429
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,280
Again... eight... three... thirty-six...

430
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:54,950
My Lord.

431
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:01,670
My Lord. My Lord!

432
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:10,760
So I am a lord, right?

433
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:16,360
How can I be of service, Officer Jang?

434
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,040
Chief Royal Secretary wanted me to tell you.

435
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:23,210
He said he will come to take the people staying at your house tomorrow, so you should prepare them.

436
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:24,940
Tomorrow night?

437
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,350
So quickly?

438
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:40,750
I thought I told you I would not be eating late night snacks for the time being.

439
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:44,280
These are dried persimmons that were a gift from San Cheong County.

440
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:48,150
I just couldn't give these up...

441
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:56,050
These taste that good?

442
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:11,410
- Eunuch Jo. 
- Yes.

443
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:13,680
Send all of them to the queen's palace.

444
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,540
Such deliciousness needs to be shared.

445
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,130
What?

446
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,980
Alright.

447
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,650
And this is yours.

448
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:39,350
What?

449
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:46,900
Your Majesty.

450
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:56,250

451
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,880
Your Highness, the king has sent a late night snack.

452
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,310
Dried persimmons.

453
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:15,030
And...

454
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,940
this letter was sent along with it.

455
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:38,390
 I plan to leave the palace to see the people.

456
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:40,770
  Will you come with me?

457
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:54,610
Let's eat breakfast.

458
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:57,260
I specially cooked mackerel today.

459
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,230
I see you were packing.

460
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,840
But I thought you guys came empty-handed when you came to my house.

461
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,370
How did you get so much stuff?

462
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:13,670
What? We don't have anything like that.

463
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:14,920
Got a lot...

464
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,910
Isn't that my shirt?

465
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:18,940
It's not.

466
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,460
What is this?

467
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,320
No!

468
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:33,750
Isn't... this a poster?

469
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,760
No... that...

470
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,110
This...

471
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,780
You should have told me.

472
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:51,540
I guess you guys like the king as much as I do.

473
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:54,970
What are you talking about?

474
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:59,680
The face on this poster is really the king's face?

475
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,570
You mean you didn't know that and kept the poster?

476
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:15,010
Ah, right! I heard the king is making a visit out of the palace to see the people.

477
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:17,610
I wonder where he's going.

478
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:22,980
The people personally get to see this handsome face. What an honor!

479
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:26,140
The world has changed a lot, don't you think?

480
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:36,880
Then, I'll be home from work before you leave, so wait for me.

481
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,420
I'll prepare a big dinner for you since it's the last.

482
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:46,250
Then have a safe trip.

483
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:56,160
Ahjae.

484
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,010
Still, we can't leave here.

485
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:02,830
He said that the king and my brother have the same face.

486
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:05,250
We need to leave the capital tonight.

487
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:08,620
- But I must see him with my own eyes before we leave.
- What?

488
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:11,850
If you are afraid, you stay home.

489
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,590
Dal Rae! Dal Rae!

490
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:34,850
My Lord, so Ha Seon is not coming to see Dal Rae?

491
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:36,550
That's what happened.

492
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:41,160
Please tell Dal Rae for him.

493
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:46,150
Dal Rae will be very disappointed.

494
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:50,970
Okay, I'll do that.

495
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:59,600
 Injeong Gate

496
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:06,900
Your Majesty, where would you like to go?

497
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,970
Somewhere they will never expect a king to show up.

498
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,700
Stop.

499
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:31,610
Your Majesty is here!

500
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,700
They say the king is coming!

501
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,000
Where?

502
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,320
There he is.

503
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,600
Your Majesty.

504
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,280
Stand up.

505
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,400
Your Majesty.

506
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,400
Stand up.

507
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,860
The king is so handsome!

508
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:53,030
Stand. Stand up.

509
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:54,800
Everyone, stand up.

510
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,320
A rice soup for me too, Auntie, please.

511
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,840
Yes, of course.

512
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,720
How are your lives?

513
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:13,330
With your grace, we are well fed and living fine.

514
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:15,130
Yes.

515
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:17,040
Tell me the truth.

516
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:21,020
That way, I can do something to help you.

517
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:27,490
Are you afraid that if you say something wrong, you will be dragged off and face punishment?

518
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:30,460
Do not worry, and speak freely.

519
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:33,970
Yes, then there is one thing.

520
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:35,430
Please tell me.

521
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:40,010
That is... it's so hard just being able to feed ourselves.

522
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,660
So we cultivated the abandoned rocky fields.

523
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,290
But the nearby noblemen swarmed in like the bees

524
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:48,690
and stole it saying that it was originally their land.

525
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:53,990
Please let me own the abandoned land I cultivated myself.

526
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:56,750
Those lowly bastards!

527
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:00,530
Okay, I will permit you.

528
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:04,530
Your grace is limitless!

529
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:08,410
Your grace is limitless!

530
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:14,300
I am about to enact something called the Dae Dong policy which collects taxes from landowners.

531
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,620
Do you still want to own the land?

532
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:21,480
Yes. If you are taxed based on how much you own, what could be the problem?

533
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:25,570
Collecting taxes when we have nothing is the problem!

534
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:28,820
That's right, you speak the truth!

535
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:35,620
Your Majesty, I borrowed rice during the famine.

536
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,770
But I was told to pay a 70% interest rate for it.

537
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:39,590
Seventy—

538
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:47,540
My master stole my wife!

539
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:51,750
Please resolve my wretched situation.

540
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:56,270
Your Majesty! Please listen to my story, too!

541
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:59,210
Your Majesty, me too!

542
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:01,290
Your Majesty.

543
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:04,750
Your Majesty! Hear me out, too!

544
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:07,590
Your Majesty!

545
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:08,850
Don't worry.

546
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:12,260
I will listen to each and every one of you.

547
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,990
Please line up.

548
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:16,220
Right here! Line up right here!

549
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,830
Please don't push!

550
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:47,990
How dare he? Is he insane?

551
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:57,680
Why is it so noisy?

552
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:02,740
Over here!

553
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:06,980
It's over here!

554
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,670
Everyone...

555
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:11,120
What is His Majesty doing here?

556
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:14,990
Let us go.

557
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,390
Ahjae, I think it's over there.

558
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:30,030
You can not go over there.

559
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:55,020
You are so stubborn.

560
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:57,490
What's wrong?

561
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,960
Did you see a ghost? Why—

562
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,810
Dal Rae.

563
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,030
Is that bastard, that bastard?

564
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,620
Excuse me. She can stay here for a bit, right?

565
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:45,130
Yes, go ahead.

566
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:49,260
I will be right back. Stay here.

567
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:00,350
Sorry. I'll come next time.

568
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,100
Where did she go?

569
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:09,470
She was right here.

570
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:22,450
So that clown's sister Dal Rae was really holding this?

571
01:03:22,450 --> 01:03:24,910
Yes, it's true.

572
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:35,220
It looks like I'll be able to reveal Chief Royal Secretary's treasonous intent.

573
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:40,080
That child Dal Rae must be quite startled. Keep her pacified.

574
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,880
Yes. I shall do so.

575
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,540
What about Yi Gyeom? Is he gravely injured?

576
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:51,210
No, he was just very startled and his arm is a bit injured.

577
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:54,630
That will do then.

578
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:57,030
I'll go see Minister of Justice right away so prepare.

579
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:59,080
Yes, Your Excellency.

580
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:16,840
Your Majesty.

581
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,450
I apologize, but I have something urgent to report.

582
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:20,580
What is it?

583
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:25,190
In the capital, an incident that broke moral codes occurred.

584
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:28,270
I am requesting an interrogation by the three ministries. May you approve.

585
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:30,740
Interrogation by the three ministries?

586
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:35,520
You need to report the details of the matter in order to get approval.

587
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:40,140
This morning during Your Majesty's royal tour,

588
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:45,000
first-level Minister Sin Chi Soo's son, Sin Yi Gyeom, was attacked on the streets.

589
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,300
Sin Yi Gyeom was? Just how did that happen?

590
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:53,310
That's... a lowly clown by the name of Gap Soo.

591
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:56,260
He attacked him out of the blue.

592
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:09,220
I must meet Gap Soo.

593
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:10,880
You cannot.

594
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,960
Sin Chi Soo was looking for you recently.

595
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,070
So it's most likely a trap he set up.

596
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:19,710
That's why I must go. Since Dal Rae and Gap Soo are in danger.

597
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:25,350
Control yourself. If you go, they might be in more danger.

598
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:30,580
Then what am I supposed to do?

599
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:37,980
Trust me and wait. I will go find out and return.

600
01:05:58,050 --> 01:06:04,450
That's what I'm saying! A man called Gap Soo and a child named Dal Rae were arrested and brought here!

601
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:07,280
I already told you many times they are not here.

602
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:14,670
Hyungnim, are you also here upon hearing news of Dal Rae and Gap Soo?

603
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:17,760
At any rate, it's good that you're here. Ask this detainment officer.

604
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,180
Ask him where Dal Rae is.

605
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:22,500
Do you know them, My Lord?

606
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:25,700
You should've said that sooner then.

607
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:28,280
I came to meet the offender of the moral code, by His Majesty's order.

608
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:32,160
Was it only the one called Gap Soo who was arrested? Was there no girl by the name of Dal Rae?

609
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,720
Yes, it was just him from the beginning.

610
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,950
There was no girl named Dal Rae.

611
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:43,620
I understand. I'll summon you later so go see to your work now.

612
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,560
Hyungnim, he's lying.

613
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:52,220
Dal Rae is probably arrested here as well.

614
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:54,060
How are you so sure?

615
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:55,550
Dal Rae, that child...

616
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:59,760
She was holding a dagger with a dragon pattern that only the king can have.

617
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,070
A lowly artisan was holding such a precious royal item.

618
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:06,160
So I thought she would be imprisoned by the authorities and ran here.

619
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:23,280
Hyungnim, what exactly is that dagger for you to be like this?

620
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,200
That's a royal item

621
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:29,220
that His Majesty received from the late king when he became the crown prince during the last rebellion.

622
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:30,730
What?

623
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:35,630
Such a precious item and why did Dal Rae have it?

624
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:39,030
Hyungnim. Hyungnim!

625
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:47,250
Please ask His Majesty for an audience.

626
01:07:56,490 --> 01:08:01,200
Your Majesty, Sin Chi Soo says it's regarding the clown Gap Soo,

627
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:04,290
that he has something urgent to report to you.

628
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,050
Let him in.

629
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:10,810
I don't have a good feeling about this.

630
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:14,480
How about you just send him away?

631
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:20,170
No. It's about Gap Soo, so I must hear it.

632
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:51,950
Your Majesty, I came to report something urgent to you.

633
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:54,660
May you clear the room, please.

634
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:29,360
I heard the news.

635
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:33,470
Your son, Sin Yi Gyeom suffered an attack on the streets.

636
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:34,720
Was he badly hurt?

637
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:39,820
More so than his physical injury, the fact that the moral codes were broken,

638
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:42,850
isn't that the greater issue?

639
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,520
You said you had something urgent to report.

640
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:54,040
I have something to show Your Majesty so I brought it.

641
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,040
Please open it.

642
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:28,400
Do you remember what that is?

643
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,020
How do you have this?

644
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:41,980
Actually, the girl who was with the clown that attacked my son,

645
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:45,810
that girl named Dal Rae had it.

646
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:53,730
That dagger was a gift to you, by the Ming emperor.

647
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:57,530
I couldn't believe that lowly clown would have it,

648
01:10:57,530 --> 01:11:00,810
so I came to show it to Your Majesty.

649
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:04,060
You always kept this with you.

650
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:08,840
That dagger. Is it right? Please verify it.

651
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,720
I remember this now.

652
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:29,770
I had it when I went out for the procession earlier.

653
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:31,820
It appears I dropped it then.

654
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,710
Your Majesty.

655
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:37,230
Are you certain?

656
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:40,430
I am. I am certain.

657
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:50,190
That dagger... is the one the late king presented to you when you became the Crown Prince during the last rebellion.

658
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:52,960
To entrust you with the court,

659
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,000
he gave it to you as a symbol.

660
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:14,490
You scum!

661
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:18,730
Reveal your identity.

662
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:22,490
That girl named Dal Rae.

663
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:25,400
She's in my hands right now.

664
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:30,990
Speak truthfully.

665
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:33,420
Who are you?

666
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,860
Alright.

667
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:01,490
I'm that two-nyang, the price of a dog back then!

668
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,600
 The Crowned Clown

669
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:37,550

670
01:14:46,130 --> 01:14:48,060
 Preview

671
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:50,720
 In order to handle this position,

672
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:54,520
 I know very well I need to overcome such pain as this.

673
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,290
 How come you couldn't hold it in until the end?

674
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:57,770
 But you said so to me as well.

675
01:14:57,770 --> 01:15:00,070
 That there are only two ways to survive in a place like this.

676
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:01,360
 Kneel.

677
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:05,470
 I will tell you how you can save your sister.

678
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:08,160
 So you will hold out until the end?

679
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:11,270
 Right this very moment, summon Chief Royal Secretary as a criminal.

680
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:14,630
 I will put your sister as a witness.

681
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:17,320
 There is only one method left for me now.

682
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:21,890
♫  I can understand everything  ♫
