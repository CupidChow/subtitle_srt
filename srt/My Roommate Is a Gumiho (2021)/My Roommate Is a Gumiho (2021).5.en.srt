He gave it to me.

162
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,920
No, he didn't give it to you.
He threw it away to you.

163
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,590
Anyway, I'm fine.

164
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,580
Are you sure you aren't just jealous

165
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,780
that I'm a car owner now?

166
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,340
I'd love to give you a good kick.

167
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,360
Goodness, she's totally jealous. Goodness.

168
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,260
Take me to Silla Hotel.

169
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,160
Did I tell you that
I live in the suite room there?

170
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,140
You don't need to. Get off.

171
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,690
Why? Aren't you here for me?

172
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,630
You know I'm not.

173
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,840
I can't believe Shin Woo-yeo the great
came to pick her up.

174
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,910
Dam seems even more amazing now.

175
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,340
But how disappointing.

176
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,760
I gave you that advice
from the bottom of my heart.

177
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,460
We never had a happy ending
whenever we started having feelings.

178
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,840
I told you not to let those petty feelings
ruin your life's work.

179
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,210
Did you decide to ignore that?

180
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,230
There's no need for me to ignore anything.

181
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,530
I never had
any feelings for her to begin with.

182
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,360
Are you sure she's not different

183
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,910
isn't any different
from all the other boring people you met?

184
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,590
Of course.

185
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,830
That's why I'm not going to get conscious.

186
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,600
If I distance myself from her
for no reason,

187
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,630
it'll seem more peculiar.

188
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,530
You seem more suspicious
with those long excuses.

189
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,640
Stop talking nonsense and get off.

190
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,520
Why? Let's just tell her
that we're acquainted.

191
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,500
Let's say we met somewhere else,

192
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,210
you know, while clubbing or something.

193
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,630
-Stop joking with me.
-I'm not joking.

194
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,610
Drop me off at the hotel.

195
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,740
It's much bigger than I thought.

196
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,820
I've never been in a car like this before.

197
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,330
You'll give me a ride, right?

198
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,980
It's not a big deal for you to drop me off
in our relationship.

199
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,130
In our relationship?

200
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,310
Well, I guess we're partners,

201
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,650
so yes, I can give you a ride home.

202
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,230
Hop in, Hye-sun.

203
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,810
No, I...

204
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,490
Woo-yeo, you punk.
How dare you use your magic on me?

205
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,040
So why did you
suddenly offer to pick me up?

206
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,250
Well, I was passing by,

207
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,570
and

208
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,720
it seemed like
you've been avoiding me since yesterday.

209
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,110
I thought we talked it out
and decided to go back

210
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,350
to how things were before.

211
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,540
Actually,

212
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,450
I was in slight confusion
over something personal.

213
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,310
A confusion?

214
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,210
It's not a big deal.

215
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,680
That's already taken care of,
so you don't have to mind it.

216
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,580
I really love Han River.

217
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,480
Why do you love it?

218
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,450
If you eat something by the river,
everything becomes twice as delicious.

219
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,920
Especially so with ramyeon you make
at a convenience store.

220
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,630
My gosh, really.

221
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,410
While we're on the subject,
do you want to stop by the river?

222
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,010
-You haven't eaten yet, right?
-I was at a tteokbokki place...

223
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,380
but I didn't eat anything.

224
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,010
Let's go to the river.

225
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,950
This isn't my car. It's my brother's.

226
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,110
I didn't ask.

227
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,310
Anyway, you.
Do I make you feel that uncomfortable?

228
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,560
-What?
-You can't talk to me or look at me.

229
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,960
What's up with that?

230
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,650
You seem to get along with Dam all right.

231
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,900
Dam and I are besties, that's why.

232
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,360
Really?

233
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,520
What's she like?

234
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,690
She's a great kid. You know
how people say, "Like attracts like"?

235
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,240
-I don't.
-What?

236
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,400
She's close to me for a reason.
I feel comfortable and pleasant with her.

237
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,630
That means you feel uncomfortable
and unpleasant around me.

238
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,530
What? No, that's not what I meant.

239
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,650
I don't want you to misunderstand this,
so I'll be frank with you.

240
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,220
This is a very heartbreaking story
only Dam and I know.

241
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,859
I actually have a goddess trauma.

242
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,650
-A goddess trauma?
-Yes.

243
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,040
In high school, I dated this older girl
who looked like a goddess,

244
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,710
but she turned out to be a bully.

245
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,010
She asked for 50,000 won
to save up for our dates,

246
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,730
but we never went out once.

247
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,119
I realized she had been ripping me off
after three months.

248
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,540
After I realized that,
I tried to break up with her,

249
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,520
but she tried to burn me with cigarettes.

250
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,920
So I always remind you of cigarette burns?

251
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,900
Yes.

252
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,800
No, that's not what I meant.

253
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,680
It means you're like a goddess.

254
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,270
It's a compliment.

255
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,180
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

256
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,250
Anyway, I'll do my best
to be more comfortable.

257
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,150
I became partners with a goddess like you,

258
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,450
so I just need to overcome my trauma
and march forward...

259
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,960
I don't think we can march forward now.

260
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,210
You're right. What's wrong with this car?

261
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,330
It's good.

262
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,970
[Jae-jin]

263
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,670
[Dam, you must be spending
some quality time with someone special,]

264
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:59,870
[Jae-jin]

265
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,210
[so I'm sorry for messaging you.]

266
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,510
[But I wanted to tell you
my last goodbye.]

267
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,320
[Dam]

268
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,080
[What are you suddenly talking about?]

269
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,670
[I was dropping Hye-sun off,
then the car went bust.]

270
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,520
[So my car is getting towed.]

271
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,600
[Hye-sun's face is
as pale as a Goryeo celadon,]

272
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,020
[and I probably need
to take some time off from school.]

273
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,830
Goodness, what a foolish kid.

274
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,030
It's Jae-jin.

275
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,010
He feels sorry for Hye-sun
about something he did,

276
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,430
so he wants to take a leave
instead of facing her.

277
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,150
He could just stay calm and deal with it.

278
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,790
He gets very nervous around pretty girls.

279
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,360
Right, you've seen Hye-sun
at the movie theater, right?

280
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,390
The guys in my department are
all crazy about how pretty she is.

281
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,030
Does she look pretty to you too?

282
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,620
Not at all. You're much prettier.

283
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,920
I am?

284
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,880
I'd say I'm a cute type,
but not pretty like her.

285
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,210
-You must be kidding.
-I mean it.

286
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,990
I'm more serious than ever right now.

287
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,250
Well, really?

288
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,810
I don't think so.

289
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,760
[Jae-jin]

290
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,250
[Why won't you respond?]

291
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,400
Sir.

292
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,300
Why don't you use a texting app?

293
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,520
I never felt the need to use it.

294
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,540
I think you should.

295
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,620
I caught your text message much later

296
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:51,050
because most people use the texting app,
so I never check my texts.

297
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,970
But I guess I can
just remember to check text messages.

298
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,330
-That sounds all right.
-Sorry?

299
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,720
It sounds like a good idea to learn to use
technology in line with this age.

300
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,660
How do you use this texting app?

301
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,360
It's... Let me show you.

302
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,310
All done. Take this.

303
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,560
-Right, your profile photo.
-Profile photo?

304
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,860
A picture for your profile.

305
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,140
I don't have any photos.

306
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,730
You don't have any photos?

307
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:30,870
[Choose from Album]

308
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,240
[No photos or videos.]

309
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,270
Sir, how can you not have any photos?

310
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,750
I never felt the need to take any.

311
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,340
Then when was the last time
you took a photo?

312
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:45,740
Back during Jungjong's reign in Joseon,
I once left behind a portrait.

313
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,720
A portrait?

314
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,850
This isn't good.

315
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,780
Sir, let me take some photos for you.

316
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,900
I'll take the best photos of your life,

317
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,260
so stand over there.

318
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,520
Come on.

319
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,940
Can you smile a little?

320
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,640
No, like this.

321
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,340
A little more.

322
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,410
[Are you sure she's not any different
from all of the other dull relationships?]

323
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,570
[Yes.]

324
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,770
[This doesn't mean anything.]

325
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,420
[Just as it always had been,]

326
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:51,170
[this is another careless relationship
who'll stay with me for a short while.]

327
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,140
You should check.

328
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,510
I'll take one for you too, Miss Dam.

329
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,660
[This isn't special.]

330
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,880
Do I look okay? Let me see.

331
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:45,110
I look much better than I do in person.

332
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,550
Shall we go home?

333
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,260
The sunset.

334
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,860
It's because of the sunset.

335
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,840
Who was she with?

336
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,650
What type of man does Dam like?

337
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,350
Well, she seems to like
good-looking guys too,

338
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,240
but personality seems to matter the most.

339
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,310
In short,

340
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,040
a nice type.

341
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,420
Seon-woo!

342
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,170
Seon-woo, could you give me
just 50,000 won?

343
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:57,800
I'll be a good sister
who does everything you say. Chu!

344
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,910
Do you think I'll give it to you?

345
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,860
-No.
-Then get lost.

346
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,630
You little...
You just said you'll be a good sister.

347
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,960
Only if you give me 50,000 won.

348
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,130
Hey.

349
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,950
Let me ask you something.

350
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,360
What?

351
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,060
What does a nice guy exactly mean?

352
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,060
A guy with a good personality, obviously.

353
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,270
What do I have to do
for people to say that to me?

354
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,830
In your case,

355
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,500
-you'll have to be born again.
-Why you...

356
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,440
-I'm serious.
-Does it look like I'm joking?

357
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,470
To be frank, you look like a player.

358
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,450
What?

359
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,260
-I look like a player?
-Yes.

360
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,080
Isn't life as a player your core identity?

361
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,030
Wait, player, core, awesome rhyming.

362
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,460
♫ Life as a player is your core identity ♫

363
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,520
You can't pull that on me again.

364
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,470
You won't even give me 50,000 won.
Don't call yourself my brother.

365
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,890
That little punk.

366
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,090
Yes, he needs to use it more often
to get used to it.

367
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,730
[Sir, have you eaten?]

368
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:38,250
[Miss Dam]

369
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,810
[Don't skip your meal for some coffee,
and eat delicious lunch!]

370
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,850
[Miss Dam,
I hope you enjoy your lunch too.]

371
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:45,780
[Miss Dam]

372
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:47,140
[Why do you add these shapes
at the end of your sentence?]

373
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:52,240
[Sir]

374
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,200
Gosh, I feel like I'm texting an ancestor.

375
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,800
Watch where you're going.

376
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,840
Right, yes. Thank you.

377
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,060
I'm sorry. I had nowhere else to grab.

378
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,000
You don't like it when others touch you.

379
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,000
We have to go on two more dates.

380
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,590
-When can you do it?
-Whenever is fine.

381
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,890
-Do you want to go anywhere?
-Anywhere is fine.

382
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,640
Oh, hey.

383
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,750
Yes, hello.

384
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,650
-Hi.
-Hey.

385
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,730
So you're taking a leave?
Did you file your request?

386
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,580
-I won't see you starting tomorrow.
-Right.

387
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,070
I got paid for the scrap metal
after scrapping the car.

388
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:12,850
I told Hye-sun I'll buy her a meal
with that money, so we're cool now.

389
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,630
Oh, right. That's not the problem.

390
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,090
Then what? What's the problem?

391
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,270
I saw this on my way here.

392
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,440
Seon-woo was totally coming onto Dam,

393
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:25,870
but Dam kept pushing him away
like a bouncy ball.

394
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,290
What if Seon-woo gives up on her?

395
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,800
-Told you it's not Seon-woo.
-Yes, it's him!

396
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,110
Let's ask them to grab a drink,
then we can help them get together.

397
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,890
"If you drink this,
it means you two will start dating."

398
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,570
Let's say stuff like that
and help them get together.

399
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,300
Let's not do any stuff
and stay still, okay?

400
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,550
Why should we stay still?
Let's call Seon-woo first.

401
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,960
Hey, stop that!

402
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:51,220
There's this other guy she likes.
I've seen him.

403
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,430
You've seen what?

404
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,600
He didn't seem like just an acquaintance.
Her face was...

405
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,680
I think it was the guy
she talked to me about.

406
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,960
She talked to you?

407
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,950
Yes, last week, she was worried

408
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,670
things seemed distant with this person.

409
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,480
Really?

410
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:30,770
I haven't heard anything.
Why didn't she tell me?

411
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,680
I'm sure there was a reason.

412
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,580
Anyway, we should wait until she tells us.

413
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:40,450
Don't act like you know something.
Okay? Will you?

414
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,120
Yes, I'll do that.

415
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,670
-Hey, Jae-jin. Want some?
-No.

416
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,880
-What's with this cold response?
-What about it?

417
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,830
What do you mean?
You obviously look annoyed.

418
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,640
Stop piling it up and tell me.

419
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,220
Aren't you the one
who should be telling me something?

420
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,460
What?

421
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,570
I'm a little disappointed.

422
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,940
There is nothing I haven't told you.

423
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,530
You know everything

424
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,300
about my ex-girlfriend,
the ex before that, the one before...

425
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,080
Forget it.

426
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,040
I told you everything I was too ashamed
to share with my brother.

427
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,990
But I guess you didn't feel that way.

428
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,380
Bye.

429
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,180
Hey, Jae-jin.

430
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,000
What was that?

431
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,540
-What's with him?
-What?

432
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,660
He said I didn't tell him something.
What could it be?

433
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,640
I'm... I'm not sure.

434
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,100
Is it how I diluted his soju

435
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,430
when he got trashed
after Jin-ah dumped him?

436
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,780
Or how I pulled out his hair last year

437
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,540
after I got trashed?

438
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,620
My gosh.

439
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,170
[Hey, I told you not to get so antsy.]

What can I do?]

442
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,320
Hi.

443
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,940
What was that?

444
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,620
[Lecture Hall]

445
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,300
Hey, Jae-jin.
What should we eat for lunch...

446
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,110
Hey, Jae-jin!

447
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,040
Can we talk...

"What"?

-Hello?
[-Hello, my foot.]

455
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,940
What's your problem?

456
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,790
-What is it?
-You'll pop my eardrum!

457
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,840
Just leave me alone.

458
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,690
Give me some time to be sulky.

459
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,970
Are you getting drafted?
Why do you need some time?

460

What are you disappointed about?
Tell me. Tell me now.

Are you all right, Miss Dam?

465
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,940
I'm sorry, sir. That must've been loud.

466
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,190
Is something bad going on?

467
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:23,570
Well, Jae-jin is angry at me,
but I don't know why.

468
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,380
I wanted to talk, but he avoids me.

469
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,180
He ignores my texts and hung up on me too.

470
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,970
You two looked very close.

471
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,680
That must be disconcerting.

472
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:35,540
Yes. As you know,
I have a younger brother.

473
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,750
But ever since I met him,
I felt like I had two younger brothers.

474
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,540
We were so close like real siblings.
Why is he doing this to me?

475
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:47,030
Sir, will you take a walk with me?

476
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,960
Sure.

477
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,820
Sorry?

478
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:57,450
Why don't we

479
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,490
go for some jokbal you love so much?

480
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,000
No, I don't feel like it.

481
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,949
Then how about
the archery game we played...

482
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,270
I'm good.

483
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,400
Do you want to grab a drink?

484
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,949
A drink?

485
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:28,300
Humans seem to drink alcohol
to forget their problems.

486
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:31,770
I figured you might need that now.

487
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,460
It's okay. I'm not supposed to drink.

488
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,790
If I drink, that would be
violating the contract.

489
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,650
You haven't been drinking until now,

490
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:42,460
and I'm with you today,
so I think it'll be okay.

491
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,659
But still...

492
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,159
Let's go.

493

Miss Dam, "the Analects" says

494
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,750
one must stop drinking
while one feels good.

495
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,520
I think we should set limits
before we start drinking.

496
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,890
How much alcohol can you take?

497
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,340
Seven bottles of soju.

498
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,550
Seven...

499
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,260
Why don't we order just one bottle?

500
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:21,980
Two.

501
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,260
Are you making a deal with me now?

502
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,200
Well, if we're going to drink anyway,

503
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,060
we should drink until we feel good,
just like "The Analects" says.

504
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,600
Just a half bottle of soju

505
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,760
will hardly touch my organs.

506
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,960
But you haven't been
drinking for a while, so...

507
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,230
Come on.

508
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,560
I know my liver.

509
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,860
One bottle of soju can't make it drunk.

510
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,080
Ma'am, I'd like to order two bottles
of soju and stir-fried cartilage.

511
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,220
Okay.

512
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,650
Cheers.

513
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,330
It's good to finally have some drink.

514
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,840
I thought I wouldn't be able
to drink any for one year.

515
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,510
Miss Dam.

516
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,990
You're not going to pretend to be down
whenever you want to drink, are you?

517
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,920
That's a very good tip.

518
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,950
Alcohol is the best.

519
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:53,850
Sir, do you think
I can make up with Jae-jin?

520

00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,130
Actually, whatever.

What does he want me to tell him?

523

I said I could drink
seven bottles of soju.

524

Thank you.

525

Excuse me. I'd like to order

Well, watching you fascinates me.

530
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,400
One moment you're happy,
the next you're upset.

531
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,470
One moment, you laugh,

532
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,980

Are you saying
I can't control my emotions?

534

When you live for such a long time,

539
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,430
everything feels like just a season
that will eventually pass.

540
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:14,060
And everything feels meaningless.

541

But you seem true to yourself
every moment.

542

00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:03,950
I don't know how to describe this feeling.

547
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,970
It's soft

548
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,140

549

I can't either swallow it

550

or spit it out.

551

That's how much I'm in love.

What? What happened last night?

553
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,600
Right. We drank soju in the street stall

554
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,420
and talked about many things.

555

Then he said he liked my honesty.

556
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,910

It won't take longer than ten minutes.

566

After hearing what you said last night,
I gave it a lot of thought.

567
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:28,150
Oh, that...

568
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,450
I was just carried away by the mood.

569
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,450
I wasn't serious or anything.

570
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:38,410
Still, if I had known it,
I would have been more considerate.

571
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,540
I thought about what I could do about it,

572
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,490
and I prepared something.

573

What?

574
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,120
Steamed eggs.

If I had known you liked
steamed eggs so much,

576

01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:08,450
It embarrasses me
that I was once attracted to him.

802
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:10,120
Don't you ever answer his call again.

803
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:12,150
That little ugly twerp.

804
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:14,920
I want to kick him in that stupid butt.

805
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:20,550
Is there an exam for cursing?
If there is, you'll get a perfect score.

806
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,450
Why the long face?

807
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:28,780
You haven't even touched the tripe.
It isn't like you.

808
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:33,660
Are you still upset?
Should I go give him a punch?

809
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:35,470
You know I did judo in high school.

810
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:37,890
Do you want me to throw you?

811
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:40,350
You're the one who has been upsetting Dam.

812
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,070
Stop acting like you care.

813
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:46,910
To be honest, I was upset.

814
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:49,850
I mean, the three of us haven't
really hung out together lately.

815
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:52,630
You don't drink with us anymore.
You always hurry home.

816
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:55,000
That I got upset was one thing,

817
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:57,690
but I was also worried something bad

818
01:00:58,210 --> 01:00:59,620
might have happened to you.

819
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,610
Nothing bad has happened.

820
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,170
See? You're avoiding again.

821
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:08,550
There are so many things
I want to ask you,

822
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,140
but I'll wait.

823
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,840
It's frustrating,
but I'll wait until you tell me.

824
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,510
That's what true friends do.

825
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:23,470
You're being cheesy.

826
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,030
-Just eat the kimchi.
-I was going to.

827
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,500
It looks so tasty.

828
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:33,020
Eat up.

829
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:44,720
[This feels strange.]

830
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,590
[Jae-jin and I made up,]

831
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,640
[and I'm not offended]

832
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:55,240
[because I didn't expect anything
from Seon-woo anyway.]

833
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:01,440
[Just because he thinks
I'm only worth 100,000 won]

834
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:04,560
[doesn't mean
I'm actually worth that much.]

835
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,280
[That Mr. Gumiho might think of me]

836
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:13,500
[as no one but someone
who made a contract with him]

837
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,030
[or just some misfortune
that happened to him...]

838
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,250
[That I might be no one to him]

839
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:28,940
[depresses me.]

840
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,100
[Miss Dam]

841
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:50,630
[Where are you, Miss Dam?
I'll come pick you up if it gets late.]

842
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,180
Miss Dam.

843
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,740
What are you doing here?

844
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:20,820
Sir.

845
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:24,990
I've been sitting here like this
since 10 p.m. sharp.

846
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:29,130
Technically, I didn't break the curfew.

847
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:30,580
Does that matter now?

848
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:32,780
I said, what are you doing here?

849
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,400
You said you wouldn't worry me.

850
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:58,080
I'm sorry.

851
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:00,190
I just

852
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:04,420
didn't want to go home like this.

853
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:10,890
I really wanted to have some soju,

854
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:15,730
but I didn't,
because I promised you I wouldn't.

855
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:21,890
Beef tripe goes really well with soju.

856
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:25,850
Did something happen, Miss Dam?

857
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:32,310
Sir.

858
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:38,430
You said I seemed true to myself
every moment

859
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:41,510
and you liked my honesty.

860
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:47,450
So I'll be honest.

861
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:52,860
You have met many people

862
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:56,730
and experienced many things,
so I'm sure nothing is hard for you.

863
01:04:58,270 --> 01:04:59,550
But I'm not like you.

864
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:05,310
I'm the opposite of cool.

865
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:11,030
We're supposed to be just two people
living together by contract,

866
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:14,070
but I can't keep
my private and public life separate

867
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:17,020
because I'm not as cool as you.

868
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:21,330
What I'm saying is,

869
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:28,900
no matter how you think of me,

870
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:32,020
you are

871
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:36,730
special and significant to me.

872
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,020
So special that I can give up

873
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,310
beef tripe and soju.

874
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,540
[Dishonesty cannot beat honesty.]

875
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,010
[Never.]

876
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:12,760
Me too.

877
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,630
Miss Dam, you are

878
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:23,410
special to me too.

879
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,810
[We appreciate Actress Han Ji-eun
for her guest appearance.]

880
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,020
[My Roommate is a Gumiho]

881
01:07:22,590 --> 01:07:24,700
Sir, may I go on a blind date?

882
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:25,980
[That should be fine.]

883
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:29,150
[My friends set up the blind date today
in case I change my mind.]

884
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,860
-I see.
-Give me a smile.

885
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,490
Again.

886
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:35,620
Sir, I'm in big trouble now.

887
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:36,890
Miss Dam?

888
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,260
Who are you?

889
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:40,370
[I'm Dam's mother.]

890
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:44,810
[I don't want you to give up
on what you like.]

891
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:46,620
Is anybody there?

892
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:50,530
[Is it really okay that I don't give up?]
