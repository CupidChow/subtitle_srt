What?

163
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,820
Why aren't you taking them off?

164
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,710
What?

165
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,900
I'm going out for a bit.

166
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,690
My friends set up the blind date today
in case I change my mind.

167
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,490
I see.

168
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,870
Don't be too late.

169
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,670
There are lots of awful stuff
on the news these days.

170
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,670
I don't know. If things go well,

171
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,820
I might come home late.

172
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,690
I have a feeling that he might be the one.

173
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,490
In any case, I'll get going, Uncle.

174
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,150
Hey, Dam.

175
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,200
Why is Hye-sun here?

176
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,960
Well, your date is at 7 p.m.,

177
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,820
but I called you out early
to let Hye-sun give you a lesson.

178
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,050
-A lesson?
-Yes.

179
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,910
Jae-jin asked me to give you tips
on your first blind date.

180
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,720
You didn't have to do that.

181
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,840
You almost bumped into him.

182
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,440
Thanks.

183
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,680
Where should we go?

184
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,140
[She somehow managed to hold out.]

185
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,380
[A gumiho can become a human
by taking their energy.]

186
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,960
[We pass over the Marble
to get energy from them,]

187
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,960
[then we must erase all their memories
when we take it back.]

188
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,360
[If we draw this out for too long,
their energy will be drained,]

189
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,880
[and we have no choice
but to take it from their dead body.]

190
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,590
[Woo-yeo also made one mistake,]

191
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,300
[and he kept his heart shut
for a very long time.]

192
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,980
[But he seems to have
a special place in his heart for her.]

193
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:00,610
This is sour.

194
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,690
[Is it because this was the first time
his Marble turned blue?]

195
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,010
Why would you drink this?

196
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,580
[If that's the case, her eyes are just...]

197
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,780
This is mine.

198
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,780
[He's about to hit his 1,000th year mark,
his deadline to become a human.]

199
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,800
[What's his plan?]

200
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,620
Hey, you.

201
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,360
I heard Seon-woo made a bet with you.

202
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,470
Is that true?

203
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,520
Everyone knows about this. Everyone.

204
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,270
You're the type
who gets involved with the weirdest guys.

205
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,340
Are you going on this blind date
out of spite because of him?

206
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,340
Or is it because you were
turned down by someone you like?

207
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,280
How did you know about...

208
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,600
[I will]

209
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,580
[break open your head]

210
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,120
[in half.]

211
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,490
[Getting chills]

212
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,250
So you've never gone on blind dates
or dated someone.

213
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,710
That means you probably
never kissed anyone either.

214
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,610
-In that case, you're...
-Hye-sun.

215
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,150
Let's change the subject.

216
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,570
Yes, I have to go use the restroom.

217
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,010
Where are you going?
I haven't even begun yet.

218
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,710
If I'm going to help,
I'm going to make this perfect.

219
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,900
Sit down.

220
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,320
Yes, ma'am.

221
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,970
Okay.

222
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,310
Look at me.

223
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,380
When you hit on someone,
do you know what's important?

224
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,830
It's your theme.

225
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,470
You either give him your attention
in his face,

226
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,410
or you can be just plain mean.

227
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,490
I'm not looking to hit on anyone...

228
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,670
First,

229
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,960
a smiley face is the best move

230
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,460
to express your good feelings.

231
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,830
Let's start with that. Give me a smile.

232
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,780
Well, you can't suddenly tell me to smile.

233
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,610
What is this?

234
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,250
That smile was
more mysterious than the Mona Lisa.

235
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,890
Again.

236
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,250
Are you seeing a client?

237
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,740
Forget it. You aren't the type
who has a pretty smile.

238
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,550
No, someone told me I have a pretty...

239
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,930
Enough. You should go
with the bad girl plan.

240
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,590
But there's something you need to know
when you do this.

241
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,580
You can't just continue to push him away.

242
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,340
When you push him away, push.

243
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,990
Then you have to pull him in too.

244
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,670
What a surprise.

245
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,710
Jae-jin, get ready.

246
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,290
Yes, right.

247
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,170
Now, let's say he's your blind date.

248
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,760
What will you say when he asks you this?

249
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,190
Are you free tomorrow?
Let's catch a movie.

250
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,440
I heard "Twilight" was re-released.

251
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,730
I'll see if I'm free.

252
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,320
You should be free at night, right?

253
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,820
I'll pick you up after school.

254
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,020
I have to eat after school.

255
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,250
Then we can eat first
before we watch the movie.

256
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,480
[Good job.]

257
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,540
[This is when you should say okay.]

258
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,140
I'm sorry,
but I'm turning you down right now.

259
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,120
And I prefer to watch movies alone.

260
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,610
-Jae-jin.
-Yes?

261
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,150
She's hopeless.

262
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,690
What?

263
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,260
The cafe street in Samcheong-dong
by 7 p.m., right?

264
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,680
Yes, he'll see you
where you want to meet him.

265
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,520
So why Samcheong-dong?

266
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,580
What?

267
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:49,280
Oh, there are
lots of great places to eat in that area.

268
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,580
Anyway, bye. Thanks, Hye-sun.

269
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,840
Dam, you got this!
You can start dating too!

270
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,900
Hey, you can do it too.
You can date someone.

271
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,240
He's such an embarrassment.

272
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,849
It'll be so awkward.
Why did I say yes to this?

273
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,640
No, I need to meet someone I can handle.

274
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,700
I should date a human guy since I'm human.

275
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,480
Let's make things work
with this human guy.

276
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,000
Are you Ms. Lee Dam?

277
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,040
I saw your profile photo,
so I recognized you at once.

278
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,200
Hello, I'm Park Jae-hyun.

279
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,910
Yes, hello. I'm Lee Dam.

280
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,190
You must be pretty close to Jae-jin.

281
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,270
Jae-jin? I've only met him once.

282
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,910
But one day, he suddenly invited

283
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,020
all the seniors from our club
into a chatroom.

284
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,410
He said he had a friend
who likes men that are older,

285
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,620
experienced, and settled,
that he needed to set her up with someone.

286
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,840
And he even invited a senior
who graduated ten years ago,

287
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,350
who got married three years ago.

288
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,970
-Why was he such a nuisance?
-Seriously.

289
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,210
I heard you got an internship
with CDAY Group.

290
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,850
It's really hard to get in, right?

291
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,390
The process must've been tough.

292
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,730
The process was fine,
but I had a tough time making a choice.

293
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,590
-Sorry?
-That wasn't my only option.

294
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,270
I got into Samsong, LD, SGEI,

295
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,030
and every single big-name corporation

296
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,450
that comes to your mind.
Isn't that awesome?

297
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,550
So I began to wonder where I should go
to use my potential to the fullest.

298
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,970
-That was the hardest part.
-I see.

299
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,330
It drove me crazy.

300
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,960
Right, you know what?

301
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,260
Each corporation has
a different type of ideal new recruit.

302
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,530
But all of their ideal types
pointed at me.

303
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,560
For example, CDAY Group

304
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,320
loves people who are creative.

305
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,790
And I'm so creative. Let me show you.

306
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,250
I don't make normal lettuce wrap
with meat.

307
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,540
I'd flip the lettuce over like this.

308
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,470
And salt? That's too ordinary.

309
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,930
I'm so creative, I dip it in cola.

310
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,500
Open up.

311
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,690
I'm fine.

312
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,120
Something like that. For Samsong,

313
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,190
they really value teamwork.

314
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,050
And voila, I'm crazy about teamwork.

315
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,250
The kind of sports I love to play

316
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,640
is something like
group jump rope or tug-of-war.

317
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,180
I'm my own co-op.

318
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,200
If we end up dating...

319
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,610
I'm sorry I jumped too far ahead.

320
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,340
But if we do,
we can do the three-legged race.

321
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,760
Why am I listening to his success story?

322
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,220
It's as if I'm here
on a blind date with Bill Gates.

323
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,510
I'd do that for 10, 20 hours.

324
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,310
Hey, Dam.

325
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,220
Did you just yawn?

326
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,350
You were so amazing that I was astonished.

327
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,090
Right? You almost shocked me.

328
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,870
And then SGEI.

329
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,110
[Miss Dam, may we have a word
after your blind date?]

330
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,250
[Is it bad to say you're like a niece?]

331
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,510
[Is your blind date ending soon...]

332
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,530
[Is your blind date ending soon...]

333
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,070
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

334
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,370
[Is your blind date...]

335
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,670
[Is your blind date...]

336
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,780
Is this the cafe you often come to?

337
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,820
Yes, will you go in first?

338
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,320
I need to make a quick call.

339
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,030
All right, then.

340
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,390
I just read your message.
I don't understand what you mean by that.

341
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,600
Were you asking
if my blind date is going well?

342
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,760
No, that's not it.

343
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,370
Something has been bothering me.

344
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,350
Bothering you?

345
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,690
Why? Do you think
I'll do something weird here?

346
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,920
Sorry?

347
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,860
I'm doing pretty well.

348
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,030
I even kept the conversation going
as if this isn't my first time,

349
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,280
[and I've shown positive responses,
so things are pretty mellow.]

350
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,330
Although I may look
way too young for you, Uncle,

351
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,750
but I'm pretty popular out here.

352
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,220
Things are going really well here.

353
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,420
[Then I'll continue to have
a great blind date. See you at home.]

354
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,580
Goodness.

355
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,890
Hey, Dam. Over here.

356
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,650
Yes, hey.

357
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,220
I already ordered coffee for you.

358
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,560
Anyway,

359
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,570
did you walk in late
to avoid paying for coffee?

360
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,600
No, I wouldn't do that.

361
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:02,920
Dam, let me give you a piece of advice
as a senior in life.

362
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,820
I just bought pork belly, right?

363
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:08,950
That means you're supposed to buy coffee.

364
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,320
And it's not about money.

365
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,080
I've been a pretty social guy,

366
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,850
and I came to know
that this is good manners.

367
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,010
I really don't mind, though.

368
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,620
But please do be careful
when you meet someone else.

369
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,610
I'm sorry, I'll send you
a voucher for coffee...

370
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,060
One second.

371
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:33,720
It's CDAY Group. It's the manager there.

372
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,110
Yes, Manager. Yes.

373
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,970
I was going to call you first.

374
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,390
Yes. One second, please.

375
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,060
I love you, sir.

376
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,690
Why are you here?

377
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,990
I couldn't focus at home.

378
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,320
I should probably leave, right?

379
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,490
No, you don't have to go
just because of me.

380
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,150
Then I'll pretend like I don't know you.

381
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,310
Please talk to him at ease.
You don't have to mind me.

382
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,150
Okay.

383
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,160
[Why did I say things are going well?
He can hear me now.]

384
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:14,200
Dam, I have really great news.

385
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,780
What is it?

386
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,430
I mean, that was this manager
who was really fond of me.

387
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,900
-Okay.
-He said I have the highest score

388
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,660
among all interns.

389
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,550
Do you know what this means?

390
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,110
It means I have the highest possibility
of becoming a permanent employee.

391
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,530
My gosh.

392
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,130
This is awesome.

393
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,200
Gosh, congratulations.

394
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,370
Thanks a lot. I got too excited.

395
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,240
Come to think about it,
you're now in your third year.

396
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,530
Shouldn't you get started on job hunting?

397
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,850
Yes, you're right.

398
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,180
I wanted to make use of my major

399
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,330
and be a curator at a museum.

400
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,280
I believe you need to study abroad
even before you apply.

401
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,670
Wait, your family must be pretty affluent.

402
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,050
No, we're just an ordinary family.

403
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:14,260
I see. Then do you have a high GPA?

404
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,190
May I ask?

405
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,850
Well, it's okay.

406
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:24,330
Come on, what's your GPA? What is it?

407
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,790
-It's 3.5.
-Your GPA is 3.5?

408
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,210
What will you do with a GPA like that?

409
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,190
What will I do with you?
This is very serious.

410
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,990
Dam, let me give you a piece of advice
as a senior in life.

411
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,770
You have no time to waste your time
with that empty dream.

412
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,190
You need to face the reality.

413
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,260
When should you dream?

414
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,210
When you sleep. Dream while you sleep.

415
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,160
This is the time for you to consider

416
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,270
what you can do to get a job.

417
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,910
Well, thanks for the advice,

418
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,330
but can you tell me this next time?

419
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,780
Next time?

420
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,170
I'm sorry, Dam.

421
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,250
There won't be a next time for us.

422
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,390
I'm not going to ask you out again.

423
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,630
What?

424
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,270
You sat there yawning

425
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,040
while I shared
all kinds of things about me.

426
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,300
Then you suddenly became nice
when I said I might get a permanent job.

427
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,200
You put your fingers around mine
when I asked you for a high-five.

428
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,800
-No, you did that first...
-Anyway.

429
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,410
Let me give you one last piece of advice
as a senior in life.

430
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,780
Instead of finding a guy
who's already settled,

431
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,340
you should try to become
someone who's established.

432
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:49,080
You should worry about your GPA
before you start dating anyone.

433
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,280
Instead of shopping for clothes,

434
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,700
buy some books
to add a line to your resume.

435
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,160
Instead of putting highlighter makeup on,

436
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,420
go highlights on your book.

437
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,220
Do you get what I'm saying?

438
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,510
Then please excuse me.

439
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,650
Right, send me two coffee vouchers
before the day is over.

440
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:27,930
That didn't hurt at all.

441
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,220
Hey, Miss Dam.

442
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,240
Miss Dam.

443
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,730
Can you tell me?

444
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,020
Tell you what?

445
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:03,650
Why were you offended
when I said you're like a niece to me?

446
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,500
Please tell me.

447
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:11,180
Yes, right. I see.

448
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,920
Well.

449
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,100
Miss Dam.

450
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,310
As you know,

451
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,180
the only thing I can do is
mimicking what humans do,

452
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,950
so my choice of words
may not have been proper.

453
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:34,590
But what I wanted to tell you on that day
wasn't that you're like a niece.

454
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,510
I meant that you're special.

455
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,710
Over 1,000 years of my life,

456
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,830
I never took in anybody
like they're my family.

457
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,700
It took me lots of courage

458
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,340
to say what I shared with you.

459
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,600
Could you understand
what I was trying to say?

460
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,010
[If you continue to be so nice to me,]

461
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,910
[I can't get over you.]

462
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,030
Miss Dam, you don't look so...

463
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,260
Oh, I was just reminded
of what that guy said to me.

464
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,200
He said it in an off-putting way,

465
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,180
but it was all true.

466
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:32,750
I already know how important
this time in my life is.

467
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:37,730
Instead of worrying about a job,
I loved studying history, so I did that.

468
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:42,040
But people keep telling me
to face the reality.

469
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:50,270
Miss Dam, there's something
I need to show you.

470
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,870
Wait, what is this place?

471
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,860
Isn't this place closed?
Are we allowed to be here?

472
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,070
Well, only if you'll keep it a secret.

473
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:19,880
In that case, this might be
my only opportunity in life.

474
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:29,340
Gosh, white porcelains. So cute.

475
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,260
Have you ever used this in real life, sir?

476
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,580
Of course.

477
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,320
You're calling me sir again.

478
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,910
Right.

479
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,420
My gosh, this is so cool.

By the way,
why do you like history so much?

483

I think I started to like it
because of historic dramas.

484
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,520
My brother and I spent a lot of time
alone at home,

485

so we watched TV a lot.

486

I used to find museums boring,

487

about Admiral Yi Sun-sin,

488
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,870
his faded journal touched my heart.

489

They say, "The more you know,
the more you see."

490

But for me, I think the more you know,
the more you get to like it.

I saw your smile?

And? What else have you done?

494
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,570
You were in the military too.

Gosh, that's amazing.

497

he's more experienced in life.

00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:10,220
because the house seemed too big and nice
for a college student.

640
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,250
Are you the owner of the house?

641
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,890
How do you know Dam?

642
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,150
Well...

643
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,050
["A precious part of me is
inside your daughter's stomach."]

644
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:24,300
[This may sound like she's pregnant.]

645
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,420
["I'm paying your daughter's tuition
in exchange for her company."]

646
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:29,840
[This may sound like we have
an inappropriate relationship.]

647
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:32,660
Gosh, why are you nervous?

648
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,170
Did I ask something hard to answer?

649
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:43,830
Mom!

650
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,570
Mom! You didn't say you were coming.

651
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,550
Let me explain this.

652
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,930
So my original plan was
to stay at my friend's place,

653
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,130
but it was too small.
So we decided to share a house...

654
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,840
Stop the fuss and sit down.

655
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,660
Okay.

656
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,040
So you're sharing a house.

657
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,540
So where's your friend?

658
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:16,660
-She'll be back soon...
-She recently moved out...

659
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,700
How long have you been living here?

660
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,500
-It's only been a week.
-About a month.

661
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,220
I think.

662
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,440
How did you meet each other?

663
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,240
-On the internet...
-A real estate agent...

664
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:39,270
[I'm doomed.]

665
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,840
[Where's your magic?]

666
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:48,340
[You told me not to use--]

667
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,110
[Come on. Do it.]

668
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,950
[Nothing happens.]

669
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:14,120
[I heard you couldn't use magic
towards someone]

670
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:16,720
[who is strong-minded, but...]

671
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:25,340
Dam, you know how much I hate lies.

672
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,280
Yes.

673
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,660
From now on,
lying will only make this worse.

674
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:34,840
Are you living with him?

675
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:39,770
No, it's...

676
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,420
I can explain.

677
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:48,790
It is true that she's staying at my house.

678
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,080
But there hasn't been
anything to worry about.

679
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:52,750
And there won't be.

680
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,980
["And there won't be." He's adamant.]

681
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,870
I'm not worried.

682
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:02,740
Whether it was weeks or months,
you've lived with her, so you should know

683
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,380
that my daughter has quite a personality.

684
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,770
I didn't even mean to scold her
for living with you.

685
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,660
I just hate lies.

686
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:15,010
I'll go now.

687
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,950
Are you leaving now?

688
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,250
Don't you think you sound too excited?

689
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,840
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about it.

690
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,880
But really, it's not like what you think.

691
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,660
I believe you know what you're doing,
but let me just say this one thing.

692
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,910
Okay.

693
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,770
I like it.

694
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,160
What? The house?

695
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:50,570
Seriously?

696
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:53,600
You have good taste just like your dad.

697
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,850
Seriously, it's not what you think.

698
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:57,120
It's not?

699
00:46:58,490 --> 00:46:59,670
I see.

700
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,980
Then I wish it will be.

701
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,790
Good luck.

702
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:11,600
I'll go now.

703
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:14,720
Okay. Bye.

704
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,790
Call me when you arrive.

705
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:19,560
Bye-bye.

706
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:26,510
Maybe I should have
sent her off at the airport.

707
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,170
-I'll drive you to the airport.
-What?

708
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,460
If we hurry, you'll have some time
to see her off.

709
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:57,310
Mom!

710
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,310
Gosh.

711
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:02,950
Mom!

712
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,530
Hey, what are you doing here?

713
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:11,040
I asked him to come with me
to see you off.

714
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:13,020
You said you had important training.

715
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:14,780
This is more important.

716
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,290
You should've told me
you were staying only for three hours.

717
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,270
I didn't know you'd leave so early.

718
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:28,070
Hey, why do you look so...
Do you wash yourself?

719
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,800
Of course. She's the one
you want to nag about washing.

720
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,560
She leaves her hair unwashed
for three days.

721
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,200
That's to save shampoo.
I care about this country's environment.

722
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,530
-Wasn't it because you were homeless?
-Do you want to die?

723
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,240
-What?
-You are homeless.

724
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:40,830
-Right.
-You want to die?

725
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,940
-You never take showers.
-I do.

726
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,260
I've got to go.

727
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:51,740
When are you coming back?

728
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:54,200
A sudden meetup and a sudden goodbye.
I don't like this.

729
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,320
We haven't met each other for a year.

730
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:04,410
My Dam.

731
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:09,210
My Dan.

732
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,650
You remember our family motto?

733
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,120
-"Live your life on your own."
-"Live your life on your own."

734
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,420
And you know I believe you can do that.

735
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,450
Why are you saying that now?

736
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,970
I wanted to say thank you
for growing into great people.

737
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:31,080
I don't feel comfortable
leaving you two alone here either.

738
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:36,710
But I have never regretted it.

739
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:39,390
Because I believe in you.

740
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,440
Mom.

741
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,410
Sir, it's been a hectic day, right?

742
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,980
Thank you so much.
I could see her off all thanks to you.

743
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,260
That's no problem.

744
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,950
You must be sad though.

745
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:21,900
It feels a bit strange,

746
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,360
but I guess that's what family is like.

747
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:26,210
We may fight all the time,

748
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:28,940
whenever something happens,
we support each other.

749
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:31,660
That's probably why thinking about them
makes me feel safe.

750
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:39,320
So that's what family is like.

751
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:46,180
You have me.

752
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:51,020
You said I was like your family.

753
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:56,520
I want to be like family to you.

754
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:00,970
Someone who supports you no matter what

755
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:04,310
and makes you feel safe.

756
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,650
Even after we take out the Marble.

757
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:27,370
[I managed it somehow,]

758
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:29,700
but you didn't handle it well

759
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:33,130
to have someone special to you.

760
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,010
An intruder!

761
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:10,320
Father!

762
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:15,210
Father!

763
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:16,570
Father.

764
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:56,300
Are you okay?

765
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:33,620
[I thought it was nothing.]

766
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:45,010
[Insincere act of kindness.]

767
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,400
[Meaningless kisses.]

768
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:03,230
[They were just what I do habitually,]

769
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,790
[so I didn't think
it was anything special.]

770
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,130
[I could have saved her life]

771
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,940
[if I had taken the Marble out]

772
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:18,800
[and pretended nothing had happened.]

773
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,150
[If I hadn't hesitated]

774
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:26,240
[to take the Marble out
and erase all the memories.]

775
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,020
[If I hadn't been afraid]

776
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,310
[of being forgotten by her.]

777
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:44,810
Just think of this as a bad dream.

778
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:49,290
When you wake up,

779
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,640
both your memories

780
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:57,170
and pain will be gone.

781
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:01,390
Don't cry.

782
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:05,840
This is not your fault.

783
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,830
You just

784
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:15,030
wanted to stay with me.

785
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,700
I wish

786
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,100
your dream comes true

787
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,870
and meet someone to teach you

788
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:35,670
what it is like to be together.

789
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:41,040
Did you know it all this time?

790
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,120
[Or if I had]

791
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,330
[never let myself
fall in love with her...]

792
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,030
[But it was too late
when I realized my mistake.]

793
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:21,090
[I might have just wanted to ignore]

794
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:26,460
[how contradictory it was to me
to have someone special.]

795
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:32,750
[It was just a coincidence,
and that could have been it.]

796
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,520
[That should have been it.]

797
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,550
[She has her family, her life,]

798
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,800
[and her people.]

799
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:49,470
[Is it fair that I keep her by my side?]

800
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,780
[Just because she makes
my life more interesting]

801
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:56,340
[and less lonely?]

802
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:03,240
[Just because I'm afraid
I might disappoint her?]

803
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:08,220
[Until when?]

804
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:12,530
[Until something really bad
happens to her?]

805
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:29,340
Sir, you're up early.

806
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,570
[Today is the day]

807
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:45,090
[I should let her go.]

808
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,130
[Haemil Publishers]

809
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:49,170
[Why those women, not me?]

810
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:52,820
[To be honest, being next to you
is the most dangerous.]

811
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:55,850
[Miss Dam, I promised
I would protect you.]

812
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:58,800
[And I always think about
how I can keep my word.]

813
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:01,490
[I heard all men have a room
in their hearts]

814
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:03,380
[and they keep]

815
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,710
their first loves in that room
for the rest of their lives.

816
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:08,750
[What if women around you
are the target, not you?]

817
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:09,760
[We appreciate
Oh Hyeon-gyeong, Han Ji-eun,]

818
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:10,290
Who would be the next then?

819
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:11,430
[Jung So-min, and Jang Sung-gyu
for their guest appearance.]

820
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,050
[Sir.]

821
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:13,590
There you are.
