-I was lying.

-Lying?
-I didn't mean it.

48

You kept avoiding me,

49
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,280
so I went a little too far
to hold you back.

50
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,500
I thought I needed to be like a fox
in order to catch a fox.

51

But I think I was wrong.

52

treat someone I like with love.

53
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,690

to move in with you?

89
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,550
and you went out and got it
even though you don't eat any food.

90
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,360
I was pretty touched back then.

00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,920
Right, when I had bad period cramps,

92
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,780
you went out
for the dating project for me.

93
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,030
And

94
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,370
when I was worried about my future,

95
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,140
you took me to a museum and comforted me.

96
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,450
In times like those, I thought
you were much more humane than I am.

97
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,820
Please continue to show me those sides.

98
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:31,200
If we start with such little things,
this might work.

99
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,190
Such little things?

100
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,659

I hope we can continue to get along.

101

it'll be the same as before.

104

But what if I take your energy...

105
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,590
Gosh, stop going on and on
about my energy.

-You won't.

116

No, I slept all right.

119
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,120
Anyway, your house is so huge,

120
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,410
so I was a little scared
when I slept alone here.

121
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,010
But it wasn't scary at all
to sleep next to you.

122
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,350
-Can we do this every single day...
-No.

123
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,110
One day of this torture was enough.

124
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,280
Torture?

125
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,320
Wait, did I snore?

126

No, it's not...

127
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,740
It's not that you snored.

128
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,230
-It was teeth grinding.
-What?

129
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,940
It's okay. It can happen.

130
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,130
I ground my teeth so badly
to the point it was torture?

131
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,240
This makes me gnash my teeth.

I was very anxious that our relationship

138
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,800
might end there.

139
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,760
I prepared breakfast.

140
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,470
Come on out.

141
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,100
Yes, I need to keep this happiness going,

142
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,180

with his awful cooking skills?]

It's ramyeon.

146
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,550
I remembered how you had this
from the morning,

147
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,060
so I prepared this
only according to the recipe.

-Of course.

150

because of this inhumane thought]

So what kept him
from becoming a human to this day?

158

00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,120
People who live
in relationship with others.

166
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,060
-Hello, Professor Shin.
-Hello.

167
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,570
Are you looking for a book?

168
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:15,940
Yes, something like that.

169
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,720
It seems like
he gets along well with most people.

170
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,930
Professor, if you haven't had lunch,
do you want to join us?

171
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,560
I can't.

172
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,200
Not too well, I guess.

173
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,640
[Dam, when are we meeting for the club?]

174
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,750
[Aren't we
making the outline of the magazine?]

175
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,740
[I was looking for some materials
in the library, actually.]

176
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,810
[Let's meet up now.
I'll head to the club room now.]

177
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,580
Gosh, how can I find a way?

178
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,880
-A way to do what?
-My goodness.

179
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,640
You startled me!

180
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,090
Is something bothering you?

181
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,540
No.

182
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,660
Right, I might be a little late today.

183
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,110
I have to be at a club meeting.

184
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,560
I wanted to leave together.

185
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,560
I'll be home right after.

186
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,660
See you at home.

187
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,860
"See you at home"?

188
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,630
Why are you two here?

189
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,080
You said you were at the library.
We were nearby, so we came for you.

190
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,380
Anyway, what do you mean,

191
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,920
you'll see him at home?

192
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,880
Well, it's...

193
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,090
We're going to make the magazine
at his place.

194
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,640
At his place?

195
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,100
All of us?

196
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,910
Yes, all of us.

197
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,730
He has lots of reference at home,

198
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,250
so he'll show those books to us
as the professor in charge of our club.

199
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,540
Really?

200
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,580
-Thank you, Professor.
-Thank you.

201
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,090
You're a true educator.

202
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,800
Thank you.

203
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,650
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

204
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,320
All right.

205
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,390
This is nice, isn't it?

206
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,150
Professor, with all due respect,

207
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,950
please excuse us.

208
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,580
Thank you.

209
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,570
Sir, once we get there,
I'll take them to a convenience store.

210
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,410
Can you move my stuff while we're gone?

211
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,830
Hey.

212
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,830
I know they're your friends,
but I can't let them come to my house.

213
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,210
But they ended up hearing me say that.

214
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,600
Dam, aren't you coming?

215
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,880
I'll be there.

216
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,510
[Okay, then he'll get to experience]

217
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,579
[different relationships with people...]

218
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,810
It's a chance of a lifetime.

219
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,099
Not everyone gets invited
to the professor's home.

220
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,859
I won't lose this chance

221
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,440
and get closer to him.

222
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,780
Do I have to go?

223
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,720
Why not? Does your leg hurt?

224
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,329
I just don't really like him.

225
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,530
You don't? Why not?

226
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,800
I just don't like

227
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,970
how formal he is
and how he lacks the human touch.

228
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,170
He lacks the human touch?

229
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,280
He's right. Other professors

230
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,970
sometimes buy drinks for students,
take questions from us,

231
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,290
and give us career advice too.

232
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,190
But Professor Shin
always dashes back to his office.

233
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,050
He does lack the human touch.

234
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,480
But if he invited us to his home,

235
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,460
then maybe he does have the human touch.

236
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,060
He just might be awkward around people.

237
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,080
Let's keep an open mind and be nice,

238
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,020
showing the love
between a teacher and pupils,

239
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,480
and what it means to live together
in different relationships.

240
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,820
What? Why are you getting all grand?

241
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,690
Hey, so what do you think
his place is like?

242
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,980
Will it be stylish and modern
just as he seems?

243
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,930
Or will it be simple and small?

244
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,640
Let's go.

245
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,870
Gosh, thank you.

246
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,820
My gosh, is this happening for real?

247
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,060
Look at this place.

248
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,740
Thank you for having us, Professor.

249
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,470
This is for you.

250
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,000
Then let's go to the study.

251
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,230
Yes.

252
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,980
-Where are you going?
-What?

253
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,190
It felt like that was the study.

254
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,100
Is that your study?

255
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,170
I want to know
if my gut feelings are right.

256
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,490
You do have great gut feelings.

257
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,950
That is my study.

258
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,490
Let's go.

259
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,170
Wait.

260
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,680
Dam, isn't this yours?

261
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,690
It's not. That's not mine.

262
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,010
You do have something like this.

263
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,590
Look at this.

264
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,100
You were wearing it then.

265
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,500
Wait.

266
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,730
If Dam's badge was found here, it means...

267
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,650
Professor Seo also uses that bookstore.

268
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,420
You only go to that one bookstore.

269
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,580
I thought this was limited-edition.

270
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,570
She must be as quick as you are.

271
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,670
Right?

272
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,590
Why are you bringing her up now?

273
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,610
-Then why else would it be...
-Yes, that's enough.

274
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,150
Let's go.

275
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,870
What's this?

276
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,190
"Sir, I'm leaving first. See you tonight."

277
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,570
"Sir"?

278
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,030
I've heard that pet name before.

279
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,490
Wait.

280
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,130
Isn't that your boyfriend's pet name?

281
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,600
What?

282
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,960
That means...

283
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,020
I guess that pet name is trending.

284
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,960
I want to make my own sir too.

285
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,320
Anyway, it's funny to think

286
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:02,220
that Professor Seo would call you sir.

287
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,120
Sir.

288
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,200
-Soo-kyung?
-Yes?

289
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,320
Let's cut the small talk
and go to the study.

290
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,300
Yes, guys. Let's go.

291
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,580
Come on.

292
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,540
Then let's use this reference here

293
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,270
and have the return of cultural assets
as our theme.

294
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,700
Think of the details by next time.

295
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,430
-Okay.
-Okay. Great work.

296
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,840
Are you all done?

297
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,490
Yes, thanks to the great materials
you let us use as reference, we ended...

298
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,250
Then let's wrap it up.

299
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,190
[He can't let them go yet.]

300
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,020
But since we're all here already,

301
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,480
why don't we have a get-together?

302
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,060
-A get-together?
-Yes.

303
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,320
Other professors
let us ask questions on history

304
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,700
and give us advice on careers too.

305
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,740
Do you have anything to ask him
or any requests to make?

306
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,360
No?

307
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,150
Professor Shin.

308
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,050
Could you use
less Chinese characters in lecture?

309
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,400
I mean, you use the most
Chinese characters in your lecture,

310
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,940
so it's tough for everyone.

311
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,900
We find it even harder
than Professor Irritating.

312
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,710
Professor Irritating?

313
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,110
We had a professor like that?

314
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,650
It's Professor Oh's new nickname.

315
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,240
No matter where you meet him,

316
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,130
he's awfully annoying and irritating,

317
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,870
so Professor Irritating.

318
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,360
Anyway, everyone is
a bit scared of Professor Oh,

319
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,600
but more people

320
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,240
have been saying
your lecture is tougher than his.

321
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,570
So could you use less Chinese characters?

322
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,990
-Mr. Do Jae-jin.
-Yes?

323
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,970
The word research is derived

324
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:03,750
from an old French word, "recherche",
which means "to go about seeking."

325
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,450
If you're a history major,

326
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,610
it means you wanted to conduct
extensive research in this field.

327
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,400
In order to examine
historical documents accurately,

328
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,470
isn't Chinese characters a given?

329
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,530
Isn't that so?

330
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,590
You're right.

331
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,640
Soo-kyung, do you have
any questions for him?

332
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:28,960
Of course, I do.

333
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,340
Professor Shin.

334
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,630
I have many deep concerns

335
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,490
regarding historical matters
as the top student of the department.

336
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,960
And while we're on the subject,
may we stay for dinner?

337
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,270
What does history have to do with dinner?

338
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,210
[Yes, a meal.]

339
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,820
[Actually, I've never seen him
eat with anyone else other than me.]

340
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,580
You should go home and eat.

341
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,390
Let's have dinner, Professor.

342
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,690
-What?
-Well,

343
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,460
an old adage says
you must always treat your guests.

344
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,660
It means you should
eat and drink with your guests

345
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,730
as you all cultivate your virtue.

346
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,750
How can a virtuous man like you

347
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,210
let us go home on an empty stomach?

348
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,390
And life is all about meat.
How's meat for dinner?

349
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,550
Sounds great.

350
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,380
Man, it does look good.

351
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,120
Is it hot enough?

352
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,070
I just threw it out there,

353
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,140
but I can't believe
I'm grilling pork neck here.

354
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,350
Right? Doesn't he seem
more humane than we thought?

355
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,040
Professor Shin, join us. Let's eat.

356
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,670
I'm boiling water for ramyeon.

357
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,090
We have so much meat, though.
Why are you making ramyeon?

358
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,540
You always need ramyeon with meat.

359
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,300
[We're here for your finances.]

360
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,530
What is this?

361
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,960
Is it your ex-boyfriend?

362
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,980
No, a spam message.

363
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,830
Ex-boyfriend?

364
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,430
You said there's trouble,
but you didn't say you broke up.

365
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,450
Well, it's, you know...

366
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,630
My boyfriend and I are back together.

367
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,240
Hey! You can't do that.

368
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,000
You can't date a jerk like him.

369
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,560
A jerk? Don't be so harsh.

370
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,930
Harsh?

371
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,490
You can't tell me where you met this jerk
and what he does.

372
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,870
You can't even tell us
how darned old that jerk is.

373
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,360
Is he a con man? Is he wanted?

374
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,650
Why does he make you so shady?

375
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,150
Enough, stop it. What's with you?

376
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,040
Stop what?

377
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,080
Hey, I wasn't going to be this harsh,

378
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,720
but the day you two broke up,
you looked so devastated,

379
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,820
so I texted him

380
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,500
pretending to be you,
and asked him to come for you.

381
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:46,240
But what happened?
He ghosted you. He never came.

382
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,800
Most guys would come for you
if you were drunk at a club.

383
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,000
That jerk sounds really cold-hearted.

384
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,260
Yes, that's what that jerk is like.

385
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:58,820
No, he's a really nice guy.

386
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:03,050
If he's such a nice guy,
why did you curse him saying he's a fox?

387
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,510
-When did I do that?
-When you got wasted,

388
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,930
you went over to a guy
in a fox costume and said,

389
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,260
"I could understand everything."

390
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,300
"I could deal with the fact
that you're a fox."

391
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,840
You said that.

392
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:17,740
Not only is he cold-hearted,
he's as sly as a fox.

393
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,290
Did you always pay,
while he never bought you a present?

394
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,530
Don't date a guy like him.

395
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,390
Yes, call him right now
and tell him you're done.

396
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,570
Enough!

397
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,330
That's enough boiling water.

398
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,110
Please enjoy your dinner.

399
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,360
I need to vent my anger... I mean,

400
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,600
I need to get some beer.

401
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,430
Eat up.

402
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,700
Were we a bit too agitated before him?

403
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,780
-You were way too loud.
-You were loud.

404
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,100
No, her.

405
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,170
-Gosh.
-Fire...

406
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,160
Professor Irr...
I mean, Professor Oh Sang-chul.

407
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:26,030
I heard Professor Shin was
having fun with the students,

408
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,920
so I decided to stop by.

409
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,590
I see. Professor, have you had dinner?

410
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,210
-We were...
-One second.

411
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,780
Ground pepper.

412
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,560
This is perfect timing
to learn some more about pepper.

413
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,720
Don't you think so?

414
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:46,450
Do you know who brought pepper to Korea

415
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,470
and how it was popularized?

416
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:56,520
There's a record on pepper
in the old writings of "Pahanjib."

417
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,010
Wait, one second.

418
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,720
The knowledge you gain easily
will be forgotten easily.

419
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:09,810
Therefore, you should
turn in a report on this subject.

420
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,340
-Here, you can take this.
-Yes, sir.

421
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,620
Grab a seat.

422
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,350
Wait, one second.

423
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,700
A silver spoon.

424
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,940
This is perfect timing to learn some more
about silver spoons, right?

425
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:36,250
Many kings in the past used silver spoons

426
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,600
in an attempt to avoid
getting poisoned to death.

427
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,290
You should turn in a report
of those historical anecdotes.

428
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,500
-May I...
-Yes, of course. Please.

429
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,860
Okay.

430
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:58,650
Right, from what I heard,
students have been calling me

431
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,330
Professor Irritating recently.

432
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,780
What's the reason?

433
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,690
-It's...
-It's because...

434
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,040
Yes, it's because
you are irritatingly handsome,

435
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,770
so we've been calling you that.

436
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,130
It's just as I expected.

437
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,960
Yes, of course.

438
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,770
-Goodness.
-In that case,

439
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,540
can you turn in a report

440
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,350
regarding how handsome I am?

441
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,870
Of course, it's already a proven theory.

442
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,620
I slept so well last night!

443
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,870
Gosh, this is hilarious.

444
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,420
Wait, one second.

445
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,510
-Glass craft.
-Professor Oh!

446
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,370
I have to be in a TOEIC class,
so please excuse me.

447
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,450
Me too. I have to take my medicine.

448
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,840
-Yes, I should get going.
-One second.

449
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,070
Miss Dam.

450
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,540
Sir?

451
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:10,760
Wait, did you just put on a disguise
to kick out my friends?

452
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,580
Why?

453
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,490
Sir.

454
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:33,030
Please don't mind what my friends said.

455
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,310
They got worried about me,
so they overreacted.

456
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,710
But Miss Dam, I was good to you too.

457
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,250
Just as you said yesterday,
I bought what you wanted to eat,

458
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:48,380
helped you with your report,
took you to the museum,

459
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:51,990
and even helped you make kimchi.
Why didn't you tell them that?

460
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:56,300
Exactly. I never had a chance
to tell them anything about you.

461
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,210
If we ever get together again,
I'll make sure

462
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,790
they don't say anything like...

463
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,270
No, we won't do anything like this again.

464
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,050
What? Why not?

465
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,480
I liked seeing you
associate with other people.

466
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,250
We said we'll do
many things that humans do.

467
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,880
I'm sorry, Miss Dam.

468
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,910
Wait.

469
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:22,830
Come on, sir. Sir! Please?

470
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,430
Come on, sir.

471
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,470
Can't you do this for me? Please?

472
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,690
I have everything planned out.

473
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,560
Aren't you cold?

474
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,640
What? The heater is on, so not at all.

475
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,230
You seem a little cold.

476
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:48,090
What are you doing?

477
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,860
I don't want you to catch a cold.

478
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,090
What?

479
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,370
[What is he doing?]

480
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,380
Why did he give me these things?

481
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,600
My gosh. Goodness.

482
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,060
This is way too hot. Gosh.

483
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,140
Did this plan just fall through?

484
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:24,040
No matter how much I think about him,
he doesn't seem different from Hye-sun.

485
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,460
But how did she make it
while he couldn't...

486
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,770
Yes, Hye-sun.

487
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,100
I had Hye-sun as a model example.

488
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,230
Jae-jin, isn't it about time
you took your medicine?

489
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,640
Yes, you're right.

490
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,220
Wait.

491
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,820
Here it is.

492
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:50,170
Hye-sun, you know,
this injury is uncomfortable,

493
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,800
but I like how I got hurt.

494
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,430
Why are you happy about that?

495
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,560
But still, you've been worried about me
ever since I got hurt.

496
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,410
So I'm glad I got hurt.

497
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,330
-Hye-sun, I'll take my medicine.
-Okay.

498
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:16,350
Hye-sun, can the three of us
eat dinner together?

499
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,980
The three of us?

500
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,050
Do you have to be the third wheel?

501
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:23,440
Not with him. You, me, and my sir.

502
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,160
I don't want to.
I'm not going to see Woo-yeo anymore.

503
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,060
There's no way he could be a human.

504
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,700
How can he push Jae-jin down the stairs?

505
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,560
Then he completely denied the charges.

506
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,580
He really didn't push him.

507
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,260
I know he did.
I still have my sixth sense.

508
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,650
I could feel some kind of mysterious force
pushing Jae-jin down.

509
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,030
There's no one else
who could use such magic...

510
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,140
You're right. It was the mountain spirit.

511
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,520
He got hurt just as I did before.

512
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:55,420
What? That darned old man.

513
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:59,160
Calm down. So apologize to him,
undo the misunderstanding,

514
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,970
and try to get along with him.

515
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:06,950
Gosh, I've never said I'm sorry to him.

516
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:11,750
Not even once.

517
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:15,659
[All right. Let's keep
the answer sheet next to me]

518
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,730
[and see what the difference is.]

519
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:23,270
I'd like to order two club sandwiches
and one shrimp sandwich.

520
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,810
Which bread would you like to have?

521
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,030
Honey oat for the club sandwiches

522
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,670
-and white bread for the shrimp sandwich.
-Okay.

523
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,909
You see, we didn't meet up
to eat sandwiches today.

524
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,810
Hye-sun, you said you had
something to say to him.

525
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,950
The thing is, I told her

526
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,490
it wasn't you who pushed Jae-jin.

527
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,830
Hey, Woo-yeo.

528
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,060
I'm so...

529
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,590
So...

530
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,910
Do they have soy milk too?

531
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,600
I guess they don't.

532
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,740
Sir, it looks like
Hye-sun wants to say sorry.

533
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,100
Why don't you say something?

534
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,360
Well, it's o...

535
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,510
It's o...

536
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,400
It's okay, Miss Dam. This is unnecessary.

537
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:10,020
Why did you invite Hye-sun, by the way?

538
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,180
[They're exactly the same.]

539
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,810
[I don't see any difference.]

540
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,930
It looks like we're all finished.
Shall we go?

541
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,080
That sounds good.

542
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,060
No! It hasn't even started yet.

543
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,290
Start?

544
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,420
I mean, the reconciliation.

545
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,970
You didn't get to make up
with each other yet.

546
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,580
Why don't we go grab a drink?

547
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,450
Alcohol is the best solution
when it comes to reconciliation.

548
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,930
Is everything going all right at school?

549
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,470
Of course, Dad.

550
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,860
Though I could use a bit more money
to buy workbooks.

551
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,970
I'm not asking you, Seo-woo.
I was asking Seon-woo.

552
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,990
Well, I'm doing my best.

553
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,420
Why did you even start studying history
if you wanted to work for my company?

554
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,280
You should have gone study abroad.

555
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,390
You keep saying that.

556
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,940
You know how much he hates to hear that.

557
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,530
I'll go.

558
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,410
Really? Are you really going?

559
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,080
What happened?
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

560
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,980
You said it felt like you're forced to go
and you hated it.

561
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,480
Butt out.

562
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,150
It's because of her, right?

563
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,010
-That boy, Lee Dan's sister.
-What?

564
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,210
That day, when you picked on me
at the police station,

565
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,440
your eyes were fixed on her.

566
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,690
So I figured out what's going on.

567
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,910
But it looks like she dumped you.

568
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,800
That's just part of the reason...

569
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,910
Forget it.

570
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,370
You see,

571
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,230
if you have regrets,
why don't you try one last time?

572
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,440
I don't have regrets.

573
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,270
Cheers.

574
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,300
It's so nice to drink all together.
Don't you think?

575
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,880
It is kind of nice to have
some makgeolli after a while.

576
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,840
This reminds me of the time

577
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,180
when I dated Lord Kim's third son.

578
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:39,920
He made straw shoes for me
and gave me chocolate.

579
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,370
He was so sweet.

580
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:43,310
Did they have chocolate back then?

581
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,390
You were all excited,
saying noblemen are indeed different.

582
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,970
Wasn't it in the 1600s though?

583
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,690
It was.

584
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,990
I thought chocolate was imported
in the 1800s.

585
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,450
Maybe it was taffy then.

586
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,540
Come on. It was centuries ago.
I was confused.

587
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:08,570
Anyway, it's nice to see you guys
reminiscing about the same time period.

588
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,370
You are old friends, right?

589
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,810
Speaking of which,
why don't you save her phone number?

590
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,380
What? You haven't saved my number yet?

591
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,580
I saved your number. Look.

592
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,470
Did you save me

593
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:28,890
as "Pox"?

594
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:33,380
What about it? You are a "pox".

595
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,180
You spelled it wrong.

596
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,560
It's "fox", not "pox".

597
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,140
F, O, X. Fox.

598
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,120
What?

599
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,620
I know. It's just a typo.

600
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,440
You're such an ungrateful smarty-pants.

601
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,600
I even held your hand to share my energy
because you seemed so shaky.

602
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,140
And how dare you treat me like this?

603
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,960
It was just

604
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,370
to get some energy.

605
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,390
There's nothing to worry about.

606
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,550
Well, seeing your relationship,

607
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,940
I wouldn't worry about anything
even if you were holding each other tight.

608
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,870
That's great.

609
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,600
What? What is it?

610
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,050
I don't like those mean-looking fox eyes.

611
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,980
Stop fighting.

612
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,970
Still, you guys have been relying
on each other for such a long time.

613
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,900
She was more of a weed to me.

614
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,240
Things were much easier without her.

615
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,950
Same here.

616
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,280
I would have been much happier
without him.

617
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,880
What an ungrate.

618
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,950
You mean, "ingrate", not "ungrate".

619
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,500
It's "ingrate".

620
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,050
My, you're really smart.

621
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,250
Is that why you haven't
become a human yet?

622
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,190
-You have a problem with that?
-I can't hear you.

623
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,770
-Stop talking like that.
-Keep talking.

624
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,620
[-They're the same.]
-I'm much older than you.

625
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:02,570
[They've lived hundreds of years,
but they're more childish than children.]

626
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,040
[What in the world is
the difference between]

627
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,760
[taking off a jacket because of the sun]

628
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,560
[and taking off a jacket because of wind?]

629
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,920
From now on, please never organize
a meet-up with Hye-sun.

630
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,090
I won't. Thanks for trying anyway.

631
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,540
Though it wasn't that fruitful.

632
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,090
Miss Dam.

633
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:35,170
Is there another reason
why you want to live with me again?

634
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,460
What?

635
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,360
You suddenly made me spend time
with your friends,

636
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,520
organized today's meet-up,

637
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:46,080
and said things like you had a plan
but it didn't turn out fruitful,

638
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,230
which I find a bit strange.

639
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,790
What do you mean, strange?
There's no other reason.

640
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,340
It's cold. Let's go.

641
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,710
-What?
-Isn't that Dam and Professor Shin?

642
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,210
My gosh.

643
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,810
Take a photo of them.

644
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:11,780
-But why?
-This is unbelievable.

645
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:18,510
Gosh. He's quick-witted like a fox.

646
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,070
Should I just tell him the truth?

647
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:23,700
No.

648
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,390
It might only confuse him.

649
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:33,780
Gosh, I'm so tired.

650
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:38,400
"A History Professor and A Student
Spotted on Date".

651
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,890
Add, "Shocking News".

652
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,530
Okay. "Shocking News".

653
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,870
I can't believe this.

654
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:46,850
How could she do this behind everyone?

655
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,120
I knew it.

656
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,500
-Should I post it?
-Yes.

657
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:01,060
Hey, did you read that post
on Everyday Time?

658
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,860
No. Did something interesting happen?

659
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:04,890
Well...

660
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,790
Someone posted
such a heartbreaking confession of love.

661
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:12,980
Here.

662
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,410
"I first met him two years ago
when I was a freshman."

663
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,220
"I told him
how much I loved his warm smile,"

664
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,060
"but he dumped me brutally."

665
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:22,970
"It hurt me
and I have been mean to him since."

666
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,300
"But in fact, I still like him."

667
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,320
"I'm sure he doesn't know how I feel."

668
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,770
Is that our senior, Jung Seok?

669
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,600
What in the...
There's nothing interesting about it.

670
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,540
You're such a horrible actress.
I know you wrote this.

671
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,790
What are you saying?

672
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,940
Stop acting like it's not you.

673
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:45,360
I have always wondered
why you hated him for no reason.

674
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,920
I guess it's because he turned you down
when you were a freshman.

675
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,830
Wait. When we played truth or dare,

676
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,550
you said you used to like one of us there.

677
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,320
And Jung Seok, Seon-woo, and I were

678
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:57,600
the only men there.

679
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,050
It's definitely you.

680
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,810
Jeez! I said it wasn't me!

681
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:01,950
"It wasn't me!"

682
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,900
Hey, did you read that new post
on Everyday Time?

683
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:06,130
That's...

684
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,730
really not me.

685
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,440
What are you talking about?

686
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,910
We're talking about the photo
of Professor Shin and Dam.

687
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,540
He's right.

688
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,390
Didn't you know about this? Let's go.

689
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:21,930
I thought they were friends.

690
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,160
I guess not.

691
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,260
What...

692
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:28,130
-Hey, look for that post.
-We were looking at the wrong post.

693
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,490
Seon-woo!

694
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:37,720
I thought there was something going on
between you and Dam.

695
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:39,350
What are you talking about?

696
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,830
I mean, she has a boyfriend,
so I've always wondered

697
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,680
why she would always
get involved with you.

698
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,490
And that boyfriend of hers
turned out to be a professor.

699
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:50,040
-She must have lost her mind.
-I know.

700
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,280
Where did you hear that?

701
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,440
Hey, are these two really going out?

702
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,380
Isn't it obvious?

703
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:58,930
Their arms are linked.
They're definitely going out.

704
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,530
I thought Dam was dating Seon-woo.

705
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:04,430
Wait. Didn't Professor Shin get involved

706
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,160
with a scandal with Professor Seo?

707
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,090
Right. It's a love rectangle then.

708
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,150
It's so confusing.

709
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:12,610
Hey, maybe we should share this
in our group chat.

710
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,850
Good idea. Go on and do it.

711
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:20,530
You know both taking photos in secret
and spreading the photos are wrong.

712
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,350
You should refrain
from talking behind others' back

713
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,730
if you don't really know about it.

714
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:28,760
Come on, guys. It's fun.

715
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,300
You were surprised to see it too.

716
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:32,060
How could you not know?
You're her friends.

717
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:33,160
Do we have to?

718
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:35,450
Dam is a grown-up.
She knows what she's doing.

719
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:36,730
Is there a problem?

720
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:39,810
Of course, there is. She takes his class.

721
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:41,920
-It's a big problem.
-You're right.

722
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:44,250
What if he gives her good grades
because they're dating?

723
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,670
-That wouldn't be fair.
-That's not acceptable.

724
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,530
It just doesn't make sense
that a student goes out with a professor.

725
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,160
Hey, Dam is here.

726
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:53,930
What's going on here?

727
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:56,790
This is just unbelievable.

728
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,330
You were the ones who took the photo?

729
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,000
You should be professional paparazzis.

730
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:13,070
When did they start dating?

731
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,270
After Professor Shin started
working here, obviously.

732
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,390
Seriously though, how could she
even think of dating a professor?

733
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,650
Wait. Did he volunteer for the club

734
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,410
-for his girlfriend?
-Yes.

735
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,740
-Gosh, even my heart flutters.
-Do you even hear yourself?

736
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,370
Guys, enough already.

737
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,090
-Goodness.
-What's enough?

738
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:32,030
How could a professor date a student?

739
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,310
Even if he could,

740
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,160
he shouldn't date someone
who takes his class.

741
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,970
Come on. They're both adults.

742
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,870
I just feel bad for Seon-woo.

743
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:41,630
-Right.
-Dam.

744
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:47,350
Hey, Dam. Is that true?
What about Seon-woo?

745
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,030
How did you seduce a professor?

746
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:53,550
We were dating
even before he became a professor here.

747
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,970
I didn't know
he'd be teaching my major here.

748
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:00,060
And about the club, I heard it was decided
by the professors at a meeting.

749
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:03,100
I see. So there's no problem with it?

750
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,460
Who cares?

751
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:07,060
Who knows if he'll give you good grades
because you're dating him?

752
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,290
She has a good point.

753
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,150
I'll drop the class.

754
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,760
Dam, we're having our final soon.

755
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,690
It will be wasting
a whole semester of studying.

756
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,760
It's better
than misunderstandings like this.

757
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,310
Now everything is okay, right?
I should get going now.

758
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:26,020
Right. Jeon Da-young, Seo Jin.

759
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,350
Delete the photo.

760
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,240
-That little...
-Hey.

761
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,610
It is kind of mean of you
to post the photo online.

762
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,020
Shut it.

763
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:42,740
[Seon-woo]

764
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,240
[Seon-woo]

765
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,580
What is it you wanted to say?

766
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,040
It's about you and the professor.

767
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:12,040
There are rumors about it
in our department. Someone saw you.

768
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,890
I know.

769
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,620
Is that what you wanted to talk about?

770
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:21,110
I mean, why are you
dating someone like him?

771
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:23,440
Don't the rumors about him bother you?

772
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,330
It's none of your business.

773
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:28,980
I know you don't care
about what others say,

774
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:30,960
but people will talk about you
behind your back.

775
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,060
And...

776
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,070
some will talk about me as well.

777
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:41,790
It's my fault. I shouldn't have made it
so obvious that I liked you.

778
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,140
Let me at least take care of this.

779
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,910
I'm the one who put you in trouble.

780
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:52,040
I can tell people
that I was the one who insisted...

781
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:53,450
Please don't do that.

782
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:58,150
I don't want to put you in trouble
for my own sake.

783
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:04,140
Just don't worry about it.

784
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:09,900
If you're done, I'll get going.

785
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:33,490
[Seon-woo, your departure date is set.]

786
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,950
[Don't forget to give me
your tablet before you go.]

787
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,720
Dam.

788
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,800
I like you.

789
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:56,890
I like that you speak so casually

790
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:00,150
and the way you look
when you glance at me carelessly.

791
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,350
I like everything about you.

792
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:06,130
-Seon-woo.
-There were times

793
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:09,650
I thought I was just confused

794
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,710
because I couldn't make you like me.

795
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,450
But I don't think that's the case.

796
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:23,650
I like you.

797
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:30,380
I know what you're going to say.

798
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,110
Still,

799
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:37,720
I wanted to say it one last time.

800
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,460
One last time?

801
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,270
I'm going to go study abroad.

802
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:59,940
This can be a confession of love

803
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,770
or a goodbye.

804
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,940
You can take it however you like.

805
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:25,860
Goodbye, Seon-woo.

806
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:58,240

809
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,060
Hello, sir.

810
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:14,910
Why are you walking away?

811
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:17,590
Well...

812
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,270
I don't want to put you in trouble.

813
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:23,130
What do you mean by trouble?
We didn't do anything wrong.

814
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:27,000
I just don't want people
to talk behind your back.

815
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,340
I don't care about that.

816
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:34,700
So don't run away.

817
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,540
I got everything settled.

818
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:41,610
I admitted that we're going out.

819
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,940
And this does look suspicious,

820
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,230
so I'll drop your class.

821
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,170
Everything is okay now.

822
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,770
That's probably

823
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:58,240
why the red thread has been cut.

824
00:54:58,550 --> 00:54:59,700
What?

825
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,010
You're right. I don't see it any more.

826
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,630
You could see the red thread?

827
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:14,170
Yes. I started seeing it at some point.

828
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:17,030
But what matters is
that we managed to cut it.

829
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,430
-"We"?
-Yes.

830
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:23,900
We solved this on our own.

831
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,780
We are the ones to decide our own destiny,
not the stupid thread.

-You should go.
-What?

834
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,710
Go and clear the air. I'll be waiting.

835
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,110
I'm sorry, Professor Shin.

836
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:22,060
It looks like there were rumors about us.

837
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:24,610
I'm sure it made you feel uncomfortable.

838
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:29,630
Now that I think about it,
you always turned me down.

839
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,910
You were just being polite.

840
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,280
I'm bad at taking hints.

841
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:38,120
I'm saying this
because I thought it'd be good

842
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:40,810
for the both of us to make things clear.

843
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,810
There's nothing

844
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,070
you should apologize for.

845
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:56,650
I knew you were interested in me.

846
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:58,670
I knew it,

847
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:03,470
but I pretended I didn't.

848
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:09,850
But I shouldn't have done that.

849
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,950
I'm sorry.

850
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:25,640
I mean it.

851
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,290
Well done.

852
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,280
I'm sure you feel much lighter now.

853
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,200
But seriously, it feels so good now.

854
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:10,830
Especially because that thread is gone.

855
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,930
Now that I think about it,
it must have been just as hard

856
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:17,430
for Seon-woo as well.

857
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,890
He probably didn't like me so much

858
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:22,400
if it weren't for the red thread.

860
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,400
[He's probably
the cutest 999-year-old person.]

861
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:44,530
Anyway, now everything is over,
let's go eat something nice.

862
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:46,470
I'd love to. What should we eat?

863
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,400
-How about pasta?
-Sounds good.

864
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,700
Let's invite your friends too.

865
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:53,240
Okay. Then I'll invite...

866
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,380
-What?
-They didn't get to eat much that day.

867
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,010
I want to make up for it.

868
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,090
But you said
it's not going to happen again.

869
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:03,720
I did.

870
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:08,160
But I thought I might be able
to work it out like I did today.

871
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,960
That's great. I've always wanted
to brag about my boyfriend.

872
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:14,720
Let's do that.

873
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,740
-Let's go.
-Okay.

874
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:29,150
He said he needed to make a phone call.

875
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:30,910
Where's Soo-kyung?

876
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,800
She went to the restroom.

877
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:39,490
I'm sure you're surprised.
I'm sorry I kept it a secret.

878
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:42,830
Are you sure you want this?

879
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,860
He once had a scandal with Professor Seo.

880
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:47,670
It's just a rumor. It will die down soon.

881
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:54,050
Dam. I thought this was my problem,

882
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,550
so I was going to keep it to myself,

883
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:57,390
but now I know you're dating
Professor Shin,

884
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,710
so I need to tell you this.

885
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,900
Please don't get me wrong.

886
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:01,490
What is it?

887
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:03,250
As a matter of fact...

888
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:10,770
I once saw Professor Shin and Hye-sun
holding hands.

889
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:12,490
That's why I hated him.

890
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:15,040
That's a misunderstanding.

891
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:16,710
Professor Shin and Hye-sun are just...

892
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:20,450
[Officially, their age difference is
too big to be friends.]

893
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:24,100
[If I say they held hands
because of energy, he'd think I'm crazy.]

894
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:25,510
They're just what?

895
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:27,840
They're just...

896
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:32,110
Relatives. Distant relatives.

897
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:34,090
Really?

898
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:38,800
That's why they both look so attractive.

899
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:40,510
It runs in the family.

900
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:44,690
I can't believe I judged
such an upright man.

901
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:46,450
I'm so ashamed of myself.

902
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:48,300
I know. I'm very ashamed of you too.

903
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:50,550
Look at you, flip-flopping so quickly.

904
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:52,480
I knew there was something
different about them.

905
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:54,150
-This is so cool.
-What's so cool?

906
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:56,750
-This way, Professor.
-He's coming.

907
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,820
On my way back from the toi...
I mean, restroom,

908
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:04,140
I bumped into him.

909
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:06,390
Hello, Professor.

910
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:09,550
I mean, Mr. Dam's boyfriend.
I mean, hello, Professor.

911
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:11,970
Shall we take seats now?

912
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:13,430
Okay.

913
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:28,740
Relax, guys.

914
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:33,140
Well, I know what I did,

915
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:34,240
so I can't relax.

916
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:39,740
I still feel bad
about what I said at his place that day.

917
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:43,610
We didn't know you were her boyfriend then

918
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,130
and used curse words.

919
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,110
"We"?

920
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,970
I was just playing along with her

921
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:53,200
because I didn't want

922
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:55,140
my friend to feel embarrassed.

923
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:57,380
I didn't mean it, Professor.

924
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:04,110
Professor. What's your favorite?

925
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,990
Well, there are so many things
I like about her,

926
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:16,830
but my favorite is her smile.

927
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:23,910
What?

928
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:29,410
I was asking what your favorite menu was.

929
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,300
I like everything.

930
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,940
Excuse me!

931
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:51,540
I wish every day was like today.

932
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,840
I'll try to make
your every day like today.

933
01:02:57,790 --> 01:03:00,830
I should have discussed with you
in the first place.

934
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,480
The things I couldn't change
no matter how hard I tried

935
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,790
seem to change
since you realized it yourself.

936
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:12,530
Now I get it.

937
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:16,620
You're the kind of person
who takes off the jacket

938
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,190
when exposed to warm sunshine
for a long time.

939
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:26,000
To be honest,

940
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,300
there is another reason
why I'm living with you.

941
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:33,260
What?

942
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,040
What turns the Marble blue...

943
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,660
is humanity.

944
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:45,440
Humanity?

945
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:57,630
Are you okay?

946
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,630
I'm glad.

947
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:10,700
I thought your sacrifice was
what changed the color of the Marble,

948
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,900
and it made me feel bad.

949
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:16,810
But I'm glad

950
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,420
that wasn't the case.

951
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,310
Still,

952
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:28,030
we should be careful.

953
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:32,300
There's still the hunger issue,
so it can still be dangerous.

954
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:35,690
I said, don't worry.

955
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,420
There's no way I'll be in danger.

956
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:44,400
Actually, when I met the mountain spirit,

957
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:46,560
I asked him a favor.

958
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:51,400
I said I would make sure
to turn you into a human,

959
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:55,010
so I wanted him to keep me
from any sickness or death.

960
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:56,630
We made an agreement.

961
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:03,940
You always surprise me.

962
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:06,890
I need to save myself, after all.

963
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,830
Looks like the wind
dropped the wind chime.

964
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:27,130
Good night, Miss Dam.

965
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:29,550
Good night.

966
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:49,830
I thought I was not in danger
any more, so...

967
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:14,910
I think things are
just about to get dangerous.

[I can't focus on my homework.]

970
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,930
[I can't focus on anything.]

971
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:53,990
Bye, Sir.

972
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:56,630
[Who would think you're dating him
if you call him "Sir"?]

973
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:57,600
You're done, Dam?

974
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:59,270
Honey! My love!

975
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,300
-It's cheesy, right?
-I like it.

976
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:04,250
[I'm very concerned about my friend
who started a tough love.]

977
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:07,020
I'm thinking of quitting the job
after this semester.

978
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:09,390
[Why won't he make out with me?]

979
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:11,680
[-Sometimes, it works.]
-My goodness!

980
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:13,660
Sometimes, it doesn't.
Why do you think that is?

981
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:16,040
I think that's a sign
that you're turning into a human.
