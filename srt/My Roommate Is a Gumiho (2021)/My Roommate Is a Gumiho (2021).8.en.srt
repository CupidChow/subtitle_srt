Yes, if we get the story straight
out of our lips.

70

Hye-sun, listen up.

91
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,690
There is this thing
called a figure of speech.

92
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,800
When we say "take out our hands and feet,"

93
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,650
it doesn't mean we use our feet.

94
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,330
It means we should do
everything we can to help.

95
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,110
And "get the story straight
out of our lips" means

96
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,170
we come up with a story

97
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,080
and run with the same story
as we make up stuff.

98
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:50,150
Are you trying to teach me?

99
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,820
-No.
-I'm not that stupid.

100
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,760
I even memorized 1,000 Chinese characters.

101
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,970
I may not have finished Lesser Learning,
but I got into the collegiate system.

102
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,920
Do you think I didn't know?

103
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,340
[Wait, does she think]

104
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,760

[She's a pretty funny girl.]

106
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,080
I'll see you on Saturday.
Instead of using our lips...

107
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,300
I mean, instead of coming up with a story,

108

Please excuse me.
You should get to class too.

117

Hey, wait.
Do you want to meet this weekend?

118
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,430
I mean, that's not what I meant.

119
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,170
I mean, well, it is.

120
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,480
We have to do the assignment.
Don't you want to do it?

121
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,090
I don't want to.

122
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,260
Sir, I'm home.

123
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,780
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

124
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,140
You took the Marble out, didn't you?

125
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,480
I could tell by the way she looks.

126
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,660
Did you see her?

127
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,980
So what if I did?

128
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,640
Why do you care?
You won't be seeing her again.

129
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,920
If you've decided

130
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,260
to strain every drop of energy
from a stranger,

131
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,280
you should've stayed away
from getting attached.

132
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,560
And if you've let her go,

133
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,800
you need to brace yourself
and find the next target.

134
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,190
You don't have time to lose
looking miserable,

135
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,510
and that goes for both of you.

136
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,620
Both of us?

137
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,080
She was crying.

138
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,760
She was? Why?

139
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,520
Why do you ask?

140
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,500
I'm sure it's because of you.

141
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,000
That's impossible.

142
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,640
I erased everything about me
from her memories.

143
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,650
I'm not sure if you're sweet or cruel.

144
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,880
Are you sure your magic worked?

145
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,000
You said it didn't work on her mom.

146
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,550
I'm sure no one will remember a thing.

147
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,920
That girl

148
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,430
and everyone else who saw me.

149
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,320
Please keep an eye on her
and see if she does all right

150
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,900
and stays healthy.

151
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,510
You said you wanted me to keep her safe,

152
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,180
not to pry on her private life.

153
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,600
She's safe now.

154
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,270
From whom?

155
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,250
From me.

156
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,850
So now you're worried
about her private life

157
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,410
instead of her safety?

158
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,340
I thought of her like my family.

159
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,360
Please do that for me.

160
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,280
No, if you want to see her,
you can see her in person.

161
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,940
She won't even recognize you.
What's the problem?

162
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,660
Family, my foot.

163
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,130
No guy makes a face like that
to a girl he thinks of like family.

164
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,920
[What about my face?]

165
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,000
How can I put this?

166
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,090
I mean, you've been smiling,

167
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,070
but you look like you're empty inside.

168
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,260
Whatever.

169
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,280
Are you sure everything is okay?

170
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,040
I'm fine.

171
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,430
[I lied.]

172
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,250
I knew how to take out the Marble

173
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,980
from the beginning.

174
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,070
But I lied to you.

175
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,960
I needed energy to become human,

176
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,750
and you happened to be there.

177
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,160
[Yes, I was just a consumable human]

178

[who was there to give him my energy.]

179

[So this is enough.]

180

[The least I can do is celebrate.
Why am I crying?]

181
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,100
Soo-kyung, are you free today?

182
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,370
Today?

183
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,450
I don't have a lesson at my academy.

184
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,710
And my phone English lesson
isn't today either.

185
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,000
Let's call Jae-jin
and party until the morning.

186
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,270
Midterms are over too.

187
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,360
I'm going to do everything
I couldn't do for a while.

188
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,340
That feels much better.

189
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:31,040
Chicken and beer
beat any kind of relationship.

190
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,250
Tipsy and delicious,

191
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,890
yet delicious and tipsy.

192
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,560
-I missed this so much.
-Right.

193
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,160
You didn't have to miss it.

194
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,270
You did this every other day.

195
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,530
Tell me about it. Some might think
she hasn't done this for months.

196
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,250
Excuse me, we'll take
one more garlic chicken

197
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,930
and another 3,000cc beer pitcher.

198
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,690
-Sure.
-You're eating more?

199
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,890
Are you going to stop eating chicken
after today?

200
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,000
I know our midterms are over,

201
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,200
but I need to recap
today's lecture and study.

202
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,890
Stop eating. Let's go.

203
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,480
Hey, go where?

204
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,030
My curfew is lifted.
We have to party harder.

205
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,530
You had a curfew?

206
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,690
-I didn't know Dan was that strict.
-Right?

207
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,130
I don't have to avoid them anymore.

208
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,450
-What?
-What?

209
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,280
My life is filled with happiness,

210
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,820
and it's killing me.

211
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,800
Hey, let's go to a karaoke room.

212
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,910
Karaoke sounds great.

213
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,730
It's time to bust out
Jae-jin's sentimental songs again.

214
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,670
-Hey.
-Fine.

215
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,700
Hey, I don't want
any of these drowsy slow songs.

216
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,420
Only dance songs.

217
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,190
Dance, dance!

218
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,180
Why is Dam so hyper today?
She's scaring me.

219
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,410
I'm not sure.

220
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,700
She said that she feels lighthearted.

221
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,640
Is it because tests are over?

222
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,480
I don't think she studied so hard

223
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,120
for her to feel that lighthearted.

224
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,940
We have a minute left. Let's go.

225
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,720
Let's not sing a long song
and mope over the time we lost,

226
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,650
-but let's go home with some class.
-Start.

["Apartment"]

228

What's with this song?
Did her taste in music change?

229
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,610
Well, I guess trot music is
really big these days.

231
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,210
Now that he took out the Marble,
did he become a human

232
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,030
with the energy I gave him?

233
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,780
Goodness, I don't even care.

or suffer from a hangover.

Eat up. It's ox blood hangover soup.

239

Can you make me bean sprout soup
or dried pollack soup next time?

240

I don't want to see any blood for a while.

Don't walk in the rain, and take this.

325
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,660
Why should I take your umbrella?

326
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,420
-Soo-kyung!
-Hey, Dam.

327
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,420
-My gosh.
-Where's your umbrella?

328
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,180
How did you find me?

329
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,940
Hey, it stopped raining.

330
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,140
Was that a sun shower?

331
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,040
It was sunny, then it suddenly rained.

332
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,890
-Let's go.
-Okay.

333
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:55,330
[Her kind voice. Her smile.]

334
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,220
[And playing a baby.]

335
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,500
[All those things were
perhaps a privilege.]

336
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,480
[I have now become]

337
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:11,030
[a nobody to her.]

338
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,370
Have you heard?

339
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,010
Professor Jung recently took a leave
because of his health,

340
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,590
so we're getting a new professor.

341
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,090
Really?

342
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,340
Why? Are you worried?

343
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,720
Well, in my case, it doesn't matter
who the new guy is.

344
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,470
What's that? What's he doing? Jae-jin.

345
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,580
What are you doing?

346
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,550
My friends, I need agony aunts.

347
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,090
What's wrong?

348
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,610
Our grades aren't in, so I doubt
you're worried about repeating this class.

349
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,810
Well,

350
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,330
Jin-ah has been in contact for a few days.

351
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:02,690
Why won't you even hear me out?

352
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,840
I mean, she keeps texting me
late at night asking if I'm asleep.

353
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:10,260
Then she sends old pictures
and asks if I remember.

354
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,850
She wants to meet, so what do I do?

355
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,880
What do you think? She's bored,

356
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,730
so she wants to lead you on.

357
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:19,670
Just ignore her.
You don't have to be shaken.

358
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,230
-She's not like that.
-Whatever. Be quiet.

359
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,630
-Hey, are you serious?
-Yes, he's going to be here.

360
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,060
-Hey, let's sit in the very front.
-Stop that.

361
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,380
Hey, Yu-ri.

362
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,650
What's going on here?

363
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,100
It's the new professor.

364
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,130
I just saw him, and he's amazing.

365
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,980
Why? How amazing is he?

366
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,250
It's none of your business.

367
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,750
-Look.
-My gosh.

368
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,570
He looks like an actor.

369
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,500
He's really hot.

-Gosh, he's so hot.
-Who is that?

373
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,940
I'm sorry I ran in late on my first day.

374
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,400
-Don't say that.
-It's okay.

375
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,080
-Don't say that.
-Right.

376
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,140
Dam, I'm thinking of retaking this lecture
for the first time in my life.

377
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,960
No, I'll re, re, re, re,
retake this lecture.

378

[Why is he here right now?]

379
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,850
[If he can use magic,
is he not a human yet? Wait, no.]

380
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,270
[That's not what's important.]

381
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,120
Then let me call attendance first.

382
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,570
-Okay.
-Yes.

00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,540
Yes.

[Is he doing this to keep an eye on me?]

393
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,700
As you have been probably informed,

394
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:11,740
I'm going to be teaching History 101
starting today.

395
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:15,870
Then

396
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,990
let's start from page 178.

-Yes, Professor.
-Yes, Professor.

Bye.

401
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,610
Thanks for the lecture.

402
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,490
Hey, Dam. Beef tripe after school?

403
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,670
I have no money.

404
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,700
It's on me. I got my allowance.

405

-Stop annoying me.
-Come on.

406
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,040
-Go away.
-Come on.

[Professor of History, Shin Woo-yeo]

408
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,120
I'm just watching her for a while.

409
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,980
Just for a while.

410
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:13,120
All right.
I didn't say anything yet, though.

411
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:19,060
So you're just watching her for a while.

412
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,250
Then what?

413
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,790
What are you going to do next?

414
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,590
You saw what happened
when one failed to become a human

415
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,170
after living 1,000 years.

416
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,240
Haven't you learned your lesson?

417
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,170
Time is ticking.

418
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,200
Why are you still thinking about her?

419
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,620
-I cared...
-If you cared about her so much,

420
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,550
why did you erase her memories first?

421
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,420
[Because I thought]

422
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,430
[if she wouldn't look at me
the same way as she did,]

423
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,550
[I wouldn't be able to stand it.]

424
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:10,140
Are you sure you want her
to go back to her normal life?

425
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:19,120
Is it really okay for you to see her
doing just fine

426
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,440
without you?

427
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,040
Of course.

428
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,310
You know what?

429
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,480
I may lie to other people,

430
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,420
but I would never lie to myself.

431
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,900
I'm buying you a really tasty beef tripe.

432
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,740
I said I'm not interested.

433
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,340
You can't convince me
with 20cm of beef tripe.

434
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,360
I know you want to talk about Jin-ah.

435
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,260
Just move on, you clingy punk.

436
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,540
I'm not being clingy.
I just want to say to her

437
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,230
that I'm not an idiot anymore
so she should stop contacting me.

438
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,340
I just want to talk with you about

439
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,630
how I make it sound

440
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,740
more charismatic and ruthless, my friend.

-Whatever.
-Jae-jin.

442

Jin-ah, what are you doing here?

443
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,860
I just came by

444
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:24,100
to see your face.

445
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,550
By the way, Dam,
it looks like you're still single,

446
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,570
seeing that you still
hang out with Jae-jin.

447
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:37,790
-You little...
-No, Dam. Don't.

448
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,929
My legs hurt.

449
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,850
Jae-jin, will you keep me waiting here?

450
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,699
Let's go somewhere and talk.

451
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,560
You're not talking to anyone. Go away.

452
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,170
Who do you think you are
to tell me to go away?

453
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,250
I know who I am to him.

454
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:02,160
If you make him cry, I'll be the one
who has to take all his drunken grumbles.

455
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,070
If you're not paying
for the drink, just go.

456
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:08,890
Jae-jin.

457
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,700
Should I go?

458
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,140
Well...

459
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:30,370
Sorry, Dam.

460
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:37,320
She came all the way here.
I can't just let her go like this.

461
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,090
Let's go, Jae-jin.

462
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,510
I saw a nice cafe on my way here.
Let's go.

463
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:43,870
I'll text you.

464
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,990
What am I going to do with that idiot?

465

[Jae-jin]

466
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,400
[I'm sorry, Dam.]

[I know I'm being stupid,]

468
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,770
[but seeing her face makes me weak.]

469
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,780
Hi, Seok.

470
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:36,980
Now?

471
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,010
Professor, what kind of coffee
do you like?

472
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,780
Professor. Please have some snacks.

473
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,340
-Seok, what's this about?
-What's your favorite?

474
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,630
Obviously,

475
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,270
we're welcoming our new professor.

476
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,900
You're the president of the council.

477
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,640
[I wished I didn't have to bump into him.]

478
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,840
What are you doing here though?
You're not even a member of the council.

479
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,750
Do you have to be a member

480
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,730
to greet our new professor?

481
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,490
Professor.

482
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,070
As the top History major junior,

483
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,140
I have a question.

484
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:24,100
Are you married?

485
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,420
Hey.

486
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,330
Can't you see he's not wearing a ring?

487
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,450
Of course. You look so young

488
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,230
I thought you were one of my seniors.

489
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,340
What a surprise.

490
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:46,980
Dam, don't you have any questions
to ask him?

491
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,500
How will our grades be calculated?

492
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,610
-Sorry?
-This is my first time

493
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,430
having my professor changed
in the middle of the semester.

494
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:09,730
They will be calculated
in the same way as before.

495
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,750
Yes, Professor.

496
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,530
I see.

497
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,490
Jae-jin.

498
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:36,660
You thought I was two-timing too, right?

499
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:43,260
But if you define my love
using one cheap word like that,

500
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,750
I'll be sad.

501
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,950
I was simply confused

502
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,240
if I liked you or him.

503
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,280
I see.

504
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:57,560
I think I'm done
organizing my thoughts now.

505
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:02,440
So I'm thinking of giving you
another chance.

506
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,620
-Another chance?
-Yes.

507
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,690
A chance to make me feel safer

508
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,420
and be nicer to me
so I don't get confused.

509
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,750
To be honest, you haven't been
that good either.

510
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,510
You hung out with Lee Dam all the time.

511
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,320
Jin-ah, Dam is just a friend.

512
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,950
How many times do I have to tell you?

513
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,240
Dam is not even a female friend.

514
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,570
She's just a human friend.

515
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,420
I said I didn't like her.

516
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,940
How many times did I say
I didn't like her?

517
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,830
Fine.

518
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:42,130
I did see another guy while dating you.

519
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,110
But you weren't nice to me either.

520
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,220
We're both at fault.

521
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,430
Choi Jin-ah. Do you even hear yourself?

522
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,440
Not once have I put her before you.

523
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,940
You have always been my priority,

524
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,480
and I have always done my best
for this relationship.

525
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,370
Don't use Dam as an excuse.

526
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,880
You may not be that good of a person,

527
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,080
but you're not that shameless either.

528
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,110
How could you side with her
in front of me?

529
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:13,190
I didn't know you were such cold a person.

530

531
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:24,980
Hi. I didn't expect to see you here.

532
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,140
Who is she?

533
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,790
I'm sorry if I have interrupted.

534
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,210
I'll leave you two alone.

535
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:34,750
See you on Saturday.

536
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,600
Okay. I'll text you.

537
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,210
Who is she? Why are you texting her?

538
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,640
-Well, she's just...
-What?

539
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:47,860
She's just someone
I do an assignment with.

540
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,330
It's...

541
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,810
Even if he told you who I am,
you wouldn't know.

542
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,850
What?

543
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,150
So what's the point of asking?

544
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:07,490
-Hey! What are you?
-Don't...

545
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:13,600

[Seriously? Saturday?]

547
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:22,890
I can't, Jin-ah. I told you
we had to do an assignment together.

548
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:25,220
You can do the assignment on Sunday.

549
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,830
I like Saturday.

550
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,040
I must meet Jae-jin on Saturday.

551
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,440
I'm not going to cancel
my appointment for you.

552
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,940
And I'll never see you again.

553
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,140
You haven't answered my question yet.

554
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,650
Who is this woman?

555
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,020
Do you want to know who I am? Why?

556
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:15,770
I don't care whether you're Jae-jin's ex
or a utility pole.

557
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:18,320
I just want you to know this one thing.

558
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,860
On Saturday, he's mine.

559
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,090
Maybe I shouldn't have meddled.

560
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,760
It's okay.

561
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,890
Next time, don't be like that.

562
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,310
Don't open your heart to others.

You can't win the game
if you show all the cards in your hand.

564
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,390
I didn't play a game.

565
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,060
I didn't want to win either.

566

Yes.

[Job Fair]

Why aren't you asking me
why I didn't call you?

575
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:54,490
Pardon?

576
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:57,660
I said I would call you
because we're having dinner together.

577
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,430
Oh, right.

578
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,030
Are you free today?

579
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,890
Today, I can't...

580
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:17,770
Thanks, Seon-woo.

581

Let's have the dinner later
when you feel better.

What?

583
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,750
You don't look so well today.

584
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,180
You cried a lot the other day...

585
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:40,690
Seon-woo, why don't we just do it today?

586

-What?
-Let's go.

This place is famous
for their salmon steak.

588
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:14,660
For salad, I'd recommend
avocado salad or Cobb salad.

589
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:16,330
And for amuse-bouche...

590
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,790
Do you like ceviche?

there are whole grain
or tofu noodle options.

What's the matter?

594
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,350
I didn't get any of that.

What's with the muse and bush?

596

Okay.

Excuse me. I'd like to order.

601

That text message wasn't sent by me.

602
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,190
It was my brother.

603
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:07,630
He has this crazy idea
that you're interested in me.

604
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,020
I know. I figured it wasn't from you.

605
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,240
I thought you would never
talk so sweetly to me

606
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,880
nor send me such emojis.

607
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,000
In fact, that's the reason
why I hesitated to call you.

608

I was afraid you would
cancel this thing at all.

Seon-woo, you don't have to do this.

610

If this is because you feel bad
about the bet--

611
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,740
I do feel bad about it,
but that's not the reason.

612

00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:06,200
I knew it.

647
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,620
So why did you follow her
in the first place?

648
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:12,400
It was nice seeing her.

649
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,180
I resented and hated her a lot,

650
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,910
but we had good memories too.

651
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:29,340
And I used to really like her.

652
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:33,920
I know she randomly appeared,
but it was nice seeing her.

653
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,290
It was weird.

654
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,960
I understand.
Emotions are weird like that.

655
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:44,120
Why do you think she suddenly appeared?

656
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:46,720
Exactly. Why?

657
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:48,920
Why did she have to appear and sway me

658
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:50,460
when I was almost finally over her?

659
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:52,830
Why sway me?

660
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:55,910
What are you doing?

661
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:58,510
Why are you copying me?

662
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,270
I am?

663
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:03,220
I'm just showing sympathy.

664
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,330
You know what?

665
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:21,170
I still have this stupid idea

666
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:26,360
that I might have been

667
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,080
too mean to her at the end.

668
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:33,270
And I even have this idea

669
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:38,550
that she might have come

670
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,850
because she missed me.

671
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,620
How pathetic.

672
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,780
[Could he be also...]

673
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:58,000
[Is it pathetic of me]

674
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,070
[to wish that he misses me too?]

675
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:13,350
Jin-ah, I really want
to move on this time.

676
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,760
If you show up again,

677
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:16,480
I'll act like I don't know you.

678
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:17,930
I'll act like I don't know you!

679
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,520
I wish I could act like I don't know you.

680
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,780
Gosh! Walk on your own!

681
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,530
Hey!

682
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:38,210
You... No. Don't.

683
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,280
I'm not going to run. Don't you worry.

684
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:46,220
I'm not going to run. Don't worry.

685
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:48,290
Let's go have a second round.

686
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,270
-Let's go have a second round.
-What?

687
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,110
Hey, wake up.

688
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,130
I will sell your organs

689
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,850
if you don't wake up now.

690
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:12,220
Have you lost your mind?

691
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:13,500
What's going on?

692
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:18,960
Hye-sun.

693
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,440
What are you doing here?

694
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:25,780
I didn't know it was your car.

695
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,420
Jae-jin got so drunk, so...

696
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,950
[What were they doing together?]

697
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,400
Dam.

698
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:47,990
I feel sick

699
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,150
and the ground is too soft. I can't walk.

700
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,920
Hey, wake up.

701
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:57,320
Come on. Goodness.

702
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:59,130
Let me help.

703
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,850
It's okay. We can take a taxi.

704
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:10,960
Right. What do we do about your car?

705
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:15,760
It must be tough.

706
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:17,560
What?

707
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:19,630
Tell him to call me when he sobers up.

708
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,520
I want to talk to the perpetrator.

709
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:25,440
Let's go have another round. Choo-choo.

710
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:28,430
Gosh, I'm going to throw you
into the recycling bin.

711
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,710
Another round, my foot.

712
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:32,870
Do you think you can handle him?
I can drive him home.

713
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,290
It's okay. I can take him to my place.
I live near here.

714
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:36,570
You don't need to.

715
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:39,430
We'll drive him home.

716
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,210
Let us do that.

717
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,670
Where does Jae-jin live?

718
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:46,510
It's really okay. If he goes home now,

719
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,200
his brothers might undress him
and kick him out.

720
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:51,440
But it's late and dangerous.

721
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,290
You should go home first.

722
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:58,480
[I want to ask him why he sounds so sweet]

723
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:02,130
[as if he worries about me.]

724
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:04,990
[I want to ask him why he's with her]

725
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:07,770
[and why he's always around me,]

726
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:09,920
[keeping me from recovering.]

727
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,200
[There are so many things
I want to ask him, but...]

728
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:18,630
It's really okay.

729
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,010
Hye-sun, I'm sorry.
I'll text you tomorrow.

730
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,470
-Bye.
-Okay. Bye.

731
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,850
I should go.

732
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:38,830
What?

733
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:41,290
I'm worried.

734
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,220
But...

735
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:19,040
[Is the person she likes...]

736
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:28,900
[Why do I keep...]

737
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:38,980
[No way.]

738
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:44,390
[Do I like her in a different way?]

739
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,260
I'll get going.

740
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:49,670
You can't go by yourself.

741
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,340
-I can...
-Ouch!

742
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:16,330
See? I said you might fall.

743
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:21,210
[How dare]

744
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:23,900
[I...]

745
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,370
[She's so young]

746
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:33,090
[and young.]

747
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,070
[Since when and how?]

748
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:44,530
I can take care of him.

749
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:46,340
You can go, Professor.

750
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,210
Hye-sun must be waiting.

751
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:54,480
[Why now?]

752
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:56,500
[You know what?]

753
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:58,750
I may lie to other people,

754
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:00,290
but I would never lie to myself.

755
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,490
Are you sure you want this?

756
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,050
[Even if she meets other people,]

757
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:07,940
[dates others,]

758
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:09,920
[loves others,]

759
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:14,190
[and eventually
stays out of your life forever?]

760
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,060
No.

761
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:33,420
I'm not sure.

762
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:51,940
[We appreciate Kang Mi-na
for her guest appearance.]

763
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,880
[My Roommate is a Gumiho]

764
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,840
[For the first time since I met her,]

765
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:30,790
[I felt like I fell from clouds]

766
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:32,770
[and bumped into reality.]

767
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,900
[I'm going to give a presentation
about Goryeo's Buddhist culture...]

768
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:38,540
[What kind of fox is so easy to read?]

769
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:40,650
[if you like her so much,
why don't you hurry]

770
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,800
[and turn into a human
so you can meet her again?]

771
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:46,150
[I think her memories aren't erased.]

772
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:49,670
[Is there really something
going on between them?]

773
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:51,340
[Miss Dam.]

774

now available on streaming sites.]

775
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:53,760
[Your memories aren't erased, are they?]
