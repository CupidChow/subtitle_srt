00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,210
I've never filled myself up
with human food...

163
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,480

may disappear.

What kind of logic is this?

169
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,810
I've seen some of these before

I've never had before.

-I wouldn't even take it for free.
-It's not for you anyway.

I keep running into him,
but I can't remember.

-and has monolid eyes.
-Monolids?

I hope nothing bad happened

His lectures are as fascinating
as his facial features,

you're a gumiho too.

-Yes.

You know what's happening, right?

257
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,650
I'm not sure.

258
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:33,170
Even if I explained it to you,
would a human like you understand?

259
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,580
But what I do know is that
you don't even know half of who he is

260
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,610
or what we're like.

261
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,140
[I'm going to be a human
as soon as I can.]

262
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,120
Why are you in such a hurry?

263
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,810
Because I want to live a different life.

264
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:58,470
A cold-hearted guy like you
who's made of ice won't understand.

265
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,350
Please erase my memories.
Please, I ask of you.

266
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,460
[One day, there will come a moment]

[when you can't stand
that you're actually a fox.]

268
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,860
Why don't you try getting energy
from other women?

269
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,540
Then she won't have to see you
as a threat,

270
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:51,270
and if you get lucky,
you may become a human too.

271
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,050
If the result is great,
who cares about the process?

272
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,840
Well, there's no way
an upright man like you would do that.

273
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,570
Then try doing something as I suggested.

274
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,520
-Try stuffing yourself to quench...
-I tried.

275
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,070
What?

276
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,670
I tried everything I can.

277
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,160
Really?

278
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,890
Yet you couldn't control yourself?

279
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,720
I don't get it.

280
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,940
Could it be

281
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,420
because of that?

282
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,190
Because of what?

283
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,660
If it's because of that,
then I wouldn't be too worried.

284
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,700
You know.

285
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,100
Sexual desire.

286
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,370
I think there's definitely a chance.

287
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:55,550
I recently saw a movie
where the male lead was in your spot.

288
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,780
He couldn't restrain himself,

289
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,380
so he'd get up in the middle of a meal
and wipe out the table...

290
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,700
That's enough.

291
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,680
It's not that I can't restrain myself.

292
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,760
I can't control myself.

293
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,930
And what's more important is

294
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,380
the Marble is somehow gathering energy.

295
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,700
What? How does that make any sense?

296
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,360
-Sir.
-Miss Dam.

297
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,700
You might want to leave for a second.

298
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,720
[Sir]

299
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,530
Sir!

300
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,580
Why did you call...

301
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,000
Forget that. Are you all right?

302
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,740
-Miss Dam.
-Yes?

303
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,330
Could we

304
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:24,390
keep our distance for a while?

305
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,070
We just started to go out.
Why would we do that?

306
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,960
Stay right there. I'm coming.

307
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,280
Just for a short while,

308
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,230
until I find a way.

309
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,170
A way?

310
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,290
Miss Dam.

311
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,690
You thought I'd become a human right away

312
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,170
once I take the Marble back, right?

313
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,390
So didn't you wonder

314
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,160
why everything seemed to be the same?

315
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,890
Yes, I was dying to know.

316
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:59,320
But I thought you had a reason
for not telling me.

317
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,590
I don't have enough energy yet.

318
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,930
That's why

319
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,660
I continue to crave for more

320
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,790
against my will.

321
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,290
But isn't it all right
since you have the Marble?

322
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,780
[What if it isn't?]

323
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,470
What if something goes wrong?

00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,020
If I take more energy from you,
you might fall in danger, Miss Dam.

325
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,270
So let's keep our distance for a while

326
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,350
until I find a way.

327
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,350
I know how smart you are,

328
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,840
so I'm sure you understood everything.

329
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,010
We have lots to discuss,
so let's get started.

330
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,730
I'm thinking of donating proceeds

331
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,500
from our school festival
to a cultural asset protection group.

332
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,570
I'm not sure. It all sounds great,

333
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,430
but are we going to make that much
from opening a pub like everyone else?

334
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,680
I was wondering if you had any other ideas
other than opening a pub.

335
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,980
How about doing tarot card readings
or having your fortune read?

336
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,270
-Economics is doing that.
-Really?

337
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,480
Just do a free hug campaign for 500 won.

338
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,430
If they have to pay, it's not free.
It's a paid-hugs campaign.

339
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,930
Don't be so uptight.

340
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,910
We can leave a box,

341
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,200
and ask people to donate
as much as they want.

342
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,500
So who would pay money for a hug?

343
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,480
It's not like we have somebody big.

344
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,530
Hey, people would pay.
They'd pay to do this.

345
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,290
We'll empty out everyone's pockets.

346
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,830
I'd give up my tuition for him.

347
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,650
-What's going on?
-You've just been sold.

348
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,290
You're our free hug guy at the festival.

349
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,800
I'm not doing it.

350
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,270
He's right. He's not in the student body,
so we can't force him.

351
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,820
-Why not?
-You totally killed this.

352
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,300
-Hey.
-Then what about Dam?

353
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,380
She can do this for coming late.

354
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,360
You do the free hugs campaign.

355
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,740
-The free hugs campaign?
-Yes.

356
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,950
You were late, and we already chose
what we're going to do.

357
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,160
-You don't have a job yet.
-We're too busy.

358
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,710
Then I'll do it.

359
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,330
I'll do it, so leave her out of this.

360
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,290
-Hey, what's going on?
-A knight in shining armor?

361
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,230
He's making my heart flutter too.

362
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,250
Hey. What's up?

363
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,250
Thank you for what you did earlier.

364
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,390
Then let me ask you something.

365
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,970
You said before that you had a crush
on someone. Who is it?

366
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,740
Don't ask me.

367
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,810
I already did.

368
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:18,640
Come on and tell me. I got you
out of the free hugs campaign.

372

because I got my energy stolen?

384

If you don't want to give us
your phone number,

644
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:46,080
I don't mind hanging out together
for just today.

645
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,340
Guys.

646
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:51,500
Be objective, okay?

647
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:54,050
Can't you see I'm way out of your league?

648
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,810
What a disrespectful wench.

649
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:03,240
Hey.

650
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,530
I'm not done yet.

651
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:07,910
Let go.

652
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,210
-"Let go."
-You let go.

653
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:13,800
-Let go.
-You let go.

654
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:14,990
Hey.

655
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,100
She said, let go.

656
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,690
What in the...

657
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,670
Hey, you think
this is a movie or something?

658
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:22,740
Who do you think you are...

659
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:36,900
Let's go, Hye-sun.

660
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:43,420
Hye-sun, if something like this
happens again, call me.

661
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,890
I did judo in high school,
so I'll be pretty useful.

662
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:49,270
Okay.

663
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,790
Let's go. I was looking for you
so we can go to the after party together.

664
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,640
To Seogwa!

665
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:06,160
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

666
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,360
Seon-woo made
a huge contribution this time.

667
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,330
-How much did you earn?
-Tell me about it.

668
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:15,010
I heard you broke the record.

669
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,870
Seon-woo, if you don't get a job,
please come to the festival every year.

670
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:19,450
-We will double your pay.
-Or triple.

671
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,300
Thanks for the curse.

672
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,460
Did Dam come, by the way?

673
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:29,970
That's a random question.
What's the deal between you two?

674
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,810
Hey, you're not a good match.

675
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:33,750
So did she come or not?

676
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,820
Hey, you're here.

677
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:37,400
-Come on in.
-Hi.

678
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:52,850
-One soju and two beers, please.
-Okay.

679
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,420
I thought you preferred pork belly.

680
00:52:58,130 --> 00:52:59,930
I like all meat equally.

681
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,140
Don't drink too much.

682
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:07,500
Are you two really going out?

683
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,160
I have a boyfriend.

684
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,360
-What?
-What?

685
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:18,150
You have a boyfriend?
Since when? Who is he?

686
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,950
Where did you meet him?
Is he a student here?

687
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,010
Why haven't you told us?

688
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:23,380
I'm saying it now.

689
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:25,670
I'm seeing someone.

690
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,690
I'll introduce him to you one day.

691
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:30,330
Right now, the situation isn't so good.

692
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:32,450
What do you mean by,
the situation isn't good?

693
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:34,780
How could you have a boyfriend?
You weren't dating anyone.

694
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:37,460
Who is it? Chan-wook? Seong-woo? Gi-yong?

695
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:39,660
Come on and tell me.
You're really upsetting me.

696
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,160
-Tell me...
-Gosh!

697
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:42,610
Just eat the meat.

698
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:44,500
Give me some water.

699
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:03,160
Seon-woo is drinking so much today.

700
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:05,580
I haven't seen him so down.

701
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:10,640
But he looks even more handsome.

702
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,540
-Hey.
-Where are you going?

703
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,920
-Don't go.
-Where are you going?

704
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,540
What time is it now?

705
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,060
So tell me. How did you meet him?

706
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:03,170
I want the whole story.
Do you have a photo of him?

707
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,930
Come on. I said I should go home.

708
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:07,400
No, I want to drink more.

709
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:10,080
If you're busy, just go.

710
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:12,370
I will take him home today.

711
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,570
Are you sure? He's horrible with alcohol.

712
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,870
I know he is.

713
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:21,480
I owe him a bit,

714
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,510
so I'll take care of him today.

715
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,590
Then please take care of him.
Thanks, Hye-sun.

716
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:32,120
What a disloyal friend she is.

717
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,260
Seriously, Hye-sun. Can you believe it?

718
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:38,280
How could she have secrets from us?

719
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:40,660
We are not just anybody, are we?

720
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:44,710
This is why they say
the axe you trust stabs you in the back.

721
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:50,030
"The axe you trust stabs you in the back"?

722
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:53,510
Well, it doesn't mean

723
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,050
you actually get stabbed by an axe.

724
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:59,140
I know. It means you get betrayed
by someone you trusted.

725
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,790
It was written in the second chapter
of the book you got me.

726
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:05,740
You read the book?

727
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:08,470
I'm so proud of you, Hye-sun.

728
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,370
Well done.

729
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:16,030
Well done.

730
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,500
Well done.

731
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:20,390
What are you doing?

732
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:23,430
You're still wet behind the ears.

733
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,690
I'll keep drinking then.

734
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:39,660
Dam.

735
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,670
Are you going home? I'll take you home.

736
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:53,920
You're not taking me anywhere.
You're almost crawling.

737
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:18,380
You drove here, right?
Do you want me to call you a chauffeur?

738
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,190
No.

739
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,610
I'll walk home.

740
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:26,480
You can't walk to Seocho-dong.

741
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,140
You remember where I live.

742
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:37,350
You're drunk. You should go inside,

743
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:38,800
sober up, and...

744
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,520
It's a free hug. It's free for you.

745
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:33,800
[We appreciate Go Kyung-pyo and
Lee Kyu-sung for the guest appearances.]

746
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:06,000
[My Roommate is a Gumiho]

747
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:08,290
[Can I come to your place?
It's been a while.]

748
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:10,580
[Don't worry about touching.]

749
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:12,780
[I'm just worried
I might take your energy...]

750
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:15,900
[When I woke up,
I was half-naked in a hotel.]

751
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:16,960
Are you crazy?

752
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:19,470
[To get close to you, Miss Dam,]

753
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,320
I have to think through a lot of things.

754
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,080
[But it seemed too easy for him.]

755
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,890
[When the red thread of fate
ties two people together,]

756
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,840
[they end up growing feelings
for each other.]

757
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,950
[Don't make me jealous.]

758
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,370
[My boyfriend, whom I really like a lot.]

759
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:35,040
Dam!
