-Hello.
-Hello.

62
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,620
Our theme for this project is

63
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,390
the history behind history.

64
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,780
I'd like it to be centered around
the behind stories of our history.

65
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,340
Of course, there will be difficulty
in providing historical evidence,

66
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,860
but I think it might be all right
if we do thorough research.

67
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,820
For example, during the Joseon era,

68
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:49,650
commoners couldn't accuse the noblemen
no matter how unfair anything was.

69
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,409
I heard they could only use sinmungo

70
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,080
or run over to the King

71
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,500
whenever he was in their town
in a procession.

72
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,090
That wasn't the case.

73
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,830
Everyone could file a lawsuit
regardless of their social class.

74
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,420
They could also appeal their cases,
and there was a system

75
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,450
to avoid corruption of the lawsuit.

76
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,780
While I was a local governor
over Pyeongan Province,

77
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,860
I once took a case of this farmer...

78
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,660
Wow.

79
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,450
Some might hear that and think
you actually did it yourself.

80
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,170
I knew it. You write everything
as if you went through it yourself.

81
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,590
That's why your works are so captivating.

82
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,270

Next time, next time.

95
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,970
So when exactly is this "next time"?

96
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,680
Wait, Mr. Shin. Mr. Shin!

97

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,710
-I'm sorry.
-Wait!

101
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,690
I mean, do I make you feel
that uncomfortable?

102
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,850
It has been a while
since we worked together,

103
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:40,750
so I thought it'd be great
if we could get a little closer.

104
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,400
It looked like
you didn't have any close acquaintances.

105
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,700

heard from her since the liberation...

110
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,500
In that case,
could you give me just one answer?

111
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,560
Why won't you let anyone
get involved in your life?

112
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,720
You don't make friends or girlfriends.

113
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,810
Do you have a bad history of dating?

114
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,590
Or is there someone you can't forget?

115
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,610
Your Highness, why do you shed a teardrop?

116
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,680
Because of that being that shows up again
as soon as it became history to me.

161
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,230
Man! I have a phone English class
with Ryan at 10 p.m.

162
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,290
I have to go.

163
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,490
No! You can't go.

164
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,460
I'm going to disinfect my broken heart
with alcohol through the night.

165
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,810
That's bitter.

166
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,280
It hurts. It hurts right here.

167
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,480
It hurts.

168
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,040
-Gosh. Why...
-This isn't going to work. You should go.

169
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,680
He's completely wasted.

170
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,260
Can you deal with him?

171
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,770
This isn't the first time.
Don't worry about us and go.

172
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,720
Said I, an hour ago,

173
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,180
and I deserve to be punished.

174
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,640
Darn it. Hey!

175
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,410
How can you drink so much
that you're unable to walk?

176
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,340
Where's your conscience, you jerk?

177
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,380
I'm not missing just my conscience,
I got no girlfriend either.

178
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,670
Hey, wait. You need to walk. Try walking.

179
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,350
This isn't going to work.
Prop yourself up.

180
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,290
Come on, please.

181
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,920
Should I just leave him here?

182
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,090
What? Did you sober up a little?

183
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,290
That crazy idiot. Hey, wait for me!

184
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,780
Jin-ah! I really loved you!

185
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,100
That son of a gun.

186
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,460
I'll kill you once I catch you.

187
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,000
Jin-ah!

188
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,580
♫ Sleep tight, my baby ♫

189
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:02,080
♫ Sleep tight, my baby ♫

190
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,180
By any chance, is this car yours?

191
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,730
[Is he a human or a signboard?]

192
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,470
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

193
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,270
♫ My baby ♫

194
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,570
Have you gone insane?
Get down here. Hey, get down!

195
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,890
Get down here.

196
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,840
-You've gone insane!
-Let go.

197
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,340
Let go of what?

198
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,880
Your life? Your future?

199
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,570
Hey, no. You can't do that. Please stop.
This really isn't a good idea.

200
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,690
-Please, stop.
-Your friend must be drunk.

201
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,600
Yes, right.
He had a little too much to drink.

202
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,950
I'll give you my phone number.
We'll reimburse the damage...

203
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,180
Are you a student?

204
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,160
Yes, I'm in college.

205
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,790
Forget it, then.

206
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,630
It's not badly damaged.

207
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,270
But still, he caused you a nuisance, so...

208
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,080
It's all right, so you can go.

209
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,790
He's an angel.

210
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,300
-What?
-What?

211
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,340
No, nothing.

212
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,950
Then thank you so much. I'm so sorry.

213
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,090
What are you sorry for?

214
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,410
How much do I owe him anyway?

215
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,740
We won't have enough
even if we sold off our organs,

216
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,930
so shut your mouth.

217
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,270
We'll get going, then. Say you're sorry!

218
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,300
-I'm sorry.
-We're sorry.

219
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,290
Come here. One second.
Please try to stand just this once.

220
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,610
Hey, wait!

221
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,370
Gosh, my head hurts.

222
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,870
When did I get home last night?

223
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,280
I need to drink some water first.

224
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,750
-You're up.
-Gosh, who are you?

225
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,020
Aren't you the owner of that red car?

226
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,960
I'm glad you remember.

227
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,000
Oh, and this is

228
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,030
my home.

229
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,020
Why am I here?

230
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:07,619
You wouldn't wake up,
so I had to bring you here.

231
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,740
And I have to get something back
from you too.

232
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,770
Get something back from me?

233
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:15,190
You swallowed my Marble last night.

234
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,490
A very important Marble
I carried with me for nearly 1,000 years

235
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,250
to become a human.

236
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,109
To become a human? What do you mean?

237
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,810
Right, I haven't introduced myself yet.

238
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,480
I am

239
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,810
a gumiho.

240
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,580
[He's a lunatic.]

241
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,840
I see.

242
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,190
You don't believe me.

243
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,440
No, I do.

244
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,460
So you're a gumiho,

245
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,760
and I swallowed a Fox Marble last night.

246
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,530
Then what should I do?
Should I wash out my stomach?

247
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,030
It's not in your stomach.

248
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:07,680
It already placed itself in your body.

249
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,880
Then what should we do?

250
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,650
I'll have to find a way.

251
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,410
Wait, where's my phone?

252
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,490
This means we're on the same boat now.

253
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,450
We have a common purpose,
taking out that Marble.

254
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,840
Therefore, let's cohabitate

255
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,420
for a while.

256
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,940
Sorry? Wait.

257
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,330
You want me to move in here with you?

258
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,060
I understand how you're flustered.

259
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,990
But we're strangers,

260
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,150
and that Marble is very dear to me.

261
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,550
Don't you think I'd only be rest assured
to always have you before me?

262
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,970
I can't believe this guy.

263
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,390
I was sorry my friend damaged your car

264
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,600
and thankful for not leaving me out there,
so I was going to let you run with it.

265
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,860
But what? A gumiho? Cohabitate?

266
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,840
Stop talking nonsense.

267
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,350
See? You don't believe me.

268
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,130
But yes, it'll be easier to understand
once you see it for yourself.

269
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,870
Try not to pass out.

270
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,430
Gosh, my head hurts.

271
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,910
When did I get home last night?

272
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,650
What kind of a dream was that?

273
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,010
Did you sleep well?

274
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,920
You seemed to be very shocked.

275
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,750
I'll get you a cup of tea
that'll help you calm down.

276
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,490
Are you okay with some lotus tea?

277
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,740
I think he came after me.

278
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,820
Mom...

279
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,250
Oh no, what am I going to do?

280
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,790
Dam! Open the door!

281
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,550
What? It's Dan.

282
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,270
-Dan!
-Open the door already.

283
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,740
Dan!

284
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,820
-Dan...
-Move out of my way.

285
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,310
Why did you chain the door?

286
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,950
What's wrong?

287
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,150
Wait.

288
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,580
-Are you hungry?
-What?

289
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,250
I knew you were a little too fast.

290
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,190
-No, I...
-You did your best to eat dinner.

291
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,900
-No, that's not...
-Why haven't you eaten

292
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,710
if you stayed out all night?

293
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,640
-You're so annoying.
-Wait.

294
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,560
Hey, wait for me!

295
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,250
[What am I going to do?
I think he's a real gumiho.]

296
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,530
[What am I going to do now?]

297
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,620
[I'd better stay away
from telling him, right?]

298
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,240
[If I do, I might also put him in danger.]

299
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,700
My gosh.
Why do you keep following me around?

300
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,550
Well.

301
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,060
I can't tell you the reason,
but I'm too scared to be alone.

302
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,050
You frighten me even more.
Go and take a seat.

303
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,800
My gosh!

304
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,870
What's with you today?

305
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,370
Dan.

306
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,330
The fact that you're an archer,
that you're good at shooting arrows,

307
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,110
-might all be fate.
-What are you talking about?

308
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,750
I really didn't want to tell you,

309
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,730
but I can't find a way around this.

310
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,160
I'm sorry to ask, but please help me.

311
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,320
What is it?

312
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,210
I met

313
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,290
a gumiho.

314
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,030
-What?
-He hasn't done anything yet,

315
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,790
but he might come for me soon.

316
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,080
When he does, can you shoot him?

317
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,290
People shoot arrows on fire
in historical dramas, right?

318
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,790
Is that possible...

319
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,400
No, not me. The gumiho.

320
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,460
My foot.
Did you catch yourself in the mirror?

321
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,000
Get out of my room.

322
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:49,170
-Please hear me...
-Three. Two.

323
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,670
Fine.

324
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:58,410
[Live your life on your own!]

325
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,960
Figures. No one would believe that.

326
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,780
Anyway, why is that gumiho so quiet?

327
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,580
He's making me more nervous.

328
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,720
[The world is so peaceful.]

329
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,490
[But I actually met a gumiho?]

330
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,230
[Maybe it was just a nightmare.]

331
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,830
[This stop is Terminal.]

332
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,990
[Next stop is...]

333
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,490
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

334
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,360
[What is this?]

335
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,880
[Do I have to take a dump?]

336
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,530
[No, this isn't what that feels like.]

337
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,830
Goodness, are you all right?

338
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,940
It's nothing.

339
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:17,260
Mr. Driver, one second!
Could you all make way?

340
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,590
This woman has to get to a restroom!

341
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,540
-No, wait.
-Please make way.

342
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,630
No, that's not what...

343
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,830
-Thank you, though.
-It's okay. Don't be flustered.

344
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,770
Thank you.

345
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,840
Hey, Dam. What's going on?

346
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,250
I have a stomachache.

347
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,890
It's not period cramps or number two,

348
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,000
but it hurts ten times as much.

349
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:49,730
Hey, you should've seen a doctor first.

350
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,800
I wanted to come and do my attendance.

351
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,910
Why does this hurt so much?

352
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,300
It's not like I ate anything special...

353
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,890
Dam, have you been well?

354
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,140
I'm on a break.

355
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,110
Hey, Dam!

356
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,140
Dam, are you okay?

357
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,300
That wasn't very strong.

358
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,820
Hey, Dam. Hey, wake up.

359
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:30,520
Hey, Dam. Stay with me. Dam!

360
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,880
Yes, this is he.

361
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,920
May I ask who's calling?

362
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,320
So this woman used her purse
to hit you on the back of your head?

363
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,600
I'm telling you.

364
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,330
Is she allowed to do this
to an innocent bystander?

365
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,040
An innocent bystander?

366
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,060
You leered at me up and down,
then sexually harassed me saying,

367
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,730
"You probably had done it a lot,"

368
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,590
"and that's not all,
I'd like to get it on with you."

369
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,410
"I keep thinking about you."
Yet you're innocent?

370
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,650
When did I say that?

371
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,250
And do you have any evidence
that I leered at you?

372
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,760
Were my eyes caught on the CCTV footage?

373
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,450
But you hitting me on the head?
It was clearly seen there.

374
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,960
The law in our country
loves to work with evidence, you know.

375
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,390
Is that the law in our country?

376
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,460
Yes, so you better be ready.

377
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:38,500
No matter how much you beg,
I won't drop your charges.

378
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,370
The least you can do is
grab my pants and beg me to settle.

379
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,430
What are you doing?

380
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,230
You told me to grab your pants to settle.

381
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,170
-Let me go.
-This is unfair,

382
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,670
but I thought it'd be better
to settle this case.

383
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,920
Let me go. What are you doing? Hey!

384
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,030
How much longer do I have to go on
for you to settle?

385
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,700
Let's talk after you let go of him.

386
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,410
You're here.

387
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,860
Have you been well?

388
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:17,040
It's our first time
since the liberation, so 75 years?

389
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,990
Did you ever wonder how my life was going?

390
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,930
We never checked on each other.

391
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,790
[Civil Services Center]

392
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,750
Why did you call me?

393
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,010
You always have that face.

394
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,790
Can you use your magic
to erase their memories?

395
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,170
You can do that yourself.

396
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,760
I can't use magic anymore.

397
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,610
Why not?

398
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,810
You're right.

399
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,160
I've become a human

400
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,520
four years ago.

401
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,670
Why are you leaving?

402
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,620
I wanted to thank you and buy you a meal.

403
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,430
People always buy a meal
when they're grateful.

404
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,800
Forget it.

405
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,170
Oh, right.

406
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,150
Human energy is

407
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,310
what fills up a fox, not food.

408
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:15,070
Sadly, that's not something I can give.

409
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,710
So stay for a chat, will you?

410
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:24,270
We've been friends for 700 years.
We can't leave like this.

411
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,580
I should stop eating.

412
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,260
Back when I was a gumiho, I never got fat.

413
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,940
But now, my body fat explodes
whenever I eat too much.

414
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,260
That's not all.

415
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,260
Back when I was a gumiho,
my skin was always flawless.

416
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,620
But I have to eat antioxidants

417
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,000
and put on eye cream to maintain my look.

418
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,680
I'm sorry. You probably don't understand.

419
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,130
If you lived for this long,
you should've learned by now.

420
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,280
But you still cross over the line.

421
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,040
What? A line?

422
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,380
Which line did I cross?

423
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,690
I don't mean that there's an actual line.

424
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,500
It's a figure of speech
which humans use often.

425
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,650
I see. Is that so?

426
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:33,000
That figure of speech or something?
It's tough for me to grasp.

427
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,520
And you're still very dumb.

428
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,330
It took you 80 years
to learn 1,000 Chinese characters.

429
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:43,470
Fine, good for you
that you studied in Seonggyungwan.

430
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,920
But you know what?

431
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:48,920
I became a human first
before a smart guy like you did.

432
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:55,880
Why haven't you become a human yet?

433
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,370
It looks like

434
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,670
you gave up on gathering human energy.

435
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:07,270
Wait, I hope you aren't still picky,

436
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,720
just as you were back then.

437
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,230
You again?

438
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,170
You again?

439
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,070
"Once you fall for her, you lose
everything starting with your liver,"

440
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,760
"then meet your demise
after your energy is all drained."

441
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,350
That rumor is all over the city.

442
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,300
I'm too beautiful
for people to not hear about me.

443
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,870
There's no need to run them dry
to the point of their death.

444
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,230
Mind your own business.

445
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,440
Stop looking displeased before women.
They can turn you down any minute.

446
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,420
Humans are very sensitive.

447
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,550
Then I will look for another prey.

448
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,170
If it doesn't move my heart,
whatever I take

449
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,150
just disgusts me.

450
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,430
What's your plan?

451
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,720
What are you waiting for?

452
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,830
Say something.

453
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,770
I'm 200 years younger than you,
and I managed to turn into a human first.

454
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,010
Don't you have any questions?

455
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,240
"How did you become a human?"

456
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,260
"Did you change while sleeping or eating?"

457
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,550
"How blue was the Marble?"

458
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,670
"Was it deep blue or light blue?
Or was it a blue gradient?

459
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,930
"Please tell me."
Go down on your knees

460
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,220
and ask me.

461
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,020
You're very boisterous.

462
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,930
"Boisterous"?

463
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,890
Back in Goryeo and Joseon,
I lived in their capital cities,

464
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:38,260
and even now, I'm a citizen of Seoul,
the capital of Korea.

465
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,290
I only live in the capital cities.

466
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,000
You remember

467
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,770
all the hair sticks and accessories I wore
went out of stock.

468
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,020
Even now in Seoul,

469
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:51,330
I haven't seen anyone
who is more fashionable than me.

470
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,600
Wait. Was that an idiom as well?

471
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,930
Don't act like idioms are
the only thing you don't know.

472
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,710
You're wholly and largely ignorant.

473
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:05,890
What?

474
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,610
Why don't we finish
this conversation here?

475
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,460
I'll be having a visitor soon.

476
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,820
A visitor? Who?

477
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:15,000
So what does "boisterous" mean?

478
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,540
Hey.

479
00:34:55,699 --> 00:35:00,010
It's the Marble
the reason why I'm sick, right?

480
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,550
To be precise,

481
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,240
it's because you met
a man born in the Year of the Tiger.

482
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,390
A man born in the Year of the Tiger?

483
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,440
Tigers are foxes' natural enemies,
so we are vulnerable to their energy.

484
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,330
And it's worse for me

485
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,720
as I was born in the cursed year
and became the only male gumiho.

486
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,030
[Men born in the Year of the Tiger are
full of yang,]

487
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,750
[so they're my worst enemies.]

488
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,300
[And because you have my Marble,]

489
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,860
[you feel pain
when you meet a man born in that year.]

490
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,680
Does that mean I'll be sick

491
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,840
until the Marble is removed from me?

492
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,140
-What are you doing...
-Only my touch

493
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,210
can kill the pain.

494
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,360
That's ridiculous...

495
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,210
That's why I asked you to stay with me.

496
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,860
I thought you could use my company.

497
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,300
Why do I have so many things to pack?

498
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:01,320
So you're going to be preparing
for a contest,

499
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,640
crashing at your friend's place?

500
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,450
Yes. If we win the prize,
it will help us get a job.

501
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,040
What contest is it?

502
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,720
It's about a historical
and cultural context.

503
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,570
You don't know what it is.

504
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:13,150
I can look it up.

505
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,010
It's not official yet.

506
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,290
I think.

507
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,270
Right. My sleep mask.

508
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,940
Did you tell Mom about it?

509
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,580
Why don't you call her?
It must be morning in the US now.

510
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:26,570
Don't you know our family motto?

511
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,040
[Live your life on your own!]

512
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:32,690
I can't bother her
with such trivial matters. She's busy.

513
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,630
Gosh, stop bothering me and go away.

514
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,870
Stay away from
a grown-up's business, teenager.

515
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,590
Fine...

516
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,800
would've been my answer
if you weren't so suspicious.

517
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,220
No, I'm not.

518
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,100
Your eyes.
Why do you roll your eyes like that?

519
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,170
Since when were you so serious
about getting a job?

520
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,630
I mean, you're packing your back
in the middle of the night.

521
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,170
Wait.

522
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,990
Are you seeing a guy?

523
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,350
Are you moving in with him?

524
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,110
What are you saying? Where did you get

525
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,300
such a naughty idea?

526
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,540
Right. I guess it's nonsense.

527
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,170
Actually, I trust in

528
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,300
us men's tastes.

529
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,290
Stop messing with me.

530
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,880
I already feel bad leaving you here alone.

531
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,080
Are you sure you're going to be okay?

532
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,710
Of course. I'm not a kid.

533
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,960
I'm barely at home anyway,
because of the training.

534
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,980
Still.

535
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:26,370
It makes me feel bad to leave you
here alone, in this empty house.

536
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,740
But I want you to know

537
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,220
that you're one of the biggest reasons
why I decided to do this.

538
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,070
Because I love you.

539
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,750
I'm leaving you because I care about you.

540
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,450
You lost your mind.

541
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,470
Get back to packing.

542
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,640
I said I'm okay.

543
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,660
I was going to work out anyway.

544
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,970
Good luck. Don't fight with your friend.

545
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,380
And go easy on the drinks.

546
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:03,330
Okay. I'll hang in there

547
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,840
and try to come back alive.

548
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,950
"Come back alive"?

549
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,960
-From the battlefield called job hunting.
-You're silly.

550
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,290
There's the taxi.

551
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:21,410
Hey, make sure to call me every two days.

552
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,950
If I don't answer, call the police.

553
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,320
Police?

554
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,040
I mean, it will be just girls there,
so I'm a little worried.

555
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,410
What's there to be worried about?

556
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,170
Your face will protect you.

557
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,250
Why don't you get
something for self-defense then?

558
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,400
-Self-defense?
-Yes.

559
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,240
-Hi.
-Welcome.

560
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,490
By any chance,

561
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:44,990
do you have any electroshock weapons here?

562
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,580
Of course, we do.

563
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,390
120,000 won.

564
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,940
What? That's expensive.

565
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,590
This should be enough, right?

566
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,030
Of course. You can overpower
any regular person with this.

567
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,800
But he's not regular nor a person.

568
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,470
If you feel so insecure,

569
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,760
you can buy this too.

570

With this, you will be 100 percent safe.

571

Once it's sprayed on your face,
it will burn for up to six hours.

572
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,650
It's 70,000 won.

-I'll get this one only.
-Sure. Suit yourself.

Organs?

586
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,430
There must have been a motive.

587
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,150
It could have been a heart or a liver.

588

-Trimming the trees?
-Yes.

[Aren't you going to school, Miss Dam?]

645

[Miss Dam?]

646
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:23,230
I'm not nocturnal like you.
Why would I go to school at night...

647
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:31,590
What? When did I fall asleep?

648
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:06,790
[Get ahold of yourself, Dam.]

disguised as a good-looking man.]

651
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,090
Did you sleep well?

652
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,160
Yes, kind of.

653
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:22,590
You don't seem like you did though.

654
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:24,390
Why don't you have
some warm goji berry tea?

655
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:28,390
Goji berries protect your liver
and help you beat fatigue.

656
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,030
[What? Why would he worry about my liver?]

657
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,880
[What does he want to do with my liver?]

658

[-That sly fox.]
-Right.

659
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:38,730
I don't know what you like yet,

[That sly fox.]

661
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:45,600

That generous fox.

665
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,490
Why would you? You don't need to do that.

666
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:01,530
Well, you will have to live
with some inconvenience here,

667
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:03,150
and I feel bad about it.

668
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,530
I thought I could pay your tuition
to compensate for it

669
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,640
since you're a student.

670
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:10,630
It's okay though.

671
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:14,150
Do you want me to text the bill to you?

[Cash Deposit]

673
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:31,090
This covers both my tuition
for the next semester and Dan's lessons!

674
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:38,270
Are you happy?

675
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:41,430
How could you laugh in this situation?

676
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,090
-Miss Dam.
-Yes?

677
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:48,210
Do you want to talk to me?

678
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:56,260
Are you going somewhere?

679
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:58,110
I'm attending a book event.

680
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,440
I'm writing a book about humanities.

681
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:03,480
I see. So you have a job.

682
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:07,090
Even legendary animals
can't avoid capitalism.

683
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:10,650
Not quite. Living a long life bores me.

684
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:13,200
-I see.
-Anyway, I'm going to Singapore,

685
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:14,920
and I'll be away for a few days.

686
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,240
Okay.

687
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,480
Really?

688
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,430
You look so happy.

689
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,410
You must've been
really uncomfortable around me.

690
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,360
That's not true. I wasn't.
I'm not happy at all.

I'll see you later then.

00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,480
It's shapeshifting.

694
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:44,040
I don't want to make myself known
too widely but,

695
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:46,160
I heard reporters might come.

696
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,490
Until I meet the staff
from the publishing company,

697
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,680
I want to look like this.

I see. You have so many talents.

Hey, Dam!

708
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:26,550
You scared me.

709
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:29,100
Why do you look so down?
Are you still sick?

710
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:30,420
No, I'm fine now.

711
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:33,100
That's great.
You're coming with us to the club then.

712
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,860
-Let's go.
-The club?

713
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:36,670
We're throwing a farewell party for Ji-eun

00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,300
because she's going to go study abroad.

715
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,530
Right.

716
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,990
I've been so busy these days
I forgot about it.

717
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,250
But I can't be in a crowded place.

718
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:48,240
I can't either.
I'm taking an English exam this weekend.

719
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:51,450
Still. We are not freshmen anymore
who live like there's no tomorrow.

720
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,300
We've reached the age
where we need to worry

721
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:55,100
about tomorrow's shame
and frozen shoulders.

722
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:58,400
For sure.

723
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:00,780

-You're coming.
-You're coming.

725

-You're coming with us.
-You have to.

726
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,400
-You're coming.
-Let's go.

727
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:08,260
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

728
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:11,160
Fine. Are we going now?

729
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:12,480
With that on?

730
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,130
-You've got no mercy.
-You've got no conscience.

731
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,510
Okay. Let's go.

732
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:21,110
It's so crowded here.

733
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:22,690
Look at all the people.

734
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,770
Gosh, I'm so excited!

735
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:36,510
-Oh, my gosh. What happened?
-What happened?

736
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:38,050
You look so gorgeous!

737
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:40,160
Where did you get those newest items?

738
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:42,450
Dam's mother is a fashion magazine editor.

739
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:45,390
She's in the US, and she sends
her the clothes she used for photoshoots.

740
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,760
Which is why she was once called

741
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,740

00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:50,060
alcoholic.

743
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,830
I haven't put on high heels in a while,
and my legs hurt.

744
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,060
Let's go sit inside.

745
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:56,920
Sit? You're not sitting anywhere.

746
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:58,810
You're not sitting tonight.

747
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:00,490
Let's go!

748
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,690
Is this a club
or a subway in the rush hours?

749
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:17,030
Hey, Dam! I'll go get some vodka.

750
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,750
Hey, wait up!

751
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,340
How old are you?

752
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:23,940
Why do you talk down to me?
Do you know me?

753
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,060
Why did you touch my body
without asking me?

754
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:30,800
Do you want to go to the police station
with me and talk it out?

755
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:33,930
I apologize.

756
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:40,920
-Here.
-Thank...

757
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:42,680
I like your style.

758
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:47,830
Don't take it so seriously.
I'm just messing with you.

759
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:52,320
Do you want to have a drink with me?

Move.

Mr. Shin, you did a great job today.

766
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:21,270
How about a glass of whiskey
in the lounge?

767
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,530

Let me take you

775
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,030
Is that okay with you?

00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,480
[Please.]

Who are you?

783

I'm her friend. I'll take her from here.

784
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:11,000
How can I believe
if you're her friend or not?

785
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,580
Why do you have my friend's phone?

-Because she's my friend.
-Do you know her name?

791
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,960
Do you want me to get you something warm?

792
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:21,180
If I order a cake, will you eat it?

793
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,540
I'd like a tiramisu.

794
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:46,480
I want you to rather scold me

795
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,740
for going to a club

796

It's okay.

The Marble is fine, and so are you.

802

But from now on,
I want you to avoid places like that,

for your sake.

804
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,010
-Okay. From now on...
-And don't be scared.

805
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,110
What?

806
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,040
I know you're scared of me.

807
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,300
You're worried
I might harm or threaten you.

808
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:28,410
I can see that.

809
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,830
-Well...
-I understand.

810
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,530
Who wouldn't be scared of a gumiho?

811
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:38,840
But you're not just anyone.

812
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,260
You have my Marble,

813
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:44,380
and you need to be safe
to keep my Marble safe.

814
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:48,780
So I need to protect you at all costs.

815
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:52,880
So why don't you try
to be less scared of me?

816
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,250
It makes me feel bad

817
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:57,500
to see you being on pins and needles.

818
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:01,630
I'm sorry I've concerned you.

819
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:04,930
From now on, I'll try
not to be scared of you

820
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:07,750
and not to repeat the same mistake.

821
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:10,390
-Promise me.
-I promise.

822
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:24,250
You have to keep your word.

823
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,590
I will.

824
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:46,510
-Excuse me for a second.
-Sure.

825
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:48,890
Hello?

826
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:51,660
Yes.

827
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:02,090
I thought he was a scary gumiho
from ghost stories,

828
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:05,910
but he might be a nice fox
from fairy tales.

829
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:17,490
Okay. Bye.

830
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:25,270
-Shall we?
-Okay.

831
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:44,280
The Year of the Tiger.

832
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:46,700
I see.

833
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:54,090
By the way, is the Marble

834
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,600
visible only to you?

835
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,710
Yes.

836
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,870
What color is it?

837
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:05,140
-It's red.
-Red. I see.

838
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:08,350
Do you think you can take it out?

839
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:10,860
I will try.

840
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:14,460
A human cannot hold
the Marble for long anyway.

841
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:17,410
How long can a human hold it then?

842
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:21,280
A year, at most.

843
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:23,530
That means after one year of holding it,

844
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:25,680
it will be sorted out somehow.

845
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:40,820
Doesn't it?

846
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,950
Then what happens
if it's not taken out within a year?

847
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,040
You will die.

848
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,500
What?

849
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,880
Miss Dam.

850
01:03:58,070 --> 01:03:59,480
You will die.

851
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:30,230
[We appreciate Kim Eung-soo and
Han Ji-eun for their guest appearances.]

852
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,810
[My Roommate is a Gumiho]

853
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:03,450
[What are you doing out there?]

854
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:06,530
Why did that pop right out?
I didn't even hit you that hard.

855
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:09,390
[Have you thought about
how you will take the Marble out?]

856
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,990
[I can't believe
I used my power like this.]

857
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:13,570
[I wrote up an agreement.]

858
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,680
[No contact
with men born in the Year of the Tiger.]

859
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:14,890
[1. No contact with men
born in the Year of the Tiger]

860
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,590
How would I know
which year they were born in?

861
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:22,550
The legend of the history department
who dated over 20 women, Seon-woo.

862
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:25,850
[The class of 2017,
born in the Year of the Tiger!]

863
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:28,000
[Anyway, does she know
she can end up dead]

864
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,760
[if the Marble keeps taking her energy?]

865
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:31,260
What are you doing here, Miss Dam?

866
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:34,120
Mr. Gumiho, please let me get out of here.
