00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,150
I'm sorry for yesterday.

168
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,500
I usually don't drink that much.

169
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,140
I'm sorry.

170
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,660
Yes, you shouldn't drink too much.

171
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,080
Goodbye.

172
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,360
Bye.

[When the red thread of fate
ties two people together,]

174
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,970
[the two will surely begin
to get attracted to one another.]

175
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,490
Therefore, a man and a woman
tied with that thread

176
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,300
will always end up together
no matter what.

177
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,130
That's the red thread I know about.

178
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,290
So? What about it?

179
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,270
Well, I just got curious.

180
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,860
Is there a way to break it off?

181
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,040
No, there aren't many people
who can go against their fate.

182
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,400
This is really suspicious.

183
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,480
You never cared about this.
Why do you ask?

184
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,690
Dam and Seon-woo are

185
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,770
tied up by a red thread.

186
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,280
What? Why?

187
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,290
Wait, was it the old man?

188
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,210
I mean, of course.

189
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,810
I get it's frustrating to see you
not doing anything before your time is up.

190
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,160
But you said you'll deal with it.
Why does he take things this far?

191
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,790
Has he really gone senile?

192
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,020
You poor thing.

193
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,810
The Marble just teases you
by changing colors once every blue moon.

194
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,680
You were about to be happy
with your first girlfriend in centuries,

195
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,790
but you got hungry
and become a threat to her.

196
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,080
But now your girlfriend is
tied by a red thread

197
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,930
to another man?

198
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,380
It's the worst.

199
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,250
Was I too detailed about my concerns?

200
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,810
Detailed?

201
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,870
Do you know how to spell it?

202
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,450
Why are you bringing that up?

203
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,970
Am I not allowed to be worried
if I can't spell that?

204
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,369
You've been fine for a while,
but you're getting arrogant again.

205
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,410
This is why the mountain spirit
punished you with the red thread.

206
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,220
Punishment? Hardly.

207
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,819
That thread is nothing.

208
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,000
Hey, Miss Dam.

209
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,550
Is everything all right with your brother?

210
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,650
We're each going to pay for the damage.

211

[So I'm looking for a new part-time job.]

212
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,750
Dan will need at least a million won

213
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,770

214
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,610
Let me know if you need my help.

215
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,980
[It's all right.]

216
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,540
It would've been horrible
if she was stubborn,

217
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,530
but it was someone I knew,
so things went well.

218
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,650
Someone you know?

219
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,440
The scooter belonged to Seon-woo's sister.

220
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,080
[He suddenly showed up as her guardian.]

221

Yes, I'm listening.

224

Then I'll call you
after I finish my report.

225
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,180
-See you later, Dad.
-Wait, Seon-woo.

226
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,610
You already maxed out
your credit card limit.

227
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,340
-Yesterday, Seo-woo...
-Give it back.

228
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,640
-What?
-If you need money, sell your car,

230
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,290
Leave the credit card here.

231
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,680
[This is shocking.]

232
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,230
You're dating someone.

233
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:54,980
And why am I hearing this news
on my best friend from someone else?

234
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,480
You broke my heart.

235
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,920
Soo-kyung, I'll tell you everything
once I figure out everything.

236
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,860
I just started seeing him, and...

237
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,060
Why? Is this a short fling?

238
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,120
So it's not very serious?

239
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,530
That's not the case.

240
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,810
No.

241
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,500
It's not the case.
This can't be happening.

242
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,980
My friends.

243
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,970
Could you sleep with someone
you don't even like?

244
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,300
What? What have you done?

245
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,680
What are you talking about?

246
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,060
When I woke up,

247
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,900
I was in a hotel without my shirt...

248
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,440
-You dog.
-You jerk.

249
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,250
What's with you? Have you gone insane?

250
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,740
You're crazy!

251
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,140
All right.
I'd rather feel pain in my body.

252
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,360
I feel so uneasy at heart.

253
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,030
What am I going to do?

254
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,700
So who's the girl?

255
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,900
Well, that's none of our business.
What did she say?

256
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,150
Nothing.

257
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,790
And it's not like she's avoiding me.

258
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,940
She acts as if nothing has happened.

259
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,000
That means she doesn't have
any intention of talking it out.

260
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,110
If you two didn't have any feelings,

261
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,500
just let it go as a mistake.

262
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,950
What else can you do?

263
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,080
I don't think I can do that.

Why do you bother staying alive? Why?

272

Oh, I got 1 point deducted, so 29.

278

I thought I'd get perfect scores
on all subjects, but I lost one point.

Gosh, maybe Seok will become

And by my standard, it wasn't that bad.

330
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,010
Really? I wasn't that bad?

331
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,790

[Hey, so one couple
really started dating?]

[Yes, Bo-rim and Jae-Hyun.]

339
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,550
[I'm jealous. If you start dating,]

340

[you get an A plus

341

Jae-jin, what are they saying?

[If you start dating, you get an A plus
even if you bomb the finals.]

343
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,050
Oh, the lecture itself is

344
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,780
about the understanding
of communication between people.

345
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,510
So if two people begin to date
by understanding each other

346
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,530
through this project,

347
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,110
he always gives an A plus.

348
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,530
-Then let's start dating.
-Okay, let's...

349
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,870
-What?
-You said you'll take responsibility.

350
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,910
-Of course.
-Then we're dating, okay?

351
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,770
Let's say you asked me out first. Okay?

352
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,900
Oh, okay.

353
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,540
-Come here.
-What?

354
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,810
Come.

355
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,660
One, two, three.

356
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,120
What's this picture?
Are Jae-jin and Hye-sun dating?

357
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,580
What? Jae-jin?

358
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,790
No way. Wouldn't you say I'm better?

359
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,530
No way.
Sir, Jae-jin and Hye-sun are dating.

360
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,070
What?

361
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:18,800
Jae-jin claims they're only pretending
to date for grades.

362
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,750
But he's not the type
who worries about grades.

363
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,310
Is Hye-sun the type who loves to study?

364
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,260
No way.

365
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,020
Then why?

366
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:33,720
[Wait, did Jae-jin
make that mistake with her?]

[No way.]

368
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,300
What do you mean,
they're pretending to date for grades?

369
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:43,400
We get an A plus if we become a couple
in our Communications lecture.

370
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,830
Is it because I haven't gone on
too many dates with Seon-woo?

371
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,600
The grade for our report
doesn't look too great.

372
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:57,170
Wait, sir.

373
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:04,250
Are you concerned about Seon-woo?

374
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,490
Of course,

375
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:13,490
you wouldn't be happy
after you saw him hug me.

376
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,330
But you seemed down since yesterday.

377
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,220
It's not that I think you're jealous.

378
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,020
But I am jealous.

379
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,220
I have to think about all kinds of things

380
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,340
to get closer to you like this.

381
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,320
But it seemed too easy for him.

382
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,510
So don't get too close to him.

383
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,070
Don't make me jealous.

384
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,830

-Come again.
-Sure.

let me borrow three million won?

390
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:32,510
Three million, my foot.
I'll beat you three million times.

391
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,810
I opened up my restaurants two weeks ago,

392
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,180
but you never visited me once.

393
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:40,700
Then when you actually come,
you come asking me for money?

394
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,260
What can I do?
My dad cut me off his credit card.

395
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,630
No, I can't.

396
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:52,270
Of course, you took after me the most
among all of my nephews,

397
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,910
so it's true that I especially adore you.

398
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:58,870
But I know what my brother-in-law means,
so I can't let you borrow money.

399
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,260
-Gosh, what do I do?
-He's hot.

400
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:05,820
-He's really good-looking.
-He is.

401
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,770
Look at how hot he is.

402
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,070
-What are you doing?
-You needed money.

403
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,450
Things have been hectic since I opened up,

404
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,000
so I was going to hire new part-timers.

405
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:24,170
You need money, I need part-timers.

406

Uncle, you have to hire her.

417
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,420
You can't try to pull strings
the moment you start here.

On top of that, why should I?

-She's pretty.
-What?

Are you sure you can start today?

You said you're in need.

And I'm grateful that
you're willing to hire me.

423

Don't mention it.

Then do you want to begin now?

426
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,780
Of course, I signed
the employment contract.

-Hey.

You two know each other?

430
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,550
Yes, she's a junior at school.

431
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,700
He's my uncle.

432
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,180
You look startled.

433
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,980
You must have thought I was his brother.

Oh. You mean, that I keep you in check?

460
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,810
Of course, I don't mind.

461

I'll just walk you to the station nearby.

490
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,320
Wherever you walk me,
it'll make me uncomfortable anyway.

491
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,620
I just have a lot of things to ask
regarding work.

492
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,210
-Then let's talk about it on the way.
-Okay.

493
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,490
-Hi, Sir.
[-Have you finished work?]

494
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,010
Yes. I was just about to go home.

495
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,720
[Was it all right?]

496
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:19,990
Yes. It wasn't so hard.
My boss seems like a nice person too.

497
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,150
[How about your coworker?]

498
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,150
[I don't want to worry him.]

499
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:28,840
I think everything was fine.

500
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,210
[Are you sure?]

501
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,920
-Yes.
[-Okay.]

502
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,520
[Then have a safe trip back home.]

503
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,010
Thanks.

504
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,780
Was that your boyfriend?

505
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,140
Yes. It's my boyfriend,
whom I really like a lot.

506
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,700
I didn't ask how much you like him.

507
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,510
Surprise!

508
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,110
I couldn't make it last weekend,
so I came today.

509
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,970
I was crushed because I was really looking
forward to our indoor date.

510
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,510
You should have called me.

511
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,010
I did, but you didn't answer.

512
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,110
The battery is dead.

513
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,710
Nothing has changed.

514
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:51,470
The huge TV, the comfortable sofa,

515
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:54,020
and you, a dashing man
standing right there.

516
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,130
I've missed them all.

517
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,730
So...

518
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,880
come here and have a seat.

519
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,770
Come on.

520
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,440
I brought something for us.

521
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,980
Surprise!

522
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,240
[Order here]

523
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,240
Here.

524
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,520
Come on and try.

525
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,280
I don't feel like it.

526
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,170
Why not? Try it at least.

527
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,900
I want to open it up.

528
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,440
I don't like that it's hiding things.

529
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,790
Who knows what's inside the bun?

530
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,500
I can tell you what's inside.

531
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,270
Bacon, salami, lettuce...

532
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,590
I'll pass.

533
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,830
[I thought she came to tell me the truth.]

534
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,980
[I came to tell him the truth,
but his mood seems...]

535
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,440
It's tasty.

536
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,850
Miss Dam.

537
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,540
The sound.

538
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,380
Okay.

539
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:28,660
[What a petty man.]

540
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,440
Wait here.

541
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,560
I'll make you the coffee you used to like.

542
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,200
Sir, wait.

543
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,110
I have something to tell you.

544
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,800
It looks like the light went out.

545
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,790
I think it's a blackout.

546
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,270
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

547
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,560
It's okay.

548
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,870
I should have some candles.
Do you want to come with me?

549
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,140
Sure.

550
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,550
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

551
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,960
I'm sorry.

552
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,170
-Ouch.
-What's the matter?

553
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,930
I got a cramp.

554
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,600
Open your mouth.

555
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,360
Did you swallow it?

556
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,080
Yes.

557
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,010
What do we do now?

558
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,040
Since I swallowed it anyway,

559
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,450
should I keep it for a few days?

560
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,120
I don't have much energy anyway, so...

561
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:57,050
No. Hurry and give it back.

562
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,380
How? Should I hit my chest really hard?

563
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,400
Don't you remember?

564
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,850
You have taken the Marble out before.

565
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,040
I'll be closing my eyes, so do whatever
you have to do to take it back.

566
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,770
What's wrong?

567
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,470
I'm afraid I might take your energy too.

568
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,890
Then let me do it.

569
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,100
What?

570
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,750
I don't know how to spit it out,

571
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,050
so you take care of the rest.

572
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,050
I don't think it was this long before.

573
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,360
You told me to take care of it.

574
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:13,850
And I took care of it all right.

575
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,470
How was it?

576
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,620
Oh.

577
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,220
My heart fluttered.

578
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,990
No, I mean...

579
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,030
How did you feel?

580
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:54,590
Did you feel weak, by any chance?

581
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:58,550
Oh, that. I think I feel fine.

582
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,960
Actually, whenever I see you,

583
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,620
I want to hold your hands
and stay close to you.

584
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,060
But I'm afraid that might hurt you.

585
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:19,760
You always say that,
but you have never actually hurt me.

586
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:23,850
You said you would find a way.

587
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,980
And this is the way I came up with.

588
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,460
This way, you can take
a little bit of energy from me,

589
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,050
and I can be very happy.

590
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,260
-Miss Dam...
-Come on. Let me do this at least.

591
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,250
I trust you.

592
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,760
I want you to trust me too.

593
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,030
Right. There's something
I need to tell you.

594
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:57,910
I'm working

595
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,940
with Seon-woo.

596
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,730
I didn't mean to lie to you.

597
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:07,010
I didn't tell you
because I didn't want to worry you.

598
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:08,860
I'm sorry.

599
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,690
You probably couldn't tell me

600
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,040
because my jealousy
made you feel uncomfortable.

601
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,890
But I can't promise I won't get jealous.

602
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:35,090
Actually, there's a reason

603
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,830
why he bothers me.

604
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:46,570
I'll be honest with you too.

605
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,260
But I don't see anything.

606
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:14,730
Is that why I keep getting involved
with him these days?

607
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:17,330
I guess destiny does exist...

608
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:20,050
Whatever.

609
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,500
I made a promise.

610
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:34,840
Red thread? What do we do now?

611
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:37,040
Just like me more.

612
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,190
Don't change.

613
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,210
Like me as much as I like you.

614
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,650
There's no such thing as destiny.

615
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:57,760
[Jae-jin]

616
00:45:57,850 --> 00:45:58,110
[Jae-jin]

617
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,680
[Hye-sun, I'm arriving soon.
Is there anything you want to eat?]

618
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,800
What? Why did he send this to me...

619
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,230
[Hey, Dam. Did I make any mistake there?]

620
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,870
[Did I write anything women hate to hear?]

621
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:19,800
I thought we were dating to get
good grades, not to actually go on dates.

622
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,880
Excuse me.

623
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:29,040
Can I have your phone number?

624
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,890
I have a boyfriend.

625
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:34,900
We can just be text buddies too.

626
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:39,030
I said, I have a boyfriend.

627
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,090
Do you have a problem with my girlfriend?

628
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:47,700
No. I'm sorry.

629
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:54,870
Oh.

630
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:00,150
Sorry, I held your hand without asking.
I just wanted to help you.

631
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:06,050
It's just like the time at the festival.
Being pretty must be hard.

632
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:11,150
What are you saying?
Come on. Let's go eat.

633
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,040
Okay.

634
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:32,270
Hye-sun, have this too. It's really tasty.

635
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,540
-Why don't you have some too?
-I had enough already.

636
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,320
Do you want me to take photos of you?

637
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,390
That's so random.

638
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,670
Look over here.

639
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,610
You look great.
Do you want to have a look?

640
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,720
If you don't like it,
I can take you some more.

641
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:58,540
Don't bother.

642
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,420
[Why is he being so nice to me?]

643
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,910
Do your legs hurt?

644
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:14,600
No.

645
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:17,150
Are you bored?
Should we do something else?

646
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:19,700
Something else?

647
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:24,760
Hye-sun, do you want to go somewhere
and take some rest?

648
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:27,400
Shall we get inside now?

649
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,410
[They're all so predictable.]

650
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:33,960
Let's have a chit-chat.

651
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:38,010
What? Have a what?

652
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:40,730
Well, we didn't get to talk much.

653
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:43,990
You may not believe this
because of our start,

654
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,280
but I like taking it slowly and properly.

655
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:48,080
We agreed to go out anyway,

656
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:51,470
so I'd like to get to know you better
to entertain you.

657
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:54,460
Let's talk.

658
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:57,320
[What is he saying?]

659
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,850
I don't really have anything
to talk about.

660
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,530
Jae-jin.

661
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:11,360
I'll catch up with you in a minute.

662
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,210
-Let's go, Hye-sun.
-Seriously?

663
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,400
Why did you not answer my call?
I said I had something to say to you.

664
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,010
I don't have anything to say
nor to hear from you.

665
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,340
Don't you remember?

666
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,510
We broke up. You dumped me.

667
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:35,910
But you weren't like this before.

668
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:38,590
You don't even reply to my texts anymore.

669
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,870
You think I should always
answer your calls and texts

670
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,760
and listen to whatever you tell me to do?

671
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:47,260
You think that's my job?

672
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:53,770
Enough already. You've crossed the line.

673
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,580
Then let me ask you just one thing.

674
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:06,220
Are you two going out?

675
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:09,960
Yes. She's my girlfriend.

676
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,680
I'm sorry, Hye-sun.

677
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:29,460
I should have

678
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:32,230
just ignored her.

679
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,020
I ruined our first date.

680
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:41,070
Did you like her so much?

681
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,100
That's not what it is.

682
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,290
I was unsure if I could see anyone else
after breaking up with her.

683
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,880
I felt like
I couldn't trust anyone anymore

684
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,720
and I kept losing confidence in myself.

685
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:03,690
I must be the problem.

686
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:09,670
I'm sorry.

687
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:12,580
I really wanted to make this work today.

688
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,360
You must be confused.

689
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:18,560
[I was confused indeed.]

690
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,770
[You were different
from the guys I've met.]

691
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,420
[At some point,]

692
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:28,720
[I started to avoid men
who seemed to seriously care about me.]

693
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:31,760
I would like to marry you
one day, Hye-sun.

694
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:34,440
I'm sorry.

695
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:38,310
[Because I knew, in the end,
everything was meaningless,]

696
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,440
[I only had shallow relationships]

697
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:44,430
[where I knew what I wanted from it.]

698
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:45,880
Should we break up?

699
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,830
Sure, why not?

700
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:52,040
[The superficial
and calculative relationship]

701
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:53,800
[lasted only until it was enjoyable.]

702
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:56,710
[Eventually, I ended the relationship
or the relationship ended me.]

703
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,580
[Having relationships like that,]

704
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,310
[I forgot how to love]

705
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:07,090
[and to be loved.]

706
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:13,730
It's not your problem.

707
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:17,300
The problem is the one
who doesn't know how to be loved.

708
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:22,400
Don't cry, Jae-jin.

709
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:25,830
Don't cry. Let's talk.

710
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,910
I'll bad-mouth her with you.

711
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:41,320
Stop crying.

712
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,350
I'm not crying.

713
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,210
We don't have tissues,
so stop crying so much.

714
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:47,310
I'm not crying.

715

[Seogwa University]

716
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,950
Dam, why are you so late?

717
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:03,670
All the front seats are taken
because it's Professor Shin's lecture.

718
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:06,490
It's like an idol concert.
I barely managed to take this seat.

719
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,350
I'll sit in the back then.

720
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:25,940
I'll sit here. This is the only seat left.

721
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:28,270
Okay.

722
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:40,760
[So the red thread is tying us together.]

723
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,010
[But why?]

724
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:49,520
[-Hello, Professor.
-Hello, Professor.]

725
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:08,400
There are two views
about understanding historical events.

726
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:13,240
One argues that historical events
happened for real...

727
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,540
There was a piece of thread on.

728
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,800
Seon-woo, no matter what it is
that is on my hair,

unless it's threatening my life,
please don't touch me.

730
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,100
But...

731
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,100
Miss Dam.

732
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,700
Please don't get me wrong.
There was a piece of thread on my hair.

733
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,020
I didn't get it wrong.

734
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,410
I just wanted to see you up close.

735
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,820
From now on, please sit on the front seat
when you take my lecture.

736
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:33,050
But they are not facts.

737
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:37,670
Let's start with the first argument.

738
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,240
To quote a German historian of the 1800s,

739
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:49,680
"How things actually were is history."

740
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:46,750
Miss Dam.

741
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:11,170
Sir.

742
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,380
See?

743
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,060
This is what happens
when you mess with the destiny

744
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:36,560
that the deity has prepared for you.

745
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:39,060
Are you the one who tied the thread?

746
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:43,550
-Why...
-Consider yourself lucky.

747
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:47,120
You don't get to meet the one
tied with you by the red thread easily.

748
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:52,220
Don't you want to know

749
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:54,240
what your destiny is?

750
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:56,310
Does that mean

751
00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:00,400
my destiny or future is all decided?

752
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:05,160
The deity cannot tell the future either.

753
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:09,820
But the deity can show
what might be the future.

754
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,760
I'll let you dream.

755
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,270
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

756
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,820
No, I'm fine.

757
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,180
Miss Dam.

758
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:32,980
What did you do?

759
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,440
I just let her dream.

760
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:39,890
A short dream, which will end
in a blink of an eye.

761
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:44,550
You're a mere animal.

762
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:48,250
Therefore you don't have
the right to decide your own destiny.

763
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:52,510
Whatever this girl chooses
for her destiny,

764
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:54,450
you have to accept it.

765
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:02,900
I'm sure you want to know
what she's seeing.

766
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:06,550
I'll let you see

767
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:09,280
what can be her future too.

768
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:02,960

769
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,170
