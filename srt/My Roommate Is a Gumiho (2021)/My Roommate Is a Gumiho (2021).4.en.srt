-Yang Min-ju.
-Present.

162
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,720
-Park Jin-young.
-Yes.

-Yes.

166
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,040
Okay, let us begin.

167
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,420
Why does she keep staring at me like that?

168
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,800
What is communication?

169
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,710
[What is communication?]

170
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,000
The act of exchanging information.
Conversing.

171
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,020
Psychological exchange.

172
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,260
There are many aspects to communication.

173
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,610
Fifty percent of this lecture
will be practical exercises.

174
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,290
You will associate
with many different types of people

175
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,490
through simulations and write up a report.

176
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,060
The first assignment is
"romantic relationship".

177
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,860
My gosh!

178
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,710
Two people will become a team,
and go on dates every week.

179
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,060
Then you'll each write a report
on how you communicated.

180
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,220
I randomly selected the pairs
before the class began.

181
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,900
Settle down. Here are the pairs.

182
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,220
Look for your partner.

[Lee Dam, Gye Seon-woo]

186
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,730
Darn it.

187
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,480
It's as if fate is helping Seon-woo.

188
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,900
He'll end up winning the 100,000 won.

189
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,550
Seon-woo is much better, though.

190
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,780
Isn't she pretty?

191
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,220
-Lucky me.
-Seon-woo, one second.

192
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,810
Hey, Dam. Lee Dam.

193
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,310
I love your sneakers.

194
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,770
Can you buy those for about 100,000 won?

195
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,450
-You can go first.
-Should we?

196
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,030
Hurry up.

197
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,580
-What is it?
-Well.

198
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,870
It's about how we became partners.

199
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,290
If you're too busy,
we don't have to go on dates.

200
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,090
We can just set the story straight and--

201
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,550
I'm free whenever.

202
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,880
Speaking of which,
why don't we set a date?

203
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,550
How about Saturday?

204
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,190
Sure, I guess.

205
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,480
I'll text you with the time and place.

206
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,560
I'll text you between lunch and dinner

207
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,550
when it's not too early or too late.

getting involved with that guy...]

-Hi.
-What's this?

213
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,760
Our club is promoting
healthy campus culture.

214
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,910
Will you sign this?

215
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,450
Okay. Let me have a read.

216
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,160
We need more people to know.

217
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,010
Hey, Tae-jin.

218
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,370
Did you see the exchange student?

219
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,270
Her shape is just...

220
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,950
It's not just her shape.
She looks like she belongs on TV.

221
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,490
-Exactly.
-So?

222
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,680
Should I hit on her?

223
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,820
Let's start a party.

224
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,150
She doesn't have friends,
so I'm sure she'll show up.

225
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,090
I don't know. She looked haughty.

226
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,230
She might be cold.

227
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,360
Why can't I seem to find a pretty girl?

228
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,220
What? You'll find some
if you take a good look around.

229
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,510
I don't think Dam is half-bad.

230
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,010
I'd say she's definitely an A.

231
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,260
Enough is enough.

232
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,130
-I wouldn't say she's an A.
-No?

233
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,420
Dam has a pretty face,

234
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,750
but she's missing that something.

235
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,910
-I'd say B plus.
-My gosh.

236
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,650
Hey, how can Dam be a B plus?

237
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,580
Forget her looks.

238
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,869
What about her personality?
And she's a weirdo.

239
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,150
Wait, Tae-jin.

240
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,829
You're still sulking
over how she turned you down.

241
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,060
What the heck are you saying?

242
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,950
I wouldn't take her even if she was free.

243
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,140
Hey.

244
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,780
What are you all doing?

245
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,869
I'm not an object.

246
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,690
What are you saying
about how I'm free or whatever?

247
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,859
Aren't you going to apologize?

248
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,880
For what?

249
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,970
We were just joking around.

250
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,350
Joking?

251
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,230
This is so absurd
that the situation is becoming a joke.

252
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,930
If you were taught well at home,

253
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,530
you wouldn't be here
judging people on their looks.

254
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,950
Shouldn't you know that by now?

255
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,430
If you don't know
what you should apologize for,

256
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,890
then don't.

257
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,850
I'll just consider that
you had no one to teach you at home.

258
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,560
What the heck?

259
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,910
Hey, Dam.

260
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,410
One second.

261
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,820
-Seok, let me have a word with him.
-Sure.

262
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,000
Hey.

263
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,820
I didn't say a word.

264
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,440
Yes, you really didn't.

265
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,340
Are you mad?

266
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,770
Hey, I'm talking to you.
You can't leave like this.

267
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,940
Just beat me until you feel better.
I'll take it.

268
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,140
Then put it out.

269
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,260
-What?
-Put your face out.

270
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,660
If you don't put it out in three,
I'll start beating you wherever.

271
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,170
One.

272
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,410
Two.

273
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,190
-Hey, wait.
-Three.

274
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,670
It's nothing for you to apologize.

275
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,560
But

276
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,210
I also don't think you should
just stand there and listen to that.

277
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,300
One second!

278
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,330
Thank you.

279
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,820
Thank you.

280
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,020
-Have you heard?
-What?

281
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,260
How our seniors graded Dam.

282
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,800
I did.

283
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,960
They said they wouldn't take her
even if she was free.

284
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,980
But I heard Seon-woo was there too.

285
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,060
Exactly. Why did she
flirt with him so much?

286
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,710
I guess Seon-woo hated her a lot too.

287
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,280
She was always with him
as if she became somebody.

288
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,800
-How embarrassing.
-People will hear you.

289
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,480
Excuse me.

290
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,460
This university is
much more interesting than I thought.

291
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,390
I got paired up for a class

292
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,600
to discuss what it's like
to be in a romantic relationship.

293
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,260
I'm about to go on a date
with a guy 700 years younger.

294
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,280
I shouldn't have sent you there.

295
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,180
If I knew you'd call me this often,

296
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,810
I wouldn't have agreed.

297
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,230
The real interesting story begins now.

298
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,220
The kid you live with
got paired up with the Tiger boy.

299
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,680
Was his name Gye Seon-woo?

300
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,610
There's no need to report back
on every detail.

301
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,340
What I wanted from you is
to keep Miss Dam safe,

302
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,840
not to pry on her private life.

303
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,830
Just make sure you look after her
so that nothing bad happens.

304
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,290
[Then is this considered dangerous?]

305
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,890
She looked as if
she was about to cry any minute.

306
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,290
Are you sure you have zero interest
in her private life?

307
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,420
Not at all.

308
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,940
So if this isn't about the Marble,

309
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,740
don't meddle with her.

310
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,370
Look at this.

311
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,280
-Isn't that hilarious?
-Exactly.

312
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,820
-Look.
-This is insane.

313
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,060
Tae-jin.

314
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,430
Tae-jin.

315
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,690
Where did you find this information?

316
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,580
On Dikipedia, Mikipedia, or something.

317
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,310
-And some on an online forum.
-I know that one too.

318
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,580
Look at this.

319
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,250
We need accurate information
to analyze or reinterpret what we have.

320
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,490
Just work with it.
Stop picking a fight again.

321
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,860

Take it easy, Miss Dam.

486
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,880
And I got something for you.

487
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,140
These are supplements

488

And these are your favorite snacks.

490

-Including the guys in my college

there are so many evil men in this world.

493

To be honest, when I first met you,

494
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,390
I thought it was like a fantasy,

495
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:42,170
but these days,
I think humans are more like a fantasy.

without expecting anything in return.

499

00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,940
-I'm not sure.
-Me neither.

647
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:09,900
Come on. Let's hang out together.

648
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:11,970
Just this one day.
You know how much I helped you.

649
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,810
Let go of me!

650
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:21,250
What was with the tone?
Did you watch a historic drama?

651
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,670
Come on. Let's hang out together!

652
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,350
I'll pay for our meals and drinks.

653
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,380
I'd love to hang out together.

654
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,890
It sounds fun.

655
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:32,560
[You...]

656
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:41,840
-Do you want some popcorn?
-No, I'm good.

657
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,410
You two look great together.

658
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:46,640
You look pretty close.

659
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:47,870
Do we?

660
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,820
We're not close. I'm just his junior.

661
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:54,780
That's true. For now.

662
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,630
What do you mean by, "for now"?

663
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,480
I think I need to use the restroom.

664
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:07,890
I'll go with you.

665
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:23,330
That boy called Gye Seon-woo
seemed quite good-looking.

666
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:27,380
Is your gender identity the reason why
you haven't collected all the energy yet?

667
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,190
Watch your mouth.

668
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,430
Please, let's not make any problem.

669
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,150
I'm not sure.

670
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:36,310
I'm too curious.

671
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:39,440
What's happening today?

672
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,370
She's sick, so I came out for her.

673
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,300
No wonder why she's sick.

674
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:50,260
The Marble is stealing her energy.

675
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:00,340
-Hey, how about we switch our partners?
-No.

676
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,150
Then how about all four of us
hang out together all the time?

677
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,090
-No.
-Why not?

678
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,350
Wait. Are you seriously into Dam?

679
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,730
Shall we go inside now?

680
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:16,350
What movie is this?

681
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,960
I just booked what they booked.

682
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,430
-What movie is this?
-I don't know.

683
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:25,020
The title sounds like a romance movie.

684
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,610
[Love Holiday]

685
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,570
Romance...

686
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:47,330
[What's with this movie?]

687
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,850
[There are barely any lines.]

688
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:55,430
[No, I shouldn't gulp here.]

689
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,170
[This is mild.]

690
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,500
Hye-sun, should we just go?

691
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,840
Why? You spent money on this.

692
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,080
[This is mild.]

693
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:33,180
I thought it was romance and comedy
because of the title.

694
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:36,170
[Collect membership points
and watch movies!]

695
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,100
What should we do? Let's grab a beer
if you're free. It's on me.

696
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:41,010
I think we should call it a day.

697
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:43,650
Why? Let's go grab a beer.

698
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:53,420
Let's call it a day. I'm a bit tired too.

699
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,010
Okay. Let's call it a day. Right now.

700
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,510
I'll take you home.

701
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,240
No, I'd like to go on my own.

702
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,950
Have a safe trip home.

703
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,760
Dam is a little weird today.

704
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,200
She is. She keeps confusing us.

705
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:04,960
[Wait. Are you seriously into Dam?]

706
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,100
What type of man does Dam like?

707
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,280
Well, she seems to like
good-looking guys too,

708
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,340
but personality seems to matter the most.

709
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,130
In short, a nice type.

710
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:23,620
-A nice type?
-Yes. A nice and kind type.

711
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:28,240
[What's that? What should I do?]

712
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:49,660
Sir, why are you sleeping here?

713
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:52,080
Sir.

714
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:26,010
I feel bad

715
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,350
putting him through all this.

716
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,190
[No wonder why she's sick.]

717
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:26,950
[The Marble is stealing her energy.]

718
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,920
But I wasn't asking how she's doing.

719
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:33,900
I was asking why you're doing this.

720
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,510
What are you trying to say?

721
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:40,320
One mistake is enough.

722
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:49,560
When you said you started to live
with a human, I was worried

723
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:54,270
you might mess it up
because of your personal feelings.

724
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:57,530
In the end, the Marble will steal
all her energy

725
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:59,680
and she will either die
or be close to death.

726
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:04,570
And it will be torture for you
to watch that in front of you.

727
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:09,710
Still, I thought it might be okay.
Because you're Shin Woo-yeo.

728
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,500
But you seem to have started
to get attached to her.

729
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,370
Think about it.

730
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,750
Has it ever ended well

731
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:26,700
when we had feelings?

732
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:09,160
She's right.

733
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:12,150
Getting attached to her won't do any good.

734
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,450
Good morning, sir.

735
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:42,290
You looked really tired yesterday.
How do you feel?

736
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:44,050
I'm okay.

737
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,800
I'm sure it was hard.

738
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:51,180
Thank you and sorry.

739
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:58,880
Why aren't you saying anything?

740
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,670
Sorry. I was focusing on the book.

741
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:13,710
Maybe he's still tired.

742
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:23,250
Surprise. Let's eat this together.

743
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,510
I was thinking of getting ox blood,

744
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,710
but then I thought
we have been eating that too often.

745
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,530
So today, I got ourselves something sweet,
which is good for fatigue.

746
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,660
Look at the generous amount of cream.

747
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:37,950
Doesn't it look amazing?
Let's eat it together.

748
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:41,380
Miss Dam, as I said earlier,

749
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,890
I don't enjoy humans' food.

750
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:47,410
But we have been eating together...

751
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,540
Oh, okay.

752
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:19,660
Hi, sir. I'm going to school.

753
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:20,940
Okay.

754
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:36,860
[He seems to be avoiding me.]

755
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,400
[But why?]

756
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,780
[Did I do something wrong?]

757
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,860
What are you doing here?
I called you from over there.

758
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,090
What's up?

759
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,980
Hey, look.

760
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:57,540
If someone you've been getting along with
suddenly starts to avoid you,

761
00:58:57,630 --> 00:58:58,950
what do you think the reason is?

762
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:01,020
Why? Is someone avoiding you?

763
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,020
-Is it Seon-woo?
-No, it's not him.

764
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:12,590
In which situation
did this person start to avoid you?

765
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,620
I'm not sure.

766
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,960
He seemed a little tired,

767
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:20,160
but other than that...

768
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:24,740
Well, if you haven't done anything wrong,

769
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,260
you might not be the reason
but that person himself.

770
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:29,970
I see.

771
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,160
I wonder why.

772
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,240
Do you have a crush on someone?

773
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,360
Crush? No way.

774
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,860
I don't know much about him yet,

775
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:45,420
and there hasn't been any occasion
where I started to like him.

776
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,350
Anyway, I don't have a crush on him.

777
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,480
Okay. Then why do you care so much?

778
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,500
What?

779
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:56,770
No reason. There's no reason.

780
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:11,770
[Gye Seon-woo]

781
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:07,640
[Have you written the report yet?]

782
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,140
[Do you want to do it together
to get the stories straight?]

783
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:24,490
I'm home.

784
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:32,760
Sir, I have a question.

785
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,340
It's about my senior
born in the Year of the Tiger.

786
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,240
He wants me to write the report
together with him.

787
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,310
If it makes you feel uncomfortable,
I'll say no--

788
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,560
Miss Dam, you don't need
my permission for that.

789
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:47,540
What?

790
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,330
But you were worried about it before.

791
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:54,630
Now you're doing the assignment together,
you can't avoid him forever.

792
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,610
I know you can take care of yourself

793
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,540
and stay away from him.

794
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:01,840
That's true, but...

795
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:05,280
You don't need to tell me everything
unless it's important.

796
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:07,740
We are nothing more than

797
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,860
two people who accidentally got involved

798
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:13,550
with each other.

799
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,630
I know we are.

800
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:54,290
When he gave me that, he was so sweet.

801
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:56,230
Why did he suddenly...

802
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:03,710
Maybe something happened during the date.

803
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:05,380
When he was with Seon-woo.

804
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:23,020
Why did we come to such a faraway place?

805
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,440
I heard they had great desserts here.
This place is--

806
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:27,950
Let's hurry and start the assignment.

807
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:33,800
I didn't know what you'd like,
so I ordered everything.

808
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:37,010
Shall we finish the assignment first?

809
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:40,670
First, let's talk about
what happened that day.

810
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:43,970
-We went to a gamjatang restaurant, right?
-Yes.

811
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:47,130
Did I eat well?

812
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:49,860
Did I look somewhat upset

813
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:52,280
or aloof?

814
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:53,470
Not at all.

815
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,930
You didn't eat as well as usual,

816
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:58,130
but you were pretty...

817
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:01,080
-What?
-What?

818
01:03:03,370 --> 01:03:05,970
Never mind. You ate well.

819
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:12,790
By any chance, did you say something

820
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:15,340
that might offend me?

821
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:17,230
Why?

822
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:18,900
Did I make a mistake?

823
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:20,570
I don't think I said anything special.

824
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:21,850
No. Never mind.

825
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:25,550
What did we do after that?

826
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:28,580
-We went to see the movie.
-Right. We did.

827
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:31,090
How was I there?

828
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:33,990
You were all right.

829
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:36,850
We met Jae-jin and Hye-sun
and hung out with them all right.

830
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:41,390
Right. You're saying
we hung out all right,

831
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:43,850
and it means
there wasn't any special trouble.

832
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:49,390
By the way, you keep talking
like you weren't there.

833
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:50,760
What?

834
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:53,570
What do you mean?

835
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:57,670
[It looks like
nothing special has happened.]

836
01:03:58,590 --> 01:03:59,910
[Then why...]

837
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,470
I can walk you home.

838
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:17,160
I'm good. See you at school.

839
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:20,630
Dam.

840
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,150
Can I ask you something?

841
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,320
What is it?

842
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:31,590
The man you were with at school
the other day...

843
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,440
Who is he?

844
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:36,830
Oh, he's...

845
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:41,710
Well, I know you said
you somehow got to know him,

846
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:45,540
but what exactly does that mean?

847
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:54,290
It's just like I said.

848
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:57,770
I accidentally happened to know him.

849
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:02,130
Nothing more, nothing less.

850
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:37,430
Miss Dam.

851
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:46,580
Sir.

852
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,000
Just like you said,

853
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:52,040
I know we accidentally
got involved with each other.

854
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:55,120
So I know we don't need
to care about each other,

855
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,790
but you know what?

856
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,280
I can't do that.

857
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,630
I wish we can be like
we used to be. What should I do?

858
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:06,690
Miss Dam...

859
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:09,280
You said you feel comfortable
around me. You said I was okay.

860
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:12,060
You said the Marble wasn't the only reason
why you were nice to me.

861
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:14,260
How could a human change his mind like...

862
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:20,060
Do you think you can just change your mind
because you're not a human?

863
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,410
You can't just alienate me
when we were doing fine.

864
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:28,910
Miss Dam, I said that

865
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:33,570
because I concluded that it might be
better that I stay away from your life.

866
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:36,480
But it looks like
it rather concerned you more.

867
01:07:37,310 --> 01:07:38,460
I'm sorry.

868
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:40,350
If you're sorry,

869
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,010
let's be like we used to be.

870
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:52,100
I'll come back and sit,

871
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:55,880
so talk to me and worry about me
like you used to do.

872
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,470
How was it

873
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,600
with your senior?

874
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:47,180
It was all right.

875
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,240
What's wrong?

876
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,160
Did he push you again?

877
01:08:57,660 --> 01:08:59,370
No, he was nice to me.

878
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:03,020
He said he wouldn't do
anything I don't like.

879
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:06,279
I'm sure he did.

880
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:09,620
Because he has special feelings for you.

881
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:18,950
Actually, I'm not sure.

882
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,160
I doubt this is true,

883
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:26,250
but if, by any chance,
he has special feelings for me,

884
01:09:27,050 --> 01:09:29,069
I think it's strange.

885
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:31,750
Why is it strange?

886
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:34,130
I'm just not sure

887
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:38,310
what it is

888
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:40,859
to like someone.

889
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:44,380
He doesn't know everything about me,

890
01:09:44,729 --> 01:09:46,800
so how could he like me?

891
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:50,720
What if he expects something from me?

892
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:54,060
What if I can't meet his expectations?

893
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:56,220
Then what should I do?

894
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,920
"There is always"

895
01:10:05,550 --> 01:10:07,920
"some madness in love",

896
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:13,330
as Friedrich Nietzsche wrote
in "Thus Spoke Zarathustra".

897
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:17,210
That you like someone means

898
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:22,570
that you are misunderstanding
that person in your own way.

899
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:26,670
So what I'm trying to say is

900
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:31,950
you could be Fermina Daza to someone,

901
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:35,070
and that's not a misunderstanding.

902
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:38,060
Fermina Daza?

903
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:41,800
She's a heroine from an old book.

904
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,550
"To him, she seemed so beautiful,
so seductive,"

905
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:54,210
"so different from ordinary people,"

906
01:10:56,370 --> 01:10:57,600
"that he could not understand"

907
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:02,220
"why no one was as disturbed as he"

908
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:06,180
"by the clicking of her heels
on the paving stones,"

909
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,110
"why no one else's heart was wild"

910
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:14,800
"with the breeze stirred
by the sighs of her veils,"

911
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:19,290
"why everyone did not go mad
with the movements of her braid,"

912
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:22,590
"the flight of her hands,"

913
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,150
"the gold of her laughter."

914
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:29,890
"He could not understand"

915
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,750
"why anyone wouldn't
fall in love with her."

916
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:36,290
[My Roommate is a Gumiho]

917
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:39,590
[Maybe I fell in love
with that breathtaking beauty.]

918
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:43,150
[This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
to make Dam fall in love.]

919
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,340
[I like you.]

920
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:50,940
[Living in the same house,
I get attached to him.]

921
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:53,670
Can we talk for a moment?

922
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:58,470
[Are you sure she's not different
from all the boring people you met?]

923
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:02,340
[Miss Dam, you always seem genuine.]

924
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:04,050
[And I like it.]
