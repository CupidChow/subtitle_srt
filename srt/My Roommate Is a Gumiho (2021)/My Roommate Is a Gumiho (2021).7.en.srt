00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,930
I bumped into this man...

164
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,410
What? Where did he go?

165
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,650
He was here just now.

166
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,670
Anyway, what brings you here, sir?

167
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,100
I just came to browse some books.

168
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,530
-What are those?
-These are related to my major.

About that man
you ran into at the bookstore.

172
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,900
What was he like?

173
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,540
Could you tell me what he was wearing,
how old he looked,

174
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,480
and anything else you remember?

175
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,510
I'm not sure. It happened so quickly,
so I don't exactly remember.

176
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,500
He seemed pretty cold,

177
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,300
and it looked like
he was in his early 30s,

178
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,240
kind of like you.

179
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,200
What is it?

180
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,960
I was concerned.

[What's going on? If he's concerned]

182

[that a stranger came up
and talked to me...]

183
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,530
There are lots of awful crimes these days.

184
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,870
Right, crimes. You're right.

185
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,850
So while we're at it,

186
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,770
I think it might be better
if you avoid strangers from now on.

187
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,000
Sure.

188
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,980
If anything happens
and seems out of the ordinary,

189

please let me know.

190
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,740

No.

As you know, the annotations were
created to supplement the first edition.

And that's called a sutra plaque.

224
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,100
It's a sort of a mark
to discern what's written

in the annotation.

226

You always say it's your first time.

234
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,480
Your first time living with someone.

235

Your first time having a family.

You always say that.

Then we have no choice
but to go on a trip.

You kept saying
all these mysterious things.

243

So I wondered if you'd adapt well
once you become a human,

244
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:27,130
but I think it might be
your lack of experience.

so sentimental and painful

such an absurd lie,

00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:52,480
So if he doesn't die,
she lives on in that room for life?

325
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:56,350
Precisely. She checks in,
but there is no check-out hour.

326
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,690
You may face a peak season
with other people you love,

327
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,940
but that room is always sold out.
No one can take it.

328
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:05,150
Goodness, you.

329
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,290
[Sir]

330
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,660
Hello, sir.

331
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,290
[What time will you be done today?]

332
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,050
Well, I don't think

333
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,780
you have to pick me up today.

334
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:32,830
No, nothing is going on.
I just wanted to walk a little.

335
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,620
Then let's walk together.

336
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,500
So why did you
suddenly want to walk today?

337
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,240
Just because. The weather is so nice.

338
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,690
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

339
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,750
Miss Dam?

340
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,340
Yes?

341
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,150
Let's go.

342
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,360
I said I'll buy you tteokbokki
with the bus fare I saved.

343
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,210
Let's go eat that now.

344
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,570
Is something wrong, Miss Dam?

345
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,370
What?

346
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,880
You don't seem very well.

347
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,120
No, it's nothing.

348
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,940
Anyway,

349
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,380
Jae-jin told me

350
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,460
that all men have a room in their hearts.

351
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,960
And in that room,

352
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,400
they keep their first love for life.

353
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,260
Is that true?

354
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,230
I'm not sure.

355
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,600
What about you?

356
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:48,300
She's suddenly come back to me
for a very long time.

357
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,430
[I feel like such a fool.]

358
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,860
[I hate myself for getting concerned
over something that happened]

359
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,230
[hundreds of years ago.]

360
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,380
What's going on? Why are you sighing?

361
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,970
Is that guy you asked out
troubling you again?

362
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,860
-What?
-I knew something was up

363
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,230
when you suddenly asked me
about men's first love.

364
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,520
Did his first love show up?

365
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,380
No, that's not the case.

366
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,140
Then just forget it.

367
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,990
You don't have to mind the past.

368
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,450
It's not like you can undo
what already happened.

369
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,700
I know that.

370
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,360
But I get jealous.

371
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,070
I hate how ridiculous I am,

372
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,090
but that's how I feel.

373
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,870
What's wrong with me?

374
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:07,670
I think that's only natural.

375
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,470
There comes a moment in everyone's life
when they lose their usual pace.

376
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,510
It happens once you like someone.

377
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,330
That happens when you like someone.

378
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,060
Hey.

379
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,490
How are your studies going
for the midterms? Do you start tomorrow?

380
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,340
Why do you care?

381
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,510
Well, I wanted to bid you good luck.

382
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,500
And I quit smoking.

383
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,570
You said you hated it.

384
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,590
Dam, let's eat lunch.

385
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,610
What? With me?

386
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,120
Is there another Dam here? Let's go.

387
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:00,650
Seon-woo, what you need to quit is
your interest in Dam, not smoking.

388
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,810
Why have you been like this to me lately?

389
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,130
Like what?

390
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,990
I mean, you're always around me,

391
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,930
and you suddenly wanted to eat.

392
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,690
Because I was asked to...

393
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,400
You were asked to do this?

394
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,060
This monk I know asked me

395
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,480
to be kind to others.

396
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,440
That's how I can gain virtue
and end up in paradise.

397
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,740
I see. So you were a Buddhist.

398
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,060
Something like that.

399
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,410
But I don't even expect
to end up in paradise.

400
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,870
I just want to live
according to my fate and place,

401
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,860
enjoying this troublesome life
to the fullest.

402
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,230
That's all I want.

403
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,440
Hye-sun, you sometimes seem like
you have years of experience

404
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,680
from the way you talk.

405
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,630
Why are you criticizing me
while I'm being kind to you?

406
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,990
Criticizing you? It's a good thing
to come off as an experienced person.

407
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,600
I'm not sure. I hate it when people say

408
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,370
I seem seasoned
as if I have years of experience.

409
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,920
It looked like humans think
longevity is a blessing

410
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,120
and want to live forever.

411
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,800
Imagine if you live for
almost an eternity.

412
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,420
How do you think it'll feel?

413
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,970
I didn't expect you to find me.

414
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,290
It has been a while, fox.

415
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,080
Don't call me a fox. I'm a human now.

416
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,880
Then live like a human.

417
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,960
Stop coming to a place like this
by using his petty magic.

418
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,270
Don't be afraid.

419
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,480
I don't mean that
I'll ruin your life right now.

420
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,930
Old man, you know about this, right?

421
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,160
Know what?

422
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,460
The mysterious happenings
surrounding Woo-yeo.

423
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,100
I can tell by your face that you do know.
Help him.

424
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,050
I'm not sure.
Don't you think this is his job?

425
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,610
If you have anything to say,
you can tell me.

426
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:46,350
Woo-yeo,
what have you been doing to this day?

427
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,560
Hye-sun is younger than you,
yet she became a human ages ago.

428
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,850
I said I wanted to become a human,

429
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,020
then you told me to collect
human energy to become one.

430
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,420
I've always known
you weren't the kindest guy since then.

431
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,550
It must've been lots of fun

432
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,770
if you just stood back
and watched me to this day.

433
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,440
Fun?

434
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,430
I may not look like it,
but I'm a mountain spirit.

435
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,670
What benefits would I get
from pestering you?

436
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:17,370
My job is to take care of your destiny.

437
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:23,790
Which is why I have been
watching over her.

438
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:27,670
Are you saying you're the reason
she has been safe?

439
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,560
Of course.

440
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,550
She's been protected by my magic spell.

441
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,130
[Humanities]

442
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,030
[I was hovering around her at times,]

443
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:39,240
[and around you at others.]

444
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,230
So,

445
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,710
from whom have you been protecting us?

446
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,400
When a gumiho lives 1,000 years,
it turns into a maegu.

447
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,070
Maegu?

448
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,200
I didn't want you to turn
into such a wicked creature.

449
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:57,150
Therefore, I thought I might as well
eliminate you

450
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:00,750
if you fail to become a human
within 1,000 years.

451
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,240
Why would you suddenly
talk about elimination?

452
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,550
There appeared one who goes against nature

453
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,920
and disrupts the order.

454
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,440
A maegu who has lived

455
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,810
a thousand years
and failed to become a human

456
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,969
refused to be eliminated

457
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,690
and turned into an evil spirit.

458
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,469
And it covets your Marble.

459
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,830
Wait.

460
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:30,670
An evil spirit covets the Marble?

461
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,210
What does it need it for?

462
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,150
It has a silly belief

463
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,830
that it might make it a human.

464
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,489
You should have made sure
to eliminate it in the first place.

465
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,760
You had one job.

466
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:45,110
So where's this evil spirit
called maegu or whatever?

467
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,650
Even if you don't try,

468
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,760
you'll eventually bump into it.

469
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,489
It couldn't find what it wanted,

470
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:55,489
and it will now try to find it from you,
the owner of the Marble.

471
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,750
And now a human's life is in my hand

472
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,950
because I did my job.

473
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:08,070
I do not want to disturb order,

474
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,580
so I think I should stop here.

475
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,460
I'm saying I'm not protecting her anymore.

476
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,370
What does that...

477
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:13,630
Miss Dam.

478
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,830
Sir.

479
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,120
-Are you okay?
-What do you mean?

480
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,460
Why didn't you call me?
I said I would come pick you up.

481
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,280
Right. The class suddenly
got canceled, so...

482
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,200
Sir.

483
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,640
Let's go home now.

I know why you appeared with that face.

488

You want the Marble.

489

Hey, I get you're busy,
but you should wash your hair.

Your hair is so oily
it can be an oil mill.

Whatever. I barely have
enough time to learn.

How about on the outside?

I heard you had the past exam materials
of Korean Medieval History.

533
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,460
Could you share it with me?

534

Seok.

535
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,480
You know, during the late Joseon period,

536
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,630
family history books were often traded.

537
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,450
-Yes, I know that of course.
-What was society like then?

538
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,080
It was chaotic.

539
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,880
That's right.

540
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,130
I turned everyone down,
so if I share it with you,

541
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,590
it will make society chaotic, I think.

542
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,150
You have your point.

543
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:42,100
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.
Good luck then.

Why won't you share it with him?

545
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,110
I get it. You don't want to help him
because he's your rival.

546
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,460
He's not my rival.

I have never left my throne.

548
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,770
I have always been the top.

549
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,270
I'm unrivaled.

550
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,070
Come on. That's not quite true.

551
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,620
You're the top student
because you focus only on studying.

552
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,950
And he's in second place
while organizing all the events...

553
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,710
because he's a student representative.

554
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,960
Once he starts focusing only on studying,

555
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,850
he will be the top student, not you...

556
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,770
Which is never going to happen.

557
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,010
As long as you don't stop breathing,
you'll always be the top student.

558
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,180
This is not right.

559
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:06,450

-Which year?
-1859.

562
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,670
I'm not interrupting you, am I?

563
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:21,890
You seemed to have trouble
focusing on study these days.

564
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:24,090
That's why I wanted
to keep you company tonight.

565
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,080
To make sure you work hard.

566
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:31,660
Well, it's nice studying together anyway
because I can get your help.

567
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:40,770
I guess I can make
use of my long life sometimes.

568
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,800
Imagine if you live for
almost an eternity.

569
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,430
How do you think it'll feel?

570
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:57,180
In the end, you have to let go
of all the people you love

571
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:01,450
and all the good and bad memories
will fade away.

572
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,540
Is it really good to live
a meaningless life like that?

573
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:08,620
How does it feel to live a long life?

574
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:12,140
Nothing. It doesn't feel like anything.

-What?
-I said, I'll try to understand.

What do you mean?

578
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:34,140
You also say a lot of things
I don't understand.

579
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,340
So just pretend you got what I mean.

580

[The feeling of liking someone]

581
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:58,870
[can be quite childish.]

582
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:04,060
[That childish feeling
sometimes bothers me,]

583
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:09,030
[but I wish it doesn't go away.]

584

Seriously, everything you mentioned
was on the exam.

585
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:04,030
Did you wash your hair, by the way?

586
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,480
I got changed too.

587
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:13,090
What am I going to do?
I messed up my first exam.

588
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:17,140
I shouldn't have studied with him.
I couldn't focus.

589
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:20,000
Him? Who did you study with?

590
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,090
Dan. He's taking exams too.

591
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,590
Why are you smirking?

592
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,450
-As if you nailed it or something.
-I did nail it.

593
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,790
I almost got a heart attack
when I got the exam paper.

594
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:38,090
All the exam materials Soo-kyung shared
with me were on the exam.

595
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:40,640
I had so much to write,
but there wasn't much space for it.

596
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:43,230
What? Am I the only one who messed it up?

597
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:44,990
Yes. You're the only one.

598
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:49,880
You'll let me see your notes
and the exam materials again, right?

599
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,460
Where's your conscience?

600
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:54,230
It's very brazen of you to ask me to share
the fruit of my hard work.

601
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,420
I'm not brazen.

602

I'm going to buy you food and drinks.
I'll be nice to you.

645
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:11,870
What happened? I was worried about you.

646
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:16,440
What did you mean by, "There you are"?

647
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:22,340
I said that because I found you.

648
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,000
Now, everything will be all right.

649
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,000
What do you mean?

650
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:52,520
If you want to come home
because you get tired or sleepy,

651
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:54,240
call me.

652
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,300
I'll come pick you up any time.

653
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:58,590
Okay.

654
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,430
Are you okay?

655
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,100
I guess all kinds of things happen
when you live a long life.

656
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:44,040
Now, don't worry about other things
and focus on your original goal.

657
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:45,760
You're almost there.

658
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,890
I know it's upsetting.

659
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:57,510
But there must be a reason why the Marble
changed its color for the first time.

660
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:00,020
So do everything you can to keep her.

661
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,360
If you become an evil spirit

662
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,400
just like the old man said...

663
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,560
[How does it feel
to witness the vain end?]

664
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,900
I want you to remember this day.

665
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,900
It can happen to you too.

666
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,760
Think of the girl as your last hope

667
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,220
and become a human.

668
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,210
I truly wish you won't meet

669
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:44,100
a tragic end like this.

670
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,030
Why aren't you saying anything?

671
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:06,630
Gosh, it's finally over. It feels so good.

672
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,740
Thanks, Soo-kyung. You helped me a lot.

673
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:11,510
If you thank me so much,
buy me some grilled pork belly.

674
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,920
Okay. Why don't we go now?

675
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:14,420
Grilled pork belly, soju, and beer?

676
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:15,610
I'd love to!

677
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:16,620
Where should we go?

678
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,950
What was that place called
where they had great fried rice?

679
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:24,890
[Sir]

680
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,500
[Miss Dam, now your exams are finished,]

681
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:23,390
[why don't we go on a trip?]

682
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:27,090
Guys, I have an appointment.
I've got to go.

683
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:30,430
I'm sorry. I'll buy you grilled pork belly
and beef tripe next time.

684
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,620
-Sorry. Bye.
-Hey.

685
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:33,430
Hey. Darn it.

686
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,590
It's okay. It's just the two of us,
so it'll be cheaper.

687
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,490
-Come on. Let's go.
-Forget it.

688
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:40,070
Let's do it another time.

689
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:43,770
I mean,

690
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:47,510
I don't want to be hanging around
the campus looking like this.

691
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:50,190
You know, I'm Kim Tae-hee
of Seogwa University.

692
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,380
You know what I mean.

693
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:55,560
Listen, my friend.
I really didn't want to say this

694
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:56,750
because you helped me a lot,

695
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,900
but why do you keep
calling yourself Kim Tae-hee?

696
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:01,370
The only thing you two have in common
is that you have a face.

697
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:05,940
What are you saying?
I totally look like Kim Tae-hee.

698
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:09,680
Gosh. How do I make you understand?

699
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:13,470
Hey, wait. Since you always say the truth,
please answer me.

700
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:15,310
Does she look like Kim Tae-hee?

701
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:17,650
Yes, she does.

702
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:18,880
What?

703
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:24,950
Kim Dae-hee, the comedian
who used to be on "Gag Concert", right?

704
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:27,330
You look a lot like him.

705
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:31,730
Bye then.

706
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,100
Let's go eat.

707
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:45,500
Hey! Stop right there!

708
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,150
Be careful. You might fall.

709
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:08,600
See? I told you to be careful.

710
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:11,460
Right. I almost fell.

711
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,890
By the way, why a trip all of a sudden?

712
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:18,320
We agreed to go on a trip together
when your exams are finished.

713
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:19,900
Right.

714
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,590
But I didn't know it would be
on the very day the exam was over.

715
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:25,100
Should we try another day then?

716
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,740
No. You say that

717
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:29,410
only when you buy lottery tickets.

718
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,640
Let's go.

719
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:35,790
Let's take a bus this time.

720
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,990
Why did you suggest
we ride a bus this time?

721
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:53,120
Well. I wanted to go slowly.

722
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,190
Slowly. That sounds great.

723
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:16,270
How about that?

724
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,910
Oh, I want to make a wish too.

725
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:12,940
By the way, do you have a wish too?

726
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:17,030
I mean, you can use magic
whenever you want,

727
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:20,200
you've been accumulating wealth
for almost a thousand years,

728
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:21,920
and you're so tall and handsome.

729
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,680
I wonder what wish you can possibly have.

730
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:28,380
Oh. Maybe you wished the Marble
comes out soon so you can be a human.

731
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:32,120
I made a wish for you.

732
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:33,840
For me?

733
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:38,370
You have a beautiful smile,

734
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:41,710
so I wished you would get to smile often.

735
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:45,890
You can make your dreams come true,

736
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,710
so I wished you wouldn't give up
on what you like.

737
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:54,300
And I wished you wouldn't get hurt

738
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:59,140
by others.

739
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:05,170
I wished you would always be well.

740
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:19,770
It's so pretty.

741
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,210
Don't you think, Sir?

742
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,010
I'm so glad we came here.

743
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,000
Sir.

744
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:41,770
Let's come back here next year.

745
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:45,120
Actually, earlier
in front of the stone tower,

746
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:48,550
I wished I could come back here
next year with you.

747
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:50,840
But not like this.

748
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,830
I wished you could come with me
as a human.

749
01:01:58,010 --> 01:01:59,070
Miss Dam.

750
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:04,390
Do you remember what I said then?

751
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:06,240
What do you mean?

752
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,110
I said I had never had a family,

753
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:12,660
but I felt like I got one now.

754
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,610
I really meant what I said.

755
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:24,850
Nobody has ever stayed with me
for this long.

756
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:29,120
I've been used to being alone.

757
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:31,850
Then...

758
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:35,940
[I'm also okay with staying with you.]

759
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:36,290
[Then]

760
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:37,080
[Actually, I'm more than
just okay with it.]

761
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:38,400
[I met you.]

762
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:44,120
[And you happened]

763
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,510
[to become special to me.]

764
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:19,940
I lied.

765
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:23,240
I knew how to take out the Marble

766
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:26,890
from the beginning.

767
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,020
But I lied to you.

768
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:37,490
I needed energy to become human,

769
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,360
and you happened to be there.

770
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,240
You won't remember a thing.

771
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:14,410
When you wake up,

772
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,400
everything will be over.

773
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:29,760
You just had a short dream.

774
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:34,740
As of now,

775
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:38,120
the contract has ended.

776
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:07,820
[We appreciate Jung So-min, Ko Kyoung-pyo,
and Han Ji-eun for the guest appearances.]

777
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:39,810
[My Roommate is a Gumiho]

778
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:41,790
[Sir, I'm home.]

779
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,420
[Her kind voice.]

780
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:45,310
[Her smile.]

781
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,110
[All those things were
perhaps a privilege.]

782
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:50,410
You don't have time to lose
looking miserable.

783
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:50,630
[Seogwa University]

784
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:54,510
[I'm just watching her
for a while. Just for a while.]

785
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:57,320
Are you free today?

786
01:05:57,590 --> 01:05:59,790
[You're just acting like you don't know]

787
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:01,630
that I like you, aren't you?

788
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:05,730
[Is it really okay for you to see her
doing just fine without you?]

789
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:09,420
I like someone else.
