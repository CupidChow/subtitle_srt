[What? The Marble turned blue?]

13
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,890
It turned blue
the moment you tried to take it back,

14
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,530
then it went back to normal?

15
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,419
How could that happen?

It turned blue at once.

18
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,710
Then I instinctively knew

19
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,840
I became a human as of that moment.

So? How do you feel?

21
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,100
I know it happened for a second,
but it never changed colors before.

22
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,300
It felt very peculiar for me.

23

Well, a little, I guess.

After what? This is why I don't associate
with kids who haven't dated.

33
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,020
That's called expressing affection.

34
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,710
What do you think he was trying to check?
Their love.

35
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,830
Anyway, your friend got married young.

36
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,980
Oh, she's not married.
She's living with him.

37
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,490
But it's not affection.
They don't like each other.

38
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:20,350
What? They live together even though
they don't like each other? Why?

39
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,960
Well things happened, so she ended up

40
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,600
-getting something precious in her...
-What?

41

46
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,770
I finally get it.

47
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,200
You wouldn't let
a random human stay by your side.

48
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,010
The Marble rolled into her

49
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,520
as if she's the owner
right before your 1,000 years are up.

50
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,640
It happened for a moment,
but it even turned blue.

51
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,410
I can see why you thought this was fate.

52
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,660
Anyway, be good to her as much as you can,

53
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,680
and do everything you can.

54
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,720
Why should I do that?

55
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,000
This might be the last chance you have.

56
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,360
In my experience, humans emit

57
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,610
the best kind of energy
when they're happy.

58
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,970
So I made a lot of efforts
to make them happy.

59
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,480
What did you do?

60
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,240
I dated them.

61
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,200
There's no other way
they could be happier than that.

62
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,230
Right.

63
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:50,550
You should just date her
while you got this chance.

64
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,440
Nonsense.

65
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,390
I'm saying because dating is
the best way to make them happy.

66
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,370
And of course, I know how much you hate

67
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,400
to feign love and stay by a human's side.

68
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,560
But you have no other choice.

69
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,360
Learn to be patient

70
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,650
and try dating her.

71
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,480
-Why would you say...
[-Are you going to date me?]

72
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,280
Then why did you hug me?

73
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,650
Oh, well...

74
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,580
I mean, I gave it a thought
to figure out why you did that.

75
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,100
But you're the one who did something odd,
so why should I be troubled?

76
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,920
So I decided to ask you.

77
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,159
What's going on?

78
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,050
At first,

79
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,820
I was really going to let you go.

80
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,460
But then it hit me

81
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,510
that I had to stay behind all by myself
to figure this out,

82
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,460
and it made me feel hopeless.

83
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,850
So in a word,

84
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,780
it's like we're stuck
on a deserted island,

85
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,950
but you felt as if
you had to let me escape alone,

86
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,200
as if your only comrade is leaving?

87
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,890
Well, something like that.

88
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,220
I guess I can understand how you feel,

89
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,930
so I'll let you slide.

90
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,900
But from now on,
don't do anything to lead people on.

91
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,630
People will misunderstand what you did.

92

93
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,880

No, I won't.

97
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,360

98

You are not my type.

99
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,490
But why do you ask?

100
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,440
Well, I am

101

feeling anxious and unable to think right,

102
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,740
so it must be a withdrawal symptom.

103
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,720
I see.

104
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,230
Why did I say that?

105
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,400

00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,250
Let's make a bet for 100,000 won.
Are you in?

164
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,460
I'm in.

165
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,890
You can have this.

166
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,400
Is this seat available?
Can I share your book?

167
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:34,020
[Gye Seon-woo]

168
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,360
[We're all meeting up
at the back gate today. Want to come?]

169
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,740
Why does he do this to me?

170
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,020
[What do you think?]

171
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,060
I'm just frustrated
to see you waste your time.

172
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,490
Your 1,000 years will be over soon,
and what if you really...

173
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,770
Brace yourself, and ask her out.

174
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,000
I did.

175
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,110
Of course, you did.

176
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,620
What? You did? Really?

177
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,960
And? What did she say?

178
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,560
She won't go out with me.

179
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,460
Because you're a gumiho?

180
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,400
Because I'm not her type.

181
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,830
People used to say gumihos are bewitching,
but not anymore.

182
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,120
[What happened to you, Sim Woo-yeo?]

183
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,480
Anyway, I'm sorry.

184
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,070
You took my advice,
then only embarrassed yourself.

185
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,440
I didn't take your advice.

186
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:24,570
I wasn't going to do that,
but she didn't seem to care at all,

187
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,330
so it just came out.

188
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,890
Yes, don't go begging a girl
who doesn't care about you

189
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,380
to go out with you.

190
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,010
[Let's find another way.]

191
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,410
It looks like dating you
isn't her idea of happiness.

192
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,970
Right, humans have
a weak spot for presents.

193
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,040
Why don't you give her
a load of stuff she likes?

194
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,800
If she likes clothes, get her clothes.

195
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,080
If she likes accessories,

196
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,500
get her things made with diamond,
gold, sapphire, clam gem,

197
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,430
and pearl.

198
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,560
Clam gems are pearls.

199
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,240
What? Since when?

200
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,540
You should take lessons
instead of meddling with my business.

201
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,310
-Forget it.
-Are you afraid of getting lashed?

202
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,950
The education system has changed a lot.

203
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,470
You won't get lashed by the teacher
like we used to in the old days.

204
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,550
I hope you get the courage
to sign up for a class. Bye.

205
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,310
I can't believe this guy.

206
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,330
Fine, big shot.

207
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,150
All showing off how he's
an elite scholar from Seonggyungwan.

208
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,810
Something that she likes.

209
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,070
-Do you enjoy ghosting people?
-Sorry?

210
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,960
I said we're meeting at the back gate.

211
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,890
Right, I have to go home early...

212
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,080
Then forget today.

213
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,670
Let's catch a movie this weekend.

214
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,530
Why do you want to go with me?

215
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,980
No way.

216
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,930
I've seen seeing them together often.

217
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,380
Is she his type now?

218
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,090
I'm sure Dam flirted with him.

219
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,090
She went for so long pretending like
she's not interested in guys.

220
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,770
Hey, do you remember
that one senior, Eun-jo?

221
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,460
She kept saying
she doesn't think Seon-woo is hot,

222
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,020
but got humiliated
when she got caught flirting with him.

223
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,330
What if Dam ends up like her?

224
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,980
-My gosh.
-Dam, what are you up to?

225
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,340
What?

226
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,060
Get some yourself.

227
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,860
It's not that.

228
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,120
What's going on between you and Seon-woo?

229
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,430
Nothing. We just had a meal once.

230
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,060
What? You had a meal with him?

231
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,290
Just you two? Why?

232
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,150
He seemed like the bad boy type.

233
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,080
Hey, she won't die from eating with him.

234
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,580
She can manage that much.

235
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,190
Well, I'm sure you're surprised
that he went for her and not me,

236
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,270
but I can always let you have him, Dam.

237
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,120
No, it's not like that.

238
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,790
We just ate a meal, and that's all.

239
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,680
[Gye Seon-woo]

240
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,070
[So we'll catch a movie this weekend.]

241
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,370
No way, a movie?

242
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,040
It's not "not like that."

243
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,150
You ate with him, took classes together,

244
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,480
then asked me to leave, and now, a movie?

245
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,860
Then he's 100 percent interested.

246
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,930
That's what it looks like on the outside.

247
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,380
But look at me.

248
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,620
I don't look so bad today,

249
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,750
but you wouldn't want to say hi to me
if you weren't my friends.

250
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,110
-You want to be strangers.
-Yes.

251
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,740
So why would he?

252
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,660
Why would he be interested in me
among countless numbers of students?

253
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,340
Dam has attended co-ed schools
over her entire life,

254
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,040
[from her preschool to college days,
for about 20 years.]

255
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,600
[But there's a reason
why she has never dated to this day.]

256
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,180
[Never dated]

257
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,280
[I'm interested in you.]

258
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm interested in you.

259
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,370
I have this feeling for you.

260
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,910
Hello?

261
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,330
I'm over here!

262
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,360
Hey, I'm over here!

263
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,480
[First, she's the type]

264
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,760
[who becomes very small
in front of a guy she likes.]

265
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,190
Hey, look.

266
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,390
I have a hole in my sock.

267
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,490
My gosh.

268
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,900
-Awesome!
[-Second,]

[she becomes too relaxed
with guys she's not interested in.]

270
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,250
You like me?

271
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,460
Don't you remember how I got hammered

272
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,070
and stuck my phone charger up your nose?

273
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,890
If you still like me
even though you remember that day,

274
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,780
I think there's something wrong with you.

275
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,270
[And third,]

276
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,690
[she turns down everyone
knowing exactly what she's like.]

277
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,600
[That's right. Dam was a woman]

278
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,110
[who could view herself
a bit too objectively.]

279
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,580
[That's why she was sure
Seon-woo wouldn't like her.]

280
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,650
[That's why...]

281
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,450
Goodness, does he have a thing for me?

282
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,930
[she couldn't let her heart race
as she gets involved with him.]

283
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,480
[Her attitude is more like
that of General Guan Yu,]

284

[who said,]

285
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,200
["I will return
before this drink turns cold."]

286
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,110
I need to figure this out
before it blows up any bigger.

287
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,670
Yes, I'll become so unlikable
that he would never, ever

288
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,170
want to associate with me again.

289
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,990
Can you just be honest?

290
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,750
Just tell him that you feel uncomfortable.

291
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,680
What if he thinks
I'm playing too hard to get?

292
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,369
Most of the girls
in my major are on his side.

293
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,170
What if he gets mad at me

294
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,890
and starts a bad rumor?

295
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:19,990
What am I going to do?

296
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,220
That could happen.

297
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,780
Making him get sick of me is
definitely the best tactic.

298
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,420
-Hey, Jae-jin.
-Yes?

299
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,740
Share your secret with me.

300
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,130
What did you do
to make all of your girlfriends leave you?

301
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,740
They all hated
how I was too needy and obsessive.

302
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,750
I see.

303
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,110
Can you ask someone else,

304
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,790
not this expert on getting dumped?

305
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,720
You know, someone who has dated a lot

306
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,660
and can give you lots of tips,

307
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,680
a real player.

308
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,850
A real player?

309

[Pizza, Chinese Food, Tteokbokki, Bossam]

310
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,060
What a beautiful relay.

311
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,040
What's all this?

312
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,560
I thought you might be hungry,
so I got these for you.

313
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,320
You got me this much food?

314
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,690
You didn't know what I'd like,
so you got everything?

315
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,600
You seemed to like everything,
so I got everything.

316
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,960
Right, but no chicken.

317
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,050
You're such a delicate
and considerate guy.

318
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,480
Sir, I knew it. I knew you'd be like that,
but you seem to be

319
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,560
a bigger player than I thought.

320
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,990
Sir, you've dated lots of women, right?

321
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,940
I mean, you're pretty old.

322
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:48,640
I need the help
of someone who's experienced like you.

323
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,800
Could you please help me out?

324
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,190
Can you fill me in from the top?

325
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,460
Here's the thing.

326
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,740
So you want to disappoint that guy

327
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,940
and make sure
he never approaches you again?

328
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,480
Yes, that's it.

329
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,370
How can I help?

331
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,170
-A date?
-Yes.

332
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,970
Just as how we take mock tests,

333
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,420
I want to go on a test date

334
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,490
before I go out with him.

335
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,180
I'll do my best to be awful,

336
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,110
so tell me what you hated the most,

337
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,580
and if you have any ideas on what I can do

338
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,940
to get him to hate me more.

339
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,880
Miss Dam...

340
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,370
I know it's you,

341
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,090

343

Let's go on a date tomorrow.

344
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,440
Really?

345
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,700
Yes, it sounds too personal,
but I have no other choice.

346
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,030
Thank you, sir.

347
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,870
I wonder if he's up yet.

348
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,890
I hope he didn't change his mind.

349
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,450
I know it's a simulation,

350
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,220
but I wanted to dress properly for a date.

351
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,460
Yes, that's a great attitude.

352
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,590
But are you going out like that, Miss Dam?

353
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,870
Yes, I thought he'd hate it
if I go out like this

354
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,940
to watch a movie with him.

355
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,670
What do you think? Do I look awful?

356
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,670
Instead of this,

357
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,030
why don't you put on
that reddish-brown shirt with a dog on?

358
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,440
[You should go with that.]

359
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,860
[It's a little bit tackier,]

360
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,040
[there are spots here and there,
and the neck is stretched out too.]

361
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,840
[How can I put this?]

362
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,100
Yes, you looked pretty awful.

363
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,400
I see. Then I'll wear that
when I go out with him.

364
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,030
And you'll look much more frivolous

365
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,620
if you put on your sneakers
while stepping on the back as always.

366
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,470
He may find you more unlikable.

367
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,890
I see. Thank you for your advice.

368

-Shall we?
-Okay.

369
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,690
Sir, I'm about to show you

370
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,030
the epitome of gluttony.

371
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,580
I hope this won't become a problem
in our cohabitation.

372
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,170
If I put you off a bit too much,
call a time out.

373
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,360
Okay.

374
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,840
This is the best restaurant
near our school,

375
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:47,110
but no matter how good it is,
if I devour on this aggressively,

376
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,610
don't you think I'll look awful?
Watch this.

377
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,590
Hey, Miss Dam.

378
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,410
Why don't you just eat jjajangmyeon?

379
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,680
Sorry?

380
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,540
I watched you eat jjajangmyeon last time.

381
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,390
You got the sauce all over your mouth,

382
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,590
and you slurped on the noodles
very loudly.

383
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,360
It might be more off-putting
than this dish.

384
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,680
I see.

385
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:44,040
And you take a bite of your picked radish
and leave the eaten ones in your bowl.

386
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,200
It seemed quite selfish too,

387
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,910
so that could be off-putting.

388
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,070
Thanks for the great tips.

389
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,340
Thank you for your help today, sir.

390
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,200
I'm glad I could be of help.

391
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,960
That was hot.

392
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,660
Right, when you drink hot drinks,

393
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,040
you tend to slurp a lot.

394
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,030
I think you should show
such uncultured behavior too.

395
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,180
And you should call your friend
when you're with him.

396
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,850
I overheard your call once,

397
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,840
and it seemed like you were using
all kinds of vulgar language such as,

398
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,390
"jerk, idiot, I'll kill you," and more.

399
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,080
That could all be off-putting, so...

400
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:45,860
What's wrong?

401
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,280
Now that I hear everything you said,

402
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,140
there's no need for me to try so hard.

-I...
-I just had to be myself.

404

I'm the human incarnation
of the word unlikable.

-No.

Then shall we go back home?

409
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,400

482
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,460
Why can't I seem to get better?

483
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,020
I'm sorry, but please excuse me.

484
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,320
-What are you doing?
-The closer I am to the Marble,

485
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,520
-the faster you'll get better.
-What?

486
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,560
Wait, you're right.

487
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,690
Your hands must be medicinal.

488
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,840
But I'm going to start flexing my tummy,
so don't talk to me.

489
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,690
You already know a lot about me,

490
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,500
but I want my body fat to remain a secret.

491
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:53,530
Hey, Miss Dam.
You've worked out before, haven't you?

492
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,670
I can hear my privacy
shattering in pieces.

493
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,490
-Do you feel better now?
-Yes.

494
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,920
Gosh, that almost killed me.

495
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,780
It was unbelievably painful.

496
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,680
Miss Dam.

497
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:17,780
You might end up with that pain again
if you see that guy.

498
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,450
Will you be all right?

499
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,220
I'm worried about that too,

500
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,670
but you saw what he's like.

501
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,560
He pets me even though we aren't close.

502
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,730
There's no point talking
to someone like him.

503
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,720
And I can't avoid him forever
since he's in my major.

504
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,660
So if it's okay with you,

505
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,950
I want to go out with him
and put an end to this.

506
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,370
I can't stop you if that's what you want.

507
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,800
But you have to call me right away
if anything happens.

508
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,440
If I call, will you run over right away?

509
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,830
Of course. I should protect you.

510
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,390
Gosh, I'm tired. I should get to bed.

511
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,110
Okay. Get a good rest.

512
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,690
Goodnight, Miss Dam.

513
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,840
Okay.

514
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,140
Hey, it's my brother.

515
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:16,270
What's this? You don't sound well.
Did you skip dinner?

516
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,850
No way.

517
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,870
The person I live with
bought me gamjatang,

518
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,590
and I even had fried rice.

519
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,140
"The person"? I thought she was a friend.

520
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,710
Yes, right.

521
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:33,210
I can be very respectful to you too
if you'd buy me food.

522
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,230
Whatever.

523
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,400
-Anyway, what was your friend's name?
-Shin Woo...

524
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,310
-hee.
-What?

525
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,770
Shi Nu-i?

526
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:46,100
Her last name is Shi, first name Nu-i?

527
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,470
No, not Shi Nu-i, but Shin Woo-hee.

528
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,500
Anyway, why did you call?

529
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,300
Mom called

530
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,720
[and asked me to make sure you're fine.
How are you doing?]

531
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:57,450
I'm done fine. I'm doing so great.

532
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,780
Okay. Good night.

533
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,110
[The person you have reached is
unavailable. Please leave a message...]

534
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,600
Why won't she answer the phone?

535
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:14,300
-Hey! Lee Dan!
-Hey!

536
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,100
-What's up?
-Hey.

537
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,469
What are you doing here?

538
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,699
I was just passing by.

539
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,460
I haven't seen my sister
for a while, so...

540
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,130
What do you mean? You live together.

541
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:23,670
Didn't you know it?

542
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,429
She's not living with me.

543
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,380
She's living with a friend named
Shin Woo-hee to prepare for a contest.

544
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:30,670
What? Shin Woo-hee?

545
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,080
I have never heard of that name.

546
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,280
I also haven't heard about the contest.

547
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,050
Wait. I drove her home two days ago

548
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,760
with my brother's car.

549
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:39,909
What?

550
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:43,380
But she moved out two weeks ago.

551
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:44,570
What?

552
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:48,659
What could it be?

553
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,760
I don't think she's doing
something shady though.

554
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,350
Actually, something weird happened.

555
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:59,310
The most popular guy in our major
is interested in Dam.

556
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,080
You're lying.

557
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,640
I know. It does sound like a lie.

558
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,790
Right! There's one more.

559
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,820
She quit chicken and drinking.

560
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,000
-No way.
-Right?

561
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,820
But it's true. It's been almost two weeks.

562
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:14,670
Wait.

563
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,010
She moved out two weeks ago and
quit chicken and drinking two weeks ago.

564
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,660
Could it be...

565
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,880
she's into something weird?

566
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,570
Something like a cult
where they worship chicken.

567
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,740
-Maybe she lives there and...
-No way.

568
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,600
-Dam.
-Hey, wait.

569
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,190
I'll call her.

570
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,300
Hey, Dam. Where are you?

571
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,940
[The class is finished,
so I'm going home. Why?]

572
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:52,550
Home? You mean the place
where you live with Dan?

573
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,790
[Of course. I've got to go.]

574
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,480
See? She was lying.

575
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,700
Okay.

576
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:05,350
[The next bus is...]

577
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,550
See?

578
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,670
She has to take 171 to go to your place,

579
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,380
but she took that bus.

580
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,620
Wait up.

581
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,090
Wait up.

582
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,780
Sir, where are you coming from?

583
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,230
I went to the publishing company.

584
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,430
You're finished early.

585
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,650
-"Sir"? But he looks so young.
-Let's eat together.

586
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,860
Hey, he must be the priest.

587
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,710
The leader of that cult she got into.

588
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,960
How was it today?
Are you feeling all right?

589
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:06,780
Are you worried about my condition

590
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,930
or the Marble's?

591
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,840
Your condition is the Marble's condition.

592
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:15,270
What are they saying? Why would she talk
about a marble while rubbing her belly?

593
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,690
Hey, it must be the baby's nickname.

594
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,270
My cousin is also pregnant,

595
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,950
and she calls her baby by nickname.

596
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,090
Now it all makes sense.

597
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,640
-She's not into a cult. She's pregnant.
-What?

598
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,800
That's why she can't
drink nor eat chicken.

599
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:27,850
That's why.

600
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,310
Is there anything you want to eat?

601
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,080
I put you through all this,
so tell me anything.

602
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,270
Don't say that.

603
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:36,210
It's not like I'm keeping it forever.
It will come out soon.

604
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,060
See? She's pregnant.

605
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,780
-Shall we go in?
-Let me carry it for you.

606
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,230
It's okay. It's not heavy.

607
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,830
Dam!

608
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:47,960
Dan!

609
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,690
I'm not here for a drink.

610
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:07,890
Come on and explain.

611
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,280
When we talked on the phone last night,
you said you were living with your friend.

612
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,080
Is this man your friend?

613
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:14,890
Well...

614
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,560
You said one of your friends got pregnant

615
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,890
and now she has to live
with a man she doesn't even like.

616
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,700
-It's you, right?
-No, it's not!

617
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,660
Then what is it?

618
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,810
What's that marble

619
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,830
that you won't keep forever
and will come out soon?

620
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,080
You even gave a nickname to your baby.
Stop lying to me.

621
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,360
He's right. Just admit it
so we can give you blessings.

622
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,340
-That's not...
-Do you love my sister?

623
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,580
No.

624
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,680
Still, you're going to marry her, right?

625
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,040
No.

626
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,120
-And you call yourself a human?
-No.

627
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,940
-You scumbag!
-That jerk!

628
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,480
How dare you...

629
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,410
I'm sending them back home.

630
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,130
Their memories will be erased.

631
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,360
What?

632
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,760
Why won't he pick up the phone?

633
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:49,840
[The person you have reached
is unavailable.]

634
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,290
It looks like it's not a big deal to you.

635
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:20,070
Erasing the memories.

636
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,880
How much did you erase?

637
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,960
It looked like he learned about it today,
so I erased today's memories only.

638
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,900
You don't know
how much this day meant to them.

639
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,970
How could you erase their memories
just like that?

640
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,370
I did it
because you seemed to be flustered.

641
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,160
Do you think there was another way?

642
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,320
We could have given it some time
and think--

643
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:44,130
What if more people find out about it
while we think?

644
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,950
Then I might have to erase more memories.

645
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,340
And I don't want to waste my time
doing something annoying like that.

646
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,950
"Something annoying"?

647
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,520
I know there was no other way

648
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:01,470
and I understand that you're right,

649
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,320
but I'm still upset.

650
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,430
You must have someone you care about too.

651
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,450
If that person has to lose memories
because of you,

652
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,960
won't it upset you?

653
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,720
That's not how I think.

654
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,670
I don't think like humans.

655
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,040
Did you at least try to?

656
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:29,280
If you really want to be a human,

657
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:33,770
I think you need to learn
about those emotions.

658
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,810
I hope he's all right.

659
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,700
Dan.

660
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,920
-What?
-Stay still.

661
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,630
Dan!

662
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,890
-Hi, Dam.
-Hi.

663
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,160
Hi.

664
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,110
-What's up?
-What?

665
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,610
I said, what's up?

666
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:23,440
-I was worried.
-Worried about what?

667
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,330
Well...

668
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:28,720
I was wondering
if you're eating and exercising well.

669
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:31,010
I'm doing fine. Now, go.

670
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,250
Go?

671
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:34,880
Well...

672
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,970
I don't think I can be
in that house comfortably now.

673
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,000
I'll be in my room.

674
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,400
Don't mind me and have fun.

675
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,130
-Hey, the toilet is clogged.
-Hey, come in.

676
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,330
Hi, Dam.

677
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,480
-Hi.
-Hi.

678
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,710
Hi.

679
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,020
-Hold on!
-Hey!

680
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,250
-What is it?
-Oh.

681
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,070
-Hi, Dam.
-Hi, Dam.

682
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,700
Oh, hi.

683
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:04,320
I guess I can be in Dan's room.

684
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,030
-Have fun.
-Okay.

685
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,720
-Hey, I'm hungry.
-Me too.

686
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,700
Hi, Dam.

687
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:13,640
Hey, let's just go.
I think we're making her uncomfortable.

688
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,280
What? You said you'd sleep over tonight.

689
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:18,790
She's leaving soon. Right?

690
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,120
Right. I'm leaving soon.

691
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,880
I just came by to take my stuff.

692
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,600
See? Take your stuff and go.

693
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:29,970
Okay.

694
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,040
Have fun. Okay?

695
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,750
-Bye.
-Bye, Dam.

696
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:47,130
Why did I even worry about that punk?

697
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:52,140
If I had known he's doing so well,
I wouldn't have been so mad at Mr. Gumiho.

698
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,770
Right. I wonder how Jae-jin is.

699
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,120
My phone.

700
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,070
[Well done.]

701
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,390
Where is it?

702
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,800
I told you

703
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:13,220
you should be as nice to her

704
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,850
as possible.

705
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,230
You should put her on a pedestal,
not argue with her.

706
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,260
And she's way younger than you.

707
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,700
What if she never comes back?

708
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:28,000
She's not that irresponsible.

709
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:33,460
What's the point of
crying over spilled milk?

710
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:36,360
You should have thought of her
as your last hope.

711
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,860
But look at what you have done.

712
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,040
Don't you feel that urge to become
a human whenever you see me?

713
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:46,220
Unlike when I was a gumiho,
I had a 360-degree turn

714
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:48,290
and now living my life proactively.

715
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,010
Aren't you just envious of me?

716
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,360
After a 360-degree turn,
you're back to where you are.

717
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,750
You little...

718
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,280
Fine, smarty-pants.

719
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:06,110
But if you're so smart,
why haven't you become a human yet?

720
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,630
What's the point of having
so much knowledge

721
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,610
if you can't wheedle a human?

722
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,820
Why don't you
stop improving your knowledge

723
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:18,870
and improve your communication skills
not to offend women?

724
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,140
Hey.

725
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,370
I'm saying this because if you keep
treating her like that, she might leave.

726
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,280
Actually, you might not be able
to see her again.

727
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,170
[Miss Dam, I...]

728
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,060
[I made a mistake.]

729
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:15,230
[I shouldn't have been so mad at you.]

730
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:18,260
[I didn't mean to,
but I seem to have upset you.]

731
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:22,440
[Please be generous and understanding.]

732
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,230
[-I'm sorry.
-I apologize.]

733
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:33,000
Will this make him feel better?

734
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,240
[I didn't mean to,
but I seem to have upset you.]

735
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,840
Oh, you were home.

736
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,260
Yes.

737
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,760
Sir.

738
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:25,100
I...

739
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,730
I...

740
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,940
I lost my phone. Have you seen it?

741
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:37,680
What?

742
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:41,340
I think I left my phone here.
Have you seen it?

743
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,510
Oh. I haven't seen it.

744
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,430
Can I borrow your phone then?

745
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,370
I would like to try calling mine.

746
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,480
Here.

747
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:11,520
There it is.

748
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,280
[Sir]

749
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:25,550
Sir, did you delete my contact?

750
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:29,510
I didn't. I have never saved it.

751
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,420
Oh. I see.

752
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:35,370
Here.

753
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,970
I want you to save it though.

754
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,570
In case of emergency.

755
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:43,860
Okay.

756
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:49,890
[Miss Dam]

757
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,850
[Miss Dam]

758
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,620
Why is there no one?

759
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:58,770
Because there is no one.

760
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:01,370
-Not even family?
-No.

761
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,690
Not even friends?

762
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:05,460
Not really.

763
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:07,270
Don't you have acquaintances?

764
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,470
Are you done using it?

765
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,840
But...

766
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,320
He literally has no one.

767
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,060
At first,

768
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:37,410
I was really going to let you go.

769
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,830
But then it hit me

770
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,570
that I had to stay behind all by myself
to figure this out,

771
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:46,470
and it made me feel hopeless.

772
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:54,650
He must have been really lonely.

773
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:07,370
[Miss Dam]

774
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:19,640
Sir.

775

Well,

776
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:29,320
I think I was a bit rude earlier.

777
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,030
And...

778
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:38,390
thank you for letting me use your phone,

779
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,520
for your dating simulation,

780
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:45,300
and for curing my stomachache.

781
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,190
So...

782
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:52,070
would you like to go
eat some jokbal with me?

783
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:01,970
[Freshly-cooked warm jokbal]

784
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:15,170
Eat up.

785
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,860
It's for you.

786
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,010
I figured out that you liked lean meat.

787
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:22,480
Oh.

788
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,430
We should have gone
to an ox blood restaurant.

789
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,500
You said you liked ox blood.

790
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:37,960
We can ask them to wrap this
for takeout and go.

791
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:41,400
We came here because you like this food.
So enjoy.

792
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,690
That's not why I brought you here.

793
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:49,050
I brought you here
because I wanted to talk to you.

794
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,860
I'm sorry about earlier.

795
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,800
My brother is four years younger than me,
and he acts up sometimes.

796
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:04,760
Then I'm like, "That brat",
and I want to give him a noogie.

797
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:08,450
And I, who is hundreds of years younger
than you, got up against you.

798
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:10,700
It must have seemed
just outrageous to you.

799
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,870
Don't say that.

800
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:18,270
I'm sorry to have upset you,
who is way younger than me.

801
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,650
By the way, Miss Dam,

802
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:27,460
as I said already,
I cannot think like humans.

803
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:32,210
I'm merely copying
what I've seen over a long time.

804
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,730
I guess I can call it a learned sentiment.

805
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,210
So I might be not so good

806
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,370
at empathizing with others

807
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:43,650
and resolving relationship problems.

808
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,540
I'm sorry I didn't understand

809
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:51,090
why you got upset and angry.

810
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:54,390
Don't say that. You are not like me,

811
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,560
and you don't have anyone around you,
so I understand you didn't know...

812
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:01,610
I'm sorry.

813
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,860
Why are you saying you're sorry?

814
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:08,560
I mean, I thought
I might have said it too casually

815
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,930
that you had no one around you.

816
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:13,310
You must have been very lonely.

817
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:18,410
That's also a humans' idea
to think it's lonely to be alone.

818
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:21,710
I rather find it uncomfortable

819
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,470
spending time with others.

820
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,210
I see.

821
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:31,090
Does staying with me
make you feel uncomfortable too then?

822
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,940
Are you coping with the inconvenience
because of the Marble?

823
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,430
Because of the Marble?

824
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:04,880
[From now on,
I'll try not to be scared of you.]

825
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,940
You have to keep your word.

826
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:08,350
I will.

827
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:10,510
[How about Oldmiho?]

828
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,180
["Sir" sounds good to me.]

829
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,560
Let's get inside, sir.

830
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,660
[I'm so envious that you got to live
in so many eras.]

831
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:26,220
[Sir. How about we try]

832
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:29,210
[to live through this day?]

833
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:34,310
[If we repeat that,
I believe good days will come in the end.]

834
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,960
[Let's tough it out together.]

835
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:29,440
[Don't forget about
our date tomorrow. Good night.]

836
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:28,650
[Gye Seon-woo]

837
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:43,480
Has he left already?
I wish he had said bye at least.

838
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:55,140
[Have a good day today,
and call me if you need me.]

839
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:58,530
[And it wasn't
just because of the Marble.]

840
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:02,400
[It is true that being with others
makes me feel uncomfortable,]

841
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:06,010
[but you were okay, Miss Dam.]

842
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:11,640
All right. I'll do this right
for his sake.

843
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:24,490
Is jjajangmyeon okay with you?

844
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:26,110
I thought having jjajangmyeon

845
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,090
with a clear view of Han River
would be better

846
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,460
than having popcorn in a theater.

847
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:31,390
Right. Why not?

848
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:34,560
Here. It will taste good.

849
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:38,740
[You will completely lose your appetite.]

850
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,100
This reminds me of your kindness.

851
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:45,390
I followed your advice
and wrapped the toilet like this.

852
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:47,720
I wrapped it tightly
so the air doesn't go inside.

853
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:57,840
Sorry. That was unappetizing.

854
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,670
[You will completely lose interest in me.]

855
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:04,920
But eat up. It will taste really good.

856
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,760
It looks so tasty.

857
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,700
Oh, no.

858
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:09,860
I took so many pickled radishes, right?

859
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:11,980
That was so selfish of me, right?

860
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:13,690
It's okay.

861
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,940
I can eat jjajangmyeon
without pickled radish.

862
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:17,830
That's great.

863
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,820
[I'll make this more greasy]

864
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:23,150
[than eating jjajangmyeon
without pickled radish.]

865
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:27,200
You know what? There are
three kinds of mayonnaise in Korea.

866
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:28,520
Do you know what they are?

867
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:30,410
No.

868
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,610
Chicken and mayonnaise.

869
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:34,860
Tuna and mayonnaise.

870
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:39,300
And "Don't smile like that,
because that mayonnaise my heart flutter."

871
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:51,270
[What's going on? This is going weird.]

872
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,090
Gosh, Seon-woo.

873
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:29,590
[I'm also okay with staying with you.]

874
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,770
[Actually, I'm more than
just okay with it.]

875
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,840
[I'm just saying.]

876
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:46,970
[Sir, let me share the progress
because I don't want to worry you.]

877
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,860
[Everything is fine here.]

878
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:51,850
[I'm going home early.
Let's have dinner together.]

879
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:20,450
I didn't know it'd rain today.

880
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:22,040
We should call a cab.

881
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:25,030
I spent all my money
buying the jjajangmyeon earlier.

882
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:27,230
Where do you live? I can take you home.

883
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:30,620
That little...

884
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:32,420
Pardon?

885
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:36,600
My little sister stole my money.

886
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:39,770
She does that all the time.
What do we do now?

887
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:41,310
Oh, well.

888
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,570
Let's just run to the bus stop.
It'll take ten minutes from here.

889
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:45,930
Which bus do you take?

890
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:48,920
Well, I haven't taken a bus before.

891
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:50,640
Then what have you been riding?

892
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,000
My car or taxis.

893
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,350
And my car happens
to be in a repair shop today.

894
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,120
Oh, well.

895
01:00:58,340 --> 01:00:59,920
Follow me then.

896
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:02,430
I'll make sure you have a safe bus ride.

897
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,000
Come on!

898
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:41,940
You can take this bus.

899
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:50,170
It's raining so much.

900
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,380
[The bus is arriving soon.]

901
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:01,520
The bus is coming.

902
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:04,470
Take that bus
and get off the bus after nine stops.

903
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:06,840
Okay. Thanks.

904
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,830
Get on the bus now. Have a safe trip home.

905
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:22,020
When you get home safely,

906
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:23,830
please call me.

907
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:43,760
He just ignored me. He must have lost
interest in me completely.

908
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:57,090
I'll be clingy until the last moment.

909
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:16,670
[Lee Dam]

910
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,140
[Seon-woo, are you going home all right?]

911
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:15,220
[I feel bad we had to say goodbye.
Have a safe trip home.]

912
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,040
[Did you get on the bus too?]

913
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:23,540
[Lee Dam]

914
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,810
[I wish my car wasn't in the repair shop.]

915
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:30,620
[Lee Dam]

916
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:24,860
[Okay.]

917
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:41,840
[Gye Seon-woo]

918
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,180
[I had fun today.]

919
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:39,330
[I'm sorry we had to say goodbye
so suddenly.]

920
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:43,550
[Don't worry! I'm having
ox blood soup for dinner today,]

921
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:46,020
[Gye Seon-woo]

922
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:46,500
[so I was planning
on going home early anyway.]

923
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:48,570
[Lee Dam: Don't worry! I'm having
ox blood soup for dinner today.]

924
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:50,730
What's with this tone?

925
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,690
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

926
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:05,910
Both my battery and I are worn out.

927
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:14,350
[Sir]

928
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:53,910
It's raining so much.

929
01:04:57,170 --> 01:04:58,400
[Sir, Battery Low]

930
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:00,950
[Sir, Battery Low]

931
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:42,790
Sir, how did you come all the way here?

932
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:46,580
You weren't answering your phone.

933
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:49,660
Right. I was going to tell you
when I get home.

934
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:52,160
Miss Dam.

935
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:59,160
From now on, always answer my phone.
Even when I'm next to you.

936
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:54,290
[But you were okay, Miss Dam.]

937
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:55,440
[I'm also okay with staying with you.]

938
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,450
[Actually, I'm more than
just okay with it.]

939
01:06:57,810 --> 01:07:00,280
[My Roommate is a Gumiho]

940
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,880
[I'm thinking of going to this place
called school.]

941
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,620
[Don't you need someone
who can observe that girl closely?]

942
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,700
[The first assignment is
"romantic relationship".]

943
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,530
[Lee Dam, Gye Seon-woo]

944
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:13,610
[Speaking of which,
why don't we set a date?]

945
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,150
[How about Saturday?]

946
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:19,240
[I think we need a curfew.]

947
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:20,690
If you break it...

948
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:26,280
[Aren't you nervous, anxious,
and sleepless these days?]

949
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:29,100
[My heart suddenly starts to pound]

950
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:33,410
[and I would suddenly feel dizzy.
What do you think this is?]
