00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,240
about that sir or whatever.

168
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,350
Okay? Are you coming?

169
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,390
-Are you?
-Yes!

170
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,260
Dam, let's stop drinking and go dance.

171
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,160
I need to use the restroom.

172
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,490
Goodness, that girl.

173
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,040
It looks like
she's not ready to say goodbye.

174
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,940
Should I help her out?

175
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:29,110
So his pet name is sir, right? Sir.

176
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,270
[Miss Dam]

177
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,400
[Sir, can you come right now?]

178
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,580
I sent him the address,
so if he isn't over her, he'll come.

179
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,870
Professor Shin?

180
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,310
Professor Shin! What brings you here?

181
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,080
Well, I...

182
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,980
I rarely come to a place like this,

183
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,140
but my friend broke up
with her boyfriend today.

184
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,600
She was having such a hard time,
so I sent him a text message,

185
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,050
and now I'm waiting for him.

186
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,640
I want them to get back together.

187
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,990
I see. So that's what.

188
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,630
Anyway, this is new.

189
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,920
You don't seem like the type
who'd be at a club.

190
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,930
Now that we're here,

191
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,360
why don't we dance to the rhythm?

192
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,260
Why? Professor, you should stay.

193
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,740
Instead of History 101,
let's do Dance 101...

194
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:18,580
Man, why isn't Dam's ex texting back?

195
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,910
He's done with her for good.

196
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,610
Dam.

197
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:25,880
Let's go dance.

198
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,580
You can completely forget
about your ex-boyfriend.

199
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,160
Okay? Let's go.

200
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,790
Let's go.

201
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,270
Goodness, why can't I push this?

202
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,560
Be careful.

203
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,930
Thank you.

204
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,020
That could've been bad.

205
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,540
Sir.

206
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,440
Why are you here?

207
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,140
Because you were crying.

208
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,530
No matter how much I like you,

209
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,610
we have to stop here, right?

210
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,430
Our relationship

211
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,750
is putting other people in danger
as well as us.

212
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,390
Then we should stop here.

213
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,380
Why didn't you just ask me for help?

214
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,680
How could I?

215
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,609
I know how much pain I could put you in

216
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,950
better than anyone else.

217
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,940
I'm sorry

218
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,510
for liking you.

219
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,470
Dam.

220
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,800
You need to wake up.
You have an early class.

221
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:29,860
Hey.

222
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,930
How did I get home last night?

223
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,610
What do you think? You came home wasted.

224
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,330
You blacked out again?

225
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,100
You shouldn't drink so much.

226
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,250
Come out. I made some bean sprout soup.

227
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,460
Was that a dream?

228
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,840
Drink this. You don't look too well.

229
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,640
Are you okay?

230
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,400
Seon-woo.

231
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,560
Could you keep what happened

232
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,330
between Professor Shin and me a secret?

233
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,580
Things are already tough,

234
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,100
so I don't think
I could deal with all kinds of rumors.

235
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,440
I won't tell anyone.

236
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,560
You didn't have to ask me.

237
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,680
Thank you.

238
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,010
It would've been better

239
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,790
if he was a good guy.

240
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,070
If he was such a good man
who was way out of my league,

241
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,120
I think I could've given up.

242
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,120
What are you going to do?

243
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,680
We need to talk.

244
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,270
Have you met with Dam?

245
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,470
She can't seem to understand you?

246
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,760
I have no idea what to do.

247
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,740
Woo-yeo.

248
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,860
What do you think
Dam wants the most right now?

249
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,150
A breakup?

250
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,590
What are you talking about?
You two are over already.

251
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,020
Do you think
she'd be scared of you at this point?

252
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,570
She's not afraid she'll fall into danger.

253
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,870
She's afraid
you're putting other people in danger.

254
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:14,770
Well, I did tell you
that you should try using someone else,

255
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,670
but I haven't thought
of how she would feel.

256
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,940
She's human,
so she wouldn't understand this situation.

257
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,630
So if you want to be loved by a human,

258
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,760
shouldn't you show her how humane you are?

259
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,070
Now, look. Let's say you were driving.

260
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,680
Dam is standing on this side,

261
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,150
and there are five people
on the other side.

262
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,840
If the brake gives out and you have
no choice but to hit one of the two,

263
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,310
-what would you do?
-I'd hit the five.

264
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,770
What if one of them is pregnant?

265
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,490
-I don't care.
-What if there's a kid?

266
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,860
-I don't care.
-What if I'm there?

267
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,800
I don't care.

268
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,840
[How do I turn this guy into a human?]

269
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,930
[Would she be better off with Seon-woo,
with the red thread and all?]

270
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,800
[Wait, Seon-woo is
as less of a human as him anyway.]

271
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,830
[A beast who couldn't become human]

272
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,770
[A man who's worse than a beast]

273
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,000
[Then the question is]

274
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,820
[which one of them will
become a decent human first.]

275
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,690
[Who'll become a decent human first?]

276
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,340
[To be honest,
this is a pretty fair game.]

277
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,520
Are you saying I'm wrong?

278
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,690
Then is it right for me to save
those strangers over Miss Dam?

279
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,610
That's not what I meant,
but I thought you'd hesitate a little.

280
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,450
Why should I?

281
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,310
That's what humans are like,

282
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,690
and I'm sure
that's what she wants from you.

283
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,100
Dam, goodness, you reek of alcohol.

284
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,250
How much did you have to drink?

285
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,650
Let's go relieve our hangover.
I'll buy you soup.

286
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,850
Hey, Hye-sun.

287
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,360
-Let's go.
-I...

288
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,310
I heard Woo-yeo cheated on you.

289
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,760
So you dumped him coldly.

290
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,320
I mean, as you know,
he didn't exactly cheat on me...

291
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,640
Don't take his side.

292
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,150
You two are over,
so you don't have to cover for him.

293
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,130
I can't just be a stranger right away.
My feelings are the same.

294
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:47,090
At first, I couldn't believe what he did.

295
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,540
But then I kind of understood,
yet I still can't.

296
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,620
I feel like such a fool.

297
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,610
It's not your fault.

298
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,040
But it's not Woo-yeo's fault either.

299
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,500
I don't know what you were expecting,

300
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,080
but he's a fox.

301
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:12,700
That means he could've deceived you
much better if he wanted to.

302
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,750
He wouldn't have told you
about that red thread

303
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,510
or how he had been

304
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,100
taking your energy
even though he had the Marble.

305
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,600
And those rumors?

306
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,210
It wouldn't have been difficult
for him to get rid of the rumors.

307
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,830
He could've done better in deceiving you.

308
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,470
But he didn't.

309
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,210
He's not human.

310
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,950
But when it comes to you,

311
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,800
he could be humane.

312
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,930
I know that, but...

313
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,090
His Marble is starting to turn blue.

314
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,990
Why is it turning blue?

315
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,310
You didn't know?

316
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,520
Once his Marble turns blue
instead of red by human energy,

317
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,590
he can become human.

318
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,420
His Marble had been stagnant
for about 1,000 years,

319
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:06,160
but it suddenly turned blue twice
ever since he met you.

320
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,460
And this time, it remained in blue,

321
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,880
although it only changed halfway.

322
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,350
Are you saying
he could really become human?

323
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,850
Do you finally get

324
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:20,810
why Woo-yeo did something
so out of the ordinary?

325
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,200
Hye-sun, I should go see him.

326
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,430
I'm sorry.

327
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,460
Can we talk for a second?

328
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,590
I'm sorry.

329
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,520
I don't know everything
about what I need to do

330
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,690
to live as a human,

331
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,380
but if I made you cry,

332
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,980
it means I was wrong. No questions needed.

333
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,270
If it doesn't bother you

334
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,140
that I'm a fox, not human,

335
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,270
then I'll stay this way.

336
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,700
To me,

337
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,950
this relationship isn't
something I can simply let go.

338
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,460
Then that's the more reason
you should've held me back.

339

If there's someone who can help you,

340
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,850
it should be me, nobody else.

341
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,970
It has to be me. I'm your girlfriend.

342
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,730

00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,080
-Sorry?
-I don't want you to see anyone else

344
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,330
or put them in danger.

345
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:17,230
But I also can't ask you to give up.

346
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,430
So give me the Marble.

-I can't do that.
-Why not? I'm fine with it.

348

349

just because of me.

This isn't the right character.
It's not "faraway".

380

It's "far away from home".

381
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,930
It means a place

I should be mean?

489
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,710
Good. You remember.

490
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,610
You should be meaner to Woo-yeo.

491
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,110
You guys decided to break up.

492
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,280
Tell him you're broken up,
so he should never contact you.

493
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:41,640
This is so random.

494
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,020
Is that necessary?

495
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,570
Think about the pattern in his behavior.

496
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,300
When you drift away from him,
he tries to catch you.

497
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,670
But when you try to catch him,
he runs away.

498
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,180
So if you really want to catch him,

499
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,030
let him go first.

500
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,980
I'm sure even a mere impression
of doing that

501
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,300
would drive him crazy.

502
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,520
I'm not sure. I don't want to do that.

503
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,850
The situation is not so good.

504
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,720
I can't tell you the details,

505
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:16,180
but I can tell you one thing for sure.
That attitude is not going to help.

506
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:19,260
I've seen him for over 700 years.

507
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,670
So trust me.

508
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,320
He needs to be pushed.

509
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,600
To deal with a fox,

510
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,150
you have to be a fox yourself.

511
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,210
Don't be too nice to me.

512
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,820
This is why you get hurt when it's over.

513
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,150
Did she say that

514
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,140
because she likes someone else?

515
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,050
Hey.

516
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,910
I could use some alcohol today. You in?

517
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,280
I know you're busy
hanging out with Hye-sun lately,

518
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,600
but just for today...

519
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,150
Actually, I could use some alcohol too.

520
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,350
What happened here?

521
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,690
Let's go grab a drink.

522
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,800
-Never mind. See you later.
-Dam.

523
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:39,430
Are you not going to ask me what happened?

524
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,100
Do I have to?

525
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,390
I'm not doing so great myself.

526
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,670
Why is that?

527
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:47,960
Did something happen with your boyfriend?

528
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,550
Don't ask me.

529
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,210
I want you to ask me.

530
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:59,800
You're really annoying. What happened?

531
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,270
I am

532
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,490
falling in love with Hye-sun.

533
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,270
I knew it. You helpless romance addict.

534
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,780
And where's the problem?

535
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:17,090
I think we should break up.

536
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,690
It turns out

537
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,810
that Hye-sun likes someone else.

538
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:24,830
Are you sure?

539
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,730
Seeing how she took care of you

540
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,570
at the festival afterparty

541
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,690
and the way she looks at you these days,

542
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,580
I thought she had feelings for you.

543
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,170
No. I think Hye-sun

544
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,430
likes Professor Shin.

545
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,200
What? I don't think that's the case.

546
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,690
Why? Because Professor Shin
is going out with Professor Seo?

547
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,270
No, that's not why.

548
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,470
Anyway, it's not true.

549
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,450
What do you know?

550
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:54,670
I know, you punk. Just drink.

551
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,470
You don't know anything.

552
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,970
-Gosh.
-One stir-fried cartilage and soju please.

553
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,770
-Okay.
-It's so annoying.

554
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,310
My ex keeps texting me.

555
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,210
Why, all of a sudden?

556
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,760
-You know my old friend, Hyeon-cheol.
-Gosh, it's bitter.

557
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:13,010
After I posted a photo of us,
he texted me and asked what we were,

558
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:18,210
saying that seeing me with another man
made him realize how he feels about me.

559
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,850
-Goodness.
-Sorry.

560
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,850
What are you doing?

561
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,140
That was so relatable.

562
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,210
It's like the universe
has given us the answer.

563
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,640
You don't want to break up
with Hye-sun, do you?

564
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,720
Of course not. Why do you ask?

565
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,230
I just came up with a brilliant idea.

566
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,120
[I'm sure even a mere impression]

567
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,110
[of doing that would drive him crazy.]

568
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:52,830
To deal with a fox,
you have to be a fox yourself.

569
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,400
From now on, I'll be a fox too.

570
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,680
A fox?

571

582
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,300
he will beg me not to leave.

583
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,900
I'd like one iced Americano to go, please.

584
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,530
That would be 4,000 won.

Actually, could you make it two?

586

Here. You can have it for free.

590

-Okay.

593

What?

594
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,470
So you're saying
I should make her jealous.

595
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,450
Yes. Who knows?

596
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:46,880
The jealousy might help her realize
her feelings for you.

597
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:50,270
I'm not sure if she even has
feelings for me.

598
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,250
I think she does.

599
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,050
I'm not sure.

600
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,350

-Gosh! Get off me now.
-Goodness.

605
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,630
Finally. I should have
my hands sanitized now.

Give me some too.

00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:28,240
Then tell her it was my idea
and you'd never see me again.

609
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:30,610
I won't just tell her that.
I will actually stop seeing you.
