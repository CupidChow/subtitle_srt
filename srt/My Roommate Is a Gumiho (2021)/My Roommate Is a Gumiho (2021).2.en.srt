Do you think you can take it out?

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,200
I will try.

00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,070
A human cannot hold
the Marble for long anyway.

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,850
How long can a human hold it then?

11

A year, at most.

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,130
That means after one year of holding it,

13
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,800
it will be sorted out somehow.

Is it because this isn't your life?

he was going to teleport? So startling.

Sure.

00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,010
What is this?

137
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,990
I wrote up an agreement.

138
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,070
There are a few things
I need you to keep in your mind.

139
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,550
[Shin Woo-yeo, Party A from hereon.]

[Lee Dam, Party B from hereon.]

141
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,380
Party B is obligated
to keep Party A's Marble safe for a year,

142
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,710
and comply with the clauses below

143
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,390
to keep the Marble safe.

144
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,610
One, no contact with the opposite sex
born in the Year of the Tiger.

145
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,490
Two, quit drinking to stay in good health.

146
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,550
[Liver, you did all the work.
P.S.: We never stayed dry.]

147
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,710
Three, do not consume chickens.

148
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,360
Wait, what is this?

149
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,000
Nothing makes sense
starting with clause one.

150
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:35,300
I can't contact with the opposite sex
born in the Year of the Tiger,

151
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,330
but how would I know
which year they were born in?

152
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,590
Doesn't this basically mean
I cannot be in contact with any men?

153
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,660
-It does.
-What?

154
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,590
Then I can't kiss any guys

155
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,790
and do this or that with them?

156
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,030
This or that?

157
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,140
And I can't drink or eat chicken?

158
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,850
Then why would I want to live?

159
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,590
The Marble is very susceptible
to your condition.

160
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,480
You haven't been living a healthy life

161
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,460
due to excessive drinking.

162
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,310
So it'll be a good idea to quit drinking.

163
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,910
What about chicken?
Why can't I eat chicken?

164
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,160
Tigers are the natural enemy of foxes,
but chickens are fatal for gumihos.

165
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,820
From ancient times, chicken blood
was used to ward off bad luck.

166
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,580
So you better not eat it.

167
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,380
No, I think I should.

168
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,370
I had chicken yesterday,
and I was totally fine.

169
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,540
Are you sure?

170
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,390
Well, I felt a little sick,

171
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,710
but it was tolerable.

172
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,190
That's just the first time.
It can get more dangerous over time.

173
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,030
Gosh.

174
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,160
I mean, I could die in a year,

175
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,260
[Agreement]

176
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,550
but I have to spend
my remaining life feeling depressed?

177
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,860
Miss Dam.

178
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,470
I don't plan on letting you die.

179
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,380
So please trust me,
and let's focus on the things we can do.

180
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,280
I'll look for ways to retrieve the Marble,

181
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,570
and you can focus on keeping it safe.

182
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,180
I think that's the way for you to survive.

183
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,700
-Hey, Dam.
-What?

184
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,340
What happened at the club?
Where did you suddenly go?

185
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,290
Oh, something suddenly came up.

186
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,480
You left without a word?

187
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,490
-Yes.
-What?

188
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,560
My phone died, so I couldn't contact you.

189
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,670
Sorry. Did I keep you guys from partying?

190
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,440
That's not the case.
We had lots of fun partying.

191
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,510
I never get bored if I got some beats.

192
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,140
I got, got, got,

193
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,440
got, got, got, got...

194
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,650
That was loud.

195
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,670
Who the heck drives like that?

196
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,830
I think that's Seon-woo.

197
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,640
What? Gye Seon-woo?
From the class of 2017?

198
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,710
-The playboy?
-Yes.

199
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,100
The legend of the history department
who dated over 20 women, Seon-woo.

200
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,740
We're doing a group project together,
so I know him.

201
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,930
He returned to school.

202
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,069
I'm jealous.

203
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,940
Let's go eat.

204
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,390
Hey, wait for me.

205
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,090
[I'm in class with Seon-woo. Lucky me!]

206
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,970
It's already on Everyday Time.

207
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,990
"I'm in class with Seon-woo. Lucky me!"

208
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,620
Look, there are 300 comments.

209
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,480
Wow, look.

210
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,240
So what? He's a bad playboy

211
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,090
who makes women cry a river.

212
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,400
Doesn't that sound better than you,

213
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,900
who gets played on?

214
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,790
No.

215
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,870
I think it's better that I cry
than to make someone else cry.

216
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,890
I've been hurt a lot,

217
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,400
but I love how I never hurt anyone else.

218
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,070
What? Have you been going to church?

219
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,570
It's what Dam said yesterday.

220
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,900
She said I should be good to myself
because I'm a good guy.

221
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,200
Did you read a book
written by Monk Bopjong?

222
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,230
That's the alcohol talking.

223
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,340
Anyway, I finally realized this
after hearing that.

224
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,410
Before I try so hard to get loved,

225
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,810
I need to learn to love myself.

226
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,530
After I made that decision,

227
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,770
I realized how loveable I am.

228
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,180
-You are?
-Yes.

229
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,070
I looked myself in the mirror,

230
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,320
and my face looked so good.

231
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,340
Then when I grabbed the bus strap,

232
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,790
my biceps looked so hot.

233
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,740
Then I have a mid-low range voice,

234
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,330
which makes me sound so sweet.

235
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,890
So lame, so stop talking
before I shoot you.

236
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,540
I'm leaving. I have to go get some books.

237
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,130
Why? You aren't going to finish?

238
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,270
I'm full.

239
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,630
-Bye.
-Bye.

240
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,890
[Okay. In order to survive,]

241
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,050
[I have to keep the Marble safe.]

242
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,880
Excuse me.

243
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,520
[Isn't he Gye Seon-woo?]

244
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,400
[The class of 2017,
born in the Year of the Tiger!]

245
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,140
You dropped this.

246
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,960
I'm sorry, but could you

247
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,640
just leave it on the floor?

248
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,980
-What?
-Just leave it on the floor.

249
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,850
Thank you.

250
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,760
What's with her?

251
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,000
[What? Cohabitation?]

252
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,340
I get that the Marble
just rolled into that woman,

253
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,250
but how did you of all people
decide to live with a human woman?

254
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,480
Well, at first,
I thought it seemed interesting,

255
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,590
so I wanted to keep her by my side, and...

256
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,040
And? What?

257
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,190
Forget it.

258
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,480
Why won't you finish your story?

259
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,640
Why? Is she your type?

260
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,060
Did you finally meet your ideal type
who opened you up

261
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,000
after hundreds and hundreds of years?

262
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,290
Don't be so cheeky.

263
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,840
She's a human
who's still wet behind the ears.

264
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,100
Wet behind the ears? Like with blood?

265
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,530
What did you do to make her bleed?
Did you beat her?

266
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,840
It's a figure of speech.

267
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,660
It's used to express
when someone is very young,

268
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,900
a figure of speech.

269
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,420
I see. Is that so?

270
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,170
There are way too many things
I have to remember as a human.

271
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,030
I have to memorize idioms and neologisms.

272
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,550
And to order a croque monsieur,

273
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,400
I have to memorize English too.

274
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,420
That's French.

275
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,560
I can't believe how you managed
to be annoying for 700 years.

276
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:32,100
I'm sure it'll be very tough
for that human woman who lives with you.

277
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,090
Anyway, does she know she can end up dead

278
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,240
if the Marble keeps taking her energy?

279
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,770
I'm not going to let her die.

280
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,460
Okay. I'm glad you made that decision.

281
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,730
I hope you won't have to take the Marble
from her dead body

282
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,140
like back then.

283
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,060
Anyway,

284
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,610
there's something I'd like to ask.

285
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,020
-Dam!
-No, don't catch me!

286
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,050
Are you okay?

287
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,690
You're in the class of 2017.
Aren't you a tiger?

288
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,500
I was born early, so I'm a rabbit.

289
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,960
Early? You were born early in the year.

290
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,730
Thank you so much
for being born in the Year of the Rabbit.

291
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,640
I'm very glad that you're a rabbit.

292
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,450
Did you come to school drunk again?

293
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,700
-No.
-Anyway, have you heard?

294
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,060
We're doing a general assembly.

295
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,670
I can't be there.
I'm currently staying away from drinks--

-I'm there.

297
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,540
I can go. I'll be there. I'm coming.

298
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,400
Okay. Go.

00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,950
Hey, don't people usually refer
to pork or beef as meat?

307
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,750
This is just chicken.

308

-Why? You're crazy for chicken.
-You do.

309

I am. So I'm about to go crazy.

00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,800
-Hey, Seon-woo.
-Over here!

324
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,950
-Hello, Seon-woo.
-Hey!

325
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,020
-Why are you so late?
-Hey, Seon-woo.

326
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,180
-Have you been well?
-I thought you weren't coming.

327
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,680
-Hey, grab a drink.
-Grab a drink.

328
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:03,920
Here.

329
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,130
-A toast?
-Okay, let's make a toast.

330
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,020
-Okay.
-Cheers.

331
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,550
Hey, I can't do this. I'm leaving.

332
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,310
-Already? You haven't eaten.
-Hey.

333
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,540
Yes.

334
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,590
I have to leave.
Could you take a step aside?

335
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,190
You're leaving?
Let's grab a drink together.

336
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,640
Things are too loud over there.

337
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,160
Stay, Dam. You couldn't be here
even if you wanted to in your fourth year.

338
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,360
You should sit
just as our senior suggests.

339
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,570
Yes, we aren't that rude. Take a seat.

340
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,190
Goodness.

341
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,280
I'm sorry for the group project.

342
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,270
It's okay. Things can happen
right after you get discharged.

343
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,530
-Are you Jae-jin's friends?
-Yes, Choi Soo-kyung.

344
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,980
I'm pretty and the top of my class,

345
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,880
so people call me
the Kim Tae-hee of Seogwa University.

346
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,300
That's your nickname?
No one ever calls you...

347
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,890
-Aren't you going to drink?
-I have bad kidneys.

348
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,890
-Then some chicken...
-I love animals.

349
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,030
Lee Dam, are you insane?
What's this crazy talk?

350
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,830
-Shut up.
-Lee Dam?

351
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,960
Your name is one syllable? Dam?

352
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,590
Yes, right.

353
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,650
Do you know my name?

354
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,240
You're Gye Seon-woo.

355
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,170
Let's be acquaintances from now on.

356
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:05,440
Let me pour you one too.

357

[-What's with her?
-What's with this guy?]

[-What's wrong with you?
-What's wrong with you?]

359
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,560
I have to take this.

360
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,810
Hey, Eun-jung. Yes.

361
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,570
-My gosh.
-I can talk.

362
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,080
You have bad kidneys?

363
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,840
-What?
-You loved animals?

364
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,350
What? Oh, right.

365
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,420
I have to go. See you tomorrow.

366
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Hey, go home after Seon-woo comes back!

367
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,480
Okay.

368
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:03,960
Are you okay?

369
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,410
Did she just roll over
trying to avoid touching me?

370
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,410
What's wrong, Miss Dam?

371
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,920
What's wrong, you ask?

372
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,360
I fell over trying to avoid a guy
born in the Year of the Tiger.

373
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:51,920
And I went to a chicken place
for the general assembly,

374
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,690
but couldn't eat anything there.

375
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,560
I was the only one
who ate the macaroni salad.

376
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,630
I see.

377
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,770
"I see"? That's all?

378
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,980
I had such a tough time today,
yet you sound so indifferent.

379
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,140
I went through so much today,

380
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,810
especially staying away from chicken.

381
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,620
You must know how it feels
to turn down a fried chicken.

382
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,300
I don't.

383
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,700
You liar!

384
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,780
There's a crunchy and chewy chicken
lying there in front of me,

385
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,650
[Crunchy, yummy]

386
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:24,170
yet I felt tortured
because I couldn't even take a bite.

387
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,260
[Bam! Give me my drumstick!]

388
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,560
You really don't know what it's like?

389
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,090
I really don't.

390
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,980
Why don't you know?

391
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,670
Because I don't eat chicken.

392
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,650
Right.

393
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:45,380
Then changed that into something you like
and think of the same situation.

394
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,590
Yes, these cigarettes.

395
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,710
How do you think you'd feel
if you suddenly had to stop smoking?

396
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,220
I'll just stop, then.

397
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,870
I doubt it.
I heard it's really tough to quit smoking.

398
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,690
Some say you should never associate
with those who quit smoking,

399
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,070
because they're the most persistent type.

400
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,130
I'm not sure.

401
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,040
That's for humans,
who have a very weak will.

402
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,580
Smoking was just a means
that helped me spend my tedious days.

403
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:17,230
I'm not exactly addicted,
so I think I'll be fine.

404
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,970
Then quit smoking.

405
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,830
-What?
-Quit smoking.

406
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,830
You do know
secondhand smoking is bad for me, right?

407
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:30,080
So please quit smoking
for the sake of the Marble.

408
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,900
Now that we're on the subject,
I want an agreement too.

409
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:36,510
I'd like to make three requests
just as you did, Mr. Gumiho.

410
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,560
What are these?

411
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,550
[Lee Dam, Party A from hereon.]

[Shin Woo-yeo, Party B from hereon.]

413
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,290
B is obligated
to keep A and A's Marble safe,

414
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,800
and comply with the clauses below

415
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,550
[Agreement]

[Share, Cold gaze, Smoking]

[1. Find a way to retrieve the Marble out
and share the progress every Friday.]

419
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,270
The first rule is already ridiculous.

420
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,510
What do you mean, "share the progress"?

421
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,020
Well, you've been only coming up
with lame ideas.

422
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,390
This way, you will try harder

423
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,150
so you have something to share with me.

424
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,090
All right.

425
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,110
Then what does the second one mean?

426
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,670
"No cold gaze"?

427
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,690
Let's be honest. A gumiho can look scary

428
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,490
even when it smiles.

429
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,560
Whenever you give me a cold look,
I feel a bit...

430
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,150
When did I look at you like that?

431
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,710
Just now.
And also sometimes when you pass by.

432
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,410
Well, we talked
about the number three already,

433
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,090
so could you sign it now?

434
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,620
It's going to be hard, right?
Especially number three.

435
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,560
If you think you can't do it,
we can make a deal.

436
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,580
For example, I can let you smoke

437
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,380
if you let me eat chicken
every two weeks...

As it's written on the agreement,

you must find a way
to retrieve the Marble out

Well, not yet.

Where's the spirit you showed me
when we first met?

457
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,139
You used to take the Marble seriously

458
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,300
and had the guts to ask me to move in.

459

00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,470
I once worked as a trader
during the reign of Jeongjo.

643
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:51,280
Gosh, that's amazing.

644
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,920
What's that?

645
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,660
It's a sketch.

646
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:07,650
I once worked for the science department.

647
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,770
You were a scientist?
You were such an elite.

648
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:13,240
And what else have you done?

649
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,350
[During the reign of Seonjo,
I fought against Japanese,]

650
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:24,330
[leading the country to victory.]

651
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:29,340
You were in the military too.

652
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:31,850
That's why there are
swords and bows there.

653
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:34,490
-Gosh.
-Miss Dam.

654
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:37,570
You seem to be very interested
in history, unlike most young people.

655
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:40,120
Haven't I told you yet?
I major in history.

656
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:42,500
Some kids applied for this major
because of their grades,

657
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,610
but in my case,
it's because I love history.

658
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,910
I have always liked to watch
historic dramas since I was little.

659
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,470
Gosh.

660
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:57,410
I want to be a museum curator
after graduation.

661
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,920
But I'm not sure if I can live until then.

662
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:03,700
Anyway, this is really cool.

663
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:06,120
I have always wanted
to travel back in time like in TV series

664
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:08,150
if I could.

665
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,800
I'm so envious that you got to live
in so many eras.

666
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,600
How does it feel to live a long life?

667
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,400
Nothing. It doesn't feel anything.

668
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:31,560
Oh, there's a pipe too.

669
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:37,140
Have you used it yourself?

670
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,870
-Yes.
-Since when?

671
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,250
Since cigarettes were imported in 1592.

672
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,010
1592?

673
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,300
When Japan invaded Korea?

674
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:49,860
Have you been smoking cigarettes
for over 400 years then?

675
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:51,750
And I made you quit that?

676
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:55,980
Just keep on smoking.

677
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,840
What am I to stop
your 400-year-standing habit?

678
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:02,360
Actually, I thought it would be easy.

679
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,420
I thought it shouldn't be too hard

680
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:06,930
to change one habit.

681
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:09,880
But it turned out to be hard.

682
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:12,430
It made me realize that I might have made
unreasonable demands.

683
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:16,080
So I want to keep myself from smoking
during the contract period.

684
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:18,200
To share your pain.

685
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,360
I'm okay though.

686
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,410
So you have been smoking for 400 years.

687
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,300
Then how old are you?

688
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,690
I'm 22. Born in 1999,
the Year of the Rabbit.

689
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:33,460
I'm 999. Born in 1012, during the reign
of Hyeonjong of Goryeo.

690
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:35,090
-Relax.
-I mean...

691
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,910
Now I hear your actual age,
I realize how ancient you are.

692
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:43,060
As a matter of fact,
you've been scolding me so much

693
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,560
I felt like I was living
with a great grandpa.

694
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:46,970
But if you think about it,

695
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,140
you've lived longer than
my great great grandpa.

696
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:54,140
Now I get why you have been speaking
like a fossil...

697
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,730
Oh, it's a wind chime.

698
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:03,340
It's so pretty.

699
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:08,180
I have seen fish-shaped sails,

700
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:10,110
but I haven't seen
a leaf-shaped one like this.

701
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,020
You can have it if you like it.

702
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,240
Are you sure?

703
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:19,880
It looks at least a few hundred years old.

704
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,700

710
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,620
You quit cigarettes, which you have been
smoking for over 400 years.

711
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:58,780
And I've been eating chicken
for only 20 years.

712

What's all this?

716

You can't eat your favorite food, chicken,

717
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:09,790
and I felt bad
to put you through such pain.

718
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,860
So I made spicy stir-fried chicken
using duck.

00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:18,400
Yum woon sen?

804
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,080
Now yum woon sen earned me some time,

805
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:25,360
let's see what I can do.

806
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:28,480
[Clogged toilet]

807
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:29,540
[Gye Seon-woo]

808
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,200
[I found a way.]

809
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:40,890
As you said, I wrapped the toilet.

810
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,110
[Gye Seon-woo]

811
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,300
Now, try flushing it.

812
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,850
[I Use Plastic Bags to Unclog the Toilet]

813
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:45,420
Then the plastic will be bloated.

814
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:46,650
Press it hard.

815
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,960
It worked! It's unclogged, Seon-woo!

816
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:10,240
Thank you!

817
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,520
From now on,
I'll call you the Toilet Fairy.

818
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:13,840
You don't need to call me that.

819
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:15,730
You don't have
to give me 800 won back either.

820
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:17,710
This doesn't make up for it.

821
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:19,740
-Let's go out and eat.
-Sure.

822
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:21,230
It's on me. It's totally on me.

823
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,860
Thank you so much, Seon-woo.

824
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:24,180
Thank you!

825
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,870
Thank goodness.

826
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:33,470
That was horrible.

827
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,100
She was actually unclogging a toilet.

828
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,850
Now, the pressure is
off both my mind and stomach.

829
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,250
Especially, my stomach.

830
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:55,200
It feels like my stomach is totally empty.

831
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:01,050
Oh, no.

832
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,960
Sir, I have a problem.

833
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,730
I think the Marble came out.

834
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:09,280
Could you see
if the Marble is still there?

835
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:15,490
The Marble is fine.

836
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:17,330
Really?

837
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:19,310
Thank goodness.

838
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:21,650
-Did something happen?
-It's just that

839
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:23,140
I had a serious stomachache

840
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:24,640
and pooped so hard

841
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:26,660
I felt like all my organs came out.

842
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,600
I was worried the Marble also...

843
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:30,710
But it's fine.

844
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:37,180
Anyway, I'm glad the Marble is fine.

845
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:53,850
Hey.

846
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:57,550
Can I have a slice of pizza?

847
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,050
Are you sure?

848
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:01,110
What about esophagitis and gastritis?

849
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,050
Actually, I gave it some thoughts.

850
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:04,940
You see, cars need oil to move.

851
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:07,930
I think humans need some oil too to move.

852
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:09,430
I love fat.

853
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,510
Sure. Help yourself.

854
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,750
Thank you.

855
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:18,980
It's so tasty.

856
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:28,570
I have one question.

857
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,900
For me? What is it?

858
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:35,080
Losing the Marble would be
a good thing for you.

859
01:01:35,170 --> 01:01:37,320
Right. That's what I want.

860
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,350
Then why were you so relieved

861
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,160
when I said the Marble was still there?

862
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:45,550
I do wish the Marble is gone,

863
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,660
but I wish it happens safely.

864
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:51,050
I don't want the Marble
to go to the sewer.

865
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,810
I don't only care about my own life.

866
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,280
I care about the Marble
and your dream too.

867
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:57,830
I'm not that selfish.

868
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:06,800
Why don't you have some too?

869
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:10,540
I don't appease my hunger with human food.

870
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:12,570
Human food is like some sort of snack

871
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:14,860
I eat for pleasure from time to time.

872
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,020
Then why did you cook earlier?

873
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,340
I told you.

874
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:22,600
I made it because I felt bad
that I put you through the pain.

875
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:26,600
Then did you get these...

876
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:28,580
I got them for you.

877
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:33,340
Oh, I see.

878
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:44,730
This goes to plastic
and this goes to plastic bags. Right?

879
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:46,050
Yes.

880
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:48,820
From now on, I'll make sure
to recycle trash.

881
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,500
Right. Can we talk about
how we address each other?

882
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:57,450
I don't feel comfortable
calling you Mr. Gumiho all the time.

883
01:02:57,930 --> 01:03:00,530
Since I call you by your name,
you can call my name too.

884
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:02,240
No, I can't do that.

885
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:04,660
You're 977 years older than me.

886
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:08,180
It's like I can't call
the king of a country by his name.

887
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,600
I think it's disrespectful.

888
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:13,680
How about Mr. Landlord?

889
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:18,830
Well, maybe it sounds like
you would push me to pay rent.

890
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,260
How about Mr. Ancestor?

891
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:28,290
Well, I guess it sounds like
you'd take food from an ancestral rite.

892
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,280
How about "sir"?

893
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,960
How about Oldmiho?
It's short for Old Gumiho.

894
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:38,590
"Sir" sounds good to me.

895
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,330
It's "sir" then.

896
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:44,130
Let's get inside, sir.

897
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:47,210
Sir.

898
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:50,770
"Sir"...

899
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:14,230
He's sweeter

900
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:17,000
and more caring than I thought.

901
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:18,850
And...

902
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,500
How does it feel to live a long life?

903
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:26,550
Nothing. It doesn't feel like anything.

904
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:30,460
He looks a bit lonely too.

905
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,030
Sir.

906
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,770
Why haven't you go to bed yet?

907
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:23,190
Well, I was doing my assignment
and I got sleepy,

908
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,900
so I came out to get some fresh air.

909
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,740
It's hard, right?

910
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:43,430
You seem tired, so I was worried.

911
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:48,620
Until now, I have been thinking
only about my situation,

912
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:51,740
but earlier when I visited the basement,

913
01:06:51,830 --> 01:06:55,620
I realized how long you have been living.

914
01:06:56,060 --> 01:07:00,410
For such a long time, you had one dream.

915
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:04,330
And it can all go down the drain,

916
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,190
so I can only imagine how hard it must be.

917
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:11,590
I feel a bit bad too,
because it feels like it's my fault.

918
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:15,330
Why would you feel bad?

919
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,220
Just because.

920
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:21,880
You know what? How about we try

921
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:24,570
to live through this day?

922
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:28,090
If we repeat that,
I believe good days will come in the end.

923
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:30,820
Let's tough it out together.

924
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:38,870
I'll go inside now.

925
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,460
Don't think too much.

926
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:32,810
[Anyway, there's something
I'd like to ask.]

927
01:08:33,649 --> 01:08:36,370
Did you even want to become a human?

928
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,810
To be honest, after what happened,

929
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:43,149
I thought you gave up hope.

930
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,240
Who is she to turn you like this?

931
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:52,040
You already know
how to take the Marble out.

932
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:02,510
-Miss Dam.
-Yes?

933
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:11,310
Let me check one thing.

934
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:38,330
You can go back now.

935
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:42,640
Just think

936
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:46,470
all this was a dream.

937
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,560
I'll get going.

938

[My Roommate is a Gumiho]

940
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:24,230

943
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:31,620
How can I help you?

944
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,560
-Go on a date with me.
-A date?

945
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:37,300
It may be just a simulation,
but I thought I should dress properly.

01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:42,890
Hold it in

949
