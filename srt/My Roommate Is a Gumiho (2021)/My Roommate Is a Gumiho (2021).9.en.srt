Young man.

129
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,400
You shouldn't drink so much
and cause trouble to Dam...

130

And cause inconvenience
to people around you.

131

Yes, sir. I'll be careful from now on.

[That's called jealousy.]

133

Be honest with me.
You were jealous to see them together.

134
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,260
Did you lose your conscience
when you lost your Marble?

135
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,809
Not only did you fall for such a kid,

136
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,970
but you also got jealous of another kid.

137
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:43,690
You're far from
becoming a decent human in many ways.

138
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,880
What? What do you want?
What can you do anyway?

139
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,370
What I said is true.

140
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,030
You once said that

141
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,310
we never had a happy ending
whenever we started having feelings.

142
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,160
You're right.

143
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,120
I've seen that bad ending once before,

144
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,610
then I lived for a very long time
without showing affection to anybody.

145
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,620
Everything seemed futile since that day,

146
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,010
and I couldn't see any hope.

147
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,030
What's going on?
Why are you suddenly so sentimental?

148
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,570
You were in pain every time
you were in love.

149
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,620
So how did you
let yourself fall back in love?

150
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,450
What do you think about him?

151
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,150
Are you setting me up with him?
He's not my type.

152
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,160
You're insane.

153
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,790
I just want to know how he seems

154
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,210
compared to me.

155
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,800
In a nutshell, you want to know
which one of you two is better.

156
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,330
You're better.

157
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,260
Honestly speaking,
if you keep your mouth shut,

158
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,850
you'd usually be the hottest guy.

159
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,040
Really?

160
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,320
Hey, go buy yourself
something you want to eat.

161
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,490
If I wasn't your sister,
I'd date you right away.

162

So what happened?

167
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,980
Did someone say he's better?
Who's this crazy witch?

168
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,180
Cut it out before I take it back.

169
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,760
Yes, sir.

Wasn't I right? Isn't he interested?

So? Are you going to date him?

176

Did you tell him about a close guy friend
that comes and sleeps over?

177

Shut your mouth, dummy.

That won't happen between us,

on an anniversary trip with a boyfriend.

Are things not going well with Seon-woo?

Yes, it's disrespectful
for history and artifacts

-Yes.

It must be tough
to be the student representative.

Professor Seo only adores Seok,

I get on Professor Shin's good side.

Why was he there?

No idea. I'm not really sure,
but he was in Hye-sun's car.

232

Wait, why would a professor
meet with a student outside of school?

that it feels like I've touched it.

322
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,770
Let's move on.

323
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,900
Here.

324
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,460
Oh, thank you.

325
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,890
Professor Shin!

326
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,320
You're here.

327
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,010
Goodness, we've all been waiting for you.

328
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,140
-I'm so glad he came.
-He's so tall.

329
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,030
And he's good-looking.

330
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,580
Why is he suddenly here?

331
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,320
Dam, may I ask you for a favor?

332
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,730
What is it?

333
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,850
Professor Shin will be
in charge of your club from now on.

334
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,890
Since you're the president,
you can hop on his car

335
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,250
and update him briefly.

336
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,570
Me?

337
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,650
Wait, I'm not ready
to give him a briefing,

338
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,370
and it's still awkward.

339
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,260
Then I'll do it.

340
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:28,920
I was about to get sick
from the bus ride. Is that okay?

341
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,510
Sure.

342
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,270
Is that okay, Dam?

343
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,570
Sure. Please do that for me.

344
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,980
Okay.

345
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,630
Professor Shin Woo-yeo.

346
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,980
Wait for me.

347
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,890
[Is there really something
going on between them?]

348
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,220
Please excuse me.

349
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,020
I can't believe you drove here
just because of that picture.

350
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,750
A fox shouldn't be so clear
about his intentions.

351
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,790
Why says I came here
because of the picture?

352
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,250
It's all right. You can be honest.

353
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,140
I sent it to you to make you come.

354
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,180
Anyway, if you like her so much,

355
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,260
why don't you hurry and turn into a human
so you can meet her again?

356
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,730
What's on your mind?

357
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,940
You drove down at once to see her,
but you look so gloomy.

358
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,550
I'm concerned about something.

359
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,190
Concerned? What are you concerned about?

360
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,550
Yes.

361
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,900
Yes, I understand. Yes, Ms. TA.

362
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,530
There has been a change
in our next destination.

363
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,160
Why? Is there a problem?

364
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,840
There was a rockslide
near Songni Mountain,

365
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,510
so we can't make it to Beopju Temple.

366
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,470
Then where are we going?

367
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,720
-Take one for me too.
-All right!

368
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,390
-Stop that.
-I want one with Seon-woo too.

369
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,240
-Let's take a picture.
-Let's do that.

370
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,170
-Let's do it over there.
-Okay.

371
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,330
-Okay.
-Let's take one too, Seon-woo.

372
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,530
-All right.
-Okay!

373
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,640
Seon-woo, let's take a picture.

374
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,630
[I had no idea he brought me here
to erase my memories,]

375
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,250
[so I wished
we could come back here together.]

376
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,910
[I must've looked ridiculous]

377
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,240
[as I wished for the impossible.]

378
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,390
Why are you staring at her?
Do you like her that much?

379
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,120
I don't think her memories are erased.

380
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,490
Right, I'm sure her memories aren't...

381
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,530
What?

382
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,300
It's carved with many shapes
such as dragons, lotuses, and more.

383
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,550
When you touch it, it...

384
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,540
"Touch it"?

385
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,390
Right.

386
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:26,420
I meant that it's so exquisite
that it feels like I've touched it.

387
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,390
That's impossible.

388
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:35,040
If she knows everything,
there's no reason for her to pretend.

389
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,900
That's true, but...

390
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,110
Hye-sun, try this.

391
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,040
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

392
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,450
-Thanks.
-Don't.

393
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,440
-Gosh, it's so good.
-I'll do it.

394
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:02,980
No, it's okay. I will.

395
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,260
No, I'll do it.

396
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,350
Hey, what's going on between you two?

397
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:11,160
Do I smell love instead of pork belly?
Good luck!

398
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:17,540
-Seon-woo.
-Our meat is a mess too.

399
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,870
-It's completely burnt.
-Take a seat.

400
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:30,130
-A random game that we love.
-A random game that we love.

401
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,720
-Which game? Game, start.
-Which game? Game, start.

402
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,930
Hey, are you sharing your soju with me?

403
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,120
What? You're drunk.

404
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,190
No, are you sharing your soju with me?

405
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,770
You're so drunk.

406
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,330
-I'm not drunk.
-Don't drink too much.

407
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,970
I've had just enough. It wasn't that much.

408
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,430
Do you know what it's like to get drunk?

409
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,800
I'm not drunk.

410
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,530
Where are you going?

411
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,600
To get some air.

412
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,810
Hye-sun.

413
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,370
I have a question.

414
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,790
Why did you

415
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,220
speak casually with the professor?

416
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,900
I did? Did I do that?

417
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,930
Yes, you did.

418
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:25,870
She did, right? Didn't she?

419
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,130
Hey, Hye-sun used to live abroad,

420
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,420
so the Korean language isn't easy for her.

421
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,480
You're so drunk.

422
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,220
Come on out. Let's get some fresh air.

423
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,290
Come. I'll buy you ice cream.

424
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,550
Okay! Dam, I'll be back.

425
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,980
Hey, Hye-sun.

426
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,410
May I ask you a question?

427
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,220
What is it?

428
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,420
Well.

429
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,620
You said you and Professor Shin
got into an accident, right?

430
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,770
What happened?

431
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,170
It was just a minor collision.

432
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,120
I drove into his car
and caused the accident,

433
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,060
so I gave him a ride.

434
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,300
I see.

435
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,490
Why do you want to know?

436
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,970
No, it's nothing.

437
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,080
Where's my wallet?

438
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,620
-It's so cold.
-It's really gone.

439
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,740
Why do you always lose your wallet?

440
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,850
-It's really gone.
-Come on.

441
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,180
Guys, I'm tired. I should go.

442
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,200
Hey, Dam, wait.

443
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,130
I remember putting it in my bag.

444
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:08,520
You were right. She remembers everything.

445
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:12,790
She asked why we were together that night.

446
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,120
She's very concerned about you,

447
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,810
which means she must remember everything.

448
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,610
Then why is she...

449
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:29,200
If that really is the case,
I think I know why.

450
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,350
She must feel the same as I did back then.

451
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,860
Goodness.

452
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,160
[In mourning]

453
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:48,830
Oh no.

454
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,690
Please erase my memories.

455
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,930
Please, I ask of you.

456
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,180
I guess he passed as we expected.

457
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,660
Do you want me to erase everything?

458
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,090
No, just...

459
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,020
Just leave a little bit behind.

460
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,520
Just enough
so I wouldn't want to kill myself.

461
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,080
She probably didn't want to lose

462
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,740
all the memories she made with you,

463
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,780
so she is trying to hold onto
at least some of them.

464
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:23,640
Miss Dam.
Do you remember what I said then?

465
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,430
I said I had never had a family,

466
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,240
but I felt like I got one now.

467
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,030
I really meant what I said.

468
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,380
You won't remember a thing.

469
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,680
You just had a short dream.

470
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,090
As of now,

471
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,440
the contract has ended.

472
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,490
[He looked sad when he said that.]

473
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,930
[Maybe he let me go]

474
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:06,720
[because he cared about me.]

475
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,720
-Miss Dam.
-Yes?

476
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,640
Your memories aren't erased, are they?

477
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,030
I'm not sure what you mean.

478
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,130
You remember everything.

479
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,030
Why do you want to know that, sir?

480
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,800
Miss Dam?

481
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,670
Why do you want to know
if my memories have been erased or not?

482
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,140
Why are you doing this to me?

483
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,640
It's not like I borrowed your money
and never paid you back

484
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,150
or stole your money.

485

[So she actually remembers me.]

487
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:42,330
I told you I was a clingy person.

488
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,750
So why did you
have to show up like this and...

489
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,680
We need to talk, Miss Dam.

490
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,360

491
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,160
Don't talk to me.
Don't act like you know me.

492
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,660
Don't do anything.

493
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,820
You ended it without asking me.
So why are you doing this to me?

494
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,040
Stop worrying about me.

495
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,240
Stop grabbing my hand so randomly.

496
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,000
Because that makes my heart flutter.

497

498

499

Was I nothing but just a Marble carrier?

502
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,720
Was I?

503
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,590
Have you really never had
any feelings for me?

Miss Dam.

505
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,890
The reason why I don't say
what you want to hear

506
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,330
is not because I don't care about you.

507
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,860
It's because you don't deserve me.

508

You should be with someone
who is safer and more normal.

I don't think I'm too good for you.

512
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,000
And I don't want to be calculative and all

513
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:14,550
because I'm not taking this lightly.

514
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:20,050

515

518

519

of that stupid memory for nothing.

Why? Because I couldn't find you.

I wanted to tell you.

-Yes. The thing is,

you said you were fine,
but it kept bothering me,

563
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,720
so I put all my useable items
on the flea market app.

564

And they just got all sold out.

what I owe to you.

and I'm paying it back.

644
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:18,700
-Does it make you uncomfortable?
-No way. I love it.

645
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:20,680
I want to be with you all the time.

646
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,080
[Maybe I was too honest.]

647
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:27,720
[But that's how I feel.]

648
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,120
Sir.

649
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:35,990
As you know, I have never been
in a relationship before.

650
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:36,340
[Professor of History, Shin Woo-yeo]

651
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,230
So I don't know what I should do.

652
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:42,550
I may be a little clumsy,
but please be understanding.

653
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,660
Of course, I will.

654
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:48,220
I might ask you weird things
from time to time.

655
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:52,360
-What, for example?
-Can I hold your hand?

656
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:57,590
I've been controlling myself
for a very long time,

657
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,000
and I can't seem to anymore.

658
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,630
Here. Hold it.

659
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,870
I got a little nervous,
but it wasn't that weird.

660
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,560
I could have asked you
something even stranger.

661
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,130
Even stranger?

662
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,430
Just kidding. Relax.

663
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,590
Now I want to tease you even more.

664
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,380
Go on and ask me anything.

665
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:58,310
I don't think
I have any further questions.

Relax. Now I want to tease you even more.

[He's a fox after all.
I should know my place.]

670
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,780
Do you have any plans for this evening?

671
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:15,470
-I'll go home and unpack my...
-How about we go on a date?

672
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,630
I'd love to.

673
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:23,700
He thinks it's important
to be neat and dressed nicely,

674
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:25,860
so I'll skip those that don't look neat.

675
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:28,940
Something like this?
Maybe this is too serious.

676
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,970
He thinks one must be clean-cut,

677
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,480
so I shouldn't be untidy.

678
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,990
It's so convenient because it's wireless.

679
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,600
He probably doesn't know
high-tech products like this.

680
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:46,140
I should get him one too.

681
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,920
It looks nice.

682
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:07,740
If I look too formal,
we won't look good together.

683
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,600
Our first date.

684
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,450
Sir.

685
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,610
My. You look so young in that outfit.

686
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,930
You look amazing.

687
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,010
You look like you're only 800 years old.

688
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:49,850
Here.

689
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:52,710
Because this is our first date.

690
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:54,780
It's beautiful.

691
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:59,840
My mom also got a bunch of flowers
on her first date with my dad.

692
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:02,210
I thought it was old-fashioned
when she told me that,

693
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,560
but it's really nice to get one myself.

694
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:09,830
Right. What should we do now?

695
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:12,600
I thought you might not know good places,

696
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,500
so I did some research.

697
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:17,700
Miss Dam.

698
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,430
This is our first date.
You think I came here unprepared?

699
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:25,140
I've been keeping myself updated with
the latest culture via news and books.

700
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:27,650
And I've been watching
romantic comedy dramas,

701
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:31,390
so I'm very well aware
of the latest dating trend.

702
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:32,660
Plus,

703
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,650
I can use magic.

704
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:37,850
You won't be disappointed.

705
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:52,550
Why sauna, all of a sudden?

706
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:54,350
I saw on dramas

707
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,700
that this is where many couples like to go
when they go on dates.

708
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,940
[Sauna date is kind of outdated.]

709
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,700
Why did you talk about magic
when we're coming to a sauna?

710
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:13,890
According to my research,
this is a perfect place...

711
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,100
because there are nine different rooms
made of nine different ingredients here

712
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,650
that help you with detox.

713
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,550
But there's one problem here.

714
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:28,720
Currently,

715
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,970
the ice room is out of order.

716
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,740
What?

717
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:38,310
What does that have anything
to do with your magic?

718
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:40,290
How about we go and have a look?

719
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,400
[Ice Room]

720
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,150
[Ice Room]

721
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:58,330
It's warm in here.
I guess you're right. It's out of order.

722
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:42,190
Sir, you're like Elsa.

723
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:44,660
I don't know who Ms. Elsa is,

724
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:46,730
but I can tell from your tone
it's a compliment.

725
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:53,460
Right. Let me show you something.
Don't be surprised.

726
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,680
Now, you look like a lamb.

727
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,620
[Who does this these days?]

728
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:20,080
What is the drama that you watched?

729
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:21,530
"My Lovely Sam Soon".

730
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:23,380
It's quite a popular one.

731
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:30,290
It was aired in 2005.

732
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:37,370
Oh. Time really flies.

733
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,610
Well, you've been living
for almost a thousand years.

734
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,520
I understand
15 years feels like a second to you.

735
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:45,730
Then saunas were popular...

736
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:47,220
15 years ago.

737
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,800
It's cold. Shall we go out?

738
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:59,190
There's this place
I've always wanted to go with you.

739
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:01,000
With me?

740
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,580
Shall we?

741
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,090
Here's your chicken. Enjoy.

742
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:25,640
Is this the place you've always wanted
to go with me? A chicken restaurant?

743
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,360
Well...

744
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:31,180
You couldn't have chicken because of me,

745
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:32,940
so I wanted to make up for it.

746
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,210
I brought you here because I remembered
this place was crowded,

747
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:40,020
but now I think about it,
that's more than 40 years ago.

748
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,510
I'm sorry, Miss Dam.

749
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,690
I tried to recall
some of my memories for you,

750
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,460
but looks like I failed
to catch up with the latest trend.

751
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:53,530
I'm sorry.

752
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,040
I messed up our first date.

753
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:57,800
I love it.

754
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,200
Until yesterday, I couldn't call you Sir
and I thought I would have to act like

755
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:04,660
we're strangers for the rest of my life.

But today, we're sitting face to face.

757

No matter what we do
and no matter where we go, I'm happy.

758
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:16,630
It looks delicious.

759
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,330
Sir, are you hungry?

760
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,570
What?

761
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:01,990
Because you're staring at me.

762
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:09,740
This is the first time
that chicken looks tasty to me.

763
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,330
That's because I really enjoy it.

764

[What was that just now?]

765
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,690
Appetite.

766
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,520
Appetite? What do you mean?

767
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,590
It means it's not necessarily a good thing

768
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,960
that things between you guys
worked out that way.

769
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,220
Think about it.

770

What do you think will happen
if a wolf falls in love with a sheep?

771
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:39,390
The more you want her,

00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,810
the bigger your appetite will grow.

Could you at least
act like you're surprised?
