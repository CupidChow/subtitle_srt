1
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,280
Rong Heng

2
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:20,800
Tell me the truth.

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,960
Who forced you to do this?

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,800
I...

5
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:27,039
You should leave.

6
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:27,920
If someone finds out,

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,760
Rong Heng,

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,160
Was it Su Wan'er?

9
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:35,159
Rong Heng, what are you doing?

10
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,200
Princess.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,520
I betrayed you.

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,399
This is my mother's bracelet.

13
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,079
What did you do to her?

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,280
Do as I say.

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,799
Or else...

16
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:07,480
Your family's lives won't be safe.

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,239
That's how it happened.

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,280
I did as she ordered.

19
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,079
Step by step,

20
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,840
I fell into the abyss.

21
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,640
Princess.

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,879
The reason I survived until now

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,959
is because, from the start,

24
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,319
when I began working for the Second Princess,

25
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,680
I was secretly gathering her incriminating evidence.

26
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:31,599
I've hidden it all away.

27
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,599
Where is it hidden now?

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,280
They're searching for it too.

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,719
You must find the evidence first.

30
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,519
Then report it to the Lord.

31
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,159
Don't worry, Rong Heng.

32
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,519
You've suffered.

33
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,120
I have done disloyal, dishonorable things.

34
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,400
I don't ask for your forgiveness.

35
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,400
I only ask you,

36
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,920
please treat my parents kindly.

37
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,239
What are you saying?

38
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,159
You and I are like sisters.

39
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,879
Your parents are my parents too.

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,479
Princess.

41
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,680
They're waking up, hurry and go.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,639
Take care, Rong Heng.

43
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,639
Wait for me to find you.

44
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,319
Go.

45
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,560
What's wrong?

46
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,680
Someone is following us.

47
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,840
Who do you think it is?

48
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,319
Whoever doesn't want the evidence exposed

49
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,360
must be their people.

50
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,439
Now it's just the two of us.

51
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,360
I'm afraid we can't protect the evidence.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,479
Let's go.

53
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:05,919
No matter what,

54
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,000
we must find the evidence today.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,039
Or it will be too late.

56
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,280
But if we go out,

57
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,319
we'll definitely be followed.

58
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,319
I've got an idea.

59
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,000
What idea?

60
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,919
That's great!

61
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,879
Rong Heng can be saved.

62
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,039
Princess Su Feng'er,

63
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,719
enter the palace to see the Lord.

64
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,319
Anyone who blocks her

65
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,319
will die.

66
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:31,639
Empress Mother.

67
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,319
It's me, your daughter.

68
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,839
Wan'er.

69
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,879
Are you rebelling?

70
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,319
Rebel?

71
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,439
Empress Mother.

72
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,240
That's a serious accusation.

73
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,040
I can't bear such a charge.

74
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,720
But you've ruled for many years,

75
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,680
your health and strength

76
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,920
are not what they once were.

77
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,000
Now, enemies surround us.

78
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,519
Trouble inside and out.

79
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,600
If you bear it all alone,

80
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,720
then as your children,

81
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,399
and as your subjects,

82
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,680
we are unfilial and disloyal.

83
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,439
Liu Shangshu,

84
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,160
tell me,

85
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,319
am I right?

86
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,839
The Second Princess is right.

87
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,399
Sun Xiang,

88
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,199
The Princess makes sense.

89
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,879
To share the Lord's burdens

90
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,839
is our duty as subjects.

91
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,839
Bah!

92
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,920
Such grand words,

93
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,319
but it's just a power grab.

94
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,079
The Lord is still here!

95
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,439
Wang Shilang seems to object.

96
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,920
It's fine.

97
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,040
I value and cherish talent most.

98
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,800
Guards!

99
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,480
Take Wang Shilang away.

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,279
Let him have tea.

101
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,319
Second Princess,

102
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,480
you can't do this!

103
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,199
Lord!

104
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,319
Save me!

105
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,480
Let go of the Lord!

106
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,399
A Fu.

107
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:16,920
Reporting to the Lord,

108
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,720
I, your old servant, believe

109
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,000
the Second Princess is absolutely right.

110
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,000
The Lord is now advanced in age.

111
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,480
It would be better to retire.

112
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:32,439
Enjoy your remaining years.

113
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,720
You...

114
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,480
Those who differ in path

115
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,639
cannot work together.

116
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,480
I won't force anyone.

117
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,480
If you won't join me in this great cause,

118
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,319
you may go home now.

119
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,959
Reunite with your families,

120
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,240
be together again.

121
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,639
I,

122
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,279
am willing to serve the Second Princess.

123
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,240
We are willing to serve the Second Princess.

124
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,319
Willing to serve the Second Princess.

125
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,279
A Fu.

126
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,439
Here.

127
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,120
Escort the Empress Mother from her throne.

128
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,480
Yes.

129
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,680
Guards!

130
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,399
Who dares?

131
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,920
I'd like to see who dares!
