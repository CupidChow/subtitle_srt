1
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,719
Greetings, Princess.

2
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,679
Xiao Yuan Yuan.

3
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,640
You look quite dashing today.

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,719
Rong Heng.

5
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:34,320
Xie Yuan, receive the decree.

6
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,320
By imperial order of the Emperor,

7
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:42,439
Xie Yuan, companion reader of the Princess,

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,799
is gifted in literature,

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,159
and well-versed in male virtues.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,159
He is hereby appointed Princess Historian.

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,600
Responsible for recording the Princess's deeds.

12
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:50,640
So decreed.

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,759
Xiao Yuan Yuan.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Starting today,

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,719
you'll accompany me every day.

16
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,479
Are you happy?

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,520
Happy.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,359
Just afraid escaping the palace will get harder.

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,000
Accept the decree.

20
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:12,200
Young master.

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,280
Express your gratitude.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,120
Thank you, Lord of the City, for your grace.

23
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,599
What's that sound?

24
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:27,959
Young Master Xie.

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,280
Our Lord wants you to record the Princess's deeds,

26
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,000
so don't turn it into a recipe book.

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,879
I advise you all to think thrice before speaking.

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,480
Since I am now Princess Historian,

29
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,280
I will record your words and actions too.

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,959
For future generations to admire.

31
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:47,760
Alright.

32
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,680
Xiao Yuan Yuan came because he values me,

33
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,480
even arriving hungry to accept the title.

34
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,519
Rong Heng.

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,760
Take him to get some food.

36
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes.

37
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,200
Young master.

38
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,400
Who are you?

39
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,719
Me?

40
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,680
General Rong Heng.

41
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,680
My window is leaking rain.

42
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,879
I asked someone to fix it.

43
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,520
Right.

44
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:19,599
This way, please.

45
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,280
Alright.

46
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,080
Why did you come looking for me?

47
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,520
Didn't I tell you to wait in the woodshed?

48
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,719
I heard you became Princess Historian.

49
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,520
I wanted to ask you,

50
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,319
are we still leaving?

51
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,319
Of course we are.

52
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,000
A temporary measure.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,879
A temporary measure.

54
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,919
Let me think again.

55
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,840
Young master.

56
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,000
A temporary measure.

57
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:36,479
Think about what?

58
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,319
Dig.

59
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,719
Dig what?

60
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,039
Such a solid wall—

61
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,520
It'd take you five years to dig through.

62
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,479
Young master.

63
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,520
I do one hundred strokes a day.

64
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,280
Two days, two hundred strokes.

65
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,039
Three days, three hundred strokes.

66
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:45,479
I really—

67
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,199
Alright, alright.

68
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,039
Take it, take it.

69
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,840
Big chicken leg.

70
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,400
Eat.

71
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:56,759
Young master.

72
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,800
That girl just now—

73
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,879
Don't look.

74
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,560
Don't ask.

75
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,400
Hurry and congratulate me.

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,080
The act is done.

77
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,759
Hurry.

78
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:06,240
Congrats to Young Master Xie on becoming Princess Historian.

79
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,039
You're too kind.

80
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,199
All trades are lowly,

81
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,639
only study is noble.

82
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:10,800
This way, please.

83
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:11,520
Alright.

84
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,080
Princess.

85
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,400
Young Master Xie is here.

86
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,240
Why is he here?

87
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,080
Come in.

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,879
Young Master Xie.

89
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,520
Greetings, Princess.

90
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,639
Congratulations on being named Princess Historian.

91
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,879
Please, have a seat.

92
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,400
Actually, I came for this matter.

93
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,280
I thought I'd fail the assessment

94
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,199
and be sent out of the palace.

95
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,319
But I was appointed Historian instead.

96
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,520
Now leaving the palace is harder than ever.

97
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,520
Young master.

98
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,639
You are favored by the eldest princess now.

99
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,319
Why not take another step forward

100
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,719
and enter officialdom?

101
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,280
Enjoy wealth and honor.

102
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm just a scholar.

103
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,879
Palace life is too much for me.

104
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,319
I only wish to leave soon.

105
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,480
Return to Yue.

106
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,399
And publish my Records of Origins.

107
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,800
As a finished book.

108
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,079
Wan'er always cherishes talent.

109
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,519
If you truly wish to leave,

110
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,920
Wan'er has a way.

111
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,000
Really?

112
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,879
What way?

113
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,600
But the palace is full of guards.

114
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,040
Even if you get past the gate,

115
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,720
it's hard to return to Yue.

116
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,199
If the guards catch you,

117
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Wan'er may be punished by the Empress.

118
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,680
Young master.

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,920
Now that you're Princess Historian,

120
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,839
stay close to the eldest princess for now.

121
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,199
Once you know all the defenses,

122
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,480
Wan'er will help you leave.

123
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,800
For now,

124
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,000
that's all we can do.

125
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,279
Thank you, Princess.

126
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,120
Raise a cup to the bright moon.

127
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,720
With our shadows, we are three.

128
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,240
I'll finish this cup.

129
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,079
You drink as you wish.

130
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,040
Xiao Yuan Yuan.

131
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
You're not being fair.

132
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,480
Celebrating here by yourself,

133
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,680
without inviting me.

134
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,879
Princess.

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,720
I'm not afraid of the Princess.

136
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,439
Ask her to come over.

137
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,480
Second Princess.

138
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,720
Why did you come to see me?

139
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,920
Hurry.

140
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,639
This fool mistook me for his sister.

141
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:55,480
What?

142
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,680
Am I so bad?

143
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,000
Could it be

144
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,079
Xiao Yuan Yuan likes girls like his sister?

145
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,279
Thank you for helping me before.

146
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,480
Come.

147
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,160
Second Princess.

148
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,199
Wine poured by the Second Princess tastes best.

149
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,800
Please.

150
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,399
Continue

151
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,720
That princess never pours me a drink

152
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:35,839
I toast to you

153
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:36,920
Cheers

154
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,000
Is it good?

155
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,519
It's good

156
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,079
It's good, here

157
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:49,759
Drink some more

158
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,399
Second Princess pours the best wine

159
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,240
Didn't expect Xiao Yuan Yuan to be such a lightweight

160
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,120
What are you doing?

161
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,720
Xiao Yuan Yuan

162
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Did you forget what you did to me last night?

163
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,199
What did I do to you?

164
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,720
If you really forgot

165
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,399
I don't mind

166
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,680
Let me help you remember

167
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,360
You

168
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,079
Don't

169
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,079
You...

170
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,079
Help!

171
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,519
Princess

172
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,199
Behave yourself

173
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,000
Behave

174
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,519
Xiao Yuan Yuan

175
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,240
Xiao Yuan Yuan

176
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,079
Xiao Tao

177
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,319
Bring me my green dress

178
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes

179
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,680
You just like my sister's style

180
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,879
I can do that too

181
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,240
Rong Heng

182
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,680
This zither doesn't suit me either

183
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,480
Go quickly

184
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,839
Bring me another one

185
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,959
Princess

186
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,080
This is the last zither in the palace

187
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,039
It's time to eat

188
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,639
Why don't we eat first?

189
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,399
No

190
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,399
I haven't finished practicing

191
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,240
How can I give up for food

192
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,399
and quit halfway?

193
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,879
Again

194
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,399
Princess

195
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,159
Princess

196
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,600
Let me help you test the zither

197
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,720
Sure

198
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,120
Xiao Yuan Yuan

199
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,480
Didn't expect you to play so well

200
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,720
From today on

201
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,039
You must play for me every day

202
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,440
Alright

203
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,559
Everyone's tired today

204
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,559
Go eat now

205
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,799
Thank you, Princess

206
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,559
Xiao Tao

207
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,200
Tell me

208
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,799
Am I much worse than my sister?

209
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,440
Princess

210
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,879
You may not be as skilled as Second Princess

211
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,120
But

212
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,799
You're good at riding and archery

213
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,639
No

214
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,000
I want to master all the arts

215
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,000
Princess

216
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,120
Mister Xie is here

217
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,639
Xiao Yuan Yuan, you're finally here

218
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,360
Quick

219
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,879
Learn male embroidery with me

220
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,159
Male embroidery

221
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,639
Isn't this called female embroidery?

222
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,240
This is all women's work

223
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,440
Look at Mister Xie

224
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Next month is the Festival of Ingenuity

225
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,399
It's a big event for our princess

226
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,159
See, he doesn't care at all

227
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,399
Xiang Er

228
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,639
I can learn if I don't know

229
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,519
The princess will teach me

230
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,240
Right?

231
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,000
Sure

232
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll teach you

233
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,639
With your help

234
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:32,200
I'll surely win first place

235
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,000
Of course

236
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,039
Princess

237
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,039
Xiang Er's male embroidery is the best

238
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,000
See for yourself

239
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:39,440
Not bad

240
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,200
Thank you

241
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,919
Like this

242
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,240
Push it in

243
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,480
Then pull it out

244
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,120
What are you sneaking around for?

245
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,240
Mister Xie's window broke again

246
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,360
Broke again

247
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,799
Your master's window is really flimsy

248
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:05,240
This time I want to see you fix it myself

249
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,120
Don't let it break again

250
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,039
Let's go

251
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:07,559
This time I want to see it

252
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,440
No need

253
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,600
I've already fixed it

254
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,399
I'm about to head back

255
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:16,600
Miss, how do I get to the gate?

256
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,840
Come with me

257
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,600
Alright

258
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,720
Miss

259
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,120
May I ask your name?

260
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
I am Rong Heng

261
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,840
Ruolin thanks Miss Rong Heng
