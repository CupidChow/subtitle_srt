1
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,839
Follow heavenly principles,

2
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,120
suppress human desires.

3
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:21,480
Maintain moderation,

4
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:22,719
adapt to the ways of the world.

5
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:24,199
The Book of Changes

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,920
is recited to illuminate reason.

7
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:29,719
Why is it so noisy today?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,799
I really can't stay here long.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,320
Young Master Xie

10
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:37,320
Why are you still here?

11
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:38,320
Lady Rong Heng

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,159
What are you doing?

13
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,679
The Imperial Kitchen prepared lots of fresh ingredients.

14
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:44,320
All the palace officials are busy buying supplies.

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,240
Go take a look quickly.

16
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,399
Sister Rong Heng

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,560
The Princess is calling you.

18
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,399
I'll be right there.

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:49,759
Young Master Xie

20
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:50,520
Go on, hurry.

21
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:54,960
Forget it.

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,799
Since the assessment is related to this,

23
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:59,640
I'll see what tricks I can come up with.

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,760
Du Momo

25
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,480
These people have no sense at all.

26
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,760
I've been standing here for so long.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,519
Let me tell you some good news.

28
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:12,159
Yesterday, the Imperial Kitchen

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,560
got a batch of fresh ingredients.

30
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,640
I thought you needed to prepare a culinary offering.

31
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,519
So,

32
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,799
I had them delivered here first.

33
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,680
So you could pick first.

34
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,159
Thank you, Du Momo.

35
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,760
Take a look.

36
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,200
Aren't these just ordinary ginseng and seafood?

37
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,640
And these river clams.

38
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,159
The Princess is tired of eating them.

39
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,200
That's right.

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,959
Momo

41
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:37,319
Young Master Xie

42
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,480
What are we doing here?

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,120
The palace holds a night banquet every festival.

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,280
We all have to present a culinary offering.

45
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,439
A culinary offering?

46
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,400
Yes.

47
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,599
Is this my assessment?

48
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes, Young Master Xie.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,079
You can't be unaware, right?

50
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,400
You should look and pick too.

51
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,640
We'll need them later.

52
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,879
They were gathered by people over there.

53
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,239
They rushed here at top speed.

54
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,879
It takes two months to reach Jin City.

55
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,760
The Imperial Kitchen only has these three.

56
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,519
Since that's the case,

57
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,200
I'll take the ten taels of silver.

58
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,280
I want it.

59
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,919
Here it is.

60
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,039
Careless, careless.

61
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,080
I actually forgot.

62
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,840
It's Young Master Xie's first time at the banquet.

63
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,639
Here.

64
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,800
This is the banquet procedure and notes.

65
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,039
Hope it helps Young Master Xie pass the assessment.

66
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,280
And earn the City Lord's reward.

67
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,639
Sea cucumber.

68
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,520
Cordyceps.

69
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,199
Snow lotus from Tianshan.

70
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,840
Such extravagance and waste.

71
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,479
I don't need it.

72
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,400
Five taels of gold.

73
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,719
Ten taels of gold.

74
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,919
Twenty taels.

75
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,240
Everyone,

76
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
do you know

77
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:39,719
in this world,

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,680
many people are still starving.

79
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,800
Such fine ingredients

80
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,319
might be food they've never tasted in their lives.

81
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,120
Just for one dish,

82
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,800
you are so picky,

83
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,039
so extravagant and wasteful.

84
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,400
Don't you feel ashamed?

85
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,039
Princess

86
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:57,800
Princess

87
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,439
Didn't I tell you to secretly help Xiao Yuanyuan?

88
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,240
Why did you come back?

89
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,960
Princess

90
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,439
I'm here for that very reason.

91
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,400
That's my Xiao Yuanyuan.

92
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,759
Well done.

93
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,639
This assessment still needs to be

94
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,120
discussed with the Second Princess.

95
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,039
Xie Yuan is so perfunctory about this banquet.

96
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,639
He's really not as good as Mo Yu and Zhao Xiang.

97
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,719
Why are you still so happy?

98
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,719
What do you know?

99
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,360
All the men in this city

100
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,159
just flatter this Princess.

101
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,120
It's so boring.

102
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,319
But Xiao Yuanyuan is different.

103
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,159
Young Master Xie

104
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,960
A ghost!

105
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,199
It's me.

106
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,080
Ruo Lin!

107
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,439
Ruo Lin.

108
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,159
It's me.

109
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,800
Ruo Lin.

110
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,960
Ruo Lin has finally waited for you.

111
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,280
You've been chopping wood here all this time?

112
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,120
Yes.

113
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,000
Young Master Xie.

114
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,919
Ruo Lin has sacrificed so much for you.

115
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,759
A huge sacrifice.

116
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,960
You lost that thing.

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,680
Which one?

118
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,439
That one.

119
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,520
That one.

120
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,479
Just...

121
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:13,159
A man's most precious thing.

122
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,639
It's still here.

123
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,240
It's here.

124
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,839
But it almost...

125
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,759
Forget it, never mind.

126
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,680
Anyway, Ruo Lin only needs to chop wood now.

127
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,639
Nothing else matters.

128
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,759
As long as it's still here.

129
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,079
As long as it's here, that's enough.

130
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,240
Do you want to check?

131
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,959
No need, no need.

132
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:31,720
Alright.

133
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,439
Young Master Xie.

134
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,240
Want to eat?

135
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,079
What?

136
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,040
Steamed bun.

137
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,560
You eat this every day?

138
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,240
Yes.

139
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,439
It's delicious.

140
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,560
You've really had it tough.

141
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,439
Go ahead and eat.

142
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,720
I eat pretty well in the palace.

143
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,839
Then I'll eat.

144
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,600
Young Master Xie.

145
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,160
When I heard the Princess took in a handsome man,

146
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,480
and he was from Yue,

147
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,000
I thought about it.

148
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,680
It had to be you, Young Master Xie.

149
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,399
So I tried my luck entering the palace.

150
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,720
Who knew I'd end up in the wood shed.

151
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,519
I wanted to find you.

152
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,560
But the palace is so huge.

153
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,240
I also...

154
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:23,680
Ruo Lin...

155
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,160
You've really suffered.

156
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,319
When we get out,

157
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,920
I'll find you a good wife.

158
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,439
No need.

159
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,519
Ruo Lin just needs to find you.

160
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,360
By the way,

161
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,040
Ruo Lin.

162
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,519
You've been here so long,

163
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,319
Have you found a way out?

164
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,480
Ruo Lin was busy looking for you.

165
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,759
Didn't think about escaping.

166
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,160
But I know,

167
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,000
The one who brought me in said,

168
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,120
Once you enter the palace,

169
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
you're a servant for life.

170
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,399
That's it.

171
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,399
That's it.

172
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,279
Looks like I need my own plan.

173
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,160
Young Master Xie.

174
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,920
You have a way out?

175
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,639
Of course I do.

176
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,959
Here,

177
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,240
the Hot Spring Palace sends people out daily to buy supplies.

178
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,800
We sneak in with them.

179
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,600
Wear their clothes.

180
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,319
Then we can get out.

181
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,279
Yes, Young Master Xie.

182
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,240
We leave tonight.

183
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,879
That was the plan.

184
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,319
But they found out I knew.

185
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,560
So they changed the rules.

186
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
We can't get out now.

187
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,560
Young Master Xie.

188
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,319
So your plan was for nothing.

189
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,519
Just like you.

190
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,839
Young Master Xie.

191
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,720
Each day here means chopping one hundred logs.

192
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,519
Two days, two hundred logs.

193
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,920
Three days, three hundred logs.

194
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,360
I know you're suffering.

195
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,639
Give me some time.

196
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,560
Once I find a way out,

197
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,639
I'll get us both out.

198
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Can you wait for me?

199
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,199
Alright.

200
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,040
Okay.

201
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,480
Young Master Xie.

202
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,519
This palace is so big.

203
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,439
Too many people and eyes here.

204
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,600
I have things to do.

205
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,800
I have to go.

206
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,759
Alright.

207
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,319
Young Master Xie.

208
00:06:59,319 --> 00:06:59,800
I'll see you off.

209
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:05,240
Know yourself and your enemy,

210
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,439
and you will never be defeated.

211
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,560
If you know only yourself,

212
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,360
you win some, lose some.

213
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,079
Princess.

214
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,199
Young Master Xie is here.

215
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,240
Young Master Xie.

216
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Greetings, Second Princess.

217
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,160
No need for formalities.

218
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,399
Princess.

219
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,959
Are you really pawning all these jewels to help the people?

220
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,680
How have I taught you?

221
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,519
These are just worldly possessions.

222
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,439
If they can help the people,

223
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,319
then their existence is worthwhile.

224
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,480
Young Master Xie, you came today

225
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,240
to ask a favor.

226
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,360
The palace banquet is approaching.

227
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,160
I wish to fail the assessment on purpose.

228
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,000
However,

229
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,199
the culinary offering here is always extravagant.

230
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:01,079
Just do the opposite, and you'll fail.

231
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,560
Xiao Cui.

232
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,519
Why is it crab pastry again?

233
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,199
Where's my favorite radish cake?

234
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,160
Forgive me, Princess.

235
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,800
The Imperial Kitchen said radish is cheap.

236
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,279
It's not worthy of your status.

237
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,839
So they stopped making it.

238
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:24,480
Who says ingredients have ranks and worth?

239
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:33,759
Young Master Xie.

240
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,080
Ruo Lin.

241
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,000
Everything you asked for is here.

242
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,440
But what do you need these for?

243
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,639
You'll know soon enough.

244
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,240
Go ahead.

245
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,679
Be careful.

246
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,399
Alright.

247
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,879
Xiao Tao

248
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,759
You said Young Master Xie locked himself
in his room, acting all mysterious.

249
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,000
What is he up to in there?

250
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,279
Can he pass the assessment?

251
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,240
I think he can.

252
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,080
The banquet is coming soon.

253
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,320
Let's see what surprises Young Master Xie
will bring.

254
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,799
No.

255
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:11,639
I can't wait any longer.

256
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,240
Go gather everyone.

257
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
I want to taste the dishes myself.

258
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,000
If Xiao Yuanyuan doesn't prepare well,

259
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,600
the Queen Mother will be furious.

260
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,000
Yes.

261
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,720
Princess.
