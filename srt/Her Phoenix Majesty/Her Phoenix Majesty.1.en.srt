1
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,039
Princess Royal

2
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,760
Princess Royal has returned victorious.

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,719
With Princess Royal here,

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,320
who dares to bully Jincheng now?

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,239
That's right.

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:32,759
Young master.

7
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,359
It seems the commander is a woman.

8
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:36,560
That's really unusual.

9
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:37,320
Ruolin.

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,439
Let's go down for a walk.

11
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,359
For my travelogue,

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,399
Records of Origins,

13
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:41,520
I need to gather some material.

14
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,560
So handsome.

15
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,799
Could he be Pan An reborn?

16
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,479
It truly is rare.

17
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:53,920
It's my first time seeing

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,560
a woman so bold in showing affection.

19
00:00:59,119 --> 00:00:59,920
Yuer.

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,079
Princess.

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,000
Yuer.

22
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,840
Still wearing these?

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,799
Aren't they heavy?

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,799
I'm just anxious.

25
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:08,599
See?

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,959
I came to see you as soon as I returned.

27
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,439
I heard border men are tall and strong.

28
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,439
Mighty and powerful.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,400
Princess Royal fought outside the city.

30
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:21,879
Maybe she's forgotten who Lan Yu is.

31
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,799
She must fear I'll fall for someone else.

32
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,560
And won't come to see you anymore.

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,000
In all Drunken Flowers,

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,280
you're the one I like best.

35
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,200
How could I ever abandon you?

36
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,400
But my Jincheng Handsome Men Record

37
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,079
hasn't had new entries for ages.

38
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,840
As a princess,

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,079
isn't that laughable?

40
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,760
Since Princess Royal has so many entries,

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
why bother with me?

42
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,000
Fine.

43
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,000
You rest first.

44
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,439
I'll come again when I'm free.

45
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,280
Princess.

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,079
Didn't you promise me before leaving

47
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,560
to take me back to the palace with you?

48
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,560
Next time.

49
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,359
I'll take you next time for sure.

50
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,280
Why do all the men on the street

51
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,439
wear such heavy makeup?

52
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,639
Here in Jincheng,

53
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,280
women run everything.

54
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,439
I think, sir,

55
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,400
you're naturally beautiful.

56
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,280
With our Beauty Cream,

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,000
if Princess Royal notices you,

58
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:17,639
your whole life

59
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,199
will be filled with endless palace riches.

60
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,560
I'm a proud seven-foot man.

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,280
How could I be kept by a woman?

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,560
What a joke.

63
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,639
I finally found you.

64
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,199
Please accept my flower.

65
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,560
Of thirty-six stratagems, fleeing is best.

66
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,039
Let's go.

67
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,560
If Princess Royal can't

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
take me away this time,

69
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,840
my humble life

70
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,960
ends here today.

71
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,639
Put down the knife.

72
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,479
Let's talk calmly.

73
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,439
If you don't agree,

74
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,639
I'll stab myself right now.

75
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,599
You...

76
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,879
Princess...

77
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,080
Be careful!

78
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:55,800
This way, this way!

79
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,000
Such a handsome man exists in this world!

80
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,800
Enough, stop pretending.

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,520
I'll visit you when I have time.

82
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,879
Princess.

83
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:13,800
Princess.

84
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,080
Rongheng.

85
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,280
Princess.

86
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,960
Did you see that young man just now?

87
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,080
Princess Royal has her eye on him.

88
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,960
Darn it, I'll go catch him for you.

89
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:24,639
Wait.

90
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,639
The Empress Mother has warned me many times

91
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,599
not to take people by force.

92
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,800
Let's use the same method as last time.

93
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,560
Stop right there!

94
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,960
My lifelong reputation,

95
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,159
will it be ruined today?

96
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,599
If only a hero would descend from the sky...

97
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,680
All of you, get lost!

98
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,639
It's fine now.

99
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,280
Thank you, benefactor.

100
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,240
I am Xie Yuan.

101
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,360
Newly arrived in this fine place.

102
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,840
May I ask your honorable name?

103
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,639
Just call me Su.

104
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,319
Mister Su.

105
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,439
To show my gratitude,

106
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,599
I'd like to invite you for tea.

107
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,639
What do you think?

108
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,839
Then I'll gladly accept.

109
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,480
About today's incident,

110
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,480
I owe my rescue to Mister Su.

111
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,839
Seeing your strength,

112
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,399
could you

113
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,000
help me find my study companion?

114
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,439
How do you plan to thank me?

115
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,879
I'll offer tea instead of wine

116
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,639
and toast you.

117
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,560
Thank you, sir.

118
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,680
Just a cup of tea to send me off?

119
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,759
Isn't that a bit too simple?

120
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,199
Wait, Mister Su.

121
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,279
I didn't think it through.

122
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,360
You should decide how I thank you.

123
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,399
I'll do as you say.

124
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,279
Then how about

125
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,480
offering yourself in marriage?

126
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,879
This Mister Su...

127
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,399
Could he have feelings for men?

128
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,120
No way.

129
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,800
Princess.

130
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,240
Forgive me for coming at the wrong time.

131
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,879
You're that Princess Royal.

132
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,480
You came at just the right time.

133
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,360
Refuse a toast, get forced to drink.

134
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,879
Take him to the palace for me.

135
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,040
Yes.

136
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,279
You...

137
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,680
Save it.

138
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,639
This was taught by a palace matron,

139
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,879
the art of tying ropes.

140
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,199
No palace official

141
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,040
has ever managed to undo it.

142
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,199
Are you really a princess?

143
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,399
I,

144
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,160
am the Princess Royal of Jincheng,

145
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,199
Su Feng'er.

146
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,600
I have no grudge against you.

147
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,040
Why did you tie me up and bring me here?

148
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,759
Earlier, I saved you heroically,

149
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,600
treated you well,

150
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,639
but you showed no gratitude.

151
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,160
So next,

152
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,199
don't blame me,

153
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,079
if I'm not so polite.

154
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,079
Princess.

155
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,720
Why are you in such a rush?

156
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,560
Princess.

157
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,600
The City Lord sent someone to summon you.

158
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,480
Seeing the eunuch stammering,

159
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,000
I doubt it's anything good.

160
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,519
What a time to call me.

161
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,920
Little Yuan, wait for me to return.

162
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,199
Disgrace.

163
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,439
Utter humiliation.

164
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,240
Though I am not highly learned,

165
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,800
I am still a scholar.

166
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,399
Yet now, a woman has taken me into her harem.

167
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,439
It's simply unbelievable.

168
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,920
A laughingstock to all.

169
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,680
If word gets out,

170
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,920
how will the world see me, Xie Yuan?

171
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,120
And what of the Records of Origins?

172
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,920
Untie him.

173
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,519
Don't damage my handsome man.

174
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,720
Yes.

175
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,720
Well played, Su Feng'er.

176
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,759
How dare you treat my Records of Origins this way.

177
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,439
Enough.

178
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,680
I am magnanimous.

179
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,279
I'll let you off this time.

180
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,839
Escaping this den is what matters now.

181
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,279
The palace is heavily guarded.

182
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,040
I must disguise myself.

183
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,439
Only then can I sneak out.

184
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,120
Princess, something's wrong!

185
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,920
What happened?

186
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,800
Everyone's in disarray,

187
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,639
how improper!

188
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,600
Princess.

189
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,040
That Xie Yuan is too cunning.

190
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,839
He slipped away without anyone noticing,

191
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,839
and escaped.

192
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:17,879
And—

193
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,480
he even stole our clothes.

194
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,560
Useless fools.

195
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,439
Can't even keep watch over one person.

196
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,439
What's the use of you?

197
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,399
Stop!

198
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,639
Why do you avoid the Princess?

199
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,200
Princess.

200
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,039
Lift your head.

201
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,399
With your build,

202
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,120
you don't look like a palace guard.

203
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,080
The Second Princess is asking you.

204
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,559
Second Princess, save me!

205
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,919
Who are you, really?

206
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,320
I am Xie Yuan.

207
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,399
From Yue.

208
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,279
Upon arriving in Jincheng, I met the Princess Royal.

209
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,279
She abducted me to the palace.

210
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,360
I see you are kind,

211
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,679
so I beg you to tell me how to leave the palace.

212
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,799
I see.

213
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,159
Here's what you do:

214
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,320
Go straight down this palace path,

215
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,559
turn right,

216
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,519
then left at the next intersection.

217
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,399
You'll see the Hot Spring Palace.

218
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,679
The attendants there

219
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,720
leave nightly to buy flower petals.

220
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,159
Just disguise yourself and blend in.

221
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,159
Then you can leave the palace.

222
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,080
Thank you, Second Princess,

223
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:41,919
for saving my life.

224
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,080
I will repay you someday.

225
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,759
When did Sister start liking

226
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,120
men like that?

227
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,480
Why are you still here?

228
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:19,840
Go quickly!

229
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,480
The City Lord is waiting.

230
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,679
Why are you standing there?

231
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,399
Hurry and massage the City Lord's legs.

232
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,279
Wait.

233
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,799
Mind your manners.

234
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,159
City Lord.

235
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,559
Is something troubling you?

236
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,799
It's Feng'er.

237
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,120
She is arrogant about her achievements,

238
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,960
lost in wine and pleasure,

239
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,360
neglecting her duties.

240
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,360
Please don't be angry, City Lord.

241
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,399
But look—

242
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,600
you still have the Second Princess.

243
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,759
Thank goodness for Wan'er.

244
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,720
So this is the mother of that unruly princess.

245
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,600
Like mother, like daughter.

246
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,919
You're pressing so hard,

247
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,000
are you trying to crush me?

248
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,080
I wouldn't dare.

249
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,159
You seem

250
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,159
not to be a Hot Spring Palace masseur.

251
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,519
There's an assassin!

252
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,720
Protect the City Lord!

253
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,159
Not an assassin!

254
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,159
Not an assassin!

255
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,080
Not an assassin!

256
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,159
City Lord.

257
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,600
I am not an assassin.

258
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,240
I am Xie Yuan from Yue.

259
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,159
I just arrived in Jincheng,

260
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:59,000
and was seized by the Princess Royal.

261
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,600
I beg for your mercy.

262
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,440
Please let me return home.

263
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,279
We in Jincheng

264
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,279
have no grudge against Yue.

265
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,039
Yet unexpectedly,

266
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,679
they sent an assassin to me.

267
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:12,000
Such sinister intentions.

268
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,360
You—

269
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,960
It's you!

270
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,639
City Lord!

271
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,159
It's him!

272
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,679
So it was you

273
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,080
who egged Feng'er on to cause trouble at Drunken Flowers.

274
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,879
A'fu.

275
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:31,879
Here.

276
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,879
Sell him to Drunken Flowers for me.

277
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,080
He is never to leave for life.

278
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,679
Little Yuan Yuan

279
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:51,759
Little Yuan

280
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:52,799
Princess, Princess

281
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:53,519
You came to see your servant.

282
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,320
Step aside.

283
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,000
Little Yuan Yuan

284
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,480
Little Yuan Yuan

285
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,519
Don't leave me.

286
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,279
Little Yuan Yuan

287
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,159
Princess

288
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,480
He just fainted.

289
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,159
Nonsense.

290
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,600
Does this Princess Royal need your advice?

291
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:10,919
Little Yuan Yuan

292
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
Little Yuan Yuan

293
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,360
Little Yuan Yuan, wake up.

294
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,159
Little Yuan Yuan, wake up.

295
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,159
Little Yuan Yuan

296
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,240
You're awake.

297
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:23,679
Why can't I escape

298
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,320
the clutches of this unruly Princess Royal?

299
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,600
Don't be afraid.

300
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,679
I'll take you back to the palace soon.

301
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,159
Who said I'm going back with you?

302
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,000
What,

303
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,360
you don't want to?

304
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,759
I almost forgot about the travelogue.

305
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,799
Fine then.

306
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,200
I'll go back and look for the Records of Origins first.

307
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,879
If needed, I'll just escape again.

308
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,559
Otherwise, all these years of effort

309
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,919
will be wasted.

310
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,480
I will.

311
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,720
You've suffered.

312
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,799
I'll take you back for a massage.

313
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,320
Alright.

314
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,399
You call this a massage?

315
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:13,879
Don't worry.

316
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,000
I've arranged everything.

317
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,639
In a moment,

318
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,799
just beg for mercy loudly.

319
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,120
The Queen Mother hates noise the most.

320
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,399
She'll let you go then.

321
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,799
You...

322
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:24,519
Time's up.

323
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,320
Begin the punishment.

324
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,399
Why is he screaming

325
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,240
before the beating even started?

326
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,159
Shh.

327
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,440
This isn't something for our two-tael salary

328
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,279
to worry about.

329
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,519
It hurts so much!

330
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,960
City Lord, I won't dare again!

331
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,080
I won't try to escape again!

332
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,279
It hurts so much!

333
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,360
Stop.

334
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,720
It hurts so much!

335
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,679
City Lord's order:

336
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,080
Punishment ends here.

337
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,399
Xie Yuan is to reflect in seclusion.

338
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,200
Your child obeys.

339
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,399
It hurts so much.
