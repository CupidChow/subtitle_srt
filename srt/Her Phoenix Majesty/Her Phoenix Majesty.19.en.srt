1
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:25,359
Shaoye

2
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,359
It's almost dawn.

3
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:27,719
Why aren't you resting yet?

4
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,519
Staying up late will harm your health.

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,240
I'm fine.

6
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:34,799
You know, these past two days,

7
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,600
Gongzhu has done a lot of hard work
for the villagers.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,000
But their prejudice against her
hasn't faded at all.

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,000
If I don't do something,

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,920
it'll never change.

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,840
As long as her injustice remains,

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,520
I can't find peace.

13
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:50,880
I can't sleep well.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,280
But you've already done so much for her.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,920
She still barely acknowledges you.

16
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,840
Let's not make things harder for ourselves.

17
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,920
Let me teach you something.

18
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,039
A man should always finish what he starts.

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,480
She may be a bit stubborn,

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,680
but I think she's

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,200
genuine and passionate.

22
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,280
I believe

23
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,439
she will be Jincheng's wise ruler one day.

24
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:15,920
Let's just do a good deed.

25
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:20,640
Shaoye

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,560
Please, have a drink.

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,120
Gongzhu

28
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:28,599
Gongzhu

29
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,879
You're willing to see our Shaoye now?

30
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:30,719
Stop talking, just lead the way.

31
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:31,239
Alright.

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,840
This way.

33
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:39,719
Ruolin,

34
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,840
I wrote an opening, listen to it.

35
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,799
Gongzhu got up early to carry firewood.

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,079
She met Aunt Zhao on the way.

37
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,680
You didn't make me look like a shrew, did you?

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,680
Gongzhu, why are you here?

39
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,719
How long do you plan to keep this from me?

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,400
What am I hiding? I don't get it.

41
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,599
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

42
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,719
And thank you for restoring my reputation.

43
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,959
I only understand now

44
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,240
that to be a wise ruler,

45
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,680
one must love the people as their own children.

46
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,280
Sadly, I realized it too late.

47
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,599
Now everyone is saying

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,199
Rong Heng rebelled

49
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,199
because I ordered it.

50
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,719
I went to Rong Heng's house a few days ago.

51
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:26,840
But Princess Er had already surrounded it.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,199
So you've been investigating Rong Heng all along.

53
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,319
I was deceived by Princess Er before.

54
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,919
I wrote poems slandering you.

55
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,560
And

56
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,000
I even brought those letters to the palace.

57
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,439
I believe

58
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,800
Princess Er is definitely involved in Rong Heng's rebellion.

59
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,159
But if we find Rong Heng,

60
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,360
we'll know her true motive.

61
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,319
I see.

62
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,319
Don't worry too much.

63
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
Evil can't defeat good.

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,879
I believe the truth will come out.

65
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,919
I've left the palace many times,

66
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,520
but this is the first time I can't bear
to leave a house.

67
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,960
After all,

68
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,840
I cleaned it up myself.

69
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:23,719
Let's go.

70
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,639
I don't want to stay here anymore.

71
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,599
Shaoye's house is so nice.

72
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,800
Once we move there,

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,080
I can even grow vegetables in the yard.

74
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,039
You...

75
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:33,919
Let's go.

76
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,080
Go.

77
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,319
It's been ages since we drank together like this.

78
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,080
How is it?

79
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,879
Tastes good.

80
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,079
I used to think

81
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,160
I wanted every man in the world

82
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,800
to admire me.

83
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,800
Even to abduct them to the palace.

84
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,360
Tie them all to myself.

85
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,480
But I never imagined

86
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,759
I'd end up like this.

87
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,560
It backfired.

88
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,680
Luckily,

89
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,639
you've always been by my side.

90
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,920
Squat.

91
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,240
Cross.

92
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:58,680
Throw.

93
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,279
Try again.

94
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,040
Bend your knees a bit.

95
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,240
Use your fingers with force.

96
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,279
Left hand in a fist at your chest.

97
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,160
Is it fun?

98
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,199
Is it fun?

99
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,360
Everyone has to do it this way.

100
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,600
Gongzhu

101
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:26,800
I stewed chicken today.

102
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,000
Come to my house for dinner tonight.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,360
What's so good about chicken?

104
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
We stew fish at my house.

105
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,759
Come to my house.

106
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,800
Our food is nutritious.

107
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,560
Come to our house.

108
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,439
The fish is fresh, come to my house.

109
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,680
I'll handle things here.

110
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,839
Go ahead, eat more.

111
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,839
Gongzhu

112
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,839
I'm here.

113
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,839
You are...

114
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,439
Where is Gongzhu?

115
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,279
Guard Yang

116
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,800
Gongzhu

117
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,040
Gongzhu

118
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,079
You know each other?

119
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,759
Gongzhu

120
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:57,800
Are you saying

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,160
Rong Heng is locked in the southern camp's dungeon?

122
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,439
Absolutely true.

123
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,199
Don't worry.

124
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,079
Guard Yang is one of us.

125
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,720
Guard Yang

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,279
Where did you get your information?

127
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:12,079
I was reassigned to the outskirts.

128
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,040
I met some sisters at the southern camp dungeon.

129
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,680
After drinking with them, I learned

130
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,959
they once guarded a mysterious assassin.

131
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,279
That person was General Rong.

132
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,560
Then why didn't you save her?

133
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,480
Forgive me, Gongzhu.

134
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,639
The day after General Rong was imprisoned,

135
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,040
all the guards were replaced by Princess Er's people.

136
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,439
I truly couldn't do anything.

137
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,759
Sit down.

138
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:37,759
Yes.

139
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,040
You see,

140
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,800
Guard Yang came from afar.

141
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,879
He must be hungry too.

142
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,079
Let's eat first.

143
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,040
Then we'll have strength to save her.

144
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,040
Eat.

145
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,199
You've worked hard.

146
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,439
Let's eat.

147
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,360
Thank you, Gongzhu.

148
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,279
I take my leave.

149
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,199
Gongzhu

150
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,160
Can we make the food less salty next time?

151
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,680
Back when I was in the palace,

152
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,560
the dishes I made

153
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,240
were always finished completely.

154
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:19,879
Looking back now,

155
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,160
it must have been those officials

156
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,399
trying to please me as Gongzhu.

157
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,480
They were deliberately flattering me.

158
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,319
Thinking about it now,

159
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,240
they were either currying favor,

160
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,160
or forced back to the palace by me.

161
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,240
Luckily,

162
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,079
you've finally woken up.

163
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,160
You understand the people's hardships.

164
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,360
I think, given time,

165
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,399
the people of Jincheng

166
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,879
I've thought of a way to save Rong Heng.

167
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,759
I hid some jailer uniforms outside the palace.

168
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,680
We can disguise ourselves as jailers

169
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,040
and go to the prison to rescue Rong Heng.

170
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,519
Gongzhu,

171
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,439
how do you have jailer uniforms?

172
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,399
Yeah,

173
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,160
back then,

174
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,800
after I rounded up all the handsome men,

175
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,600
I got playful for a moment

176
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,800
and wanted to visit the prison

177
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,879
to see the good-looking prisoners.

178
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,040
Gongzhu,

179
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:06,199
your methods are truly unique.

180
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,759
You...

181
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,160
Shaoye,

182
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,600
wait until the guards leave,

183
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,680
then sneak in behind me.

184
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,079
I really wonder

185
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,799
why you'd come here to choose a consort.

186
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,240
I told you, I was young and reckless.

187
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,200
Who hasn't,

188
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,759
done a few crazy things when young?

189
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,799
That's just twisted.

190
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,279
There's a banquet in the palace today.

191
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,240
The masters are in good spirits.

192
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,360
This is our reward.

193
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,159
It's my turn now.

194
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,200
Ladies,

195
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,440
we're still playing.

196
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
Look, the palace today

197
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,360
gave us fine wine and food.

198
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,480
Hurry,

199
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,559
come, drink!

200
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,759
Drink!

201
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,960
Smells really good.

202
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,840
This dish is nice.

203
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
Here, fill it up.

204
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,200
Rong Heng.

205
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,679
Rong Heng, are you there?

206
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,480
Gongzhu.

207
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,000
Gongzhu.

208
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,320
Rong Heng.

209
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,600
Rong Heng, Gongzhu.

210
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,519
Rong Heng.

211
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,440
You've suffered.

212
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,960
It's all Rong Heng's fault.

213
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,440
I made you fall from Gongzhu

214
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,200
to a commoner.

215
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
I don't blame you.

216
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,879
I know

217
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,440
you must have your own reasons.

218
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,879
Loser drinks!

219
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,720
I'll drink.

220
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:45,879
Bottoms up!

221
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:51,720
Another round!

222
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,519
Your turn now.

223
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,440
Bottoms up!

224
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,080
Keep it coming!

225
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,960
This wine smells great.

226
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,279
Tell me the truth.

227
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,559
Who forced you to do this?

228
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,240
You should leave.

229
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,120
If someone finds out...

230
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,960
Rong Heng.

231
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,679
Was it Su Wan'er?
