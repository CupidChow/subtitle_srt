1
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,239
Princess Royal, this is the place.

2
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:34,759
Princess Royal.

3
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,759
This is the best I could find

4
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,479
for you here, Princess Royal.

5
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,759
Please bear with it for now.

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,759
We've traveled all day.

7
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,159
Come rest, Princess Royal.

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,359
Princess Royal, have some water first.

9
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,320
What did you give me to drink?

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,159
It's so bitter.

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,479
Forgive me, Princess Royal.

12
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:56,920
It's well water.

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,520
The commoners drink this to quench thirst.

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,240
You...

15
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,880
haven't left the palace with me enough.

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,159
You're not as steady as Rong Heng.

17
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,680
Rong Heng...

18
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:10,760
What happened to him?

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,959
Why won't you let me out?

20
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:14,120
We're just following orders.

21
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,879
Please stay calm inside, Princess Royal.

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,760
Eunuch A Fu.

23
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,760
Brings the City Lord's decree.

24
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,159
Princess Royal Su Feng'er has acted improperly.

25
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,719
She intended to rebel.

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,760
She is demoted to commoner.

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,680
Never allowed to enter the palace again.

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,400
Eunuch A Fu...

29
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,159
What does this mean?

30
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,319
I didn't do it.

31
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,239
I want to see the Empress Mother.

32
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:41,879
Rong Heng tried to assassinate the City Lord last night.

33
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,680
He confessed and was punished.

34
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,560
In your palace, Rong Heng

35
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,799
was found with letters colluding with officials.

36
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,760
Letters plotting rebellion.

37
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,319
The City Lord issued this decree.

38
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:58,319
Look at these yourself.

39
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,280
It is my handwriting.

40
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,760
But I didn't write these.

41
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:07,879
Eunuch A Fu...

42
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,560
Do you believe me?

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,479
I want to see the Empress Mother.

44
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,520
The City Lord just coughed up blood in anger.

45
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,159
He has already issued the decree.

46
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,240
No one is allowed to see him.

47
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,120
Coughing blood?

48
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,800
Why would the Empress Mother cough blood?

49
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,240
Eunuch A Fu...

50
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,680
Eunuch A Fu...

51
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,560
Princess Royal.

52
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:30,759
Guard Yang.

53
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,080
Princess Royal.

54
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,400
You've suffered, Princess Royal.

55
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,479
How is Rong Heng now?

56
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,039
Why did she try to kill the Empress Mother?

57
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,159
I've been investigating secretly.

58
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,240
I only know she's being held in secret.

59
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,240
As for where she's held,

60
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,919
I have no way of knowing.

61
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:45,960
I see...

62
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,719
Can you arrange for palace guards

63
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,240
to let me in to see the Empress Mother?

64
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,400
This matter...

65
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,560
I'm truly powerless to help.

66
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,879
I was once commander of the armies,

67
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,520
but now my influence is gone.

68
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,120
It's hard for you too.

69
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,360
I have one more favor to ask.

70
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,879
Find out exactly where Rong Heng is held.

71
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,879
It will help us uncover the truth.

72
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,960
Your matters are my family's matters.

73
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,400
Besides, General Rong has helped me.

74
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,240
I will do all I can.

75
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,360
To fulfill your request.

76
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,599
I'll wait here for your news.

77
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:22,240
Yes.

78
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,000
Young Master.

79
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,520
You've been silent since leaving the palace.

80
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,159
We could've returned to Yue.

81
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,280
Why stay here?

82
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,240
To be a teacher?

83
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,879
Young Master...

84
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,599
Ruolin...

85
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,240
What do you think of Princess Royal?

86
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,759
Princess Royal was terrible to us.

87
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,960
Now she's banished from the palace.

88
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,479
She brought it on herself.

89
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,759
Can you say exactly

90
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,240
how she was terrible to us?

91
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,360
Can't remember, can you?

92
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,599
This time,

93
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,240
because of leaving the palace,

94
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,439
I couldn't tell right from wrong.

95
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,319
I became someone else's pawn.

96
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,959
And I harmed Princess Royal.

97
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,920
We must help her fix this.

98
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,920
We can't leave yet.

99
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,920
Will you help me?

100
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:33,800
Princess Royal.

101
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:34,519
Sit.

102
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,600
Shopkeeper, what are you staring at?

103
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,120
Clear the place.

104
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,279
Clear the place.

105
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,240
Why clear the place?

106
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,399
Shopkeeper.

107
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,879
Don't you recognize our Princess Royal?

108
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,680
Princess Royal or not,

109
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,560
here in my place,

110
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,879
everyone's just a guest.

111
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,879
If you have money, you eat here.

112
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,279
No money, go somewhere else.

113
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:55,879
You...

114
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,560
Forget it.

115
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,079
I am magnanimous.

116
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,079
I won't argue with her.

117
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,120
Xiao Tao.

118
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,279
Shopkeeper.

119
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,959
What food do you have today?

120
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,399
Serve it all to our Princess Royal.

121
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,600
We have food,

122
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,319
but some can't afford it.

123
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:12,920
How dare you!

124
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,839
I am Princess Royal of Jincheng.

125
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,160
I didn't want to argue with you.

126
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,600
But you keep pressing me.

127
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,920
Princess Royal...

128
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,680
You're just a commoner now.

129
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,399
Stop pretending to be Princess Royal.

130
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,560
Eat or don't, I don't care.

131
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,079
Xiao Tao.

132
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,360
Let's go.

133
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,600
Princess Royal.

134
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,040
Old lady,

135
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,800
Are you all right?

136
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:37,879
Get up quickly.

137
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,319
Let go.

138
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,399
Princess Royal.

139
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:40,480
Mother.

140
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,360
Where did you bump yourself?

141
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,240
Do you not watch where you're going?

142
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,720
Sir, you misunderstood.

143
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,920
We didn't bump into her.

144
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,240
I just helped her up.

145
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,319
Right, you didn't bump her.

146
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,959
Could my mother fall on her own?

147
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,759
Look.

148
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,199
And you say it wasn't you.

149
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,920
It's all right, Mother.

150
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,399
Fine.

151
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,160
Today was my fault.

152
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,079
Please forgive me.

153
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:00,680
Stop.

154
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,600
Forgive?

155
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,439
My mother is past her prime years.

156
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,519
If anything happens because of this,

157
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,519
can you bear the consequences?

158
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,399
What's so hard to bear?

159
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,560
Isn't it just paying money?

160
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,759
Money, right? Hand it over.

161
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,759
Thirty taels of silver.

162
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,439
Hand it over. What?

163
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,639
Thirty taels.

164
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,040
Give it here.

165
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,279
Xiao Tao.

166
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:16,839
Give the money.

167
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,959
Princess Royal.

168
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:26,319
Princess Royal only has twenty taels left.

169
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,279
Hand it over.

170
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,079
Twenty taels of silver.

171
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,360
Princess Royal, huh?

172
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,480
You're getting off easy today.

173
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,759
It's all right, Mother.

174
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,240
I'll take you to see a doctor soon.

175
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,519
Xiao Tao, let's go.

176
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,759
Princess Royal, it's time to eat.

177
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,759
Xiao Tao.

178
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,680
Tell me,

179
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,879
have I never considered others?

180
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,199
Never thought for anyone else?

181
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:05,759
Why do you say that, Princess Royal?

182
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,240
After what happened today,

183
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,120
I've been thinking,

184
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,160
back in the palace,

185
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,319
I always did whatever I wanted.

186
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,759
Just followed my own will.

187
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,720
Don't think that way, Princess Royal.

188
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,079
Princess Royal is of noble birth.

189
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,720
People like us,

190
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,439
were born to serve you.

191
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,680
Are people truly born noble or lowly?

192
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,279
What Princess Royal says,

193
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,920
I really don't understand.

194
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,480
All I know

195
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,199
is to serve my mistress well.

196
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:37,920
Princess Royal.

197
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,120
Let's eat first.

198
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,639
Xiao Tao.

199
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:42,800
Sit down and eat with me.

200
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,120
No.

201
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,920
Servants don't eat with their mistress.

202
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,519
From now on,

203
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,000
we'll rely on each other here.

204
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,160
Starting now,

205
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,600
we'll call each other sisters.

206
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,959
Let's eat.

207
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:19,800
Princess Royal.

208
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,959
I'm full.

209
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,519
I'll go gather the clothes.

210
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,800
You finished so quickly?

211
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,559
Xiao—

212
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:08,080
Boss.

213
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,600
Can you tell me how much this is worth?

214
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,840
This isn't worth much.

215
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,279
Not worth much?

216
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,600
If it was from the palace, it'd be valuable.

217
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
It is from the palace.

218
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,679
How can you prove it's from the palace?

219
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,759
Besides,

220
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,960
how would palace things end up with you?

221
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,840
Don't worry about that.

222
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,279
Just tell me its price.

223
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,679
Five taels of silver.

224
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,960
So little, even if it's from the palace?

225
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,720
It's valuable but rare to sell.

226
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:42,960
If you won't pawn it,

227
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,159
go try somewhere else.

228
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,559
If you come back, the price drops.

229
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,799
Pawn it.

230
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,360
Xiao Tao.

231
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,240
Princess Royal.

232
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,519
You're finally back.

233
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,320
Where did you go?

234
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,840
You worried me so much.

235
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,519
Guess what I brought you.

236
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,240
What's this?

237
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:16,440
Smells so good! Take a look.

238
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,159
How is it?

239
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,759
Princess Royal.

240
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,480
Where did you get all this money?

241
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,159
I found some work today.

242
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,120
Try it quickly.

243
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,320
You eat. You go first.

244
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,840
I still have more.

245
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,120
Go on, eat. Don't be shy.

246
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
Then let's eat together.

247
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,399
It smells so good.

248
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,039
It's been so long since we had

249
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,080
meat this delicious.

250
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,879
Eat more.

251
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,240
This palace treasure—

252
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,399
None of you have seen it, right?

253
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,519
Don't touch.

254
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,480
If you break it, you can't pay for it.

255
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,919
Mr. Xie.

256
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,159
You're very knowledgeable.

257
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:56,879
Please enlighten us.

258
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,159
All right.

259
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,200
Where did you get this item?

260
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,519
A noble pawned it here a few days ago.

261
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,639
Where is this person?

262
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,559
At—

263
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,840
At the bun shop on the east side of the street.
