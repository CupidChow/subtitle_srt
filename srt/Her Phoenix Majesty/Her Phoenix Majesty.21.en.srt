1
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:26,800
Let's see who dares.

2
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,439
I arrived too late to protect you.

3
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:35,560
I beg the Empress Mother for forgiveness.

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,399
Su Feng'er

5
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,000
Sister

6
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,679
Are you trying to force your way into the throne?

7
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,280
Looks like you're the one staging a coup.

8
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,560
You are a commoner now.

9
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:51,600
Without being summoned,

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,240
you barged into the royal hall.

11
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,479
Sister

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,640
Don't try to turn the tables on me.

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
Speaking of commoners,

14
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,399
I should thank you, sister.

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,040
You forced me out of the palace.

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,680
Because of that,

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,560
I learned a lot.

18
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:11,799
Let's hear it.

19
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,840
For example, you colluded with outsiders.

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,840
You plotted to seize the throne.

21
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,640
You set up private troops.

22
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,040
Took bribes.

23
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,159
Eliminated rivals.

24
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,040
Sister, you must be joking.

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,280
Colluding with outsiders,

26
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,159
plotting to seize power,

27
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,959
assassinating the Empress Mother—

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,680
All of these

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,120
weren't they done by you?

30
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,319
Empress Mother

31
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,480
I have here

32
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,760
evidence that my sister framed me for treason.

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,959
I present it for your review.

34
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,480
Su Wan'er

35
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,640
How dare you!

36
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,239
Empress Mother, you're already

37
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,760
believing her words?

38
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,919
Don't forget,

39
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,319
you were the one who made her a commoner.

40
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,159
Here's the evidence.

41
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,000
See for yourself.

42
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,000
That's all?

43
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,280
There's more to this than meets the eye.

44
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,039
I'll explain to the Empress Mother another day.

45
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,639
Another day?

46
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,800
How much longer do you want to wait?

47
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,680
After I execute the traitor Su Feng'er, of course.

48
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:43,960
Guards!

49
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,960
Sister

50
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,159
Surrender.

51
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,240
We are family by blood.

52
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,159
I believe the Empress Mother will show you mercy.

53
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,360
Wan'er

54
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,479
What happened today,

55
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,439
I'll treat it as youthful recklessness.

56
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,479
Don't be stubborn.

57
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,840
Don't make a grave mistake.

58
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,240
And then?

59
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,560
Then you'll keep favoring Su Feng'er.

60
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,520
Am I just your caged canary in the palace?

61
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,120
What are you saying?

62
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,879
I treat you both equally.

63
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,719
There's no favoritism.

64
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,479
Equally?

65
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,759
Empress Mother

66
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,879
Don't you feel guilty saying that?

67
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,879
No matter how hard I try,

68
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,400
in your heart,

69
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,520
there's only Su Feng'er.

70
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,319
Sister was obsessed with men,

71
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,960
caused so much trouble,

72
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,560
and you fixed it for her.

73
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,919
She neglected her studies,

74
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,120
drove away many teachers,

75
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,800
and you found her the best tutors.

76
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,120
Her reputation suffered,

77
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,919
so you held royal gatherings for her.

78
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,560
One thing after another—

79
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,919
Which one

80
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,159
wasn't about grooming her as heir?

81
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,360
Sister

82
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,039
All these years,

83
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,919
I didn't know you suffered so much.

84
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll make it up to you.

85
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,120
Su Feng'er

86
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,879
You think coming here will change anything?

87
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,039
Let me tell you—

88
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,560
Nothing will change.

89
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,680
Guards!

90
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,800
Drag them all away!

91
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,360
Are you all deaf?

92
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,319
I said drag them away!

93
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,600
Xie Yuan, Palace Historian, is here.

94
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,519
Let's see who dares harm the Princess.

95
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,959
Xie Yuan

96
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,639
Xie Yuan

97
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,120
I arrived too late to protect you.

98
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,519
I beg the Lord for forgiveness.

99
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,360
You are forgiven.

100
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,319
Guards!

101
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,600
Drag them all away!

102
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,120
I want them cut to pieces!

103
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,319
Welcome the Princess back to the palace.

104
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,079
Welcome the Princess back to the palace.

105
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,319
Sister

106
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
Stop now.

107
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,120
Wan'er

108
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,000
Since you were little,

109
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,120
you were frail and sickly.

110
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,680
The imperial doctors all said

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,680
you wouldn't live past ten.

112
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,759
But I didn't believe them.

113
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,759
I never let you train in martial arts.

114
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,519
Gave you the best food and clothes.

115
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,519
At last,

116
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,279
you survived past ten.

117
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,560
But you remained weak.

118
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,639
Always falling ill.

119
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:56,920
Empress Mother

120
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,079
I worried every single day.

121
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,519
I wished

122
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,519
I could suffer in your place.

123
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,600
Do you know that?

124
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,399
No.

125
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,720
I don't believe it.

126
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,040
You're lying to me.

127
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,000
You're all lying to me.

128
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,079
Child

129
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,720
Stop now.

130
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,839
I can let the past go.

131
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,680
Stop.

132
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,839
Stop.

133
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,759
Empress Mother, do you think

134
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,360
I can still stop now?

135
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,519
Su Feng'er must die today.

136
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,279
Wan'er

137
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,040
Wan'er

138
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,839
Xie Yuan

139
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,480
Xie Yuan

140
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:51,959
Wan'er

141
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,879
Summon the imperial doctor.

142
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,199
Call the imperial doctor!

143
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,800
Xie Yuan

144
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,959
Xie Yuan

145
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:00,759
Xie Yuan

146
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:14,879
Young Master

147
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,759
You're about to become Prince Consort

148
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,959
and enjoy a life of luxury.

149
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,959
So maybe we don't have to leave now?

150
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,319
Besides,

151
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,480
Rong Heng and I still have plenty of time.

152
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,120
Don't worry.

153
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,519
Those destined to meet

154
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,759
will always find each other.

155
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,839
The Princess is already busy now.

156
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,319
There's nothing

157
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,800
she needs my help with.

158
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,360
We came out here to travel anyway.

159
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,959
We've stayed in Jin City

160
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,680
for far too long.

161
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,439
And my Chronicle

162
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,360
is still unfinished.

163
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,759
Yes, Young Master.

164
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,759
It's time for us to set out.

165
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,759
Let's go.

166
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,720
Alright.

167
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,360
Young Master.

168
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,680
I, Su Feng'er,

169
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,360
have come to bid farewell to the Empress Mother.

170
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,759
Feng'er.

171
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,639
You're giving up your rightful place as heir.

172
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,399
Where are you planning to go?

173
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,120
Empress Mother,

174
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,879
I believe

175
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:17,120
to be a true and wise ruler,

176
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,920
one must travel the world,

177
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,759
learn of its many ways and the people's hardships,

178
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,279
only then can one govern the realm.

179
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,439
On this journey,

180
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,839
I will learn

181
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
how to become a true and wise ruler.

182
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,800
I ask for your permission, Empress Mother.

183
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,960
My Feng'er has grown up.

184
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,440
Alright.

185
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,960
I grant you permission.

186
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,639
Thank you, Empress Mother.

187
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,759
Rong Heng.

188
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,080
Princess.

189
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,519
Is everything packed?

190
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,440
All packed.

191
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,799
Xie Yuan really is something...

192
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,679
The world is vast—

193
00:08:58,759 --> 00:08:59,960
where do you think he could go?

194
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,919
I don't believe

195
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,639
he'd give this precious travelogue to me.

196
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,399
I and Ruolin

197
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,240
have agreed to keep in touch by letter.

198
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,320
Maybe it won't be long.

199
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,480
Alright.

200
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,960
Then let's head to the next city

201
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,360
and see where he runs off to.

202
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,039
Hyah!
