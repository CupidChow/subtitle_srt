1
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,440
Young Master Xie

2
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,120
Your writing is truly impressive.

3
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:22,800
Of course.

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,640
I received an excellent education.

5
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,120
Is your homeland like Jin City?

6
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,039
Quite the opposite.

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:29,679
Princess.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,559
Look.

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,359
Quite the opposite.

10
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,759
How did those two end up together?

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,719
Let's go see.

12
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,920
Our land values men above women.

13
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:43,359
Men live carefree lives.

14
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,079
There are places with equality.

15
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,520
Of course.

16
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,240
If you never travel,

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,039
how will you know the world?

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,960
According to Young Master Xie,

19
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:53,159
the Masculine Virtue Class is flawed.

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,759
Exactly, Mo Gongzi.

21
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:56,679
Here, everything is upside down.

22
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,439
Men have no dignity at all.

23
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,560
You should know,

24
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,320
men elsewhere in the world

25
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,280
live completely different lives.

26
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:04,560
Take our Yue Kingdom,

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,840
we practice gender equality.

28
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,879
Both men and women can trade or govern.

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,760
Young Master Xie.

30
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,200
Since we're here, we should accept it.

31
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,959
Since the princess chose us,

32
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,920
our lives should belong to her.

33
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,280
Mo Gongzi.

34
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,640
Our lives belong to ourselves.

35
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,719
Why starve yourself for favor?

36
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:24,560
You look pale and frail from hunger.

37
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,040
Instead of being used for amusement,

38
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,120
why not walk the world?

39
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,560
See the vast lands.

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,959
Be a true man, stand tall.

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,879
Why must men live without dignity?

42
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,719
That makes sense.

43
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,040
But it's hard to realize that here.

44
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,519
Young Master Xie, our paths differ.

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,439
I don't agree with you,

46
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,760
but I respect your view.

47
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,239
I have other matters.

48
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,640
I'll take my leave now.

49
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,359
They're used to a pampered life,

50
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,640
like sheltered flowers.

51
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,319
How could they endure hardship?

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,560
Equality between men and women?

53
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,080
How could that be possible?

54
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,240
Little Yuanyuan.

55
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,360
Soon enough,

56
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,680
you'll be just like them.

57
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:21,439
I know you all enjoy tea.

58
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,759
So today I've arranged

59
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,520
a tea ceremony class for you.

60
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,759
Thank you, Princess.

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,479
Little Yuanyuan, I—

62
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,120
I've heard you're skilled in tea.

63
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,360
This class is for you.

64
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,360
Don't disappoint me.

65
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,360
Gentlemen,

66
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,800
let's begin.

67
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,800
Liu'an tea.

68
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,080
Jinmen Tuanhuang.

69
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,560
Guzhu Zisun.

70
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,159
Pu'er.

71
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,719
Mengding Shihua.

72
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,599
Young Master Xie, your tea skills need work.

73
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,680
Isn't Little Yuanyuan best at tea?

74
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,919
Did I get it wrong?

75
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,479
Princess.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,479
New fabrics arrived outside the palace.

77
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,479
Alright.

78
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,919
Carry on.

79
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,280
Little Yuanyuan.

80
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,719
Don't let me down.

81
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,680
Farewell, Princess.

82
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,520
Young Master Xie.

83
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,039
I'll give you one more chance.

84
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,599
Try this.

85
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,680
What tea is this?

86
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,400
I can't tell.

87
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,479
You—

88
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,919
The princess praised you,

89
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,599
said your tea skills are superb,

90
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,919
even set up a tea test for you.

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,280
But I don't see it.

92
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,520
Let me show you something.

93
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,680
Taste this.

94
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,680
What are you doing?

95
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,079
You're wasting the tea.

96
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,240
Can you smell this?

97
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,040
Here we have

98
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,600
Bijian Mingyue,

99
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,279
Huangshan Maofeng,

100
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,920
and Wuyi rock tea.

101
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,920
That's right.

102
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,079
Exactly.

103
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,639
And also

104
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,199
Yuye Changchun,

105
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,120
Huizhou Songluo,

106
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,319
And one more,

107
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,600
Shenquan Xiaotuan.

108
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,879
Impressive.

109
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,560
Young Master Xie is a tea sage reborn.

110
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
Madam.

111
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,879
It's not that I don't know tea.

112
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,839
I just disdain using tea tasting as a test.

113
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,560
What are you doing?

114
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,040
You dare mock me?

115
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,879
A true man repays his grudges.

116
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,959
I'll remember this debt.

117
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,240
Alright.

118
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,240
I made this medicine myself.

119
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,360
It must be freshly prepared.

120
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,920
Come every other day.

121
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,120
You'll recover soon.

122
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,480
Thank you, Princess Er.

123
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:14,720
It's nothing.

124
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,360
Princess Er has read so many books.

125
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,519
You must be very learned.

126
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,680
I am humbled in comparison.

127
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,680
Not at all.

128
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,920
Just for amusement.

129
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,879
But I recently acquired a rare book.

130
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,720
It records strange tales.

131
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,839
I don't know if they're true

132
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,439
or just imagined.

133
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,839
I'd love to hear more.

134
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,759
It says there's a small land by the Eastern Sea.

135
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,920
Its people are uncivilized,

136
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,279
their ways are barbaric.

137
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,759
They eat raw fish.

138
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,160
So the people are stunted in stature,

139
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,439
thin and frail.

140
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,480
It's also called

141
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,680
The Stunted Isles.

142
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,480
Also known as

143
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:07,920
Woguo.

144
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,759
I once traveled there.

145
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,800
Where did you read about it, Princess?

146
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
Records of Origins.

147
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,759
My Records of Origins!

148
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,920
Wonderful!

149
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,120
Wonderful!

150
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:45,759
Princess

151
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,079
My Records of Origins
has been found again.

152
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,680
I got a bit emotional
after that.

153
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,360
I was really
too abrupt.

154
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,800
Please, I hope
you don't mind.

155
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,759
It's nothing.

156
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,319
Since Young Master Xie
wrote this book,

157
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,399
it should be returned
to its owner.

158
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,160
Princess Er

159
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,360
I don't even know
how to thank you.
