1
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,679
Don't worry, Gongzhu.

2
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,160
It's all right.

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,239
Gongzhu.

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,120
How is it?

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,039
Did you find him?

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,640
Search for him.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,960
Dig everywhere if you must.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,399
You must bring him to me.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,920
Yes.

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,679
Please don't worry, Gongzhu.

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:34,679
That boy Xie Yuan—

12
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:36,039
If we can't find him, so be it.

13
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:36,719
In the future,

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,320
won't we still serve you?

15
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:38,960
Right?

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,079
Who do you think you are?

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,320
You dare mention Xiao Yuan to me?

18
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:43,560
Deliver my command.

19
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,240
Expel all officials from the palace.

20
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,799
Leave none behind.

21
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,159
Steaming hot buns.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,960
Would you like one?

23
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,159
Fresh from the oven.

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,000
They're delicious.

25
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:53,479
I'll have one.

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,159
I'm not hungry.

27
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:57,399
Bun.

28
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:59,560
Freshly baked bun.

29
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,000
Gongzhu has given an order.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,719
Find this person.

31
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,680
A great reward awaits.

32
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,680
Steaming hot buns.

33
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,799
Straw hat.

34
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,200
Take a look at the straw hat.

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,799
It's really nice.

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,760
Freshly baked bun.

37
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,640
Gongzhu.

38
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,879
Please, Gongzhu.

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,840
What's wrong with our Gongzhu?

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,719
She probably wants to drive us all out.

41
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,000
She wants everyone gone.

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,079
Forgive us.

43
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,680
Please, Gongzhu.

44
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,640
Gongzhu.

45
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,879
Forgive Xiang'er.

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,879
Xiao Tao.

47
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,120
What's all the commotion outside?

48
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,560
Gongzhu.

49
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,719
It's Zhao Xiang and the others.

50
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,120
They're all kneeling outside the palace gate.

51
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,400
They insist on staying.

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,200
Forgive us, Gongzhu.

53
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,040
Enough.

54
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,680
They've served me for years.

55
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,920
They're quite pitiful.

56
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,000
Let them stay.

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,040
Yes.

58
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:06,400
Young master.

59
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,719
Are you just leaving like this?

60
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,639
What about Ruo Lin?

61
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,319
You can go find her.

62
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,280
Who are you?

63
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,520
I...

64
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,840
I'm here to see the second Gongzhu.

65
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,000
Our young master and your second Gongzhu

66
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,280
are good friends.

67
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,879
Get out!

68
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,840
You don't belong here.

69
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,120
Don't blame us for being rude.

70
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,599
Second Gongzhu.

71
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,039
I'm Ruo Lin.

72
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,560
You're with Xie Yuan. Leave!

73
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
Second Gongzhu.

74
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,879
I'm with Xie Yuan!

75
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,840
I'm Ruo Lin!

76
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,319
Who's outside?

77
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,280
Why all the noise?

78
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
Reporting to Gongzhu,

79
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,199
it's Xie Yuan's attendant.

80
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,240
His name is Ruo Lin.

81
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,840
He's asking you to let him leave the palace.

82
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,039
Should I go drive him away?

83
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:00,840
Wait.

84
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,599
Take him away.

85
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,719
Treat him well.

86
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,520
Yes.

87
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
Sister.

88
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:28,000
Are you worried about Xie Yuan?

89
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,520
There's still no news of him.

90
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,400
What should I do?

91
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,879
Don't worry, sister.

92
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,840
If Ruo Lin, Xie Yuan's attendant, is paraded,

93
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,479
Xie Yuan will surely appear.

94
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,719
And Ruo Lin is in your palace now.

95
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,800
Who is it?

96
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,879
They're beheading someone!

97
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,240
Look, someone's being executed!

98
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,240
I heard they caught a Yue spy in the palace.

99
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,680
He'll be executed at noon.

100
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,639
Yue spy.

101
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,840
Ruo Lin.

102
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,199
Young master.

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,199
Ruo Lin will go first.

104
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,480
If there's another life,

105
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,480
Ruo Lin will still follow you.

106
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,480
GONGZHU ARRIVES.

107
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
Everyone, rise.

108
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,600
Today, I will witness the execution myself.

109
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,800
It's to

110
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,319
show Jin Guo's national power.

111
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,000
The person before you

112
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,360
is truly

113
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,560
a Yue spy.

114
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,319
Guilty of unforgivable crimes.

115
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,720
Full of cunning schemes.

116
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,959
If not executed,

117
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,480
the people's anger won't be calmed.

118
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,879
Execute! Execute!

119
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:52,839
Stop!

120
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,639
Execute!

121
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,879
Xie Yuan.

122
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,879
Young master.

123
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,079
Why are you here?

124
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,279
Are you all right?

125
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,160
I'm fine.

126
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,600
Gongzhu.

127
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,399
You say he's a spy.

128
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,439
Do you have proof?

129
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,439
How dare you!

130
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,040
My word is proof enough.

131
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,319
Xie Yuan.

132
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,319
You think I'll release him just because you came?

133
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,240
You underestimate me.

134
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,000
You approached me first.

135
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,519
You tricked me out of the palace.

136
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,480
I didn't expect it was all a lie.

137
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,120
If you want me to release him, I can.

138
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,040
Cut off your own legs

139
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,199
and I'll let him go.

140
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,240
Young master, you mustn't!

141
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,000
It's fine.

142
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,199
I know what I'm doing.

143
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,800
Gongzhu

144
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,639
Just to vent your anger,

145
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,079
you want my legs,

146
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,399
and others' lives.

147
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,079
Then I think Jin Guo's people won't live long.

148
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,879
Because in your eyes,

149
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,639
our lives are worthless.

150
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,279
Do you know why everyone fears you?

151
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,120
Because you don't value their lives.

152
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,319
Isn't that right, everyone?

153
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,319
Yeah, aren't our lives lives too?

154
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,439
Let him go! Let Xie Yuan go!

155
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:23,319
Let him go! Let him go!

156
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,079
Let him go!

157
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:24,680
Quiet.

158
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,600
I can let him go,

159
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
but you two

160
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,920
must return to the palace with me.

161
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,199
Alright.

162
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,480
I promise you.

163
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,879
Release him now.

164
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
Take them back to the palace.

165
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,480
You've suffered.

166
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,439
Young master.

167
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,720
Ruo Lin is fine.

168
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,079
Let's go.
