1
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:21,960
Xie Yuan

2
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,359
What did you make here?

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,600
This is way too careless.

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,239
It's more than just careless.

5
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:28,640
Gongzhu, look at him.

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,760
This is an important offering.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,800
And he made only this.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,960
Gongzhu

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,000
Xie Yuan is being truly disrespectful.

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,200
Enough.

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,840
I've grown tired of delicacies.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,799
Having vegetarian food is nice for a change.

13
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:47,399
Gongzhu, Gongzhu

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,640
This is...

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,679
Radish

16
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:51,320
Yes, it's radish.

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,560
As they say, true greatness is found in simplicity.

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,719
Call the imperial doctor, hurry!

19
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,600
Someone, come quickly!

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,560
What did you give Gongzhu to eat?

21
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,840
Look what you've done.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,239
Gongzhu hasn't had an allergy in years.

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,040
Why would it happen today?

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,959
It's all because of Xie Yuan.

25
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,719
Who knows what he's thinking.

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,319
He made radish for Gongzhu on purpose.

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,040
Sir

28
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,439
How is Gongzhu now?

29
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,359
City Lord

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,799
Reporting to City Lord

31
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,799
Something happened.

32
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:30,799
What happened?

33
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:31,879
Why are you so flustered?

34
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:32,799
Gongzhu

35
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,840
The eldest Gongzhu fainted.

36
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,200
What?

37
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,920
How is Gongzhu?

38
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:39,879
Go inside.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,200
How is Gongzhu, really?

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,079
Young Master

41
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,560
Harming Gongzhu is a grave crime.

42
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,640
You'd better behave.

43
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
Harm

44
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,079
Gongzhu is dead.

45
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,439
No way.

46
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,799
It can't be that serious.

47
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,319
She won't drink.

48
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,439
Let me do it.

49
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,719
What should we do?

50
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,240
Enough, enough.

51
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,599
Greetings, City Lord.

52
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,159
Let me do it.

53
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,560
What exactly happened?

54
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,599
Reporting to City Lord

55
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,159
Gongzhu, she...

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,479
She ate the radish Xie Yuan made.

57
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,520
What?

58
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,599
Radish

59
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,199
With so many ingredients,

60
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,319
Xie Yuan didn't pick any of them.

61
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,560
He chose only radish.

62
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:33,879
City Lord

63
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,479
There's no such thing as coincidence.

64
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,759
It's Xie Yuan again.

65
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,560
Where is he?

66
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,080
He's been locked up.

67
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,360
Afu

68
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,159
Here.

69
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,520
Pass on my order.

70
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,879
Set a date to execute Xie Yuan.

71
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,680
Yes.

72
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,199
Xie Yuan

73
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,159
Xie Yuan

74
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:57,719
Mo Yuan

75
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:01,960
Xie Yuan

76
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,719
Mo Yuan

77
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,719
Here.

78
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,479
Thank you.

79
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,599
How is Gongzhu?

80
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,680
Gongzhu hasn't woken up yet.

81
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,919
City Lord has already ordered

82
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,720
to execute you soon.

83
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,759
Stay strong.

84
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,040
Once Gongzhu wakes up,

85
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,800
she will clear your name.

86
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,959
Do you trust me?

87
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:24,800
I do.

88
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,879
Gongzhu has been allergic to radish since childhood.

89
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,680
Only her attendants know about the allergy.

90
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,720
I suppose

91
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,800
you didn't mean to do it.

92
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,160
Xie Yuan

93
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,959
It's not safe to stay here.

94
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,680
I'll take my leave.

95
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:39,879
Thank you.

96
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,319
Feng'er

97
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,160
It's all your mother.

98
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,800
I'm sorry to you.

99
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:21,879
Royal Mother

100
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,920
I carved this Mighty General myself.

101
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,040
I want to give it to you.

102
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,000
You are ignorant and unskilled.

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,160
As the eldest Gongzhu of our nation,

104
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,560
do you know how many lives you carry?

105
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,480
Royal Mother only cares about state affairs.

106
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,839
I don't like Royal Mother anymore.

107
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,000
Feng'er

108
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,199
You are the future City Lord.

109
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,399
Don't blame Royal Mother for being so harsh.

110
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,079
Gongzhu

111
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:27,600
Feng'er

112
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,079
Gongzhu, you're awake.

113
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,360
Royal Mother

114
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,639
Slowly, slowly.

115
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,240
Take it slow.

116
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,000
Your child greets Royal Mother.

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,639
Enough, no need for formalities.

118
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,639
I'm fine now.

119
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,800
Gongzhu

120
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,000
The City Lord watched over you all night.

121
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,759
I made Royal Mother worry.

122
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,360
Eunuch Afu

123
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,839
Quick, help Royal Mother back to rest.

124
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,000
Yes.

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,959
Where is Xie Yuan?

126
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,759
He used poisonous radish to harm you.

127
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,439
I order his execution.

128
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,199
Royal Mother, please calm your anger.

129
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,360
Royal Mother

130
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,199
The officials in my palace

131
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,360
all have money,

132
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,480
except Xie Yuan.

133
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,360
So,

134
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,399
he can only buy cheap ingredients.

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,759
You just recovered from illness,

136
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,040
yet you still worry about him.

137
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,279
A man who won't spend a few taels of silver

138
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,519
what's the use of keeping him?

139
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,360
Royal Mother, you don't know

140
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,720
this Du Momo

141
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,519
sells kitchen ingredients at high prices.

142
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,639
My palace staff suffer because of it.

143
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,000
Feng'er

144
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,920
Don't lie for Xie Yuan's sake.

145
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,079
City Lord

146
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,920
What Gongzhu said

147
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,800
is not even a fraction of Du Momo's crimes.

148
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,240
Du Momo not only sells river clams

149
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,920
for dozens of taels of gold,

150
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,399
but also, without Gongzhu's consent,

151
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,399
takes the pastries gifted to Gongzhu

152
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,639
and coral bracelets, all for herself.

153
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,920
This is outrageous.

154
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,120
Pass down my order.

155
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,120
Confiscate all of Du Momo's belongings.

156
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,720
Await further punishment.

157
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,800
Yes.

158
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,240
Royal Mother

159
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,360
So Xie Yuan has passed the test

160
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,639
and may stay in the palace.

161
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,639
Enough, enough.

162
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,120
Focus on recovering your health first.

163
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,639
If your staff cause trouble again,

164
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,240
I won't keep a single one.

165
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,600
Yes.
