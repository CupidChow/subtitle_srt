1
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,079
Stop hitting me.

2
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,359
Stop hitting me.

3
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:23,000
Xiao Yuan Yuan

4
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,000
Gongzhu

5
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:29,800
You're really too frail.

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
It was just pretend fighting.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,159
How did you still faint?

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,079
No.

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,759
I shouted so loud I ran out of air.

10
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,119
Look at you—

11
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:38,399
Living comfortably in the palace,

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,520
with so many people serving you,

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,799
and you still want to run away.

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,079
Gongzhu,

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,479
I'm just a commoner.

16
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,560
I can't stand all this palace luxury.

17
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,200
Please, let me go.

18
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:54,719
Absurd.

19
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,719
Without my protection,

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,000
you'd be like a lamb to the slaughter.

21
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,359
If I hadn't saved you,

22
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,479
you'd be a Drunken Flowers patron by now.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,760
Xiao Yuan Yuan,

24
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:08,519
don't worry.

25
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,879
Just stay obediently in the palace,

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and I promise

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,120
you'll have wealth and honor.

28
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,640
Chengzhu

29
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,439
Du Momo is here.

30
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,680
Your servant greets Chengzhu.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,920
Du Momo

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,519
You watched Feng'er grow up.

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,200
As long as you're by her side,

34
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,439
I can rest easy.

35
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,280
She recently took in a scholar.

36
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,519
He's quite talented.

37
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,319
I've made him Feng'er's study companion.

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,480
But he's from Yue.

39
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,799
He knows nothing of our palace etiquette

40
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,439
or our rules.

41
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,079
Take this chance

42
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,319
to teach him well.

43
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,680
Yes.

44
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,359
I will do my best to ease your worries.

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,560
By the way,

46
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,599
the other scholars in her palace

47
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,200
should be properly disciplined too.

48
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,239
It's a mess in there.

49
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,239
It's upsetting to see.

50
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,120
Yes.

51
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,519
I won't let you down.

52
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,159
Xie Yuan, oh Xie Yuan,

53
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,919
you're so clueless.

54
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,840
That tyrant mother and daughter

55
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,039
would never punish their own.

56
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,759
Now you're her study companion.

57
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,560
Escaping is nearly impossible.

58
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,919
No way.

59
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,439
I have to leave tonight.

60
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,159
Wait, no.

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,759
I haven't found my Records of Origins yet.

62
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,599
Why take the clothes she gave me?

63
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:38,759
Xiao Yuan Yuan,

64
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,759
are you leaving?

65
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,400
Aren't you the study companion now?

66
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,280
I took from my bundle

67
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,000
the clothes you gave me.

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,759
Pick one that suits you.

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,879
Xiao Yuan Yuan,

70
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,479
I didn't expect you to care so much.

71
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,039
It's my fault for neglecting you.

72
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,879
I didn't prepare proper clothes for you.

73
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,360
Don't worry.

74
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,759
As long as you stay in the palace,

75
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,800
I promise

76
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,840
to give you the best of everything.

77
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,840
That's really not necessary.

78
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,599
Xiao Yuan Yuan,

79
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,400
then

80
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,800
rest early.

81
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,840
Escaped trouble again.

82
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,800
But how much longer can I hide?

83
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,639
Once I find the Records of Origins,

84
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,599
I must find a way to escape.

85
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,879
For now, I have to compromise.

86
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,400
Gongzhu

87
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,439
It's time to get up.

88
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,560
Gongzhu

89
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,919
It's time to get up.

90
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,759
Gongzhu

91
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,080
Gongzhu

92
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,360
Gongzhu

93
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,840
Xie Gongzi is here!

94
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,319
What?

95
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,680
Xie Gongzi is here.

96
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:55,879
Hurry, hurry!

97
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,039
Dress me up, quickly!

98
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,000
Gongzhu

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,280
I lied to you.

100
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,159
You brat!

101
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,319
Greetings, Gongzhu.

102
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,520
Du Momo

103
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,439
Why are you here?

104
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,919
I just told Xiao Tao

105
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,520
I'd visit you when I have time.

106
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,759
Yes, Du Momo,

107
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,840
Gongzhu often says she wants to visit you.

108
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,479
Gongzhu's words humble me.

109
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,759
Chengzhu sent me.

110
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,759
I heard Gongzhu recruited

111
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,240
a scholar from Yue.

112
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,959
Chengzhu ordered me

113
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,560
to teach him rules and etiquette.

114
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,480
So it's for Xiao Yuan Yuan.

115
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,560
That's fine.

116
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,279
Du Momo is strict.

117
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,600
I won't have to worry anymore.

118
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,399
Alright, Du Momo.

119
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,279
I'll have Xiao Tao

120
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,759
bring Xie Yuan to the main hall.

121
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,519
Wait.

122
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,639
There's more.

123
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,639
Gongzhu, gather everyone

124
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,360
in your residence.

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,519
Let me see them.

126
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:49,360
See if they serve you well.

127
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,160
Alright.

128
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,040
Du Momo

129
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,680
We'll go together later.

130
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
Yes.

131
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,600
This—

132
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,759
the study companion's clothes

133
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,759
are quite refined.

134
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,639
Gongzi

135
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,240
You've gone from scholar to study companion.

136
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,439
You're the first ever.

137
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,160
I don't need this.

138
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,120
Take it away.

139
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,079
But palace rules say

140
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,720
men must wear rouge when going out.

141
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,319
Is there a rule

142
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,439
that you must obey your master?

143
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,519
I don't need it. Take it away.

144
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,920
Yes.

145
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,759
Young Master Xie, come with me quickly.

146
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,079
Gongzhu asked you to go learn etiquette.

147
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,319
Even the study companion must learn etiquette?

148
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,759
You'll know once you go.

149
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,079
Gongzhu, Young Master Xie is here.

150
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,439
You are

151
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,680
Xie Yuan.

152
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,720
You see Gongzhu,

153
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,279
why don't you bow?

154
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:56,959
Why should I bow?

155
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:57,959
Du Momo.

156
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,439
Um...

157
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,199
I'm having a spat with him.

158
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,319
Isn't that right, Xie Yuan?

159
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,600
Bow.

160
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,399
Du Momo.

161
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,839
Young Master Xie.

162
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,879
Let me warn you first.

163
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,600
I'm here by the City Lord's order.

164
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,040
I'm here to teach you what etiquette is.

165
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,079
And what rules are.

166
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,800
Do you know, in this palace,

167
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,879
what you most need to learn?

168
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,279
Do you all know?

169
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,800
No.

170
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,040
In this palace,

171
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,639
the most important thing to learn

172
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,600
is Male Virtue.

173
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,519
You truly know nothing

174
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,800
about Male Virtue.

175
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,240
Men should value gentleness and harmony.

176
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,360
Step down.

177
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,160
Standing so straight—

178
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,199
are you trying to outshine Gongzhu?

179
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:55,800
You—

180
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,439
Step down, now.

181
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:56,839
Down.

182
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,319
Du Momo.

183
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,600
Um...

184
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,639
He didn't mean that.

185
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,240
Serving Gongzhu,

186
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,879
your face has no makeup at all.

187
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,560
You're really being careless.

188
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,160
Someone, come.

189
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,759
I'll do your makeup myself.

190
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,639
You—

191
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,920
How dare you—

192
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,360
You—

193
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,600
You—

194
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,040
How dare you, how dare—

195
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,680
How dare you!

196
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,560
That's tall enough.

197
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,680
Now that's more like it.

198
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,879
I'm not that talented,

199
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,439
but those I've taught Male Virtue

200
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,079
have become proper gentlemen.

201
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,279
Countless, in fact.

202
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,680
This time, I've come

203
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,560
to design a special course for you.

204
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,040
This is the palace's finest compilation.

205
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,680
You must memorize it well.

206
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,879
Also, do you see

207
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:54,680
those things?

208
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,399
Those over there?

209
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,360
They're materials for your needlework.

210
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,079
Your embroidery must also improve.

211
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,120
The rest,

212
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,639
I'll teach him slowly.

213
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,480
But

214
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,800
more importantly,

215
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,079
next time you see Gongzhu,

216
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,759
if your face lacks makeup again,

217
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,680
I'll report to the City Lord.

218
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,959
That won't be a simple punishment.

219
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,319
Absurd!

220
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,680
Come back here!

221
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,480
Xie Yuan.

222
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,839
Don't worry, Du Momo.

223
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,600
I'll make sure to supervise him well.

224
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,600
Let's have some tea first.

225
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,480
Just agree to it.

226
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,480
Du Momo is very skilled at training people.

227
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,600
Though a scholar may die, never be humiliated,

228
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,159
but under another's roof,

229
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,480
one must bow their head.

230
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,279
I

231
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,399
will take good care of Gongzhu.

232
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,120
That's more like it.

233
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:53,919
Bring it here.

234
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,639
Take it.

235
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,000
Clean the entire Gongzhu's residence

236
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,879
from top to bottom.

237
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,320
That's all.

238
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,879
Understood?

239
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:04,559
Du Momo.

240
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,720
Let's go have tea first.

241
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,399
Remember that.

242
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:11,360
Go, go, go.

243
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,440
Let's go have tea, let's go.

244
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,240
Do a good job.

245
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,039
Go.

246
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,639
Go.

247
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,039
What tea does Gongzhu drink?

248
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,039
Bi Luo Chun.

249
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,000
Bi Luo Chun is great.
