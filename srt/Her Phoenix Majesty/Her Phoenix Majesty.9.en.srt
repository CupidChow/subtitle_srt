00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:21,120
Rong Heng

2
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,039
This poetry collection, for me,

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,519
is absolutely no challenge at all.

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,160
Go find another one for me.

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,039
Yes.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,479
If Xiao Yuan Yuan saw my calligraphy,

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,520
he'd surely be enchanted by me.

8
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,679
Princess, your talent is remarkable.

9
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,359
Xiao Yuan Yuan, you're here!

10
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,079
The Mountain Climbing Ode you chose

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,920
is truly the finest among these works.

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,719
Great minds think alike.

13
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,119
I think so too.

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,439
These classics

15
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,680
are all by renowned masters.

16
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,079
I hope you treasure them well

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,040
and practice diligently.

18
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,120
That's exactly my intention.

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,480
Xiao Yuan Yuan

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,079
How about

21
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,799
you practice with me?

22
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:16,879
Please.

23
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:29,719
Princess,

24
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,120
you should calm down and take it slow.

25
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,040
Mister Xie

26
00:01:59,239 --> 00:01:59,959
Princess Er

27
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,159
No need for formalities.

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
Mister Xie

29
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,680
Is something troubling you?

30
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,479
Just missing home under the moon.

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,840
Seeing you so homesick,

32
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,719
I truly worry for you.

33
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,479
I hope you can return to Yue soon.

34
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,360
Thank you, Princess Er.

35
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,120
But the Princess Royal

36
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,879
seems to tell me everything,

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,159
but about the defenses,

38
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,560
she only reveals a little.

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,560
Looks like my road home

40
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,919
is still far off.

41
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,120
Where's the princess?

42
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,039
She hasn't gotten up yet.

43
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,159
I've called her many times.

44
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,599
Mister Xie, you're here.

45
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,800
Xiao Yuan Yuan is here.

46
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,319
Xiao Yuan Yuan

47
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,599
Where is he?

48
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:52,599
Princess

49
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,919
Rong Heng tricked you.

50
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,400
Oh, you!

51
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,240
You've learned to lie.

52
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,439
Xiao Yuan Yuan

53
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,520
Princess, you

54
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,919
I'll cook a meal for you.

55
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,199
Let's go.

56
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,719
Hurry.

57
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,599
Try this.

58
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,240
Okay.

59
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,879
How is it?

60
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,639
It's delicious.

61
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,319
It's fine now.

62
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,120
You need to calm down.

63
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,120
Take it slow.
