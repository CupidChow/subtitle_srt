1
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:20,800
Your child greets the Empress Mother.

2
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,160
You may dispense with formalities.

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,800
I summoned you both here today

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,359
to discuss matters regarding the Festival of Ingenuity.

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,800
Princess Er has hosted it in previous years.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,719
She has always done an excellent job.

7
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,000
This year, Princess Er will assist Princess Royal in organizing it.

8
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:39,799
Empress Mother,

9
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:42,200
I really don't want to celebrate the Festival of Ingenuity.

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,799
I'm not interested in those needlework activities.

11
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,119
Why not let my sister handle it instead?

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,479
Nonsense!

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,560
The Festival of Ingenuity is a day to pray for a good harvest.

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,719
How can you treat it so lightly?

15
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:57,119
As Princess Royal,

16
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,759
you should bless the people.

17
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,359
You must not shirk your duty.

18
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,599
Yes.

19
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,719
I will obey your command.

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,799
Princess Er,

21
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,879
Princess Royal knows little about the festival's details.

22
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,560
Starting tomorrow,

23
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,959
teach her the Festival of Ingenuity's procedures.

24
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,920
Be thorough and precise.

25
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,480
No mistakes are allowed.

26
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,159
Yes.

27
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:22,920
Empress Mother,

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,239
I will do my best to assist my sister.

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,480
We'll organize the Festival of Ingenuity well.

30
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,359
Greetings, Princess.

31
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,599
Hello, Sister.

32
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,000
What are you two doing?

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
Whose water is this?

34
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,280
It smells bad now.

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,040
Sister,

36
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,959
On the fifth day of the seventh month,

37
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,599
the Festival of Ingenuity features the Needle-Floating Skill Test.

38
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,959
Women place bowls of water in the sun.

39
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,159
After a while,

40
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,280
a thin film forms on the water's surface.

41
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,560
This embroidery needle,

42
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,799
when dropped in, will float.

43
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,799
Look at the shadow beneath the water.

44
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,199
If it forms shapes like clouds, flowers, birds, or beasts,

45
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,599
Enough, enough, enough!

46
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,759
Stop with all the fancy talk.

47
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,560
I don't like listening to it.

48
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,919
Threading needles, year after year, with neighbors.

49
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,120
Testing one's skill and luck with the needle.

50
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,960
Who alone sees the shadow of a dragon shuttle?

51
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,400
Embroidering mandarin ducks, yet not crossing paths.

52
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,360
The Needle-Floating Skill Test

53
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,560
is not just for wishing for skillful hands.

54
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,719
Girls secretly wish for an ideal husband.

55
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,080
What are you two talking about?

56
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,159
I have no idea what you're saying.

57
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,879
But

58
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,800
this ideal husband

59
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,719
sounds rather interesting to me.

60
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,879
Why are there needles stuck in this potato?

61
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
On the night of the Festival,

62
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,120
you must face the moon

63
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,560
and thread needles one after another.

64
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,159
Whoever threads fastest is deemed skillful.

65
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,680
She becomes this year's clever maiden.

66
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,039
That's impressive.

67
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,800
What's the point, really?

68
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,800
All these pointless things.

69
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:25,520
Little Yuan Yuan,

70
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:25,960
come here!

71
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,919
Princess,

72
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,240
are you calling me?

73
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,080
Give me your hand.

74
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,680
What for?

75
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,479
To dye your fingernails.

76
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,039
Dyeing fingernails?

77
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,919
That's right.

78
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,960
How can a grown man dye his fingernails?

79
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,840
All men in Jin City dye their fingernails.

80
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,680
I won't do it.

81
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,560
Sit down.

82
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,879
Did you forget you made me eat radish and I had an allergy?

83
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,319
I pleaded with the Empress Mother for you.

84
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,199
I saved your life.

85
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,960
If you agree to dye your fingernails,

86
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:51,960
this incident

87
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,960
I'll let it go.

88
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,919
Fine.

89
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,360
You promised, remember.

90
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,919
That's more like it.

91
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,199
Don't move.

92
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,879
It'll be done soon.

93
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,959
All done.

94
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,600
The color is just about right.

95
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,199
Young Master Xie,

96
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,000
my sister loves to joke around.

97
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,360
Please don't hold it against her.

98
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,160
Princess Er is truly gentle and wise.

99
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,279
She understands people well.

100
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,079
Little Yuan Yuan,

101
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,800
Princess,

102
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,759
why are you here?

103
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Today, the imperial kitchen

104
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,879
prepared many pastries bought from outside the palace.

105
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,680
I found them quite delicious.

106
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,480
So I brought some for you to try.

107
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,600
I didn't expect you to be so thoughtful.

108
00:04:58,759 --> 00:04:59,759
Actually,

109
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,160
I've been thinking a lot lately.

110
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,279
Instead of always opposing you,

111
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,360
I'd rather stay in the palace peacefully

112
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,079
and live with you.

113
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,480
Little Yuan Yuan,

114
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,240
I'm glad you think that way.

115
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,399
Just stay by my side obediently,

116
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,319
and I promise you'll be well treated.

117
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,000
After the Festival of Ingenuity,

118
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll ask the Empress Mother to grant us marriage.

119
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,160
Marriage?

120
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,000
Isn't that a bit too soon?

121
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:28,839
What,

122
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:29,800
you don't want to?

123
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,519
No,

124
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
I just think

125
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,319
we should have a romantic date first.

126
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,199
Then talk about marriage.

127
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,120
A romantic date?

128
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,680
Look,

129
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,399
the Festival of Ingenuity is coming up.

130
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:47,680
The Festival of Ingenuity

131
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,160
is a day for couples in love to go on dates.

132
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,160
I heard that in Jin City,

133
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,399
there are grand celebrations outside the palace.

134
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,519
Princess, could you

135
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,600
take me there too?

136
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,160
Let it be our date.

137
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,879
It'll add material to my Yuan Yuan Chronicle.

138
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:01,759
What do you think, Princess?

139
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,560
Great idea!

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,600
Perfect.

141
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,240
I've never

142
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,920
attended the Festival of Ingenuity outside the palace.

143
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,199
Alright.

144
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,120
After the palace events are finished,

145
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,759
we'll go out for a date together.

146
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,560
Okay.
