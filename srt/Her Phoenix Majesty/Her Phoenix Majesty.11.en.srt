1
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,120
Princess, look.

2
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,719
Isn't that Xie Yuan over there?

3
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:25,719
Xie Yuan.

4
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:31,480
I didn't expect

5
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,200
you're so eager for a date.

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,159
Princess,

7
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,600
how is your Festival of Qiqiao going?

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,840
It's going well.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,679
Let's go.

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,560
Whoa.

11
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,119
Rong Heng.

12
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,039
Wait here.

13
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:04,200
Yes.

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,879
Come, come.

15
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,560
Take a look, come and see!

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,879
Festival Pastries!

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,319
Beautiful and tasty Festival Pastries.

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,760
Festival Pastries!

19
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,799
Take a look, honored guests!

20
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,040
So cute!

21
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:16,920
Little pigs and rabbits.

22
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,640
You have great taste!

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,280
This rabbit-shaped pastry

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,799
is our most expensive one.

25
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,959
We only make it once a year.

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,079
I'll take one.

27
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:25,879
Alright!

28
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:30,519
It looks like you.

29
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,599
It's lively up ahead.

30
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,599
Let's go check it out.

31
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,120
Let's go.

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,519
Take care, come again next time!

33
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,120
Festival Pastries!

34
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,680
Buy a Love Lock!

35
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,719
May lovers be together forever!

36
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,319
Let's go see.

37
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,200
Come buy a Love Lock!

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:47,920
Boss,

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,760
What's this?

40
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,359
Buy a Love Lock!

41
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:52,120
May lovers be together forever!

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,359
Is it really that magical?

43
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,400
Of course!

44
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,599
Just one or two silver coins.

45
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,120
Guaranteed, you and this gentleman

46
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,040
will be in love for life.

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,439
Alright.

48
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,159
I'll take one.

49
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,159
Okay!

50
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,040
Honored guest,

51
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,959
for this lock,

52
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,919
you must write both your names for it to work.

53
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,639
Thank you, boss.

54
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,560
You're welcome, take care!

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,280
Love Lock, may lovers be together!

56
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,680
Love Lock, may lovers be together!

57
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,280
Buy a Love Lock!

58
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:47,080
Open.

59
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,439
Excuse me.

60
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,400
What's this?

61
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,199
What is it?

62
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,199
Don't be afraid.

63
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,599
This is the Spider Web Contest.

64
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,639
Spider Web Contest.

65
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,599
That's right.

66
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,560
Whoever's spider spins the finest web

67
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,400
is the winner.

68
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,919
The bet is one gold coin.

69
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,319
I'll join too.

70
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,400
Then I'll join as well.

71
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,479
You're cheating.

72
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,960
Hey, honored guest,

73
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,199
do you know the rule: accept your loss?

74
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,080
Exactly.

75
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,719
Only you can win,

76
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,400
but others can't?

77
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Others can win,

78
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,879
but if it's against the princess,

79
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,199
only the princess can win.

80
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,560
Princess!

81
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,719
You're the princess!

82
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,960
Run!

83
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:37,879
You guys—

84
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,599
Why are you running?

85
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,360
Why run?

86
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:40,800
Xie Yuan!

87
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,479
Xie Yuan!

88
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,159
Xie Yuan!

89
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:50,039
Xie Yuan!

90
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,159
Xie Yuan!

91
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,120
Princess!

92
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,199
Rong Heng, Princess!

93
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:57,759
Rong Heng.

94
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,719
Xie Yuan is missing.

95
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,960
I'll send the guards to search right away.

96
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,240
Please return to the palace and rest.

97
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,960
But where could he have gone?

98
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,319
If the guards find anything,

99
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,560
they'll report to you for sure.

100
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,400
Don't worry.

101
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,680
Alright.

102
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,639
I'm free now.
