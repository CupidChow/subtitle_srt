Steamed buns for sale!

6
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,320
Oh, Miss Su,

7
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:32,280
you need to call out louder.

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:32,799
Otherwise,

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,240
how will you attract customers?

10
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,679
I need to go home for more flour.

11
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:38,880
You stay here and keep selling.

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,679
If any customers come,

13
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:41,200
just handle it yourself.

14

15

Steamed buns for sale!

17
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:54,479
Give me two buns.

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,079
Sorry, sorry.

19
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,920
Sorry, you dropped everything on the ground.

20
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,280
And you still want me to buy?

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,760
Sorry, is this how you do business?

22
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:10,920
You...

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,840
My buns...

24
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,120
Sorry, boss.

25
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,840
Sorry.

26
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,319
What's wrong with you?

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,040
I...

28
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,640
I was gone for just a moment,

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,319
and you ruined a whole basket of buns.

30
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,920
I didn't know the steamer was so hot.

31
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,599
You've never eaten pork

32
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,640
but you've seen pigs run, right?

33
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,079
Can't even pick up a bun properly.

34
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,400
My humble shop can't handle someone like you.

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,879
Just go.

36
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,439
Boss...

37
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,359
What about my wages?

38
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:31,079
I'm not even asking you to pay for the loss.

39
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,480
And you still want your wages?

40
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,799
Leave before I change my mind.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,480
Wait.

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,680
Leave the apron.

43
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,079
What kind of person is this?

44
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,280
My buns...

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,319
Perfectly good buns, all ruined.

46
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,079
Madam Boss,

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,799
Mr. Xie,

48
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,879
That young lady is an old friend of mine.

49
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:55,920
Really?

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Please, don't be upset.

51
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,719
Her family has fallen on hard times.

52
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,120
That's why she's working here.

53
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,120
Please be understanding.

54
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,079
I have one more favor to ask.

55
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,519
Go ahead.

56
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,799
I hope you can

57
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,280
let her keep working here.

58
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,240
I'll pay her wages.

59
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,120
But don't tell her.

60
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,639
Is that alright?

61
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:11,439
Well...

62
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,439
Since Mr. Xie asked,

63
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,159
then I

64
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,599
will go get her to come back and help.

65
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,639
Thank you.

66
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,439
I'll go right now.

67
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,759
Lady Su,

68
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,599
Lady Su,

69
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,879
Please wait.

70
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,280
Boss, why are you here?

71
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,840
I can't pay for your buns.

72
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,520
Miss Su, you've misunderstood.

73
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,800
I'm not here for compensation.

74
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,599
Then why are you here?

75
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,520
I was wrong earlier.

76
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
I spoke too harshly.

77
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,520
Please don't take it to heart.

78
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,840
Come back to work.

79
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,199
No need.

80
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,120
Since you already sent me away,

81
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,240
I'll just find work elsewhere.

82
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,960
Lady Su,

83
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,439
If you insist on leaving,

84
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,879
there's a stable hiring in East Jincheng.

85
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,199
You can work there.

86
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,319
Thank you.

87
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:51,759
You're welcome.

88
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,879
Strange, just told me to leave,

89
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,000
now wants me to stay.

90
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,319
Boss...

91
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,080
Are you hiring?

92
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,919
Yes, I am.

93
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,039
But I raise horses here.

94
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,599
I know how, let me try.

95
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,319
Alright.

96
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,520
Horse...

97
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,439
Are you remembering

98
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,039
the world you once knew?

99
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:56,840
Alright.

100
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,159
I'll take you out for a walk.

101
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,840
I was wondering...

102
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,759
I haven't seen you all afternoon.

103
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,039
So you were slacking off here.

104
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,280
Boss, I wasn't slacking off.

105
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,040
The horse's been in the stable too long,

106
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,480
so I took it out for some air.

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,720
Only this way

108
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,079
can the horse stay healthy and shiny.

109
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,920
You're just a hired hand.

110
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,120
This is my horse.

111
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:28,240
Who let you take it out?

112
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,720
Just feed the horse well,

113
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,920
it'll stay healthy.

114
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,839
A walk, really?

115
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:39,079
You think you know horses better than me?

116
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,079
Boss, you've misunderstood.

117
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,079
For over ten years,

118
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,800
I've spent a hundred days a year with horses.

119
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm not trying to explain.

120
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,199
I just hope you can trust me.

121
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,879
I'll make your horse

122
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,279
stand out from the rest.

123
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,519
Don't come back. Leave.

124
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,279
If Boss Yang hadn't recommended her,

125
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,680
I wouldn't have hired her.

126
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,399
She's clearly spoiled.

127
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,319
Boss...

128
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,680
I heard she's Princess Royal Su Feng'er.

129
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,879
Is it really okay for us to treat her like this?

130
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,560
Even if she's Princess Royal,

131
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,639
she's been demoted to commoner now.

132
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,079
She's just earning a living like everyone else.

133
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,079
Heard she messed up Boss Yang's bun shop

134
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,399
and left it in a mess.

135
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,120
At this rate,

136
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,439
Jincheng won't have a place for her soon.

137
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,600
Let's go.

138
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,480
Princess, why are you still awake?

139
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,600
Xiao Tao,

140
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:10,199
do you think I'm completely useless?

141
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,000
You are the Princess Royal of Jincheng,

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,879
the Ever-Victorious General praised by the people.

143
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,519
Why would you say such a thing?

144
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
Princess Royal and Ever-Victorious General—

145
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,439
those are all things of the past.

146
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,480
Now I can't even sell buns properly.

147
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,600
Even my best skill, riding, isn't respected.

148
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,079
Tell me, what else can I do?

149
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,839
When I first entered the palace,

150
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,600
I didn't know anything either.

151
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,480
I was careless in everything I did.

152
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:43,600
I remember once I accidentally broke a mirror.

153
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,319
Du Mama scolded me for it.

154
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,279
But you, Princess, defended me.

155
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,639
You transferred me to the Princess's residence.

156
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,120
If you hadn't mentioned it,

157
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,879
I'd have forgotten how you first arrived.

158
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,879
But I will always remember.

159
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,680
From that moment on,

160
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,480
I swore to do everything well.

161
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,519
To repay your great kindness.

162
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,519
Didn't it prove later

163
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,839
that as long as you try,

164
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,920
one day the clouds will part and the sun will shine.

165
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,600
Alright.

166
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,839
Then I, Princess Royal, will do my best in everything.

167
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,079
That's the Princess I believe in.

168
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,720
Princess Feng'er lives among the people.

169
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,000
Ordinary folks find it novel.

170
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,240
They don't care about her title.

171
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,319
They only see Feng'er unable to help.

172
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,600
She has no royal airs at all.

173
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,079
She holds thousands of families in her heart.

174
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:34,720
In her heart.

175
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,600
Little one,

176
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,480
can you show me?

177
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,160
Sure, okay.

178
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,680
Give me one.

179
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,920
I want one too.

180
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,839
Give me, give me.

181
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,040
You want one too?

182
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:46,600
Alright.

183
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,040
Remember what the teacher taught you.

184
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,639
Here, yours.

185
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:53,920
I want one too.

186
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,600
Remember.

187
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,720
Here.

188
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:56,959
You want one too?

189
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:58,839
I want one, you want one.

190
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,040
