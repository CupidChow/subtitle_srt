1
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,480
Mo'er

2
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,600
Su Feng'er and Su Wan'er,

3
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,079
you've watched them grow up since childhood.

4
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:27,199
So tell me,

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,000
between these two children,

6
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,880
who is better suited to manage Jincheng for me?

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,439
I wouldn't dare to comment on state affairs lightly.

8
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,560
It's fine.

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,119
Just speak freely.

10
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:45,079
I won't hold it against you.

11
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,079
Well...

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,679
Then I

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,479
will talk about the personalities of both princesses.

14
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,399
The second princess,

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,640
she appears gentle,

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,479
but is quite shrewd.

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,719
She is no ordinary person.

18
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,599
As for the crown princess,

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,640
she seems reckless,

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,799
but has a pure heart.

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,599
She is both brave and wise.

22
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,200
She even resembles you in your younger days.

23
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,120
Yes.

24
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,519
Su Feng'er

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,680
really is much like I was.

26
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:29,840
But...

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,879
Forget it, forget it.

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,680
Mo'er,

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,680
go ahead and light the incense.

30
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,840
Yes.

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,280
You know, as people age,

32
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,439
once you get older,

33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,280
you can't smell the fragrance anymore.

34
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,519
It's really hard to fall asleep.

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,000
I've called you all here these past days

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
so that you may

37
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,799
witness the appointment of Jincheng's crown prince.

38
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,599
After much consideration,

39
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,079
I've made my decision.

40
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,239
If a crown prince is appointed,

41
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:09,719
I hope you all will support them well.

42
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,360
For Jincheng's lasting legacy,

43
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,719
I will wholeheartedly assist the crown prince.

44
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,319
I will give my all,

45
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,520
until my dying breath.

46
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,719
I will give my all,

47
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,280
until my dying breath.

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,719
Very well.

49
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,039
I have decided

50
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,599
to appoint Jincheng's crown prince as

51
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,039
Crown Princess Su Feng'er.

52
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,319
My lord,

53
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,319
the matter of appointing a crown prince is urgent,

54
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,840
but it is of great importance.

55
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,680
Please reconsider, my lord.

56
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:42,479
Indeed.

57
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,520
We believe

58
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,159
the crown princess is truly not

59
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,000
the best choice for the throne.

60
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,039
Please reconsider, my lord.

61
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:49,960
A'fu.

62
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,560
Yes.

63
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,680
Choose a day

64
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,919
to announce the edict to the world.

65
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:00,840
Yes.

66
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,960
Don't panic.

67
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,520
Protect the lord!

68
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,439
Who goes there?

69
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,000
How dare you try to assassinate me!

70
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,039
Mo'er!

71
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,199
Mo'er!

72
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,879
I want to see

73
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,159
who is so bold

74
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,960
as to attempt an assassination in the palace.

75
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,599
Rong Heng!

76
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,680
It's you.

77
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,360
Reporting to the lord,

78
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,120
I found in the crown princess's palace

79
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,360
many letters exchanged with court officials.

80
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,000
My lord!

81
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,399
My lord!

82
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,240
My lord!

83
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,480
Pass down my order:

84
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,319
the crown princess,

85
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,439
Su Feng'er,

86
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,920
is to be demoted to commoner.

87
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,040
Yes.

88
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,480
Half a lifetime in the palace,

89
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,399
I never thought it would end like this.

90
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,000
What are your plans, Master Mo?

91
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,079
Master Xie,

92
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,600
a true man roams the world bravely,

93
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,480
with ambitions far and wide.

94
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,279
No matter where I go in the future,

95
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,959
I will always remember your words.

96
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,839
Master Xie,

97
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:26,879
take care.

98
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,519
Be well.

99
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,680
I didn't expect he still remembers my words.

100
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,079
Why are you taking the axe?

101
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,000
Young master,

102
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,279
you don't understand.

103
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,519
I chop one hundred logs a day here.

104
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,600
Two days means two hundred logs.

105
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,800
Three days, three hundred logs.

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,399
I've grown attached to this axe.

107
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,920
Of course I have to bring it.

108
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,480
Alright.

109
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,800
Take it if you want.

110
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,519
I just remembered,

111
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,879
I haven't said goodbye to the second princess.

112
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:00,879
You pack up first.

113
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:01,199
Alright.

114
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:01,720
I'll go see her.

115
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,160
Okay.

116
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,240
Princess, you truly planned ahead.

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,680
You got the defense details from Xie Yuan,

118
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,959
and even hid the secret letter in a book.

119
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,040
He brought it to the crown princess's residence.

120
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,160
Who?

121
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,160
I really didn't expect this.

122
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:28,160
So it was all a trap.

123
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,360
Then what am I?

124
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,879
You...

125
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,959
just a scholar who can't judge people.

126
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,920
So from the very start,

127
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,600
you've been deceiving me.

128
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,199
Is that so?

129
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,920
Deceiving you?

130
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,920
It's all just imperial tactics.

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,959
I never thought

132
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,519
I ended up as an accomplice.

133
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,079
Princess,

134
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,399
since he knows your secret,

135
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,560
shouldn't you...

136
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,600
I, Xie, thought myself clever all my life,

137
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,319
yet in the end, I failed to see people's hearts.

138
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,199
I misplaced my trust.

139
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,120
I have no face to live on in this world.

140
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,000
If you want my life,

141
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,480
then take it.

142
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,040
Do it.

143
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:28,959
Stand down.

144
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,079
Xie Yuan,

145
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,920
you are from Yue,

146
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,600
I am from Jincheng.

147
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,759
We have no ties.

148
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,079
But I have always admired your talent.

149
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,759
Today, I will not kill you.

150
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,920
Go back and continue writing your Records of Origins.

151
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,959
Is the scheming Second Princess

152
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,000
too afraid to kill even a scholar?

153
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,199
If I wish,

154
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,279
I could kill you at any moment.

155
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:05,560
How can a sparrow understand
the ambition of a swan?

156
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,519
Since you are insignificant,

157
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,199
I won't bother to kill you.

158
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,600
Su Wan'er

159
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,600
You are despicable.

160
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,120
Guards!

161
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,920
Drag him out of the palace!
