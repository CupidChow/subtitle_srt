1
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,160
If not for finding the Records of Origins

2
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,480
why would I be here sweeping these leaves?

3
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:34,560
Just bear with it a little longer.

4
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,880
Excellent tea, truly excellent.

5
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:02,560
Let's go.

6
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,799
Let's see how Xiao Yuan Yuan's cleaning went.

7
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,359
Princess.

8
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,079
Wait.

9
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:08,879
Wait for this old servant!

10
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,799
Strange...

11
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,920
This courtyard was just swept,

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,760
why are there still so many leaves?

13
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,599
More.

14
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,599
Scatter more.

15
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,480
Over here.

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,120
Scatter more here.

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,920
So it was you causing trouble!

18
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,959
Stop.

19
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,599
I have no grudge against you.

20
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,879
Why treat me like this?

21
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,200
Sorry to disturb you.

22
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,079
My apologies.

23
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,400
Quick, help Mr. Xie clean up.

24
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,719
Run!

25
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,200
Stop!

26
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,359
Stop!

27
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,519
Run!

28
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,960
Princess.

29
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,639
You...

30
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,759
Xiao Yuan Yuan.

31
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,159
Princess.

32
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,039
This Xie Yuan doesn't obey palace rules.

33
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,759
He'll never pass the assessment.

34
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,599
Du Momo.

35
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,039
Even if Xie Yuan passes the assessment,

36
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:46,599
you know these leaves aren't his doing.

37
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,759
Fine, fine.

38
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,520
Princess, if you say he passes, he passes.

39
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,240
But Mr. Xie, don't celebrate too soon.

40
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,960
The Male Conduct Assessment has five levels.

41
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,599
You've only passed the first, the easiest.

42
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,879
When you pass the other four, much harder rounds,

43
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,879
then you can stay in the palace to serve the Princess.

44
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,639
You never said there were five levels!

45
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,240
Do I need to explain to you?

46
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,960
Du Momo.

47
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:13,960
Princess.

48
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,759
When did palace assessments get so complicated?

49
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,360
Replying to Princess:

50
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,080
Extraordinary people require extraordinary measures.

51
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,680
The Lord knows you value Mr. Xie.

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,599
He ordered me to test him strictly.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,800
Yes, yes.

54
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:29,960
There's a written order.

55
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,439
The Lord's letter is proof.

56
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,479
Princess, please look.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,639
It really is the Empress Mother's decree.

58
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:39,840
Xiao Yuan Yuan.

59
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,680
You're in trouble now.

60
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,080
Mr. Xie,

61
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,400
you must give it your absolute best.

62
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:51,159
If you fail any round of the assessment,

63
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:53,319
you'll be expelled from the palace.

64
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,800
Then where will you hide your little face?

65
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,159
Expelled from the palace...

66
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,960
Searched high and low, found nothing.

67
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Yet it came with no effort at all.

68
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,159
I never thought all my past hardships

69
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,960
were waiting for me here.

70
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,560
Princess.

71
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,560
Xie Yuan is willing to serve the Princess wholeheartedly.

72
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
And pass the assessment.

73
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:21,920
Don't worry.

74
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,639
Xiao Yuan Yuan.

75
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,439
I have a way to help you.

76
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,240
Made me all dirty...

77
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,000
At least you let me wash at the Hot Spring Palace.

78
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,399
Xiao Yuan Yuan.

79
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,680
Princess.

80
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,439
Xiao Yuan Yuan.

81
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Xiao Yuan Yuan.

82
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,160
Xie Yuan.

83
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,399
Xiao Yuan Yuan, that little fox,

84
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,560
has made me rescue him again and again.

85
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,480
Such a handful.

86
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,040
Forget it.

87
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,800
He's my man, after all.

88
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,600
Xiao Yuan Yuan.

89
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,000
Xiao Yuan Yuan.

90
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:37,639
Princess.

91
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,920
I nearly died.

92
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,040
And you still humiliate me.

93
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,399
What will it take for you to let me go?

94
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,040
Xie Yuan.

95
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,040
Am I really someone who takes advantage in your eyes?

96
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,879
Yes.

97
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,519
That's right.

98
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,000
Fine.

99
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,480
My sincere feelings

100
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,079
were wasted after all.

101
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:01,920
Princess.

102
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,000
Was I too harsh?

103
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,879
Forget it.

104
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,399
Better a short pain than a long one.

105
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,199
I hope she'll let me go this time.

106
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,279
Princess.

107
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,319
Princess.

108
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,800
I need some time alone.

109
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,439
You all may leave.

110
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,240
I said I need to be alone.

111
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,319
Can't you hear me?

112
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,519
Yes.

113
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,319
Wan'er.

114
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:25,879
There, there.

115
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,040
Don't cry.

116
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,439
My dear.

117
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,160
Empress Mother.

118
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,120
Feng'er.

119
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:34,800
Stand up.

120
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,959
Listen to the Empress Mother.

121
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,639
Learn to stand up on your own.

122
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,079
If you don't stand up now,

123
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,720
no one will help you in the future.

124
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,319
Do you understand?

125
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,759
Come.

126
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,680
Wan'er.

127
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:58,639
Have a bite of this.

128
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,480
Thank you, Empress Mother.

129
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,879
Afu.

130
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,160
Here.

131
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,040
Take this dish away.

132
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,279
From now on,

133
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,759
never serve it again.

134
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,120
Yes.

135
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,120
Feng'er.

136
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,159
Remember the Empress Mother's words.

137
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,480
No matter how much you like a dish,

138
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,519
never eat more than three bites.

139
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,720
Yes.

140
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,240
Wan'er.

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,440
This soup was made by the Empress Mother herself.

142
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,720
You're frail.

143
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,639
Drink more.

144
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,720
It will strengthen you.

145
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,600
Thank you, Empress Mother.

146
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,799
Empress Mother.

147
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,679
This is the Mighty General I carved myself.

148
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,000
I wish to give it to you.

149
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:27,960
Ignorant and unskilled

150
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,960
As the eldest princess of the realm

151
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,360
Do you know how many lives
depend on your actions?

152
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,559
The Empress Mother cares only for state affairs

153
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,919
I no longer care for the Empress Mother

154
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,600
Everything of mine

155
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,840
must be under my own control
