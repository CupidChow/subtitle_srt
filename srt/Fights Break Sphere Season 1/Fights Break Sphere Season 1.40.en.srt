=Episode 40=

3
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:06,140
Please be assured, young Sect Leader.
What we talked about today...

4
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,710
I won't mention it to anyone.

5
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,220
I will pretend this conversation never happened.

6
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,120
Manager!

7
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,350
Manager! Bring us some food.

8
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,750
Manager! Are you still doing business?

9
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,860
We are on the road all day. Bring us the food.

10
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,430
Manager!

11
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,450
Get your own wontons?

12
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,650
What does that mean?

13
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,220
Self pick-up?

14
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,690
We have food now!

15
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,940
Here, have some food.

16
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,090
What is this?

17
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,710
Just eat it.
We need to be on the road soon.

18
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,040
Elder Ruo Lin,

19
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,740
those guys don't look right.

20
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:27,680
They should be traitors of small clans. They shouldn't
have much Fight Qi. I'll take care of them.

21
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,810
You eat.

22
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,900
Don't get involved. We are in a rush.

23
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:08,780
If you two get hungry in this trip,
I won't take care of you.

24
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,210
Elder. This is...

25
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,760
Elder Xiang. What, you don't remember?

26
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,350
Hello, Elder Xiang.

27
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,190
Thank you, Sect Leader Yun Shan.

28
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,460
Sect Leader Yun Shan...

29
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,830
You found Yanran a good man.

30
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,040
Our family is very grateful.

31
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,370
This is the list of gifts I will give you.
Please take a look.

32
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,180
Master Nalan, there's no need for this.

33
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,550
You're the prime minister of Chu Yun Empire.

34
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:29,070
You are in high position.
I am only an old man in the countryside.

35
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,420
I can't take this.

36
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,550
We are in your debt.

37
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,350
You appointed Yanran as the young Sect Leader.

38
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:40,780
In this chaotic world, our clan gets to be safe.

39
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,570
Please accept my gratitude.

40
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,960
I'm doing this for our family.

41
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,250
Not only the young Sect Leader.

42
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,490
I plan to be a hermit
and focus on my training after the wedding.

43
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,110
She will be the leader of Cloud Mist Sect.

44
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,930
And also the leader of Nalan family.

45
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:11,900
In this land, who has the equal power as hers?

46
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,430
This is all your kindness.

47
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,930
But with Yanran's reputation and capabilities,

48
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,090
she won't be qualified for this role.

49
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,540
I came here today...

50
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,700
to beg you to not retire so soon.

51
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,170
You will break everyone's heart.

52
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,040
Who told you to say this?

53
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,150
I am in the position of the empire's minister for her.

54
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:42,660
Before I came, Emperor Ye Lan told me that.

55
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,410
He heard you announced to the world...

56
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:51,020
and invited all friends
to attend Yanran and Mr. Gu He's wedding.

57
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:56,030
You will also announce your retirement
at the same time.

58
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,840
Emperor thinks this is not appropriate.

59
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,980
He thinks so?

60
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,290
You have lived in the mountain like a god.

61
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,850
You don't know how the world out there...

62
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:16,130
is very chaotic. The Soul Hall is rising.

63
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,460
There are traitors in every school and clan.

64
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,110
It's already a mess out there.

65
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,460
Emperor Ye Lan hopes you...

66
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,490
could come out and take control of things.

67
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,540
When it comes to reputation and insights,

68
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,960
there's no one better than you.

69
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,370
That's the emperor's compliment.
I can't take it seriously.

70
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:50,560
But, he does make a good point.

71
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,730
How about this?

72
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:59,100
Now all the talents in this land
are in Cloud Mist Sect.

73
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,260
I will ask their opinions.

74
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,680
Yanran is still waiting for me over there.

75
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,220
I will leave for now.

76
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,790
Here.

77
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,500
- Ok. Get out.
- Yes.

78
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,760
These are the clothes for you.

79
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,930
These are jewelry.

80
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,870
You can use this to reward people.

81
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,100
There's also some make-up stuff.

82
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,340
What did Yun Shan say?

83
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,650
He said what I suggested...

84
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,510
will have to wait till your wedding.

85
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,900
He will discuss it in front of all heroes.

86
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,200
I knew it.

87
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,400
Sect Leader of Cloud Mist Sect is just an empty title.

88
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,600
He just gave it to please me.

89
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,400
How could he be willing to step aside?

90
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,600
He wants to take this opportunity to become
the leader to fight against Soul Hall.

91
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,400
This box is full of the ancient medicine.

92
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,600
Some rare ones can be given to Gu He.

93
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't know if he likes them or not.

94
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,000
The best alchemist of Cloud Mist Sect...

95
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,400
the rare genius of Fight Qi Continent must like them.

96
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,900
That's good. That's good.

97
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,000
At the wedding, bring out
the Eight Clan Leader Bodyguards.

98
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,200
Eight Clan Leader Bodyguards?

99
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,400
You wear the pin of our clan.

100
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,700
When they see this, they will obey you.

101
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,600
Do we have to do this?
You have to think clearly about it.

102
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,800
Father, how could you still have hope?

103
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,000
If I give in, not only my jade will be taken away,

104
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,800
the two of us...

105
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,600
will be like abandoned chess pieces...

106
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,100
and die in this mountain.

107
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,000
Nalan family will die out.

108
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Like Xiao family.

109
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Is that what you want?

110
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,200
It looks we don't have much room for discussion.

111
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,300
If everyone's soft as you,

112
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,800
and tries to talk things out,

113
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,800
the world would've been peaceful.

114
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,400
But even though the Eight Clan Leader Bodyguards
are great fighters,

115
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,600
Yun Shan is no ordinary fighter either.

116
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,000
If we couldn't kill him right on spot,

117
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,600
our disaster will be right ahead of us.

118
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,400
But if we do anything, we will die.
If we don't, we will die too.

119
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,720
Eight Clan Leader Bodyguards
were trained by grandpa himself.

120
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,000
They should be able to kill people
with 2-3 times their Fight Qi...

121
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,400
with one punch.

122
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,000
No matter how great Yun Shan is at fighting,

123
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,600
being attacked by 8 people, he wouldn't be
able to get out without being hurt.

124
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,100
When he gets hurt,
I will announce his crimes in public.

125
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,900
I will kill him with a legitimate reason.

126
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:13,280
This is still risky.

127
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,570
I didn't want to do this either.

128
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,300
But grandpa already put me in a corner.

129
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,100
If I don't kill Yun Shan,

130
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,600
Nalan family would cease to exist in this land.

131
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,600
Faster. We need to get there before it gets dark.

132
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,590
This is also Blood Sect's doing?

133
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,800
Wherever they walk, the soil gets burnt.

134
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Without the alliance of 5 families,

135
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,300
nobody can stop them.

136
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,200
Why didn't the elders of the academy discipline them?

137
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,980
The situation in the academy isn't great.

138
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,400
There's only the seal of the Fight God
that can stop the outsiders.

139
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,400
Some people who want to fight the Soul Hall...

140
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,400
struggle with the fact
that there's no one stronger who can lead.

141
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,800
These people are the last force
of Fight Qi Continent.

142
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,400
They can't go to waste.

143
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,600
The Elder Union thinks
it's better to wait and see.

144
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,800
Everyone's waiting and watching.

145
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,200
Should we just sit back
and let Soul Hall grow stronger?

146
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,800
Good people fight with each other.
Bad people are united.

147
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,400
It looks that way now.

148
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,600
There's no Fight God in this world.

149
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,500
Sometimes, even I can't imagine the future.

150
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,000
It's getting late.
We should hurry up.

151
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,200
Let's go.

152
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,800
Brother Xiao Yan.
It looks weird up ahead.

153
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,800
Be careful.

154
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,400
- Xun'er. Be careful.
- All right.

155
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,800
We are in their trap.

156
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,700
Let's not move first and see what they're up to.

157
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,800
What are they doing with the lanterns?

158
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,600
Looks like Fu Clan's people.

159
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,800
Fu Clan is the most notorious clan.

160
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,000
They train skills to live forever,
steal the Purple River Cart,

161
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,600
and kill pregnant women.

162
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,800
That's really cruel.

163
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,800
People have been trying to eliminate them
for hundreds of years.

164
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,800
I can't believe we didn't get them all.

165
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,900
What's Purple River Cart?

166
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,180
The placenta of a pregnant woman.

167
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,800
They're so evil.

168
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,400
Since we met them. Let them stay.

169
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
So they wouldn't...

170
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
cause more trouble.

171
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,900
Be careful.

172
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,300
They know tricks that can fool you.

173
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,400
You finally showed yourself!

174
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,800
A ship full of drunken souls...

175
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,800
The moon moves with west wind.

176
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,200
Generations after generations,

177
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,200
life and death are just natural.

178
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,400
We don't have a problem, Mr. Mi.

179
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,800
The two kids next to you...

180
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,100
Mr. Fan Lao asked for them.

181
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,600
You're really bold.
You dare to stop people from Jia Nan Academy.

182
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,800
Aren't you afraid people from our academy
will look for us and kill your body and soul?

183
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,300
It would be too late to regret then.

184
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,500
I'm not afraid of you now.

185
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,220
Mr. Fan Lao taught me high-end skills.

186
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,790
You're all here today.
Time to test my skills.

187
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,420
If you defeat me,

188
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,810
I will leave right away
without saying one word.

189
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,710
Release.

190
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,210
Release.

191
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,670
Break!

192
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,870
Prepare to die, you three!

193
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,120
Xun'er.

194
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,960
The Subdue Heaven Bow is made for this kind of evilness.
Try it.

195
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,420
Dragon Mother's Reformation.

196
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:58,060
I didn't see it. Little girl.
You're the Dragon Mother.

197
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,110
Save your Fight Qi.

198
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,950
It doesn't work on them.

199
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:12,370
The Fight Techniques of Blood Sect are spooky.
Be careful.

200
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,110
Go!

201
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,660
Reserve the Fight Qi!

202
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,330
Elder. We can't keep doing this.

203
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,210
Hang on for a little while longer.

204
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:34,020
Release, read, go!

205
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,490
Mi, even if you're the Fight Lord,

206
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:10,530
if I attack you for a whole night,
even your bones will disappear!

207
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,470
Burn, march, stand!

208
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:30,410
Stupid boy, I will skin you alive today!

209
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:34,700
Xun'er, she wants to skin me alive!

210
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,340
- Elder Qin. Elder Yang.
- Elder Tengshan.

211
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,700
Mi. You outnumbered me.
That's not fair.

212
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,020
The elders don't want to attack
because they're better than this.

213
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,130
We are not.

214
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,500
You're killing too much.

215
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,840
We have to eliminate evil. If we let her go,
she will do more vicious things.

216
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,050
Why aren't you talking?

217
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,140
I will speak then.

218
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,130
I think, the situation right now...

219
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:30,660
it's not good to hide.
What's Jia Nan Academy?

220
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,080
That's the place that Fight God...

221
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:38,440
founded many years ago to fight for justice.

222
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,240
Right? Who are we?

223
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,470
We represent justice!

224
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:48,430
Are we just going to hide in the school like turtles?

225
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,270
Does that make us look good?

226
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,850
My suggestion is forming an army instantly...

227
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:56,890
and eliminate Soul Hall.

228
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,900
Good!

229
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,580
A real man should have no fear.

230
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,110
Elder Han, good talk!

231
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,980
That's just good talk.

232
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,570
How many people do we have?
Those big clans don't do anything.

233
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,620
How can we fight alone?

234
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,040
Don't go if you are afraid to die.

235
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,750
I am afraid to die?
Is your Star Fall Pavillion doing anything?

236
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:23,070
I'm telling you, our clan will all be there!

237
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,070
How many people do you have?

238
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,280
How many people does our academy have?

239
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,430
I'm afraid before your disciples
in your clan get ready,

240
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:35,750
we would all be dead.

241
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,870
- So you're still afraid to die?
- I...

242
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:45,180
Enough! Stop yelling!

243
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,010
Anyone else has any opinions?

244
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,160
I have!

245
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,290
I am following Elder Han.

246
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,760
I think...

247
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,810
this is not a problem of
if you're afraid to die.

248
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,520
It's about taking a stand.

249
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,140
Teacher Ruo Lin, if you're afraid to
fight Soul Hall to death,

250
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,460
I think there must be something wrong with you!

251
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:18,380
Are you connected with Soul Hall?

252
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,200
I think you should be investigated!

253
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,720
Elder Ge, you're crossing the line.

254
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,850
How am I crossing the line?

255
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:36,140
In your words, those who don't go out
and ask for death are all traitors.

256
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,580
It's not wrong to say that.

257
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,520
Now Blood Sect is absorbing traitors

258
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,890
and small clans from everywhere.

259
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,990
They are getting more and more powerful.

260
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:52,460
If we discuss this for one more day, they would
absorb hundreds, even thousands of people.

261
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,020
Yes!

262
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,140
How many people can we block
with Fight God's seal?

263
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,950
Maybe before we get any result,

264
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:04,110
the continent will be in ruins.

265
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,650
How do we protect ourselves then?

266
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:10,170
That's so right!

267
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:13,060
It's not a problem of the number of people.

268
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,430
It's a problem of our stand and attitude.

269
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:18,930
- Is that right?
- Even if we all die in the war,

270
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,870
it would send a signal.

271
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:24,910
A signal for the world, letting them know...

272
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,340
we will always stand out
and fight against the Soul Hall.

273
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,630
- Right?
- Right!

274
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:34,990
Now our students are all hyped up.

275
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,310
They're ready to walk out of academy,

276
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:40,990
and get rid of all the monsters
and evilness in this land.

277
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:44,920
Our teachers are hiding here like turtles.

278
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,710
Don't you think it's a shame?

279
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:53,520
Elder Tengshan.
What do you think?

280
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,660
Our Jia Nan Academy...

281
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:10,020
now has 471 students.

282
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,450
We have only about 60 staff...

283
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,390
who can fight in the war.

284
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,210
Send them out...

285
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,650
Who can they form an alliance with?

286
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:23,080
Where can they rest?

287
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,330
Where can they stay while their wounds heal?

288
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,370
They have no idea.

289
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,890
Some of these students...

290
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,800
are from rich families.

291
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,770
Some of them are already the heir of their own clan.

292
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,740
If we send them out to fight in the war,

293
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,530
will their families and clans...

294
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:48,640
be on board?

295
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,690
We don't know that.

296
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,220
Elder Tengshan.

297
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,860
You're overthinking too much.

298
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,850
If you're like this,
how do we fight for justice?

299
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:00,950
Right.

300
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,600
Yes.

301
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,910
I've seen too much.

302
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:08,410
So I have more ideas.

303
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:11,250
I might be too naggy.

304
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,890
Don't blame me.

305
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:18,280
I just don't think it's a good idea...

306
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,110
to send students to fight in an actual war.

307
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,660
These are all kids.

308
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,410
They are just building their foundation.

309
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,070
They are the future of our continent.

310
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,830
If we send them out,

311
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,640
we are wasting their lives.

312
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,580
To fight against the Soul Hall,

313
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,580
we are not afraid to sacrifice people.

314
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,760
This sounds righteous.

315
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,270
But,

316
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,470
this is a total trap.

317
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:56,120
There are traitors everywhere.

318
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,320
It's the duty of us adults.

319
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,500
Children shouldn't bear the consequences.

320
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,610
Then...

321
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,440
So,

322
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,630
the duty of students should only be study.

323
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,620
Not to fight in the war.

324
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,930
As for the teachers of our Jia Nan Academy,

325
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,900
this is my opinion.

326
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,330
In our team of teachers,

327
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:27,250
we have alchemists,
we have teachers who teach the breathing,

328
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,110
and enhancing Qi,

329
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:32,200
these teachers are all our treasures.

330
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,250
If we lose them in the war,

331
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,400
that would be such a shame.

332
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,820
So,

333
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:49,820
I don't agree with what Elder Han said.

334
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,940
Our duty is to teach our students.

335
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,910
Make sure our Jia Nan Academy is in safe hands.

336
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:01,820
That's our real duty.

337
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,850
As an elder of Jia Nan Academy,

338
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:11,090
looking for justice is your top duty!

339
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,700
Not necessarily.

340
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,470
You're the Leader of Star Fall Pavillion.

341
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:22,480
Elder Gu He is the top alchemist of Cloud Mist Sect.

342
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,140
Nalan Yanran is also in Cloud Mist Sect now.

343
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:31,380
I think the two of you could form an alliance.

344
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:36,310
Unit Star Fall Pavillion, Cloud Mist Sect and Nalan family.

345
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,360
Organize a well-planned powerful

346
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,040
fight back...

347
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,870
on the traitors...

348
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,480
and the force from Soul Hall that
infiltrates into the FightQi Continent.

349
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:54,350
At that time, our Jia Nan Academy...

350
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,530
will become the strongest backbone.

351
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:01,370
I haven't asked what Sect Leader thinks.

352
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:04,880
But I don't think it's going to work...

353
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,290
if you ask his family alone
to provide people and efforts.

354
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:14,090
You said Jia Nan Academy will be the backbone.

355
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:20,730
I think that's for the future. Without actions,
how could I negotiate with them?

356
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,540
You're so right.

357
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,260
So I hope Sect Leader Yun Shan...

358
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,030
would unite the 5 families' power,

359
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:32,480
and any force in this land who's willing to
fight against the Soul Hall,

360
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,270
and form a new military alliance.

361
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,860
We are willing to let Sect Leader Yun Shan
to be the leader of this army.

362
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:45,760
All of our teachers. If anyone wants in,

363
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,820
I wouldn't stop you.

364
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,080
If anyone dies in the war,

365
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:57,500
our academy is willing
to take good care of their family.

366
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:03,630
The alchemist department
can provide enough basic medicine.

367
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:07,230
Also, if anyone gets hurt in the battle,

368
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:10,860
we are willing to treat them.

369
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:15,210
I wonder if you two elders...

370
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,100
are satisfied with my statement?

371
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,870
I agree with that. Students are always students.

372
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:30,820
Sending the kids to die...

373
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,960
how could we run a school?

374
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:40,230
That would be against Fight God's original purpose
when he founded the school.

375
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:43,970
Yes. Yes.

376
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:49,290
Two elders, please go visit Cloud Mist Sect.

377
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,860
In the future when everything is clear,

378
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,200
and the world is in peace,

379
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,130
you two would be the heroes
and the role models of our school.

380
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:08,210
I wonder you just want to provide some medicine,

381
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:13,500
and ask the old master of Cloud Mist Sect to be
the leader of this alliance, right?

382
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,350
You don't want to provide any soldiers, right?

383
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,250
You're so sneaky.

384
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,080
Mi Tengshan.

385
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,210
If I go back to school,

386
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:27,450
and the kids ask me,

387
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:31,250
darkness is coming
and why aren't you elders doing anything?

388
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,200
What should I say?
Can I say you are in my way?

389
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:39,220
Are you the turtle? We are colleagues.
I can't say that about you.

390
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,230
Also,

391
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:48,490
if teachers and students offer to seek justice,

392
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:51,910
and attack Soul Hall,
you can't get in the way of that, right?

393
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,840
Who dares?

394
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,100
If any student leaves school without permission,

395
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,130
I will abolish their Fight Qi.

396
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,260
I will not tolerate that!

397
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,680
You...

398
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:19,930
Elder Tengshan. They can't offer.
They can't volunteer.

399
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,120
I think there must be something wrong with you!

400
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,310
Something terribly wrong!

401
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:25,780
Yes! You must be connected to the Soul Hall!

402
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,470
I don't have any connections.

403
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:34,750
Some people try so hard to get the students
out of the protection of Fight God's seal.

404
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,870
So the Soul Hall can kill them all?

405
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,820
What do you mean?

406
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,140
Say it clearly.

407
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,610
Who has the special purpose?

408
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,430
Your Star Fall Pavillion,

409
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:50,260
and Cloud Mist Sect have so many great fighters.

410
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,850
You guys don't do anything.

411
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:54,490
Instead you ask the teachers
and students to go risk their lives.

412
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,990
I think that's your special purpose!

413
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,760
Enough!

414
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,600
Fighting like crazy. So inappropriate.

415
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,300
You guys can wait.

416
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,800
You would be happy when Soul Hall kill you all!

417
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,300
I'm finally back.

418
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,220
I want to sleep. Don't talk to me.

419
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,100
Don't sleep yet.
Where have you been all this time?

420
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,190
Tell us.

421
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,360
Hao Tian. Stop bothering him.

422
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,980
How was I bothering him?

423
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,090
They thought we are still brothers.

424
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:39,130
So many people asked about you.

425
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,360
They asked us and we don't know anything.

426
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,330
Fine.

427
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,570
What do you want to know? Ask away.

428
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:48,740
We heard that you made a mess in Xiao family,

429
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,920
burned the Fight Technique Pavillion,
then went to Ta ge'er to become a hired soldier.

430
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,600
You killed so many people!

431
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,560
You became a gangster in a few days!

432
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,740
Isn't that wrong?

433
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,090
I didn't burn the pavillion.

434
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:07,860
I don't know who burned it.

435
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:13,820
In the soldier group, other than 3 meals
and sleep all day, I didn't kill any one.

436
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,040
You can go ask Xun'er
how she became the Dragon Mother.

437
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,120
Her story is more interesting than mine.

438
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,290
So boring.

439
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,750
Right now, there are full of Blood Sect people outside
and renegades who have surrendered.

440
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,430
A lot of our classmates and teachers want to charge out

441
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,660
and fight it out with the Blood Sect.

442
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,840
Why don't you continue being our boss,
lead us down the mountain, and kill them with pleasure.

443
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:48,030
Lin Xiuya, with just this trip, we have subordinates
of Blood Sect who kept chasing us.

444
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,680
You still are going out to fight them?

445
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,020
In the past, there were so many strong fighters from the Five
Great Clans who joined the campaign to eliminate Soul Hall,

446
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,450
but only a few returned.

447
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:02,630
What? You think you are stronger than them?

448
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:06,260
Just obediently stay here inside the academy.

449
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:18,610
Words that Xiao Yan is a traitor

450
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,500
and that he burned
the Fight Technique Pavilion of Xiao Family,

451
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,530
are all just hearsay.
We didn't personally see it.

452
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:27,060
We can't rashly make conclusions.

453
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:30,300
The Xiao Clan is one of the Five Great Clans.

454
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,660
If we keep Xiao Yan here in the academy,

455
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,770
it would be very beneficial
to our cohesive force in the future.

456
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,730
I don't know if he has any cohesive force,

457
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:42,570
but just in burning the Fight Technique Pavilion,

458
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:46,440
didn't he already get expelled out of his clan?

459
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,100
That was announced by his own father.

460
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,400
Can't we still make a conclusion?

♫ the mountain calls and the sea roars ♫

486
