3
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,200
Down there! It's below!

4
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,400
It's down below! Hurry!

5
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,799
My mother said fear is like the dew.

6
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,400
It arrives in the dark
and is bone-chilling cold everywhere in the wilderness.

7
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,899
In that situation, don't worry.
Just endure till dawn.

8
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,600
When the sun rises, everything will be gone.

9
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,399
The Fight God is the sun on this continent.

10
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,399
A millennium ago, he led five big clans

11
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,999
in fighting the Soul Hall
in the coldest place in the North

12
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,799
and sealed them in the dark underground.

13
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,299
That brought peace to the Fight Qi continent.

14
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,999
He knows that as the day and night alternate,

15
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,799
the light will soon dim
while the dark will soon rise.

16
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,200
The children of the five clans
are the ones guarding the light.

17
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,000
Hurry! Run!

18
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,900
Run! Hurry!

19
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,000
[Wu Tan City]

20
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm Xiao Yan, son of the Xiao family in Wu Tan City.
When I was nine years old...

21
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,699
Announcing... The champion of the Fight Qi
Martial Arts Youth Competition is Xiao Yan!

22
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,699
- Good!
- Good! Xiao Yan!

23
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,150
I mastered the nine stages
of Fight Qi martial arts skills,

24
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,300
which made me the strongest
and youngest genius on the mainland.

25
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,399
The news of the revival of the darkness
also came from the North in the same year.

26
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,799
My mother joined the five big clans
and marched toward the Soul Hall.

27
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,599
I can't stay.

28
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,899
It's my duty.

29
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,499
Every person has their own responsibility.

30
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,299
Mother!

31
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,399
No one knows what happened on that journey
to the North back then.

32
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,700
My mother returned but was badly injured.

33
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,770
The Venerable Medicine Supreme, he...

34
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,099
From now on, no matter what happens,

35
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,199
you must properly protect this Spatial Ring.

36
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,799
Mother, in that case,
don't leave me again.

37
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,599
I won't. Not for a day, not ever.

38
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,599
I want to see you grow up.

39
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,599
I won't leave you again, not even for a day.

40
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,299
Where are the treasures?

41
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,399
Tell me. I want you to get rid of it yourself.

42
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,799
Since you said that
I betrayed the alliance of the five clans,

43
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,799
and became a slave to Hun Miesheng;

44
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,400
then, why would I have the treasures?

45
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,299
Mother! Mother! Mother!

46
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,199
- Xiao Yan!
- Mother!

47
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,099
I escaped and returned to the house of Xiao

48
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,199
only because I wanted to see my son.

49
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,599
If you want the treasures,
go and get them from Hun Miesheng.

50
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,600
Sect Leader Yun, Hun Miesheng asked me
to convey a message to the five clans.

51
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,200
"Darkness is coming."

52
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,199
You're afraid, too?

53
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,199
People from the other clans rushed here.

54
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,599
They said she was a traitor,
that she killed the Venerable Medicine Supreme,

55
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,900
and kept the treasures for herself.
They forced her to kill herself.

56
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,999
Mother! Mother!

57
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,999
Even though Madam did that,
she still can't cleanse the tainted reputation of the Xiao Clan.

58
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,499
Are all of you joining together to coerce me?

59
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,399
Making the assumption
that the treasures are definitely in my hands.

60
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,399
You have already dragged
the House of Xiao into hell,

61
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,530
and you are still going to
keep the treasures for yourself?

62
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,300
Then I will give all of you a statement.

63
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,800
Xiao Clan Leader!

64
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,199
Father personally destroyed
his Fight Qi martial arts skills.

65
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,800
The House of Xiao has been on a decline since then.

66
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,399
Sometimes I feel what Mother said was right.

67
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,400
The fear has lived inside me for seven years.

68
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,999
I want to work hard
to become strong and powerful.

69
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,800
I want to find out the truth
behind my mother's death.

70
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,399
But the truth seems to be that over the past seven years,
no matter how hard I try,

71
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,399
my Fight Qi skills have been deteriorating.

72
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:47,100
Fantastic!

73
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:50,399
Xiao Yan, come on stage!

74
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,399
What is he doing?

75
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,799
Is he able to do it?

76
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,699
- Why is he even here to compete?
- That's right.

77
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,999
I'm Xiao Yan

78
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,100
and I'm the last piece of trash
on this mainland.

79
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,139
Let's go back.

80
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,800
Xiao Xun'er, come on stage!

81
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,600
Fantastic!

82
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,000
Senior Brother Xiao Yan.

83
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,399
Am I in a position for you to still call me your senior?

84
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,999
Senior Brother Xiao Yan, you told me once,

85
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,699
"One has to be able to put something down
in order to pick it up again.

86
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,800
Those who can let go
are the ones who can be free."

87
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,060
Let's go back.

88
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,180
Brother Xiao Yan, have some water.

89
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,299
Take a look! This piece of trash
is quite hardworking.

90
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,899
Don't listen to them, Brother Xiao Yan.
You've been practicing very hard these days.

91
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,799
I believe one day you will become the top Fight Practitioner.

92
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,000
It's a pity that no matter how hard he tries,
he's still a piece of trash.

93
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,610
Hey.

94
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,599
I'm talking about you, a piece of trash.

95
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,799
Not satisfied? Are you not satisfied?

96
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,999
What are you doing?

97
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,400
I'm asking you if you are still not satisfied.

98
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,600
You good-for-nothing! You dare to make a move?

99
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,999
Your Fight Qi skills are as weak as a child's

100
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,300
and you still need a girl to protect you.

101
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,099
- Why did you hit him?
- What was the meaning of that?

102
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,599
What's wrong? You're fine, right?

103
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,799
Go after him!

104
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,099
- After him!
- Stop running!

105
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,200
- Stop right there! Stop running!
- Stop right there!

106
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,799
Hurry! That way!

107
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,700
Stop running!

108
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,359
Lord, 5 qians of white musk slices.
[*Each qian is 5 grams]

109
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,750
All right.

110
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,030
You fought again?

111
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,770
I did.

112
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:19,800
Father, teach me the Mad Lion Crazy Stars
martial arts technique. I want to defeat them.

113
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,049
You are not suitable for that.

114
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,289
I can practice day and night.

115
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,430
I will work harder than them.

116
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,339
Even if I regress, I won't be like you.

117
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,920
You destroyed your own Fight Qi skills
and hide in here managing ledgers!

118
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,410
Bring me the ruler.

119
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,750
Watch your mouth.

120
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,960
Hit yourself.

121
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,970
- Young Master.
- Come with me!

122
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,590
Let's go. Let's go.

123
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,740
Brother Xiao Yan.

124
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,970
Thank you.

125
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,539
Young Master.

126
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,560
Young Master, Master wants you to come back.

127
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,390
All right.

128
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,999
Father.

129
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,819
You've come.

130
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,190
This is the Xiao Family Medicine Shop's Mister Wan.

131
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,899
Father, why did you want to see me?

132
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,639
You don't have to practice
Fight Qi martial arts skills anymore.

133
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,719
Follow Mister Wan and be an apprentice
in the medicine shop.

134
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,709
You're to be his apprentice
and take care of the medicine shop business.

135
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:11,879
Father, I want to be a Fight Practitioner.

136
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,939
We are taking the exam
for getting into Jia Nan Academy soon.

137
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,719
If I can't get in,
I can't be a good Fight Practitioner in the future.

138
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,649
You don't have that kind of talent.

139
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,550
I do!

140
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,989
I-I do.

141
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:31,019
In this year's Fight Qi martial arts main competition,
how did you place?

142
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,559
What's your Fight Qi ranking?

143
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,269
Father, I will definitely succeed in learning it.

144
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,419
Don't make me a shop apprentice.

145
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,669
I-I will work harder than anyone else.

146
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,219
I practice fighting even in my dreams.

147
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,489
Mister Wan, please take a seat first.

148
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,489
I...

149
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,420
Please take a seat.

150
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,820
Come, please sit.

151
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,539
Come, come. Please take a seat.

152
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,490
And you come over here now.

153
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:08,389
Kneel down with a cup of tea
and pay your respects to Mister Wan.

154
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:12,990
After acknowledging him as your teacher,
learn to manage the business at the medicine shop.

155
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,539
Father, I don't want to be a shop apprentice.
I want to be a Fight Practitioner.

156
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,919
If I can't learn it today,
I will use ten years to learn it.

157
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,109
If I can't learn it in ten years,
I'll learn it in twenty.

158
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,679
If I can't make it in twenty years... Even if I need to
practice until I am dead, I still want to be a Fight Practitioner!

159
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,849
Father, I beg you, please don't make me a shop apprentice.

160
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,790
Don't make me a shop apprentice!

161
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,419
My child, with your talent,

162
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,949
you will die sooner
if you become a Fight Practitioner.

163
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:53,590
If something were to happen to you,
I won't be able to face your mother.

164
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,489
Just accept your destiny.

165
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,620
Come... Pay your respects to your teacher.

166
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,780
No, I will not!

167
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,089
Fine. You are the most precious.

168
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:17,979
Then I will do it for you.

169
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,528
Father!

170
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,130
- Clan Master, you—
- Sit down!

171
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:44,230
According to the rules, my son lacks discipline.
I apologize for letting you witness it.

172
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:50,220
Please, accept this cup of tea.

173
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,010
Master.

174
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,539
Take him back.

175
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,350
Forbid him from entering
the Fight Qi martial arts training place.

176
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,269
The back courtyard is where
we keep the medicinal herbs.

177
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,689
What's stored over there
are jars of herbal wine.

178
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,519
Remember this.
Those over there are very expensive.

179
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,590
Don't break them.

180
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,140
Let's chop these herbs first.

181
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,000
Don't grab so many!

182
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,769
Press them down before you chop them.

183
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,160
Cut it into smaller pieces!

184
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,829
I heard you've learned martial arts skills before?

185
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,649
I like to throw a couple of punches myself.

186
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,589
I learned some moves from the front
of a martial arts skills training studio

187
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:09,130
when I peeked over from the fence.
Let me show you.

188
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,949
You show no promise of a good future.

189
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,059
Coming to a medicine shop to be a nobody.

190
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:32,550
For you, it will be of no use
even if you practiced until you are eighty years old.

191
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,800
Slow down! If you break the chopper,
the Master will yell at us!

192
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,939
You will be sending those finished herbs

193
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,010
to the martial arts skills training studio.

194
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,219
- Which martial arts skills training studio?
- House of Xiao, of course!

195
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,529
Clan Leader has given his instructions.

196
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:56,819
He said they are taking the exam
for entry into the Jia Nan Academy soon.

197
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,950
Hence, they need extra supplements daily.

198
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,160
Who are you?

199
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,070
Little Scoundrel, you look just like your mother.

200
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,009
Who are you? Where is this place?

201
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,009
I'm your Grand Old Master!

202
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:23,619
Grand Old Master has been dead
for seven years already.

203
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,750
You are a ghost, right?

204
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,159
Who did you say was a ghost just a while ago?

205
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,479
You're not a ghost! You're not a ghost!

206
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,099
What am I?

207
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,600
Grand Old Master! Grand Old Master!

208
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,240
Grand Old Master.

209
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,160
Are you really my Grand Old Master?

210
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,729
But didn't you die seven years ago?

211
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,059
How could you show up here?

212
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,709
Seven years ago, I locked myself in here.

213
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:08,839
So to those on the outside,
I am indeed dead.

214
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,550
Outside?

215
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,050
Then where is this place?

216
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,490
The Spatial Ring on your finger.

217
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,180
We're inside my Spatial Ring?

218
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,930
Come with me.

219
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,789
People on the outside would never have thought

220
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,419
that the Star Fall Pavilion treasures
that they've all wanted for so many years

221
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,759
were in the palm of a young fool all along.

222
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,669
If I'm still not impressed by my ingenuity,

223
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,740
then I'd feel embarrassed by it.

224
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,969
Are the Star Fall Pavilion treasures in here?

225
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,550
Yes.

226
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,539
That year, your mother risked her life to save me.

227
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,469
I was afraid that these treasures that had been passed on
for generations would fall into the hands of bad people.

228
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,849
So I told your mother to move everything here

229
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,130
to be locked inside with me.

230
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,489
But all these years, my two disciples,

231
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,559
one seeked refuge at the Soul Hall,
one committed suicide and died.

232
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,650
As for me, I reside inside this ring all alone.

233
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,479
But it's good that I have you.

234
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,999
If I hadn't relied on absorbing your Fight Qi skills,

235
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,500
my soul might have long disintegrated and disappeared.

236
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,799
So, you were absorbing my Fight Qi skills?

237
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,119
Yes.

238
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,029
So, as I practice every day,
my Fight Qi skills that are deteriorating every day,

239
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,820
- are absorbed by you?
- Yes.

240
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,260
You absorbed it daily?

241
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,270
Did you just...?

242
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:58,309
Do you realize that over the years
because I've lost all my Fight Qi skills,

243
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,419
that I've suffered so much humiliation?!

244
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,960
And it's all because of you!

245
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,899
And... And my mother, in order to save you

246
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,129
and those so-called Star Fall Pavilion treasures,

247
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:15,439
she was forced to kill herself by those people.
Forced to kill herself!

248
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,229
Did you know that?!

249
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:21,460
Instead, you hid yourself in this Spatial Ring
and didn't come out!

250
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,499
That's because I can't get out.

251
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,599
And since I haven't recovered,
I wouldn't be able to win even if I went out.

252
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,029
You harmed me... You harmed my mother...

253
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,950
I'll kill you, you old man!

254
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:41,549
Scolding child, why are you being disrespectful
with your Grand Old Master, hitting and kicking me like that?

255
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,929
Since you're so incredible, come out with me.

256
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,750
Go out? Where to?

257
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,139
To get revenge.

258
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,039
Yun Shan, Yan Luotian, all those people
who hounded my mother to death.

259
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,329
I'm not going. I just recovered.

260
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,679
Grand Old Master!

261
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,900
Didn't you just call me an "old man" just now?

262
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:03,070
Don't kneel. I get anxious
when I see people kneel.

263
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,099
Why don't we do this?
There's no need for you to be anxious either.

264
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,630
Let me rest for a bit and regain my vital energy.

265
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,029
Since you've come, do your job well.

266
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,889
If you're unable to become a Fight Practitioner,

267
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,100
selling medicine is not so bad.

268
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,560
Even if it's not as an alchemist,

269
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,659
but just a...

270
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,699
medicine merchant or the manager of a pharmacy,

271
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,050
you'll also be superior to a lot of people.

272
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,179
A person above others.
What's wrong with being respected by others?

273
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,409
Do you understand my reasoning?

274
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,510
Think about it.

275
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:17,739
Young fellow, you really are not sensible.

276
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,300
You just sneaked out on your own,
causing me to get scolded.

277
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,840
Fine, take care of this job.

278
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,169
Where's the wine? Where did it go?

279
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,990
Who drank it? Where's the wine?

280
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,910
Get up!

281
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,960
What's going on here? Where are the wines?

282
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,230
Say something!

283
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:02,570
You scoundrel. You've got some guts.

284
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,949
Tell me! Where's the wine?

285
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,639
I don't know!

286
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,839
You're still being tough-mouthed? Hit him!

287
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,100
Where's the wine?

288
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,150
I've got nothing to say!

289
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:22,389
Let me tell you that your father wished to
entrust you to me not just once or twice.

290
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,609
Since you've become my disciple,
you're now a shop attendant here.

291
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,489
I then must discipline you.

292
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:31,179
Today, I must remove
that "young master" attitude of yours.

293
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,920
Hold him down well!

294
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,369
Lad, if you have the guts,
don't dare shout that it's painful.

295
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:42,289
I'll beat you!

296
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:46,420
I'll beat you!

297
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,670
Grand Old Master, your alcohol tolerance is quite good.

298
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:00,220
Grand Old Master, give me some pointers.

299
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:13,340
If your pants fall, lift them up yourself.
This matter has nothing to do with me.

300
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,669
That fist technique was taught by my mother.

301
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,169
And my mother was taught by you.

302
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:24,270
Hence, if my technique is wrong,
it's directly your fault.

303
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:29,469
And moreover, who are you?

304
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,589
You won't dare to drink my wine for free, right?

305
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,279
That fist technique of yours is not bad.
To drive away flies when you're using the latrine,

306
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,529
it will be very suitable. Too bad,
if the foundation of your Fight Qi skills were a bit better,

307
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:44,289
the effect of those fist attacks
would have been different.

308
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:47,139
Yes. My mother also said that

309
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,629
here on the Fight Qi continent,
one must control one's fist using qi.

310
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:54,269
It's just that all the Fight Qi skills
I've cultivated these past seven years

311
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,939
were all consumed by you.
I wasn't left with anything.

312
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,769
How could my foundation get better?

313
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:04,279
Moreover, you Old Man, have been recuperating for so
many years and absorbing so many of my Fight Qi skills,

314
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,099
yet you still are not ready.
It's all mere talk.

315
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,000
That, I can understand.

316
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,960
Look well, Little Lad.

317
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:17,219
This Long Fist technique was left
by the Fight God to be used by the five great clans.

318
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:21,450
It looks simple, but every stance
must be full of Fight Qi.

319
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,540
Will you be able to learn it?

320
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,100
I don't understand.

321
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,300
If you're this good, why did you die there?

322
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,900
If you have such strong Fight Qi skills,
why did you need my mother to save you?

323
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,300
Is Hun Miesheng really that strong?

324
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,670
Do you know what the strongest kind of fight technique is?

325
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,200
It's the human heart.

326
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:15,300
It's people who are close to you that scheme
for so many years to harm you.

327
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,099
That year, if not for your mother saving me,

328
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,899
I really would have died
by the hands of the person I was closest with.

329
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,900
The world's number one.

330
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,780
The world's number one needed to be protected
by a woman and a child.

331
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,799
It wasn't easy for me to steal some wine to drink,
but it caused you to get beaten up instead.

332
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,400
That is the world's number one
you're talking about?

333
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,598
Vengeance! Everyone wants to get revenge.

334
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,999
But now, even my desire to take revenge is gone.

335
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,199
As for you, why don't you just be an attendant
at the medicine shop? It's good that way, too.

336
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,198
I'm unable to just hide and be a coward.

337
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,199
- Who are you calling a coward?
- You tell me.

338
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,199
That year, just because of you, many people died.

339
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:58,499
My mother was innocently forced to commit suicide.
My Fight Qi skills were absorbed by you for seven years!

340
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,000
Seven years...

341
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,399
You want me to just be an attendant
in a medicine shop?

342
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,800
Let me tell you. There's no way.

343
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,050
It's your choice if you want to teach me or not.

344
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,100
Just a minute.

345
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,099
Star Fall Pavilion's Thirty-Six Medicine Formula.

346
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,799
Earning the blessings of Heaven and Earth,

347
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,999
the Xiao Clan were originally
the descendants of the Farm God.

348
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,399
Be a good alchemist, and in the Jia Ma Empire,

349
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,499
everyone will respect and fear you.
They won't dare to offend you.

350
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,799
If you cultivate following the instructions in here,
you might even have a long life.

351
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,200
What do you think? Not bad, right?

352
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,999
I will definitely learn to be an alchemist.

353
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,100
But... I still am going to be a Fight Practitioner, too.

354
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,199
This is a gold medal that the Jia Ma Empire
gives out only every three hundred years.

355
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,599
Take this gold medal and, in the Jia Ma Empire,

356
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,799
you can have the money or power that you want.

357
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,400
A million man army will roar for you.

358
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,399
Take it to womanize every day

359
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,099
and have a few drinks. How about it?

360
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,100
Dirty Old Man.

361
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,099
Don't talk to me that way. Don't forget.
I'm your Grand Old Master.

362
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,200
You're the one who forced me to call you that.

363
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,300
If you just leave me behind in this way,
do you think you're doing right by your mother?

364
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,880
Give me the Spatial Ring.

365
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,199
What is this?

366
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,999
This is my present for you.

367
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,499
No matter what happens in the future,
you must keep this Spatial Ring safely.

368
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,700
My mother instructed me before she left

369
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,400
that I must protect this ring well.

370
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,900
I will always wear it.

371
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,100
You can drink as much wine as you want.

372
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,199
Anyway, I'm good at enduring a paddling.

373
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,200
Just treat it as doing my filial duty toward you.

374
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,899
I don't owe anyone, you little brat! How dare you say
that my temper is bad?! I'll kill you with one slap!

375
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,900
You owe me a lot!

376
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,599
Father, did you call for me?

377
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,199
It's been years since we've seen Yanran.

378
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,899
Yanran's here?

379
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,699
The Nalan Clan are currently recruiting talents

380
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:02,099
to go to Wu Tan City
and attend the Jia Nan Academy examination.

381
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,499
I'll give you leave.

382
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,899
Buy some gifts and go visit Yanran.

383
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,100
Don't bother. In my current state...

384
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,999
The engagement was set
by your grandfather and the Nalan family.

385
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,699
Now that both you and Yanran are grown,

386
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,399
it's time for you to see each other.

387
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,999
This is...

388
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,800
the visit letter I wrote
for the Clan Chief of the Nalan Clan. Take it with you.

389
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,600
- Miss.
- Miss.

390
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,799
Good day, Miss.

391
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,300
The matter concerning the Xiao Clan
is quite hard to handle.

392
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:47,760
Xiao Zhan is a stubborn man.

393
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,700
I still have things to do,
so I'll take my leave now.

394
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,400
Grandfather.

395
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,500
Who made you angry?

396
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,599
This is a letter from your master.

397
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,999
He sent four disciples

398
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,499
on an eight hundred li journey
to bring this over quickly.

399
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,900
It's about your marriage.

400
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,399
What Sect Leader Yun Shan said is right.

401
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,800
One seeks his way up, just as water seeks its way down.
[T/N: One should always strive to make progress.]

402
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,199
Faster or we'll be late.

403
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,399
- Faster.
- Wait for me.

404
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,999
Young Master.

405
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,799
Let me do this kind of work instead, Young Master.

406
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,299
What is it? I'm delivering water
to the martial arts skills training studio.

407
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,219
No, you will be delivering water
for just a few more days, Young Master.

408
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,999
Just let me attend to you on this one more time.

409
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,999
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

410
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,999
The tailor is here.
He's waiting for you in the hall.

411
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,299
What?

412
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,199
Before classes at Jia Nan Academy begin, Master wants

413
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,599
to have your marriage with Miss Nalan be done with.

414
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,999
He'll be choosing an auspicious day
next month for your wedding.

415
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,199
Let's hurry... We don't have enough time.

416
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,500
Five days from now,
it will be your engagement banquet.

417
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:24,599
Good. Turn around.

418
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,379
Let me measure it. Good.

419
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,860
Good.

420
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,299
How about this?

421
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,799
It'll do.

422
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,199
You're getting married soon.
Why aren't you happy?

423
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,699
There's nothing to be unhappy about.

424
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,200
It's just that it feels like
I'm still in a dream.

425
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,299
Look for someone to copy this.
Based on the prepared name list,

426
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,199
deliver it to our friends and relatives.

427
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,600
Yes, sir.

428
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,220
Master!

429
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,199
Master, the distinguished guests are here.

430
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,900
Cloud Mist Sect's Head Alchemy Elder Gu He,
also known as the Pellet King, asks for an audience.

431
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,300
Pellet King Gu He?

432
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,399
Pellet King Gu He is here.

433
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,499
It's my great fortune to have you visit us.

434
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:19,599
Xiao Clan Leader lowering yourself to welcome me
is making me feel so overwhelmed.

435
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,900
- Please come in.
- Thank you, Clan Leader.

436
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,599
Xiao Clan Leader indeed has an air of a martial arts warrior.

437
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,599
This study of yours is quite uniquely decorated.

438
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,400
Brother Gu, please tell me the purpose of your visit.

439
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,069
Brother Xiao, this is a small token gift.

440
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,900
I hope you can accept it.

441
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,099
That is a sixth level mythical medicine.

442
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,999
It can revive a dead person and can also
transform the bones of the dead into flesh again.

443
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,399
In the past, Xiao Clan Leader was forced
to completely destroy your Fight Qi.

444
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,599
Let's not talk anymore about
whether that was right or wrong.

445
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,499
Once you take this drug, although your Fight Qi
won't be able to return to its previous state,

446
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,700
I'm still confident that it can reach 60
to 70% of your previous strength.

447
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,599
What is the reason
that you're giving me such a precious gift?

448
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,100
Brother Gu, please express it clearly.
