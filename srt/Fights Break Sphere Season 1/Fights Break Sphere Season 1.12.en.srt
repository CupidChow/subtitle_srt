=Episode 12=

3
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,900
My... My dad let me hide in the box,

4
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,800
but the box was moving around a lot.

5
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,100
And the inside was very smelly, so I fainted.

6
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,700
I even thought I was dead.

7
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,700
Miss, don't be afraid.

8
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,600
Where are you from?

9
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
She has said it before.
Why are you still asking?

10
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,800
She said that she's the daughter of the medicine shop
that's at the base of the mountain.

11
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,700
That Immortal Bug went down the mountain
and ate her family.

12
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,900
Her dad let her hide in the box. That was it.

13
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,500
You're too talkative. Let her speak for herself.

14
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,800
I...

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,300
Miss, do you want to take revenge?

16
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,400
Where's the magical crystal we'd found?

17
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,810
This one? It's no problem to make

18
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,080
ten more Regeneration Pills with this.

19
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,000
But this little thing here... One couldn't set this
onto one's weapon even if we hammer it.

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,300
Let's just go inside and walk around.

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,500
We can't.

22
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,900
If we walk inside there again, it will be dangerous.

23
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,000
Didn't you say that the big beasts
are only found in the gorges?

24
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,400
My uncle said...

25
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,600
to go inside there further...

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Okay. If we go inside further,

27
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,000
we'll encounter the Two Headed Spiritual Snake.

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,400
- What rank is it?
- That I don't know.

29
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,900
But once we encounter it, there will be thousands of them.

30
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,700
Moreover,

31
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,400
we even brought a person
that doesn't have any knowledge of Fight Qi.

32
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,200
Brother Xiao Yan, come over here.
I have something to say to you.

33
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,500
I think there is something wrong with that girl.

34
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,800
What is it?

35
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Earlier, I was afraid that she had internal injuries.

36
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,400
I used Fight Qi energy to run a scan of her body.

37
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,600
Inside her body, there was Fight Qi energy resisting me.

38
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,900
I think that her Fight Qi energy
may be much stronger than ours.

39
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,000
Xun'er!

40
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,000
I surrender.

41
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,100
Don't hurt her.

42
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,700
Just who are you?

43
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:33,200
I'm Yun Yun, a disciple personally taught
by the Grand Old Master of Cloud Mist Sect.

44
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,700
Lad, you have Essence Flame.

45
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,300
Yes.

46
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,150
Let's trade on a condition.

47
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,700
I can spare them,

48
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,200
but you have to help me.

49
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,900
Okay. I agree.

50
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,300
Under this cave, there is another cave.

51
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,000
Go there with me.

52
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,100
What kind of monster is in that cave?

53
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,900
I hid in that bug's stomach
just so I could dodge that cave.

54
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,000
Instead, you foiled my plan and killed my host.

55
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,600
Of course, I must let you pay for that.

56
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Your Essence Flame would be able
to help me get passed that cave.

57
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,200
Okay. I'll go with you.

58
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,600
But you also have to promise me.

59
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,300
You won't hurt any one of them.

60
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,770
Deal.

61
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,200
With your high ranking,
you could have entered on your own.

62
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,460
Why did you have to drag me along with you?

63
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,300
This cave is extremely strange.

64
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,000
When a person enters,
he will have illusions,

65
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
unable to get out, age and die here.

66
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,200
But to that magical beast,
it has no effect.

67
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,250
Then why did you bring me along?

68
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,900
I'm not a magical beast.

69
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,800
I said your Essence Flame will be useful to me.

70
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,400
The Essence Flame is Fight God's Flame.

71
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,900
The king of nature.

72
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,800
The smell in here is different from that outside.

73
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,600
If you inhale it, you might develop illusions.

74
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,700
I advise you to manifest the Essence Flame earlier.

75
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,100
Or else, later, if I develop illusions,

76
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,740
I might kill you.

77
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,000
Over there.

78
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,400
Be careful.

79
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,220
How big is this cave?

80
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,400
I also don't know.
It's not recorded in ancient texts.

81
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,200
But I already made marks throughout our path.
We probably won't get lost.

82
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,400
This... This...

83
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,500
We've been moving towards one direction.

84
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,300
This isn't right.

85
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,400
How could it turn out to be like this?

86
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,900
This time, let's walk on by following the rope.
The direction should not be wrong.

87
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,700
We returned to the same area again.

88
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,100
Lad, what's wrong?

89
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,400
What's wrong with you?

90
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,400
To keep the Essence Flame burning,
my Fight Qi energy depletes very quickly.

91
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,500
My Fight Qi energy is not as deep and intense as yours.

92
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,680
I wouldn't be able to endure this for too long.

93
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,200
You are useless.

94
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,100
I don't believe this.

95
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,500
Crazy woman.

96
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,700
Why did you abandon me?

97
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,100
You were clearly the one who abandoned me, okay?

98
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,900
You left me alone and moved on ahead.

99
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,010
Why don't you want me?

100
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,500
What is it about her that's better than me?

101
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,800
What is it about her that's better than me?
What is it about me that's not comparable to her?

102
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,700
I've done so many things for you,
yet you abandoned me!

103
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,800
Say it! Tell me!

104
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,800
What is it about her that's better than me?
Tell me why you don't want me?

105
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,200
I'm better looking than her and better in martial arts than her.
I'm in a better shape than her. Why did you give up on me?

106
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,300
What is it about her that's better than me?

107
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,600
Tell me!

108
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,000
You...

109
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,500
She... She is not better than you.

110
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,300
You lied.

111
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You lied to me.

112
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,400
You are lying.

113
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,400
You lied to me!

114
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,000
You want to kill me?

115
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,650
You want to kill me?

116
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Since you don't want me anymore,

117
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,700
then what's the point...

118
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,800
of me staying alive.

119
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,600
- Are you crazy?
- Go away.

120
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,900
Let go of me!

121
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,000
Crazy woman!

122
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,000
Let go of me!

123
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,590
You dirty little rat.

124
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,200
You've lost too much blood.
If you still don't apply the medicine-

125
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,900
If you dare to touch me one more time,
I will kill you!

126
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,890
Little dirty rat, when I've recovered,

127
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,100
I will kill you.

128
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,590
Are all the people from the Cloud Mist Sect
so worthless like you?

129
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,390
How dare you humiliate my sect?

130
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,900
I...

131
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,900
Stop moving around. I didn't bring
a lot of these pellet medicines.

132
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,400
If you keep moving,
I really have no way of helping you.

133
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,000
It's all right if I die.

134
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,200
I don't care for your help.

135
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,900
If anyone else finds out
about you tearing up my clothes.

136
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,300
I...

137
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,920
I won't be able to live.

138
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,900
Fine...I won't tell anyone.

139
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,300
Cloud Mist Sect is
the No.1 in the world. Satisfied?

140
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,080
Cloud Mist Sect was originally the No.1 in the world.

141
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,100
Grand Old Master raised me since young.

142
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,910
I'm deeply indebted to him.

143
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,800
I won't allow anyone

144
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,900
to speak ill about Cloud Mist Sect.

145
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,400
Sounds like that old fellow Yun Shan
did something good.

146
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,700
Why did you save me?

147
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,600
Don't think too much about this.

148
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,400
Who knows what other danger
may befall us in this cave?

149
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,100
I may not make it out by myself.

150
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,500
Your sister, she is not your sibling right?

151
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,310
Why do you ask?

152
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,800
I'm dying soon.

153
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,200
Just think of this as having a conversation with me.

154
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,100
No.

155
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,500
We grew up together.

156
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,300
Childhood sweethearts.

157
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,550
Then, are the two of you engaged?

158
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:30,000
- No.
- Foolish boy, your sister must really be interested in you.

159
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The way she looks at you.

160
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,200
It lights up.

161
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,000
Stop talking nonsense. Hurry.
Think about how to get out of here.

162
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,690
Yes. Yes.

163
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,800
Yes.

164
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,200
I'm cold.

165
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,900
I'm cold.

166
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,800
Save me.

167
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,770
Hold me.

168
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,090
I don't want to die here.

169
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,400
Save me.

170
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,300
Hold me.

171
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,940
Hold me.

172
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,100
Hold me. I don't want to die here.

173
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,000
Save me.

174
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,200
Save me.

175
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,430
Awake? If so, take your hands off quickly.

176
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,230
Thanks.

177
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,720
Why is there poison on your sister's sword?

178
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,370
My sister isn't that kind of person.

179
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,870
The poison on your body is probably
from the toxic air outside.

180
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,200
It was absorbed into your blood and flesh.

181
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,430
This body of air is very poisonous.

182
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:51,970
It could alter the space and cause one to lose direction.

183
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:54,700
It could also cause one to have illusions,

184
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,760
as well as to be poisoned to death.

185
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,160
No wonder for so many years, there has been no one
who could get through this cave.

186
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,940
Hurry up and try to recover your Fight Qi energy.

187
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,640
When you have recovered,
we'll get out of here quickly.

188
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,480
When I have recovered,

189
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,530
we should go out there and give it another try.

190
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,440
We can't even handle the toxic air outside.

191
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,400
If we go out there, we are seeking death.

192
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,600
Aren't we safe in this little cave now?

193
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,840
Please, inside and outside are totally different.

194
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:31,220
The reason why this cave is so strange

195
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,380
is because a magical beast known
as Air Rock Beast lives inside here.

196
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,590
Although this magical beast is only palm-sized,

197
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,430
but once someone intrudes into their territory,

198
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,450
they will emit a kind of toxic air

199
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:44,480
that lets the intruder enter but unable to exit.

200
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,730
If it's just a magical beast,
then it's easy to handle.

201
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,100
We can find it and kill it.

202
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,470
That kind of magical beast looks like a rock.

203
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:56,400
There's no way we can find it unless it wants us to.

204
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:01,540
Besides, they can't be killed by any weapons,
even the Essence Flame can't burn it to death.

205
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,810
Even if we find it, there is no way we can kill it.

206
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:10,330
The corpses outside are probably like you.

207
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:13,210
Too greedy in hoping to get through the cave,

208
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:16,480
but were trapped here till their deaths by this Air Rock Beast.

209
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,790
I really don't know what's on the other side of the cave

210
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,060
that could make all of you risk your lives.

211
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,130
It's exactly because you don't know
what's on the other side of the cave.

212
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,600
If you knew,

213
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,860
you would also risk your life to get there.

214
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,190
What exactly is it

215
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,480
that made all of you so crazy?

216
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,140
Do you know why the magical beasts only live around
the Magical Beast Mountain Range

217
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,020
and never go deep into the Fight Qi Continent?

218
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,170
Because there is a door here

219
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,060
that can allow them to cross over
from somewhere far away.

220
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,270
However, what is it inside the door?

221
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,490
No one has seen it before.

222
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,560
According to legends, all the secrets
of the Magical Beast Mountain Range

223
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,950
can be unlocked
once one is able to get through this door.

224
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,730
In addition, there are other people who said that
inside that door, there is a huge treasure.

225
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:07,940
That year, when Fight God and Hun Miesheng
were learning Fight Qi skills,

226
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,920
it was all done behind this door.

227
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,530
They practiced cultivation and refinement together?

228
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:14,430
Don't you know that?

229
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:17,680
At first, I also could not believe that
those two people actually existed in this world.

230
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,430
Later, it was the Grand Old Master who told me,
and that made it impossible for me not to believe.

231
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:25,460
You people at the Cloud Mist Sect
are very good in overrating yourselves.

232
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,370
Yesterday, when we trapped the Amethyst Winged Lion King,
none of your people were able to even fight it face-to-face.

233
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,840
Instead, they were all already burned to death.

234
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,740
What do you know?

235
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,360
That Amethyst Winged Lion King
is the magical beast that guards the door.

236
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,510
The Companion Amethyst Source on it

237
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,180
can elevate a Fight Practitioner's cultivation level.

238
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,350
If we can find it,
and get the Companion Amethyst Source on it,

239
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:48,000
we can decrease our cultivation
and refinement practice by thirty years.

240
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,190
How about you send me to the door,

241
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,070
and I will share half of the benefits with you?

242
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:01,290
I don't have that kind of skills, nor the luck.

243
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:04,700
Here is my advice, don't be so greedy.

244
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,690
What are you doing?

245
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,710
Okay.

246
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,270
Then as we said before.

247
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,370
You send me to the opening of the cave.

248
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:28,400
As for whether I will live or die in the end,
that will have nothing to do with you.

249
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,800
I will walk into the door by myself.

250
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,790
I really just have to accede to your request.

251
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:38,380
Forget it. What a coincidence!

252
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,200
What coincidence?

253
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,240
- What are you doing?
- This is a rhino horn.

254
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,030
This is Sky Pass Rhino Horn. I killed it
at the Magic Beast Monster Range.

255
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:58,180
The essence of this rhino horn is it can ward off evil.

256
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,020
Also, the body of air from burning this rhino horn

257
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:03,250
is coincidentally the favorite food of the Air Rock Beast.

258
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:06,070
You are so badly injured, even if you go out,
you will only be a hindrance to me.

259
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,620
In a while, I will use this rhino horn
to lure the Air Rock Beast away.

260
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,900
You wait for me to shout out to you,
and then run towards the opening of the cave.

261
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,700
Okay. You be careful.

262
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,140
Deal.

263
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,070
I will give you the rhino horn and you will let us go.

264
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,970
You just draw in the toxic gas for a while.

265
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,840
As for whether I will be able to run out of here,

266
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,260
that would have to depend on our own destiny.

267
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,230
Get ready.

268
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,770
Run!

269
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,760
That's it over there. Let's get down quickly.

270
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,260
Okay.

271
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,510
They lied to me.

272
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,320
They lied to me!

273
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,060
What did they lie to you?

274
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,860
At the base of the mountain, I traded some
martial arts skills for this treasure map.

275
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,420
But there is nothing here.

276
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,220
Since there is nothing here,
let's quickly get out of here.

277
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,020
No.

278
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,520
Look!

279
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,030
It's in the water!
The entrance is actually in the water!

280
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:34,150
You have already walked in
and out of the netherworld several times.

281
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,290
Yet you are still so greedy.

282
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,280
I admire your spirit...

283
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:42,810
Go down there with me and I will share
half of the benefits with you.

284
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,650
Our deal is just for me to walk you to
the opening of the cave. Our deal is done now.

285
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,690
Even if there are some startling secrets

286
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,250
or amazing martial arts skills down there,
you still won't go?

287
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,410
My friends are still at the Magical Beast Mountain Range.

288
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,870
I'm afraid they are in danger.
I have to get back there quickly.

289
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,480
I don't want to kill you.

290
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,830
You won't kill me.

291
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,480
Why wouldn't I?

292
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,480
If you wanted to kill me,

293
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,970
you would already be dead.

294
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,750
What do you mean?

295
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,230
When I was treating you just now,

296
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,020
I left some Essence Flame inside your body.

297
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,240
If you were to harbor the intention to kill me,
you would already become a pile of ashes.

298
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,680
You—

299
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,470
You scoundrel!

300
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:45,450
I have no other way.
Your martial arts skills are better than mine.

301
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,280
If I can make it through this door alive, I will find you.

302
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,320
Crazy woman.

303
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,800
Where did you go?

304
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,500
There was a woman who attacked us unexpectedly,
and dragged me off to hunt magical beasts.

305
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,800
I got away when she was not paying attention to me.

306
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,690
Who is this woman? How dare she

307
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,890
bully the disciples of our academy?

308
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,190
I don't know either.

309
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,990
Enough talking.

310
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,090
All of you will get one demerit each in your record.

311
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,800
Tomorrow, you are all not allowed to go into the mountain,
but do some introspection yourself.

312
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,400
Why are all of you still standing here?
Hurry. Go back to the camp.

313
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,700
Let's go.

314
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,900
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

315
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,200
Did that woman hurt you at all?

316
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,300
It's all because of you
meddling in other people's affairs.

317
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,700
Why did you blow that whistle?

318
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,400
Han Feng doesn't like us anyway.

319
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,300
Now see what we got?
One demerit each for our record.

320
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,500
And we can't go anywhere.

321
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,110
Keep writing. Ignore him.

322
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,600
Can I come in?

323
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,360
Come in. Come in!

324
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,500
What's the matter?

325
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,800
Can I talk to you in private?

326
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,900
What do you want to say, say it here.

327
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,500
It's about the life and death of both our families.

328
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,600
I'm not begging you.

329
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:42,200
I heard that during the daytime,
all of you fell down the cliff from here.

330
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,400
How was it? Did you get hurt?

331
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,500
Just say what's in your mind.

332
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,400
There's no need to beat around the bush.

333
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,200
What do you know about the Blood Sect?

334
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,700
I don't know much about it.
Why did you ask me this?

335
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,400
This is related to people's lives.

336
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,600
Even if you hate me, you have to tell me the truth.

337
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,900
I did meet face-to-face once with the people
from the Blood Sect. But that was it.

338
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,100
Then how did you get the Essence Flame?

339
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,800
When you fight with them,
did the Essence Flame curb their Fight Qi skills?

340
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,000
What do you mean by Essence Flame?

341
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,100
You released it while fighting Bai Shan.

342
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,600
Any knowledgeable audience
can recognize it as the Essence Flame.

343
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,540
What are you saying? I don't understand at all.

344
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,100
I received a long-distance letter from home.

345
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,400
Fan Rong of the Blood Sect
has entered the Fight Qi Continent.

346
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,820
He's going to attack the Five Great Clans.

347
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,600
My family is one of them.

348
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:43,500
I heard that the Essence Flame can restrain
their special fight technique. So I came to verify it.

349
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,600
I couldn't even beat you.

350
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,700
How could I have any Essence Flame?

351
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,200
Moreover, the Nalan Clan is rich
in different kinds of fight techniques.

352
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,000
Why must you be afraid of the Blood Sect?

353
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,300
Miss Nalan, you are putting too much importance on me.

354
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,700
If you still hate me,

355
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,000
just stab me with your sword.

356
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:11,400
My clan is facing a major problem. I have no other choice
but to be shameless and come here to beg you.

357
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,800
What's scary about the Blood Sect

358
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,300
is that they have the poisonous "gu" bug

359
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,400
in their blood.

360
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,200
Once you are poisoned by them,
the "gu" bug will enter your blood stream

361
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,600
and you will then become their puppet.

362
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:34,300
Only by using the Essence Flame to burn the whole body
will the parasite be completely removed.

363
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,600
That's all that I know.

364
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,510
Thanks.

365
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,000
Elder Han.

366
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,600
You're being such a stranger.

367
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,700
There are no outsiders here. Based on seniority,

368
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,700
you should call me Master Uncle, my eldest nephew.

369
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,500
Where did you hide the old man?

370
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,900
What old man?

371
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,500
It's bad to pretend to be muddled with me.

372
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,720
My master, Yao Chen.

373
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,300
I know that he's just around here.

374
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,600
Say it. Where did you hide him?

375
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:23,330
Do you think that if you don't tell me about it today,
you'll be able to leave here alive?

376
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,100
Quite gutsy. You want to fight, is that it?

377
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:48,100
If the two of us were to fight,
it'll be a fight within the same sect.

378
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,700
It's just the right time for me to see
how your martial arts skills are. Bring it on!

379
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,200
Flame-Splitting Wave-Devouring Ruler!

380
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,600
That move is the Star Picker Hand of the Star Fall Pavilion.

381
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,100
Didn't your mother teach you that?

382
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,000
What rotten toy is this?

383
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,600
It's not something from our Star Fall Pavilion, right?

384
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,400
Do it again.

385
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,600
Form two!
