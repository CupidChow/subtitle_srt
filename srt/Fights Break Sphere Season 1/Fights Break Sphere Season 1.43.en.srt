=Episode 43=

3
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,710
Medicine Elder,

4
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,040
that is not a prophecy.

5
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,760
- That is...
- What is it?

6
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,270
It was my memory.

7
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,290
It was my memory from growing up.

8
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:03,070
It was everything
that happened to me all these years.

9
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,810
It didn't mention any savior.

10
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,790
Isn't that you?

11
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,030
Medicine Elder,

12
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,930
I have confidence in myself.

13
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,590
I will become the strongest in this land.

14
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,270
But could it really be me...

15
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,050
who will save the people on this land?

16
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,780
Nobody was born a hero.

17
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,240
People write their own history.
God doesn't write it.

18
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,010
To be or not to be,
it's only a matter of choice.

19
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,810
I have been thinking all night
but still can't figure it out.

20
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,120
Is that so?

21
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,280
If what that roll said was true,

22
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,520
the prophecy is...

23
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,030
I will lead everyone in this land...

24
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,870
and seal Hun Miesheng.
Get rid of the darkness once and for all.

25
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,060
But how is that possible?

26
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,600
How could I lead everyone in this land?

27
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,340
How could I defeat Hun Miesheng?

28
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,610
If this prophecy isn't true,

29
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,580
how could my memory exist in that roll?

30
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:01,260
Do you think you're not capable enough
or are you not responsible enough?

31
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,220
It's simple if you think
you don't have enough skills.

32
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,040
You can train properly to improve
your Qi and skills in a short time.

33
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,650
That would be easy to do.

34
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,279
But, that doesn't mean...

35
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,159
you're the hero in the prophecy.

36
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,100
The Fight God was so strong.

37
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,350
He is no longer around.

38
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,210
What makes people miss him so much...

39
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,160
is not only the fact that he beat Hun Miesheng.

40
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,460
It's his mercy and kindness.

41
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,960
He sealed the darkness and divided the land.

42
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,810
He founded Jia Nan Academy
and left us so much heritage.

43
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,780
His kindness is still being spread
around in this world.

44
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,720
So,

45
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,160
what's strong doesn't necessary last long.

46
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,320
What's soft... will last forever.

47
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,430
What the hero cares about...

48
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,010
shouldn't be his own death or loss.

49
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:21,080
He should accept the fate that he will sacrifice...

50
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,990
himself for others anytime.

51
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,870
Ask yourself, are you ready?

52
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,860
But in this prophecy...

53
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,610
There's no prophecy.

54
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,280
No prophecy?

55
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,320
The darkness has come. Anything can happen.

56
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,370
Even though you are the hero in the prophecy,
you could become a traitor.

57
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,200
You could die young.

58
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,880
But as long as this prophecy doesn't come true,

59
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,150
it will be passed along in this world.

60
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,330
It's just there will be a different person.

61
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,690
One after another, generation after generation.

62
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,660
Until this prophecy comes true.

63
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,870
You mean...

64
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,530
this prophecy means it could be anyone?

65
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,050
So called prophecy...it just gives us faith.

66
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,700
The darkness will be gone
and a hero will come along eventually.

67
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:30,750
It gives us hope to live and keep fighting.

68
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,450
Who I am now...

69
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,930
is not ready.

70
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,710
Of course not.

71
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,430
To become that person in the prophecy,

72
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,000
you need to go through a lot of tests.

73
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,490
You can choose to not accept it
and no one will blame you.

74
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,030
Thank you for clearing my doubt.

75
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,350
If that day really comes,

76
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,820
I will be ready.

77
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,690
Oh right,

78
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,570
this is the Three Changes of Heavenly Fire.

79
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:22,080
The earth core python said Fight God used
these 3 attackes to defeat Hun Miesheng.

80
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,250
I left the pagoda so abruptly.

81
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,720
So I only learned very little.

82
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:37,500
The heritage from Fight God isn't that easy to learn.

83
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,520
You're about to go to the three year pact.

84
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,330
I hope you are fully ready.

85
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,070
We will face many enemies.

86
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,950
Yes.

87
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,430
Nalan family, Cloud Mist Sect,

88
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,530
and Star Fall Pavillion.

89
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:01,520
There are much more traitors than we imagined.

90
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,240
Three Changes of Heavenly Fire!

91
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,530
The secret of heaven and earth...

92
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,580
is to keep generating prosperity.

93
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,390
This first change...

94
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,300
is to live with fire and keep on.

95
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,780
The change of heaven and earth!

96
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,940
When the universe started, there was nothing.

97
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:01,100
Fire came from the sky and dominated the nature.

98
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,990
I will go with you.

99
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:41,040
The 3 year pact is my own thing.
You can't help me.

100
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,110
What if you lose?

101
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,190
I heard she got the skills passed along
from Nalan family and Cloud Mist Sect.

102
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,750
Brother Xiao Yan, I know...

103
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,970
you value this 3 year pact greatly.

104
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,180
I will not stop you from training.

105
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,980
But I'm scared.

106
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,500
I'm scared too.

107
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,780
As the day comes closer,
I get more scared.

108
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,860
This time I go to Cloud Mist Sect,
nobody knows what will happen.

109
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:32,470
Xun'er. Do you know?

110
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,130
Dad kicked me out of the family back then...

111
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,220
He was doing it to protect me.

112
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,420
He hoped that I could receive
Xiao family's heritage in safety.

113
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,630
Elder Tengshan wished I could stay in school,

114
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:51,160
focus on training and become the hero in this prophecy.

115
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,290
My friends including Lin Xiuya
hope I can bring them...

116
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,190
and fight the Soul Hall head-on.

117
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,800
Everyone was expecting something from me.

118
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,950
Everyone has things they want me to do.

119
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,420
Only this three year pact.

120
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,140
I want to do it out of my own will.

121
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:23,070
I want to do it for Xiao family and myself.

122
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:27,870
If this was a few years ago,
I would drill so many holes on her.

123
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,740
But since I became the Dragon Mother,

124
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,800
Brother Xiao Yan, when she did those things,
she was just a kid.

125
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,970
Since you two couldn't be together anyway,

126
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,350
why not just let go?

127
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,180
I can let go some people.

128
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:57,770
But some things... I can't forget.

129
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,520
This is the other scroll of the Three Thousand
Thunder Movement that Dragon Mother gave me.

130
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:14,850
Brother Xiao Yan,
I can't help you in any other way.

131
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:22,560
I just hope you would be safe
this time you go to Cloud Mist Sect.

132
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,380
Before I leave, let's take a trip home first.

133
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,720
Ok.

134
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,660
Let's go back together.

135
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,740
What's wrong, Senior?

136
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,000
You, you...

137
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,990
What's going on with you?

138
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,120
You have made it!

139
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,580
Go!

140
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,240
My skills are not enough.

141
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,690
This Black Dragon Blade...

142
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,330
should be controlled by mind.

143
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,520
It can kill a person from thousands of miles away.

144
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,780
Such a treasure.
No wonder they are all after it.

145
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,380
That makes sense.

146
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,340
What makes sense?

147
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,150
The Sect Leader suspected I stole the blade.

148
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,960
I explained myself for a long time.

149
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,160
When I left,
I saw he left the roll on the floor.

150
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,710
He knows whoever stole the blade...

151
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,430
will try everything to get that roll.

152
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:17,560
Tell me, what is he trying to do?

153
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,090
What does that mean?

154
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,280
This Black Dragon Blade needs to be nurtured with blood.

155
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,540
Once it's nurtured enough it will go on forever.

156
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,780
It will become greedy to the master's blood.

157
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,180
Once blood sucking stops, it will bite back.

158
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,830
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

159
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,390
I already told you. You wouldn't listen to me.

160
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:04,230
You...You have become half human half ghost.

161
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,859
Since I became the leader of the Nalan family,

162
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:11,709
I have become half human half ghost.

163
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:16,119
Grandpa said, if thousands of
coffins come out of the door,

164
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,219
then the family will be prosper.

165
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,030
Before he died, he asked me to swear...

166
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,199
not to let Nalan family die.

167
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,270
Even if that means I have to die.

168
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,420
All of my emotions...

169
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,910
But he died.

170
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:41,360
Thousands of people in Nalan family are still alive.

171
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:48,130
They stand on my shoulder day and night, judging me.

172
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,530
If Nalan family really dies in my hands,

173
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,250
I can't even imagine.

174
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,360
Senior, you need to help me!

175
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,310
You have trained such evil skills.

176
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,000
You're no weaker than the Sect Leader.

177
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,350
I can't help you.

178
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,200
When I become the Sect Leader,

179
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,410
Nalan family will devour Cloud Mist Sect.

180
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:46,400
And Xiao Yan. I will not let him win.

181
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,950
Brother Xiao Yan.

182
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,370
Blood?

183
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,410
This was cut open by sword.

184
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,720
There's no one good at swords in Xiao family.

185
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,970
Anyone here?

186
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,840
Anyone here?

187
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,950
Anyone?

188
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,830
Anyone?

189
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,360
Anyone?

190
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,940
No one is here. Father is not here either.

191
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:36,180
This wine is made by father. When it happened,

192
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,890
he hadn't finished his wine.

193
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,950
Xiao family is one of the 5 big families.

194
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,880
It's got hundreds of people and many Fight Spirits.

195
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,190
Soul Hall can't take them all and kill them.

196
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,600
It's not Soul Hall.

197
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,820
This is not their style.

198
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,620
Who is it then?

199
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,290
No one is there.

200
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,570
Young Master Xiao, you're back.

201
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,090
Tell me,

202
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,320
what happened to Xiao family?
Who did this?

203
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,790
We went far away and came back to this.

204
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:19,800
No one is here. What's going on?

205
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,100
Two months ago, a group of people came.

206
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,670
They warned people on the streets not to go outside.

207
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:31,810
They look so evil.
We were scared so we closed our doors.

208
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,760
After a few days when we stepped out again,
Xiao family was gone.

209
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,100
What do they look like?

210
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,890
They were all dressed in white.
One of them is called Cloud Covering Hand.

211
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:46,020
It was said they killed Xiao family
and took away the Clan Leader Xiao.

212
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,700
Cloud Covering Hand is one of
the 13 masters in Cloud Mist Sect.

213
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,130
These 13 masters are independent.

214
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,430
They never take orders from each other.

215
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:56,280
Now they're interfering with Xiao family's affairs.

216
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,060
Looks like they have been infuriated by Soul Hall.

217
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:05,050
Cloud Mist Sect.

218
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,690
I will kill all of you.

219
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,670
Soul Hall has been more and more active.

220
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:16,410
Now they're showing their dominance with Xiao family.

221
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:21,270
Anyone who doesn't obey will end up like Xiao family.

222
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,650
It's not only showing dominance.

223
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:32,060
So many people died in the internal dispute in Gu clan.

224
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,300
They were only after that piece of ancient jade.

225
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:41,120
Now they killed everyone in my family...

226
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,860
for the same purpose, I suppose.

227
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,930
That's right.
So now the most urgent thing is not revenge.

228
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:00,600
You need to find your father
and ask him where the jade is.

229
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:07,380
What is that jade anyway?

230
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,220
Back then the Fight God led the 5 families
and defeated the Soul Hall.

231
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,890
After that, Fight God was dead.

232
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,550
5 families buried their skills,

233
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,510
and their treasures with Fight God.

234
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:27,630
The jade is the key
that opens the Fight God's grave.

235
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,450
Fight God asked to divide the jade into 5 pieces.

236
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,250
The leaders of 5 families had one each.

237
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,900
Why?

238
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,040
Because Fight God had mercy.

239
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,790
When he defeated the Hun Miesheng, he didn't kill him.
Just sealed him.

240
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:46,530
He was worried that one day
Hun Miesheng will break loose.

241
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,530
So he created a curse.

242
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:53,120
If 5 families can't resist,
they can reunite the 5 pieces of jade,

243
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,760
and therefore open the grave of the Fight God.

244
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,010
So that the most talented person can train inside of it,
and become the new leader.

245
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,880
It's been a thousand years again.

246
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,090
The 5 families never stopped fighting.

247
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,130
To be honest,

248
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:15,040
they still want to have the 5 pieces of jade
and become the supreme leader of the world.

249
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:23,260
The supreme leader.
Does it worth so many deaths?

250
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,770
Why didn't my father tell me that earlier?

251
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:36,170
Maybe one day you really become the leader,
he will tell you all the secrets then.

252
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,530
Don't you worry though.

253
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,980
The Soul Hall won't do anything to your father yet.

254
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,730
What does that mean?

255
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,520
Your father was so cautious.
He didn't even tell you.

256
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,430
Of course he won't let Hun Miesheng have
any clues of the whereabouts of the jade.

257
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,890
So, he will only be imprisoned for a long time.

258
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:57,140
Soul Hall will look forward to the day he gives up.

259
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,440
Imprisonment?

260
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,160
Would that be the altar?

261
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,990
I will only use this once.

262
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,260
I don't care how many times you use it.

263
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,680
I was worried...

264
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,410
once you go in, you won't be able to get out.

265
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,140
Your Fight Qi has improved a lot.

266
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,800
But it's not good enough to challenge him.

267
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,930
Medicine Elder,

268
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,660
I will give the ring to Xun'er.

269
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,820
Silly boy, are you getting bold?

270
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,830
You want to leave me behind on your adventure?
I'll go with you.

271
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:46,570
Brother Xiao Yan. Eat some more.

272
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,860
I will go find father.

273
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,980
What? Where would you go?

274
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,810
I will go find out now. Protect me.

275
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,270
You...

276
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:25,780
Xun'er. No matter what happens later,

277
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,640
leave me alone.

278
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,760
If anything happens...

279
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,740
What's going to happen?
I am coming with you.

280
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,610
You can't go.

281
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,430
If my face changes color,
or if I don't come back in two hours,

282
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,260
kill me.

283
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,450
Why?

284
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:55,190
Promise me. Do it.

285
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,290
Father!

286
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,310
Father!

287
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:40,330
[Xiao Zhan]

288
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:27,010
We can't go on like this.
Their organs have been blocked by evil tricks.

289
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:29,980
I will awaken them with Fight Qi.

290
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,150
Father!

291
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,580
Father, wake up! Father!

292
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,590
Go back!

293
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,170
Ta Ge'er!

294
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,730
Father!

295
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,170
Go back!

296
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,110
Xiao Yan, let's go!

297
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,160
I can't go.

298
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:19,030
Little guy, we meet again.

299
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,440
You locked so many heroes here...

300
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,820
for what?

301
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:28,950
These metal chains are my bones.

302
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:32,390
They have been sealed
by the Fight God for thousands of years.

303
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:37,230
I will use these people's rage, fear and hatred...

304
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,260
to melt the ice.

305
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,820
Fight God is dead.

306
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,040
What else do you want?

307
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,630
There's something that belongs to me in his grave.

308
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:52,160
I have to get it back.
Leave your family's jade.

309
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,520
The jade is the mascot to guard the Fight God.

310
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,880
I will die before I give it to you!

311
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,890
The 5 families are like ants to me.
You're different.

312
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:07,980
I once chose you and gave you my weapon.

313
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,610
I taught you my skills.

314
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:14,760
Even though it's the entire continent,

315
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,750
I can let you run it if you like.

316
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,230
But what did you do?

317
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,920
Maybe I should consider someone else.

318
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:47,350
Go deeper into the ship.
Don't get caught by the red fog.

319
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,970
Fan Lao!

320
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:19,050
You... your Fight Qi.

321
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,220
Don't forget...

322
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,360
this is our Soul Hall's altar.

323
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:30,320
Boy, I will show you what it's like
to have buring sword in your body!

324
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:46,580
What, you were defeated just like that?

325
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:06,970
Angry Buddha and Firey Lotus.
You're getting it.

326
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,070
Medicine Elder.

327
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,500
I don't have more skills.
I can only go this far.

328
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:28,440
Once I throw out this lotus,

329
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,250
what will happen to us?

330
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:34,140
You will lose your body and soul and become ashes.

331
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,820
Do you regret it?

332
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,290
Regret?

333
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:42,510
I just have some regrets.

334
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,980
I'm afraid I can't make it to
the three year pact after all.

335
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:51,670
The person in that prophecy
doesn't seem to be me either.

336
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,430
It's good to be flying dust.

337
00:39:55,430 --> 00:40:00,790
Medicine Elder, I owe you a title.

338
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:05,490
Even though you never called me teacher,

339
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:13,660
Xiao Yan, you are the best student I've ever had.

340
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,440
Teacher, thank you
for supporting me for so long.

341
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:46,710
This boy is so stubborn!

342
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,030
♫ If you want change, battle it out with no fear of chaos ♫

343
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,790
♫ The sky is dark, there’s misery on earth,
the people are living in a terrible state ♫

344
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,620
♫ Constant hatred and bitter attachment become evident ♫

347
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,960
♫ To fulfill my promise,
I conceal an arrow inside my gold-threaded sleeve ♫

348
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,780
♫ Being mesmerized for a moment
by the purgatory and the lava ♫

349
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:17,760
♫ Jumping in with a leap with
neither grace nor resentment ♫

350
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,490
♫ Young but bothered by undiminishing worries ♫

351
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:26,110
♫ Worries adding on to worries,
the mountain calls and the sea roars ♫

352
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,900
♫ Rushing headlong even if
heaven is narrow and earth is small ♫

353
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,690
♫ Chaos in fighting the evil and foreign forces ♫

354

♫ Disturbances that no one can escape from ♫

361
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,230
