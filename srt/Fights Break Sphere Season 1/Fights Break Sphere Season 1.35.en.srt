3
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,920
The Fight Technique Pavillion is filled with the essence of the
Fight Techniques of the Xiao family. It's off limits for others.

4
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,180
I will teach you anything if you want to learn.

5
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,330
I have to get rid of your Star Fall Pavillion
Fight Techniques first.

6
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,620
So you can focus on your own family's Fight Techniques only.

7
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,930
Don't. I won't use them again.

8
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,170
Don't practice other useless Fight Techniques anymore.

9
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,550
I will show you the real Angry Lions.

10
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,250
Have you had a good look at it?

11
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,850
No.

12
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,120
You can't even learn something so simple?

13
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,120
You can't just do it yourself and not teach me.

14
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,780
You need to tell me the gist of it.

15
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,060
The lion was made out of the Frozen Fight Qi.

16
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,280
When you release your qi,

17
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,360
do it nice and slow.

18
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,900
The shape of the lion is the essence of the qi.
It needs to be consistent.

19
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,480
If you just use force,
it's not going to work.

20
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,270
Yes. I will read the books first.

21
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,380
Xun'er, why are you here?

22
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,180
Father, we are losing the port.
You go back and I'll take care of the rest!

23
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,500
Nonsense! Go back!

24
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,000
Protect the General and let him go first!

25
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,620
Yes!

26
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,520
Xun'er! I can't leave you!

27
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,150
Father, you weren't being careful today;
negotiating with them alone.

28
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,570
I was not being careful.

29
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,740
Xun'er, I have to thank you today.

30
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,450
If it weren't for you, I would...

31
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:12,250
But seeing that your Fight Qi was so good,
I am pleased.

32
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,570
Father, keep being happy for a while.
Grandfather wants to see me.

33
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,300
Wait.

34
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,980
You came to my rescue today.
They all saw it.

35
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,180
Now they want to see you.

36
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,410
They probably want to talk to you again
about becoming the Dragon Mother.

37
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,180
I have already said it.
If Dragon Mother disappeared, go find her.

38
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,470
We can't just replace the Dragon Mother
because the three other islands are attacking us.

39
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,470
You go get me a cane. I will go with you.

40
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,200
Father, don't force yourself.

41
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,490
Let's go together.

42
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,310
Father, Xun'er really opened up my eyes today.

43
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,350
I didn't expect her to have
such a strong Fight Qi at her age.

44
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,280
You must be so happy for her.

45
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,830
Yes.

46
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,140
Father.

47
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,730
You are hurt. Don't be courteous. Sit.

48
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:25,090
Everyone sit. Xun'er, come here.
Let Grandfather take a look at you.

49
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,610
Grandfather, Uncles, Generals.

50
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,990
Fine, fine.

51
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:36,030
Just now, your brothers, Tianwei and Tianyi,
said they were going to pick you up.

52
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,530
Come, sit.

53
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,720
Xun'er made significant progress.

54
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,580
Here, let's make a toast.

55
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,830
For Xun'er.

56
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,970
Thank you, Grandfather, for your praise.

57
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,630
When I was little, I thought Auntie
was the most beautiful person in the world.

58
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,500
Now that Xun'er grew up, she is no less.

59
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:10,140
You said Big Sister was the most favored
by Dragon Mother.

60
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:15,530
It's a shame she died for the Xiao family.

61
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,520
Xun'er, don't be like your aunt.

62
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,220
Don't truly become a Xiao
even if you've lived there for too long.

63
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,520
I heard there's a lad named Xiao Yan.

64
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,630
He doesn't respect his teachers and family members.
He even burned down their Fight Technique Pavillion.

65
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,400
Is he some sort of monster?

66
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,390
Fourth Uncle,
do you believe all the rumors you hear?

67
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,060
Brother Xiao Yan isn't like that.

68
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,930
Why would you care what he is like?

69
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:51,280
He has nothing to do with me.

70
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,560
When everything is peaceful, I need to get drunk
when Tianyi and Xun'er get married.

71
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:03,290
Grandfather, Tianwei is talking nonsense again.
Aren't you going to discipline him?

72
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,350
They are just happy to see you.

73
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,890
Listen, my granddaughter can pick whoever she likes.

74
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,000
You boys can not interfere.

75
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,990
Report!

76
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,660
The enemy is attacking! Danger at the East Gate!

77
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,570
It's the South Dragon Master to the east.

78
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,330
Even the softies are bullying us now.

79
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,660
Father, I will go check it out.

80
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,970
Father!

81
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,390
Grandfather.

82
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,310
Even though the four islands have a Dragon King,

83
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,850
Dragon Mother is the most respected one.

84
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,300
This Dragon Mother is 200 years old.

85
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,230
She was just fine living on the East Dragon Island.

86
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,000
How could she just disappear like this?

87
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,210
We can't be excused from the blame.

88
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,440
Father, stop worrying about it.

89
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,670
You have said this a thousand times.

90
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:26,950
Among the women of her age on the four islands,
Xun'er is the most talented.

91
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,030
She's qualified for the position of Dragon Mother.

92
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,320
I am thinking if Xun'er agrees,

93
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,920
we will go talk to the masters
of the other three islands

94
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,500
and make Xun'er the new Dragon Mother.

95
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,930
Grandfather, the Gu family
are the descendants of the Magic Dragon.

96
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:49,510
The Dragon Mother in every generation
is appointed by the previous one.

97
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:55,140
Then she performs with the Subdue Heaven Bow passed
down through generations, so the four islands will obey.

98
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,840
I wasn't appointed.
I don't have the Subdue Heaven Bow either.

99
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,240
Even if you talk to the other three islands,
they won't agree.

100
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,290
Everyone should know clearly...

101
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,020
that looking for the Dragon Mother was just an excuse

102
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,050
for the other three islands to invade us.

103
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:17,960
I don't understand why,
when facing such a dangerous enemy,

104
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,480
our lovely Xun'er doesn't even look scared.

105
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,090
You don't seem to even care.

106
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:30,360
Fourth Uncle, I can't accept this praise.

107
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,480
Father, in my opinion,
someone else should go and negotiate.

108
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,380
Third Brother has been gone for so long.

109
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,350
I don't see any positive results.

110
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,240
Fourth Uncle, it is the three islands
that are being unreasonable.

111
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,040
They wanted to take my father hostage
since he went alone. If I...

112
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,330
If you didn't save your father with our soldiers,

113
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:57,280
do you think you and your father
would have a chance to talk to us now?

114
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,890
But I haven't seen any soldiers sent by the city.

115
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,160
Sister Xun'er, don't be so angry.

116
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,250
Do you know that it was Grandfather
who told us not to open the city gate?

117
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,970
What are you talking about?

118
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:13,490
If Xun'er and the Third didn't come back,
I wouldn't have known they were trying to kill us.

119
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,980
Even if I had to go out myself, I needed to save them.

120
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,770
Father, we don't have what it takes to defeat them.

121
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:27,670
Even if we want to surrender, if we have no soldiers,
they probably wouldn't even want us.

122
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,520
Fourth, what are you talking about?

123
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,880
So impressive, my brother!

124
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,530
You should lead the soldiers and go out now.

125
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:39,150
Prove to everyone that you're the legendary hero, all right?

126
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,220
Go! Go!

127
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,810
I am full, Grandfather. Second and Fourth Uncles,

128
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,840
you may carry on. I will go check on my father.

129
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,850
They have retreated.

130
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,800
Why are you out here?

131
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,650
I am full.

132
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,880
Xun'er, if East Dragon Island can't hold on,

133
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,760
you should go back to the Xiao family.

134
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,780
I won't go. Are you trying to abandon me again?

135
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,020
I don't believe they will actually break through

136
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,330
and kill Grandfather or us.

137
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:01,930
We share the same ancestors. If the Dragon Mother
comes back someday, how would they tell her?

138
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,270
Stupid child, if they dare to attack us
like this without any concern,

139
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,730
do you think the Dragon Mother is able to come back?

140
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,970
You mean...

141
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,530
Dragon Mother is already dead?

142
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,940
That's impossible!

143
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,320
Dragon Mother is the best at Fight Techniques.
No one is able to harm her.

144
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,730
I have been thinking...

145
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,590
it wasn't a coincidence
that Dragon Mother disappeared.

146
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,930
There are not many people
that can take her away in this world.

147
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,990
Not many people can even be sure
that she won't come back either.

148
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,440
Those three Island Masters don't have the guts.

149
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,590
There must be someone else behind them.

150
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,220
Did you get any news?

151
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,820
A few years ago I put spies
on those three islands.

152
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,560
After Dragon Mother's disappearance,
the spies had some information.

153
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,470
What did they send?

154
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:10,860
They said the three masters had formed
a command post on their own.

155
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:16,830
But they got their military
and political orders from another place.

156
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,660
Nobody knows who lives in that room.

157
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,520
Whoever can make the three masters obey their order...

158
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,660
can only be the Dragon Mother, right?

159
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,560
I thought so, too.

160
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:35,160
But the spies said whoever was in that room
moves like black smoke.

161
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,710
That he has red eyes.

162
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,720
Blood Sect, Fan Lao?

163
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,550
You have met Fan Lao?

164
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,550
Kind of.

165
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,560
Xiao Yan knows him well.

166
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:14,960
[Heaven]

167
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,920
♫ From sprouting one leaf ♫

168
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,890
♫ To covering the whole blue sky ♫

169
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,130
♫ One region of the world is in my heart ♫

170
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,740
♫ Even as things change with the passage of time ♫

171
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,620
♫ From dreaming of growing wings ♫

172
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,510
♫ To flying high and having difficulty
in hiding my talent ♫

173
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,980
♫ In the long and arduous journey, no matter
what was in my way, I resisted the winds ♫

174
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,240
♫ The youth I once had was not in vain ♫

175
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,760
♫ I want, I want to experience
trials and tribulations ♫

176
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,750
♫ I want, I want to forge ahead courageously ♫

177
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,330
♫ I want, I want the mountain in my sight ♫

178
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,010
♫ I want, I want never to
have any higher plains to climb ♫

179
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,280
♫ any higher plains to climb ♫

180
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,120
What's the skill where you rolled up your sleeves?

181
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,150
The Thirteen Step Flowing Cloud of the Xiao family.

182
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,960
Do you want to learn?

183
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,640
Wait, I will go read the books again.

184
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,900
Ancestor, what are you doing?

185
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,350
I am making you a bed.

186
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,930
Let me help you.

187
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,130
No need.

188
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:16,720
You don't have to do this.
I can sleep on the floor.

189
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,660
When you have to sleep for sixty years,
the floor can get really damp.

190
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,660
It's bad for your body.

191
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,030
Sixty years?

192
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,130
Yes.

193
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,900
We had a deal.

194
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,920
If you can't defeat me,
you have to stay here with me.

195
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:43,260
Looking at you, I don't think you can get out.

196
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,770
When it's time, I will give you a pill.

197
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:49,060
Sixty years later we'll wake up together

198
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,280
and continue practicing.

199
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,460
When you can defeat me, you can get out.

200
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,490
Are you being serious?

201
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,620
Of course, I am.

202
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,510
Go look over there
and see how many days it's been.

203
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,090
Fifteen days already.

204
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,050
It's been fifteen days.

205
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,500
I can't do this.
You have practiced almost a thousand years.

206
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,330
I am not even twenty years old.
You're bullying a kid.

207
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,370
Son, your father was right.

208
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,980
You have good talent.

209
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:38,120
But asking you to beat me in thirty days is too much.

210
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,860
So, we won't be in a rush. All right?

211
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,430
You stay here with me for sixty years.

212
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,110
Then you can probably defeat me.

213
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,870
This bed is almost ready.
Do you want to try it?

214
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,060
I can't do that.

215
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,520
I can't stay here with you.

216
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,390
I have so much to do.
The Xiao family is in danger.

217
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,440
I have to get out.

218
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,080
How dangerous? Tell me.

219
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,000
It's said that Hun Miesheng has broken the seal
and is about to invade the Fight Qi Continent.

220
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:15,120
As one of the Five Great Clans,
the Xiao family should be on the front line.

221
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:22,030
If I sleep for sixty years,
the Xiao family probably won't exist anymore by then.

222
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,510
So what if it's gone?

223
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:31,200
You're still here. If you're here,
the Xiao family is also here.

224
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,550
No! What about my family and my friends?

225
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,470
I have to get out. Don't try to stop me.

226
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,070
With the way you look now,

227
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,900
even if you got out,

228
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,300
could you save them?

229
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,600
Son, only when you reach my age,

230
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,820
will you understand...

231
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,310
that life is just the blink of an eye.

232
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,880
Families' rise and fall...

233
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,490
are just like a few waves in the sea.

234
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:06,780
Do you know what the ocean is?

235
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:11,260
It's your Fight Techniques.

236
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,690
If you learned all the Fight Techniques
in this pavillion

237
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,240
and become a Fight Saint
or a Fight King,

238
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,410
you will be number one in this world.

239
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:28,800
At that time, you can make any family you want rise

240
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,580
and any family you hate fall.

241
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,290
Won't that be much easier than it is now?

242
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:40,210
Young man, you need to think far ahead.

243
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,820
You want me to be number one in the world?

244
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,680
You're still young.
You need to take over my position.

245
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,240
Spread the Fight Techniques...

246
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,950
of the Xiao family.

247
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,010
The three flowers gather around your head
and five hearts face the sky.

248
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:10,540
Your Fight Qi comes from your stomach
and travels through the back and spine.

249
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,630
Going up to your brain and through

250
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:18,500
your throat, lungs,
and then back to your stomach again.

251
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,600
Sleep well.

252
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,510
Sister Xun'er.

253
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,040
Who is it?

254
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,110
I knew you didn't eat enough just now.

255
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,770
I told the kitchen to make you another meal.

256
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,300
I am not hungry. I am going to sleep.

257
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,890
We were yelled at by Grandfather just now.

258
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:58,450
He said we shouldn't mention the marriage thing
right when you just returned.

259
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,150
See, Tianwei and I came here to apologize.

260
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,640
If you don't accept our apology,
we won't leave!

261
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,170
I forgive you. Drop the meal and go.

262
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,720
Come in.

263
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,170
I watched the kitchen
when they made this deep-fried pork.

264
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,150
It was very delicate. Taste it.

265
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,760
It's too greasy. I don't want it.

266
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,890
I promise if you take the first bite,

267
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:38,140
you will absolutely want the second bite.

268
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,380
Here.

269
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,600
How does it taste?

270
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,270
It's fine.

271
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:57,200
Try to see if you can start your Fight Qi again?

272
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,020
Grandfather asked you to poison me?

273
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,550
He promised me...

274
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:26,420
when the city gets invaded,
I will be the East Dragon Island Master.

275
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,160
Why are you so ungrateful?

276
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,530
Treating my heart as dirt all this time.

277
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,000
All you talk about is that Brother Xiao Yan.

278
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,730
Who promised you the marriage?

279
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,220
I thought we need to obey the Dragon Mother's orders.

280
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,350
It's someone who's stronger than the Dragon Mother.

281
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,130
Soul Hall?

282
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:56,000
When you become mine, I might tell you.

283
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,630
I will tell you, too.

284
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,490
Our sister Xun'er is so pretty.

285
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:16,350
What "our sister?"

286
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,410
That's my Xun'er. Get out!

287
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,660
Would the Dragon Mother return?

288
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,320
The Third Uncle keeps talking about looking for her.

289
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:47,110
My heart trembles.

290
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,370
Xun'er will be mine after tonight.

291
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:55,230
This is the only heir of Dragon Mother.

292
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:59,110
I am her husband. Even if Dragon Mother returns,

293
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:02,090
I will still be the Master of East Dragon Island.

294
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,280
Also, the person who promised us...

295
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,050
is capable of everything.

296
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:12,160
If it weren't for him,
Dragon Mother wouldn't have been gone for so long.

297
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,000
Pleased to meet you, Dragon Master.

298
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Cut the courtesy.
When I become the Master,

299
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I will give you Third Uncle's position
and you'll be the Master General.

300
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,030
You didn't finish what you were saying before.

301
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,490
Who promised you? So impressive.

302
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,880
I wanted to hear more.

303
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,570
Why isn't the medicine working?

304
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:37,230
You thought I did nothing
in the Xiao family or Jia Nan Academy?

305
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,890
Xiao family is a medicine family.

306
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,520
I attended the Alchemist Competition of Yin City.

307
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,970
Some small pellets can't knock me over.

308
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,380
You two are my older brothers.

309
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,450
How could you see me in such a disgusting way?

310
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,740
I will show you...

311
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,650
what my true Fight Techniques look like.

312
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,600
My life pearl!

313
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Tell me where the Dragon Mother is.

314
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,090
Dragon Mother is in Thunder and Lightning Valley.

315
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,690
Where is Thunder and Lightning Valley?

316
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,740
A deserted valley outside of the four main islands.

317
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,740
There's thunder year round
and it's a forbidden land to the Gu family.

318
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,380
Why is she there? Did that person take her there?

319
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,110
I can't say or I'll die.

320
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:32,560
If you don't say it now, you'll die anyway.

321
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,820
He's the envoy from Soul Hall.

322
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,080
We met him when we went outside.

323
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,820
Is it Fan Lao?

324
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,530
How do you know?

325
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,340
All right. I won't tell Grandfather

326
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,120
what happened here today.

327
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,100
But what you did to me,
I will never forgive you.

328
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,690
Let us go! Let us go!

329
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,890
Let us go!

330
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,570
(Map of Dragon Islands)

331
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:10,300
Look. That's Thunder and Lightning Valley.

332
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,740
It's about a day's journey away from us.

333
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,240
The edge of the valley is all swamps and forest.

334
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,300
Then there's the thunder area.

335
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,590
You can only reach the hinterland
after you pass the thunder area.

336
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:31,660
But the thunder never stops rumbling there.

337
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,650
It's very dangerous.

338
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,440
Are there any enemies?

339
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,110
No. Even if there were,

340
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,210
they're not the most dangerous ones.

341
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,600
Our Gu family are descendants of the Magic Dragon.

342
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,180
What are dragons most afraid of?

343
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,250
- Thunder.
- That's right, thunder.

344
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,600
This valley is the forbidden land of our family

345
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,270
because it's full of thunder.

346
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:59,130
There's also fog and swamps.

347
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,870
You can get in, but it's not easy to get out.

348
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,010
I will have to try.

349
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,180
Xun'er, how do you know Dragon Mother
is on Thunder and Lightning Valley?

350
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,020
I believe the information is reliable.

351
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,560
After I'm gone, you need to be careful
about Second and Fourth Uncles.

352
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:29,320
I always feel they're somehow connected.

353
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,580
You want to go to
Thunder and Lightning Valley alone?

354
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,760
No. I will go with you.

355
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,230
We will bring a few expert soldiers.

356
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,440
Father, how could Dragon Mother

357
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,690
disappear like that?

358
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,240
There must be spies inside East Dragon Island.

359
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,610
If you're gone, what should we do
if the other three islands attack us?

360
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:59,310
We have nowhere to go, anyway.

361
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:04,250
If I can really find Dragon Mother,
we can turn the situation around.

362
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,000
What if you can't come back?

363
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,250
If the city gets invaded, you and I,

364
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,770
all the people of East Dragon Island,

365
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,650
will all die.

366
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,350
Father,

367
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:32,230
trust me for once.
I will bring back the Dragon Mother.

368
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,260
Xun'er, be careful.

369
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:47,250
I will defend this city and wait for you.

370
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,540
Yes.

371
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,440
Your Fight Qi has progressed a lot.

372
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,140
My ancestor keeps telling me
I need to be the best in the world.

373
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,600
What should I do?

374
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,490
Your ancestor is basically half a Fight Saint.

375
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,260
He was just one step away.

376
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,760
Fifteen more days to go.
How can I defeat him?

377
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:31,180
Based on how your practice is out there,
I'd say very unlikely.

378
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:38,960
You always mock me.
Will you be happy if I can't get out?

379
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:45,070
You should be happy though.
You'll get to sleep for sixty years.

380
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,350
When you wake up, you will get it all back.

381
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:55,230
I can wait, but can Soul Hall wait?

382
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:58,540
Don't forget my Star Fall Pavilion is in Han Feng's hands.
How can I rest assured?

383
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:02,990
Your family is in danger,
but there's a greater danger in this world.

384
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:09,380
Sixty years. When we have no enemies,
we go out together and take a look at the world.

385
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,900
Whoa, it's Hun Miesheng's world now!
That will be exciting!

386
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,670
I know. I know it's dangerous out there.

387
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:19,150
I want to go out, too, but...

388
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:28,070
Medicine Elder, let's try again.

389
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,920
Try planting your Fight Qi inside me again.

390
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:38,210
It doesn't help if we combine our Qi together.
He's no Fan Lao or Yun Shan.

391
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,340
What should we do then?
I'm already trying my best.

392
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:50,190
I have been practicing it in my dreams,
but I can't beat him.

393
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,190
Such a child.

394
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,110
Xun'er's life pearl is broken!

395
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,720
Let me see.

396
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:34,250
Gu family members are descendants of Magic Dragon,
their life pearls won't break because of outside forces.

397
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:38,150
This means the owner of the pearl is in danger.

398
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,960
You're saying...

399
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,730
Xun'er.

400
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,390
Xun'er.

401
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,080
Brother Xiao Yan, the antidote you gave me

402
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,200
really worked here.

403
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:46,790
Father! Father!

404
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,620
Xun'er. Xun'er.

405
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,730
We don't want you to go
but this is Dragon Mother's order.

406
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:57,010
I don't want to go to the Xiao family!

407
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:00,010
Xun'er, be good.

408
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,920
I will come to see you every year, all right?

409
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,620
Do you promise?

410
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,180
I promise.

411
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,200
Father!

412
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,670
Your Aunt has a son named Xiao Yan.
You need to be good friends with him.

413
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,570
Let's go.

414
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,480
Father!

415
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,470
Father! Take me home. I don't want to be here!

416
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,120
I don't want to stay here!

417
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,380
Stop following me!

418
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:55,190
Leaving you in the Xiao family will make it easier for
our family to build a relationship with them. Go back!

419
00:37:55,190 --> 00:38:00,290
Father! I don't want to stay here.
I want to go back with you!

420
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:04,560
From today on, your name is Xiao Xun'er.

421
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,380
Father!

422
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,700
Father!

423
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,960
Father!

424
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,360
Father!

425
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,550
This is all an illusion.
I can't get confused by it.

426
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,050
Who are you?

427
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,860
I am the envoy of Hun Miesheng.

428
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,550
I am keeping an eye on Dragon Mother for him here.

429
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,190
Dragon Mother is here!

430
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,420
Brother Xiao Yan!

431
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,000
You have been lying to me.

432
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:26,410
You pretended to come to our family
and became my sister.

433
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:31,030
Brother Xiao Yan! I didn't lie to you!
I am true to you!

434
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:36,120
No, it's not like that.
You've been lying to me!

435
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:40,420
Brother Xiao Yan, I didn't lie to you.

436
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,950
I know it all. You're a thief.

437
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,920
You came to steal from us.

438
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:53,170
From now on, we don't know each other. Go!

439
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:59,040
Brother Xiao Yan!

440
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,170
Brother Xiao Yan!

441
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,000
Brother Xiao Yan!

442
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,820
Brother Xiao Yan!

443
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:20,250
Your Brother Xiao Yan has abandoned you.

444
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,830
Follow me.

445
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:25,040
This isn't real. It's all an illusion.

446
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,590
Brother Xiao Yan is not here.

447
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:33,110
Your Brother Xiao Yan has been locked
in the sacrificial altar by me.

448
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,280
You should join him.

449
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,990
Continue dreaming!

450
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:01,570
The Dragon Mother is in this valley, right?

451
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,530
So what?

452
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:06,310
You will die if you run over there.
