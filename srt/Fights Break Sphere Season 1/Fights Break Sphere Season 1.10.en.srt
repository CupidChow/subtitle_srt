3
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,050
Some things are just your own

4
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,970
and has nothing to do with the rest of the world.

5
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,350
Can't you just wait some more?

6
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,150
I want to wait too.

7
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,070
But this world won't wait for me.

8
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,030
The people who forced my mother to death won't.

9
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,370
The people who forced my father
to self-destroy his Fight Qi won't.

10
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,650
Those people who are doing all means
to frame me won't too.

11
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,860
The Blood Sect. The Soul Hall.

12
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:22,900
All of the evil people in this world,

13
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,230
none of them will wait for me.

14
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,510
I don't have time anymore.

15
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,830
If I stop merely because of Bai Shan,

16
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,480
how will I protect you guys in the future?

17
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,490
- Maybe...”
- Maybe the evil people will become good?

18
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,520
In my world,

19
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,430
in this realistic world,

20
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,640
evil people will only become more and more evil.

21
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,300
And the only way to extinguish them
is to become stronger than them.

22
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,930
Let them disappear completely.

23
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,710
Everyone, quiet down.
We are having a meeting today.

24
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,960
As everyone knows, our Sect Leader Xiao
is challenging Bai Shan.

25
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,710
How to say it? The courage is commendable.

26
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,070
Aren't you saying that I am getting overconfident?

27
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,460
Okay already. Let's lay all our cards out.

28
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,620
Everybody is worried.

29
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,530
What to do if Sect Leader Xiao loses?

30
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,710
In the future, when people come to bully us

31
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:09,630
and steal our storefront,
we won't even have someone to show his face.

32
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,670
Xiao Yan is our sect leader.
He should listen to his helpers' opinions.

33
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,840
Now, with a show of hands,

34
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,350
those who support the Sect Leader to fight Bai Shan,

35
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,640
I want to see how many people support this.

36
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,440
Those who do not support the Sect Leader
to fight Bai Shan, raise your hands.

37
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,120
Xiao Yan, look at it. Look at it.

38
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,120
Just don't go.

39
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,340
How about this? You nod.

40
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,280
Everything else, leave it to us.

41
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,790
What if...

42
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,260
I still want to fight?

43
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,340
I understand. You all care for me.

44
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,380
You are afraid that I'll get hurt,
that I'll lose this fight.

45
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,670
But if I hide today,

46
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:32,820
the Bai Sect will only become more and more arrogant.

47
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,760
They will still bully us
until we can't lift up our heads.

48
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:41,090
With strength to battle, but choose to retreat,

49
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,390
this is not the worth of a man.

50
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:49,280
How about this? Let's choose a new Sect Leader.

51
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,350
I just won't appear as Sect Leader.

52
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,350
How about Han Xian?

53
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,170
He has experience anyway.
All this time,

54
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,320
he's more suited for this position than me.

55
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,950
Why are you dragging me into this again?

56
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,870
If you all don't want to be it,
I'll be the Sect Leader then.

57
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,080
But I also think that my qualifications aren't enough.

58
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,490
Whatever. Anyway, except for you,

59
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,380
I won't acknowledge anyone as the Sect Leader.

60
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,970
I already said my thoughts clearly.

61
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,200
You guys can slowly discuss.

62
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,940
Why is he just leaving like that?
What is going on?

63
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,420
Don't try to persuade me anymore.

64
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,140
This matter, I must go and do it.

65
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:09,200
Brother Xiao Yan, I know your temper.

66
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,370
Once you decide to do something,
no one can stop you.

67
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,330
What are you doing?

68
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,170
I'm going to train,

69
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,960
not to send myself to death.

70
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,380
Stop trying to comfort me.

71
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,510
I know that even if it's just training,

72
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,150
you're anxious to go to Fen Tian Qi Training Pagoda.

73
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,940
You will surely use your life to practice asceticism.

74
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,490
This trip is difficult and dangerous.
By all means, you must be diligent.

75
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,370
You have to make sure to not endanger your life.

76
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,650
No matter the results,

77
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,540
I will always stand on your side.

78
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,790
It's okay. Believe in me.

79
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,760
Since I am going, I will definitely
have methods to protect myself.

80
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,510
I promise you. I will definitely come out safely.

81
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,820
After a while,
I'll be waiting for you at the entrance.

82
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,920
Okay.

83
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,270
Let's go.

84
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,490
This is Ziyun Wing.

85
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,370
Really?

86
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,140
However, the wings have suffered great damage,
so it probably won't be able to fly.

87
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,130
Such a pity.

88
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,760
There really is no way to use it then.

89
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,620
Not necessarily.

90
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,750
This skeleton's temperature still exists.
Furthermore, there's still spiritual power.

91
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,790
I'm guessing while it was still living,
it swallowed the Yi Fire of the magical beasts.

92
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,940
If you want to use it,
you will have to suffer a lot of pain.

93
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,750
What kind of pain?

94
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,500
I will find a way to plant it inside your body,

95
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,680
then use your blood to nourish it.

96
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,240
Then it'll suck and suck and suck and suck,
until one day... Bam! It grows out.

97
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,410
In other words, it's like planting flowers.

98
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,210
Okay. Then what are you waiting for?
Hurry and plant it.

99
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,280
Okay. I'll incinerate it and slowly plant it for you.

100
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,270
How about now I transfer the Flame Secrets to you first?

101
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,110
The Flame Secrets have been passed down for a millenium.

102
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,260
It's our Star Fall Pavilion's treasure
that has never been revealed to people.

103
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,760
Ordinary people can only intake
one type of Yi Fire.

104
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,530
But there's a Flame Secrets aid.
You can absorb all kinds of Yi Fire.

105
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,600
The more Yi Fire there are,
the higher the requirement level of the Flame Secrets.

106
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,410
You know too that to intake Yi Fire,
you must endure enormous amounts of pain.

107
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:47,460
But cultivating the Flame Secrets,
you must bear multiple types of pain.

108
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,630
It will completely burn
all the impurities in your cells.

109
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,700
You will feel your vital channels,
skin, and flesh expanding.

110
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,070
This pain will affect every corner of your body.

111
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,540
This is only the beginning.

112
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,590
How is it?
Do you still have the courage to practice it?

113
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,610
Do you have any last wishes?

114
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,060
When I go out one day,
I'll take care of it for you.

115
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,850
Medicine Elder, I'm still worried about one thing.

116
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,130
If I take in the Bone Spirit Cold Flame,

117
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,200
will someone discover you?

118
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,280
You're talking about Han Feng right?

119
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,110
Relax, even if he found me,
he wouldn't let you go.

120
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,440
He instead will become more afraid of you
for having the Bone Spirit Cold Flame.

121
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:45,250
When the curtain opens,
each one will perform his own show.

122
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,870
Don't worry. Practice it.

123
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,540
When the curtain opens,

124
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,690
each one will perform his own show.

125
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,000
Medicine Elder, teach it to me.

126
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,180
You're awake.

127
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,590
You're at Fen Tian Qi Training Pagoda
using Fight Qi and raging flames.

128
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,330
You fainted from exhaustion.

129
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:25,130
It was Xiao Xun'er who found you and sent you here.

130
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,020
Lie down and don't move.

131
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,140
These flowers have healing powers.

132
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,780
Okay.

133
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,440
I don't know what you were practicing,
but out of every 10 veins in your body,

134
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,390
7 or 8 have already broken.
It's amazing that you're still alive.

135
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,840
This is already a miracle.

136
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,980
But, I'm worried that you're starting down the wrong road.

137
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,380
There is a saying that I must give to you.

138
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,940
Elder, speak.

139
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,690
"Fire is the purest thing in this world".

140
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:17,610
"Ashes does not represent death,
but the start of new life".

141
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,610
Hold this branch.

142
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,980
When it is in full bloom in your heart,

143
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,590
your training will be complete.

144
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,840
This is what Teng Shan Elder gave me.

145
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,190
He understands what I mean.

146
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,820
I don't understand.

147
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,690
What he means to tell you is that the strength of the flames
is that they grow and multiply without end.

148
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,420
They give warmth and their light illuminates people.

149
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,170
This is the power of life.

150
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,410
And not the power to destroy.

151
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,020
This is the line of separation between good and evil.

152
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,960
Hey, you!

153
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,530
Here.

154
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,319
When Flame Secrets are hidden,
Essence Flame is neglected.

155
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:38,469
When Flame Secrets appear, the whole world fights.

156
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,110
When Flame Secrets are abandoned,
Fight Practitioners will die in war.

157
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,300
When Flame Secrets come out,
evil ways will be punished.

158
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,610
When Flame Secrets are hidden,
Essence Flame is neglected.

159
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,660
When Flame Secrets appear,
the whole world fights.

160
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,160
When Flame Secrets are abandoned,
Fight Practitioners will die in war.

161
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:00,410
When Flame Secrets come out,
evil ways will be punished.

162
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,590
Practicing the Essence Flame will let all of
the channels in your body to be completely re-smelted.

163
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,820
In order to achieve the ability to hold the Essence Flame.

164
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,450
This process will be exceptionally painful.

165
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,980
Similar to the phoenix's self-immolation
and nirvana's rebirth.

166
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,990
But if you can just endure the process, you will be
able to shed your mortal body and exchange your bones.

167
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,570
Medicine Elder.

168
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,960
Medicine Elder?

169
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,560
Medicine Elder!

170
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,470
Medicine Elder.

171
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,790
Medicine Elder.

172
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,950
That you came from within the raging inferno proves
that your body must already have been purified.

173
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,940
Kneel. I will pass the Bone Spirit Cold Flame to you.

174
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,690
Yes.

175
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,390
Don't resist. Treat it as your blood.

176
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,370
Absorb it into your vital channels.

177
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,030
Medicine Elder, how come you...

178
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,320
Have I aged?

179
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,940
The person you are looking at right now is the real me,
someone who has lived for a hundred years.

180
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,670
A hundred years?

181
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,790
That's so long.

182
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,980
Only those who can die are happy.

183
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,630
Because everything can start anew.

184
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,810
But I must live on with the memories of a hundred years.

185
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,600
This kind of feeling, no one can understand it.

186
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:20,570
Right. I found the method to plant the wings inside your body.

187
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,320
When Fight God created the Flame Secrets,

188
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,190
he created a space between life and death.

189
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,700
He allowed people who were left destitute and homeless
to have some place to settle in.

190
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:52,100
You must go out from here by your own
for Bone Spirit Cold Flame and Flame Secrets

191
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,210
to be truly become yours.

192
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,540
Leave this place?

193
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:09,090
I can't help you with this.

194
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:13,080
If you cannot leave this place,
you'll become like me, forever trapped here.

195
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,350
I've already passed on the Bone Spirit Cold Flame to you.

196
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:20,560
For the next few days, I'm going to hibernate.
Hope that when I wake up,

197
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,540
you're not here anymore.

198
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,980
Medicine Elder!

199
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,460
Why are you crying?

200
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,480
You fainted again while you were
at the Fen Tian Qi Training Pagoda.

201
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,090
I thought you died.

202
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,040
Why would I die?

203
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,730
You don't realize your current condition.

204
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,240
You don't even look like a living person.

205
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,480
I'm just feeling a little cold.

206
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,800
You don't have any heat in your body at all.

207
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,220
I feel so cold.

208
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,830
Don't fall asleep.

209
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:43,650
Don't fall asleep, Brother Xiao Yan.

210
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,560
Don't fall asleep.

211
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,450
Medicine Elder! Medicine Elder!

212
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,560
Medicine Elder!

213
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:33,470
It's almost 11 AM. What should we do right now?

214
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,060
How is he doing?

215
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,140
Let him rest a little longer.

216
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,890
Let's go.

217
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,780
Go.

218
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,400
Xun'er.

219
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,700
Brother Xiao Yan.

220
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,660
It's almost 11 AM.

221
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,460
Let's go.

222
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:51,210
Who is this?

223
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,850
Is it all right if we cancel the challenge today?

224
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,600
I say, Xiao Xun'er,
this is a written challenge started by Xiao Yan.

225
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,500
We're all just waiting to see what happens.
What you say doesn't count.

226
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,030
Then let's reschedule.

227
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,050
Xiao Yan is sick today.

228
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:06,600
If Bai Shan wins, it would be
because you have an unfair advantage.

229
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,120
You're unexpectedly affectionate and loyal.

230
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,810
But the words have already been spoken.

231
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,700
I can't be the first to withdraw.

232
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,720
Otherwise, others will believe that the Bai Sect turned tail.
Isn't that right?

233
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,250
That's right!

234
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,090
You all clearly know that it took Xiao Yan
two years to catch up with your strength.

235
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,180
Acting this way,
you're just the strong bullying the weak.

236
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,150
Then you make Xiao Yan retract his written challenge.

237
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:32,540
Fine. Then, Bai Shan, let me clearly tell you.

238
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,720
If Xiao Yan suffers from any accidents today,
we will meet in the Fight Qi arena.

239
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,810
I, Xiao Xun'er, dare to say this,

240
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:41,050
because I have this type of strength.

241
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,800
Who is this? She's so passionate.

242
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:53,620
This is somewhat interesting.
I'm willing to accept your challenge.

243
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,190
Go. Go. Hurry up and go.

244
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,540
Get out of here quickly. Just go.

245
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,890
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's go.

246
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:12,620
Yan Sect will win.
Yan Sect will win.

247
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:19,330
- Bai Sect is mighty.
- Yan Sect will win.

248
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:25,030
- Bai Sect is mighty.
- Yan Sect will win.

249
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:31,890
Bai Sect is mighty.

250
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:36,820
Don't fight, okay?
You can announce that you're sick.

251
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,540
It's fine, Xun'er.

252
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,210
He can't hurt me. Don't worry.

253
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,770
You're lying.

254
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:49,210
- Bai Sect is mighty.
- Yan Sect will win.

255
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,460
Good!

256
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,420
Don't forget.

257
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:25,910
Xiao Yan, what's wrong? Are you sick?

258
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,760
Why don't you cancel today and talk about
rescheduling when you're feeling better.

259
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,350
That's not necessary.

260
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,220
This child. How can you still be this eccentric?
Your body is completely lacking in heat.

261
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,240
Did you hurt yourself while practicing? Come here.

262
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,100
I'm fine.

263
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,770
You all know the established rules.

264
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,880
Whoever falls to the ground
and cannot stand back up will be the loser.

265
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,730
After someone falls to the ground, the other person must not
maliciously hurt the fallen person or abolish his Qi.

266
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,070
Bai Shan,

267
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,900
you know the established rules.

268
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:30,020
If you break these rules,
don't blame me for acting against you.

269
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,680
Fine.

270
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,850
Xiao Yan!

271
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,520
Brother Xiao Yan!

272
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:26,730
You. Come!

273
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,930
Xiao Yan! Xiao Yan! Xiao Yan!

274
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,630
Come on, Xiao Yan!

275
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,300
Xiao Yan!

276
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,050
Stay down! Xiao Yan!

277
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,060
Xiao Yan, stop fighting!

278
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,890
Xiao Yan. Hurry and stay down!

279
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,280
Stay down!

280
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,150
- Stay down, Xiao Yan!
- Brother Xiao Yan!

281
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,410
Stay down!

282
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,210
Mighty! Mighty! Mighty!

283
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,310
Hit him. Beat him to death!

284
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:35,700
Mighty! Mighty! Mighty!

285
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,930
Acknowledge defeat.

286
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,540
Stay down!

287
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,380
You idiot!

288
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:51,220
- Brother Xiao Yan!
- Stay down! Xiao Yan!

289
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,400
Stay down!

290
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,390
Do you recognize me?

291
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:52,570
I recognize you. You are me, and I am you.

292
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,040
Do you know where we are right now?

293
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,880
I'm in a dream.

294
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,610
I'm going fishing with mother tomorrow.
She even promised to teach me how to sing.

295
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,250
How nice.

296
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,780
Then you have to listen to your mother, understand?

297
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,110
Why are people so annoying when they grow up?

298
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,610
They always tell me to be obedient.

299
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,860
You have to accompany your mother well.

300
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,140
Cherish every moment with her.

301
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:33,970
Don't let her be angry.
Let her be happy everyday.

302
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:38,240
If one day she is going away,

303
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,740
you must stop her.

304
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:45,339
Don't let her take even one step away.

305
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,909
I won't. Do you know what I like to do?

306
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:51,749
I like to stay in the house by myself.

307
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,370
Free, with no one bothering me.

308
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,389
It's best if mother and father are both gone.

309
00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:00,459
Then I can climb trees if I want,
and do anything I want.

310
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,360
So stupid.

311
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,990
You're stupid.

312
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,740
Tell me, what will happen when I grow up?

313
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,270
Did I get married to Nalan Yanran?

314
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:25,040
Who do I love the most?

315
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,160
How old was I when I left home?

316
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,490
How old was I
when I got accepted to Jia Nan Academy?

317
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:35,320
Also, did mother and father come to see me often?
Did they bring lots of yummy food?

318
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,060
Did I make a lot of friends?

319
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,130
You'll know later,

320
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,590
that growing up

321
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,770
is a very painful thing.

322
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,380
You're lying. Only when you grow up
can you do anything you want.

323
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,050
Never mind. I'm not listening to you.

324
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:59,160
Mother is calling me up, I'm waking up.

325
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,790
How are you going to get out?

326
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:05,480
I'll get out once I wake up from the dream.

327
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:26,800
Sometimes, I am very afraid.

328
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,540
Why?

329
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:31,080
I'm afraid I cannot win.

330
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,840
Why do you say that?

331
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,000
Do you really want to win?

332
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,890
Because I can't lose,

333
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,140
I must win.

334
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,030
Remember, no matter how strong you become,

335
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:50,550
there will always be more powerful things
than you in this world.

336
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,570
We are only human. After a few decades,

337
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:56,960
we will be ruins.

338
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,380
Can you win a rock?

339
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:10,340
You can't even beat a pile of dust.

340
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,890
Then training so hard,

341
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:18,120
what's the purpose?

342
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,910
The only thing you need to do
is overcome yourself.

343
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,990
Fight with your envy.

344
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:29,450
Your curiousity. Face your pain.

345
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,500
Give up on your persistence.

346
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,700
This life is just a game in vain.

347
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,340
But you have to experience it
with a serious attitude.

348
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:43,740
With hope. With patience.

349
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,720
If the flower hasn't blossomed yet, wait for it.

350
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,340
Life is just a game in vain.

351
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,780
As long as you have the door in your heart.

352
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,830
I can go wherever I want to.

353
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,070
I should get out.

354
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,650
What is this?

355
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,630
Ziyun Wing!

356
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,660
He really put the Ziyun Wing on him!

357
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,460
That's amazing.

358
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,410
I am flying...

359
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:26,190
Xiao Yan! Xiao Yan!

360
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,150
You lost.

361
00:40:56,070 --> 00:41:00,050
Xiao Yan, you fight with me with two wings.

362
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:04,500
It's not honorable fight.

363
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:07,860
If you have what it got,
let's fight with our hands!

364
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,200
Eight Extreme Collapse.

365
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,320
The Yan Sect wins.

366
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:42,560
The Yan Sect will never lose!
The Yan Sect will never lose!

367
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,460
Yan Sect! Yan Sect! Yan Sect!
