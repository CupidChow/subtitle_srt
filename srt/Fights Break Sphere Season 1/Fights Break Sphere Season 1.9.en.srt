3
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,790
Let me explain. Let me explain.

4
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,980
Now, the Student's Council has officially signed
a sale and purchase contract with the Yan Sect.

5
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:57,340
It's a 20% discount to buy it through the Student's Council.
A round of applause, please.

6
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,300
Students, remember this please.

7
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,820
If it's a product from the Yan Sect, it's a premium product.
Just as one can see the good result of healing.

8
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,220
The key is to continue taking it.

9
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,210
Good.

10
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,260
Students from the Department of Alchemy
are to stay here.

11
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,970
Students from the Department of Fight Techniques,
follow me.

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,630
Students from the Department of Fight Techniques
just have to follow Lin Xiuya.

13
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,960
Okay. Let me say something to all of you.

14
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,080
The first goal of our first month
is to decorate our practice room well.

15
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,020
Since we have all joined the Yan Sect,
we should do as much work as we can.

16
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,990
Where's the leader?

17
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,050
The leader is...

18
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,380
-That's right. Where is the leader?
-What do we eat for celebration?

19
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,100
Hold on.

20
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,620
- Xun'er!
- What?

21
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,630
- W-Where's Xiao Yan?
- He's with the Medicine Sect.

22
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,140
More fights?

23
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,490
Fight? What's there to fight about?

24
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,930
Xun'er, do we have a celebration banquet?

25
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,410
I think we have, I'm waiting, too.

26
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,290
That's great!

27
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,360
Yes, that's fantastic!

28
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,020
It's right here.

29
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,240
Who is it?

30
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,110
Senior, you have taken too much
High Level Gather Qi Powder medicine.

31
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,460
Your qi is trapped inside your body for sure.
I'm here to check on you.

32
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,940
Are you trying to be a good person?

33
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,150
Come here and give me a massage.

34
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,740
Okay. If you don't mind,
I can give you a massage.

35
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,140
This is the ointment.

36
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,420
Tell me what you want.

37
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,360
Yan Sect can just focus on the sale
of High Level Gather Qi Powder medicine.

38
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,550
As for the rest of the medicines,
the Medicine Sect can sell whatever it wants to sell.

39
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,020
Can you leave a path for us?

40
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,510
That's so polite of you.

41
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,420
How about it?

42
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:59,270
You won. You can take all the markets
and territories from the Medicine Sect.

43
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,120
You can also poach all the people
from the Medicine Sect.

44
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,660
If you like this practice ground.

45
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,790
If you bring a few people here to beat me up,
then this is yours, too.

46
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,630
How about that? I am speaking honestly, right?

47
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,220
Indeed. You spoke honestly.

48
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,630
Go easy and rub gently.

49
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:31,100
Senior, this is the pellet medicine I have refined.

50
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,320
You take one pill in the morning and one in the evening.
The qi that's trapped in your body will be released.

51
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,980
Take it starting today. If you delay it
another day, the problem will become bigger.

52
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,610
Thanks.

53
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,000
Brother, good work.

54
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,470
You won the fight and you took the high ground.

55
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,770
How about if I give you my territory
and my people as well?

56
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,890
Otherwise, I would look like I lack manners.

57
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,120
But you don't seem to understand who I am.

58
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,960
Indeed, I am a very petty person.

59
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,190
From tomorrow, our Medicine Sect will
take turns to challenge your Yan Sect.

60
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,010
You have that big ruler.
Do you think other people don't?

61
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,220
We can fight one-on-one.

62
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,190
Senior, the Yan Sect are all new students.

63
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,990
How can we beat you seniors?

64
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,960
We can take a step back
with the pellet medicine business.

65
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,650
All we want is peace and nothing more.

66
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,580
You want peace?

67
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,760
Well, I don't.

68
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,750
Forget about the massage you have
given me today to help me heal.

69
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,960
Even if you were to bow down to me,
I have only one thing to say to you.

70
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,070
You scoundrel, you've offended me!

71
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,370
Tell me what's in Han Xian's mind?
I grew up in the Magical Beast Mountain Range.

72
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,200
I have seen people bitten to death by Magical Beasts.
I have never seen people scared to death by them.

73
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,090
Han Xian is only a small figure,
why pretend to be such a big shot?

74
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,420
Exactly. Just because he threatened us,

75
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,150
will that stop us, the Yan Sect, from selling the medicine?
If so, how are we supposed to support ourselves?

76
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,360
And the practice ground,
how do we keep that place running?

77
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,450
If other people were to hear this speech of yours,

78
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,660
people who wanted to take advantage of us
would be of unimaginable quantity!

79
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,650
That Han Xian wants to fight?
Then, let's fight.

80
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,290
No, Lin Xiuya. Are you addicted to fighting now?

81
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,420
Did you forget the initial purpose
of establishing the Yan Sect?

82
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,800
We are here to unite together
and not to be bullied by the senior students.

83
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,090
Also, not because we can fight all day.

84
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,870
The most important thing is,
they aren't just challenging me.

85
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,940
They can take turns
and singularly fight with each one of you.

86
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,060
They can fight Hao Tian or Hu Jia.

87
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,400
They have so many Three-Star Fight Masters,
can you handle them?

88
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,020
When we are at the fighting ground,
I can't help you.

89
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,930
By then, all the members of our Yan Sect
will be bruised and hurt.

90
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,080
Why even go to the academy at that point?

91
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,930
Let me ask you. If you don't fight,
where do you get the energy talismans?

92
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,610
We followed you because we want to
have our own space to survive.

93
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,409
Now, there are so many people
following the Yan Sect.

94
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:51,689
We'd rather be beaten to a pulp

95
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,510
than to follow you to be cowards.

96
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,590
Look at you. I say one sentence
and you say a page of it.

97
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,520
What about the two of you? Say something.

98
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,560
I have nothing to say.

99
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,060
Brother Xiao Yan, I'll listen to you.

100
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,190
I also think there's nothing wrong.

101
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,200
Right, today, the students
who signed up for alchemy at my place,

102
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,690
most of them come from the Medicine Sect.

103
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,590
Didn't that Han Xian say that they have
over twenty Three-Star Fight Masters?

104
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,070
Maybe these twenty students
are all coming over to our Yan Sect now.

105
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,600
Take a look.

106
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,700
Then what are we talking about?
Let's move on to the next subject.

107
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,980
What do we eat at the celebration banquet?

108
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,630
Everyone, silent.

109
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,730
We invite Sect Leader Xiao
to say a few words to everyone.

110
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,130
Just eat! What's there to say?

111
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:15,590
Xiao Yan! Xiao Yan! Xiao Yan!

112
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,770
I really don't have anything to say.

113
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,260
So I'll just talk about Yan Sect's regulations.

114
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,000
Today, we have a lot of new members
who have joined our sect

115
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,030
and you may not know what the Yan Sect is all about.

116
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:33,260
The Yan Sect is just a sect started
by a group of freshmen.

117
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,460
In the early days, we established it at the...

118
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,180
Water room!

119
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,080
If all of you already know about it,
why do I have to speak?

120
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,840
Anyway, the people from the Yan Sect
are not allowed to take advantage of other people.

121
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,780
If I were to find out that any one of our brothers

122
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,520
is taking advantage of other people outside,
you don't have to return to the Yan Sect anymore.

123
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,140
But, similarly,
if anyone were to be taken advantage of,

124
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,560
you can come back home,
and we can all discuss it together.

125
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,530
Anyway, we will not attack

126
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,650
unless we are attacked.
But if we are attacked,

127
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,990
then our Yan Sect will go
and take care of them together.

128
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,790
Great! Great!

129
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,700
Xiao Yan!

130
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,000
Sect Leader Han, why are you here?

131
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,050
All of you!

132
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,490
Humiliating!

133
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:37,400
You saw me lose a fight, and you just willingly
start working for the freshmen. Right?

134
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,360
Do you have no shame?

135
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,910
It's okay if you left.

136
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,940
Tell me something.

137
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,860
Has the Medicine Sect ever mistreated you
in the past in any way?

138
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,290
Sect Leader Han, remember to
take the medicine I gave you.

139
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,140
The Fight Qi energy that's trapped
inside your body will be very dangerous.

140
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,000
I underestimated you, Xiao Yan.

141
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,280
You don't need to snatch the medicine store!
It's all yours!

142
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,600
Do you dare to fight me again
without using your ruler?

143
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,420
Fight again?

144
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,410
If I don't take you down today,

145
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,630
I have no face to stay at the academy.

146
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,080
Come!

147
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,570
Without that ruler, you are useless.

148
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,490
I can fight, but the medicine,

149
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,950
you can forget about taking it.

150
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,800
It's quite crowded here.

151
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,620
Do you think the rules of the academy don't apply?

152
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,540
The two of you can fight all you want in here.

153
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,840
Brother Xiao Yan, I brought you a bowl of soup.

154
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,940
Lin Xiuya said you didn't have enough food at the banquet.

155
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,200
So I cooked a chicken stew for you.

156
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,210
You must be suffering in there.

157
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,570
No. The bed is very comfortable.

158
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,860
Okay. Go back now.

159
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,140
What about mine?

160
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,420
Sect Leader Han... I-I don't know.

161
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,200
Did the school not send
the two of you some food at the same time?

162
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,260
The next time you come, bring two servings.

163
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,690
You can go.

164
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,510
Drinking soup so loudly.
You must be from a poor family, right?

165
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,410
Yes.

166
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,970
Before I came to this Jia Nan Academy,
I was just an attendant at a medicine store.

167
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,370
Aren't you from the Xiao family at Wu Tan City?

168
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,300
The five big clans!

169
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,260
I really disliked this.

170
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,470
Where did you get the superiority?

171
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,650
For us with any other last name besides those
of the five big clans, are we just never as good as all of you?

172
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,860
Says who? Aren't you seniors
the ones who bully others?

173
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,190
Five big clans?
If I were any weaker,

174
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,180
you would ruin me.

175
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:29,510
Did you ever care that I was from
the Xiao family at Wu Tan City?

176
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,220
You are right about that.

177
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:36,760
But I think it's strange.
How many stars are you?

178
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,930
Originally, I was a One-Star Fight Master.

179
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,270
But after the fight in the ring,
I got lucky and progressed to a Three-Star Fight Master.

180
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,370
I'm a Three-Star Fight Grand Master.

181
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:53,170
Three-Star! I should have beaten you up
with my eyes closed.

182
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:59,200
Do you feel that I can't win against you
in a fight if I don't have my ruler?

183
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:04,350
I'll tell you that my arms can be the ruler, too.

184
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:08,490
Did you learn on your own
or is someone teaching you?

185
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,830
You can say it's taught by a teacher.
You can also say I practiced and learned it myself.

186
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,150
Even if I lost,

187
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,620
I have something that's better than you.

188
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,120
Really?

189
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,870
Tell me about it
and I'll give you this chicken soup.

190
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,770
I was in confinement... eighteen times.

191
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,510
Eighteen times!

192
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:41,300
That's so impressive.
I was confined only twice.

193
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,320
What did you put in here?

194
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,160
Knockout medicine.

195
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,760
I don't care, I will eat this
even it has knockout medicine in it.

196
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,810
You really are quite weird.
You can even get angry over a bowl of chicken soup.

197
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:17,000
Inside, there are two pellet medicines that can break down
the High Level Gather Qi Powder medicines you had.

198
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,800
After drinking it, the Fight Qi energy that's
trapped inside you can disperse for good.

199
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,430
Xiao Yan, you don't have to be nice to me.

200
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,300
I can't repay your kindness.

201
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,710
No one said you have to pay it back.

202
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,930
Then, I won't!

203
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,410
Let's be brothers.

204
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,030
From now on, the Medicine Sect and the Yan Sect are one,

205
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,760
and vice versa.

206
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,090
You drank it all?

207
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,300
Why didn't you leave me some?

208
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,830
When is the next meal coming in?

209
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,220
Everyone, please take a look.

210
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,830
Behind the Yin Yang Fish is where
you practice your meditation skills.

211
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,850
If any student can't breathe properly,

212
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,750
you can go upstairs first.

213
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,770
Look at how minute your abilities are!

214
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,230
This pagoda has a total of nine floors.
This is just the first floor.

215
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,800
The lower you are, the hotter it gets,
and you will need your Fight Qi even more.

216
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:04,750
You need to confront it and gain equilibrium.
Yet some of you are actually running away.

217
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,720
Do you know why it's so hot in here?

218
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,020
Underneath, there is a volcano,
and there's also a fire snake

219
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,630
that Fight God had personally sealed here in the past.

220
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:20,450
One day of cultivation and refinement practice here
is equal to a month outside.

221
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,750
My suggestion is, if you are not
that strong in your martial arts skills,

222
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,500
you can start your cultivation
and refinement practice from the top floor.

223
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,850
The difficulty is lesser, too.

224
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,430
Of course.

225
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,080
If you are good, of course, it wouldn't matter.

226
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,770
Right? Sect Leader Xiao?

227
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,610
I don't deserve the compliments.

228
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,860
This is the first time I am spending summer
inside the Spatial Ring.

229
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,890
Although spending time
inside the Spatial Ring is comfortable,

230
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:42,660
but at the Fen Tian Qi Training Pagoda,
I'm afraid you won't be able to take it.

231
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,460
Is this Fen Tian Qi Training Pagoda really good
for my cultivation and refinement practice?

232
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,550
Of course! You can even learn
a set of martial arts skills in there.

233
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:58,260
You won't be able to find any better cultivation
and refinement place in all of the Fight Qi continent.

234
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,450
Jia Nan Academy is indeed deserving of its fine reputation.

235
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,130
Flame Secrets, a flame-style martial arts skill.

236
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,700
This is the only scroll in all of the Fight Qi continent.

237
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,060
Compared to the Heaven Rank martial arts skills,
it's stronger and even stranger.

238
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,860
Stronger than Heaven Rank martial arts skills?

239
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,890
Then... What level is it?

240
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,760
Low Level Yellow Rank.

241
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,800
Are you trying to trick me? If it's at Low Level Yellow Rank,
even if it's strange, it won't be that powerful.

242
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,980
It can evolve.

243
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:43,890
No way. I have never heard of
any martial arts skills that evolve.

244
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,890
What do you know?
The Fight Qi continent is vast and unparalleled.

245
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,970
There are countless numbers of odd and strange people.

246
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,560
You have never stepped foot outside of the Jia Ma Empire.

247
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,520
Things you haven't seen are boundless
and as deep as the ocean!

248
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,230
Then, have you heard of any martial arts skills
that can evolve?

249
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,470
It's because there aren't. That's why these martial arts skills
can be considered to be unique in comparison.

250
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,760
It can really evolve?

251
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,670
Have you tried learning it?

252
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,830
No.

253
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,140
- Did other people learn it before?
- Also, no.

254
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,780
Then how do you know it can evolve?

255
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,070
That's what the scroll says.

256
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,120
Okay, you win. You win.

257
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,010
Who cares if it's a Yellow Rank or Heaven Rank.

258
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:45,360
Medicine Elder, as long as you're willing to teach me,
I'll definitely learn it.

259
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,340
It's easy to pass on to you the Flame Secrets,
but learning it is hard.

260
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,510
I think you should head downwards first.
The lower you go, the better.

261
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,190
- If you can endure that...?
- As long as I can become stronger,

262
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,090
I would even go down to the netherworld.

263
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,380
Gutsy!

264
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,330
- You are smoking now.
- What?

265
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,960
Leader, Xiao Yan is here.

266
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,860
Senior Bai Shan!

267
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,260
What are you doing?

268
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,860
It's like this. I want to use several rooms
on the lower floors of the

269
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,100
Fen Tian Qi Training Pagoda
for cultivation and refinement practice.

270
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,530
But just now, someone stopped me and said that
the lower floors belong to the territory of the Bai Sect.

271
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,330
So I thought I should come and discuss it with you.

272
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,480
Allow me to go in and practice for a few hours every day.

273
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,630
Of course. I will pay you energy talismans.

274
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,600
A few of the lower floors?

275
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,950
Aren't you afraid
your hair will be totally burned?

276
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,590
Go do whatever it is you're supposed to be doing.

277
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,410
Senior, I have a question.

278
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,490
I am wondering. Regarding how you're
monopolizing the Fen Tian Qi Training Pagoda,

279
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,590
whether the school knows or not?

280
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:45,290
A freshman...

281
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,590
dares to talk to me about this?

282
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:50,190
Are you tired of living?

283
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,270
No, I wouldn't dare.

284
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:57,590
It's only... One's defeated opponent.

285
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,770
Who gave you the self-confidence to speak like this?

286
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,680
What are you saying?!

287
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:09,260
At Black Point Region,
I was plotted against by you, lad.

288
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,020
I've only used a third of my martial arts skills.

289
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,580
If you're looking for trouble,

290
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,270
don't blame me for not going easy on you.

291
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:25,290
Senior, those who engage in personal fights
within the school campus

292
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,570
will be expelled.

293
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,390
Personal fights? Did any of you witness it?

294
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,500
No!

295
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,600
Good heavens! He's really powerful.

296
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,110
I see that you're left
with just this mouth of yours, right?

297
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,620
Sect Leader Xiao!

298
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,930
Sect Leader Xiao!

299
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,910
What are you doing here?

300
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:31,260
A group of students is ordering the Gather Qi Powder.
They want to discuss the price with you.

301
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,120
We could not come to a decision.

302
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,680
Han Xian, are you acknowledging this brat as your master?

303
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,780
I get it now.

304
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,040
Recently, the Yan Sect and the Medicine Sect have united.

305
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,340
You're now the richest within the school

306
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,890
and so, you've lost your direction. Right?

307
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,970
Bai Shan, let me tell you something.

308
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,090
Personal fights are forbidden within the campus.

309
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,300
If you insist on violating the rules,

310
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,010
then don't blame me
for disregarding the camaraderie of schoolmates.

311
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:07,700
- You're so mature.
- Whatever you say.

312
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,980
- Let's go.
- Xiao Yan, you're just leaving like this?

313
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,460
Don't you want the cultivation
and refinement practice room on the underground floor?

314
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,180
If you can beat me,

315
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,650
besides the cultivation
and refinement practice room on the lower floor,

316
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:25,600
you can come and go as you please
to all the places that belong to the Bai Sect.

317
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,650
Senior, you're basically making me give you a challenge letter.

318
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:43,500
That time in the Black Point Region,
you embarrassed me a lot.

319
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,300
Beating my brother in the water room;

320
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,770
you definitely showed
that you don't respect our Bai Sect.

321
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,560
I was worried I wouldn't have the chance
to teach you a lesson.

322
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:56,160
Today, you showed up yourself.

323
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,590
How about it? Do you dare to or not?

324
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,660
Just a minute.

325
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:18,350
If you don't fight with me,
then I'll beat your people.

326
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,820
Han Xian. Lin Xiuya.

327
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,830
Hu Jia. Hao Tian.

328
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,020
And your little sister.

329
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,240
I guarantee, I won't let them off.

330
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,980
Fine.

331
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:54,570
Bai Shan, let's have a duel.

332
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,990
I hope you'll keep your word.

333
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,850
Let's go.

334
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,450
Practice your martial arts skills!

335
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,510
Let's go. Time to practice our martial arts skills.

336
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,590
Let's go.

337
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,850
We, from the Yan Sect, believe
that the Fen Tian Qi Training Pagoda

338
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:27,660
is a place provided by the academy for students
to practice cultivation and refinement.

339
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:32,090
That every student in the school
should enjoy the right to use it,

340
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,320
but the Bai Sect has, for a long time,

341
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,780
been forcibly occupying the best spots.

342
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,760
The other students are angry
but don't even dare to voice themselves,

343
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,520
only because they are really good at fighting.

344
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,630
When we proposed going to practice cultivation
and refinement in the Fen Tian Qi Training Pagoda,

345
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:56,210
Assistant Sect Leader, Bai Shan, actually requested
a public martial arts competition

346
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,600
that only if I could beat him, then could I enter.

347
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,330
As a result, we have formally decided
to have our Sect Leader, Xiao Yan,

348
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,340
make a personal request

349
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:09,720
to issue a challenge against Bai Shan,
the Bai Sect's assistant sect leader.

350
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,120
They must be joking.

351
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,420
You, come!

352
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,280
All right.

353
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,790
Fantastic. Applause please.

354
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:34,260
That's great. You're indeed my younger brother!

355
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,140
Keep clapping.

356
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,570
What're you doing? Keep clapping. Don't stop.

357
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,960
It's coming again.

358
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,810
So cool.

359
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,820
There's also me.

360
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:02,050
Just now I was incredible. I was flying.

361
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,400
Look at Hu Jia!

362
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,170
- How was it? Isn't it exciting?
- Awesome.

363
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,740
Come, everyone. Come take a look.

364
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,840
The limited edition of the High Level Gather Qi Powder.

365
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,490
If you don't buy it, there may not be any left later.

366
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:27,090
Xiao Yan personally made it. It's unique and unmatched.

367
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:30,100
A limited edition. Come. Don't miss it when you pass by.

368
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,820
Everyone, come take a look.
A limited edition of the High Level Gather Qi Powder.

369
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,550
Come... Come...

370
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:38,000
Unique and unmatched. Limited edition.

371
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,020
Come. Look. Take a look.
Anyone passing by, absolutely don't miss it.

372
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,740
Senior, I want to take a look
at your High Level Gather Qi Powder.

373
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,230
Yan Sect, Sect Leader, Xiao Yan,
made this High Level Gather Qi Powder.

374
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,630
The qi will increase fast
and it will be maintained for a long time.

375
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,970
Two thousand energy talismans.
I'm not extorting you.

376
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,640
In the marketplace, it has already increased
to two thousand five hundred.

377
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,370
Isn't Yan Sect's medicine store always open?

378
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:01,370
- Are you from the Department of Alchemy
or the Department of Fight Techniques? - Fight Techniques.

379
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,620
No wonder you don't know about the matter here.

380
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,850
Currently, Yan Sect is only releasing
twenty pills every day.

381
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,530
Those student council's officials
have already divided all of it among themselves.

382
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,000
Quickly buy it. Buy one pill
and there'll be one pill less.

383
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,400
- Xiao Yan will be dead soon. It's a limited edition.
- Why?

384
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,290
Bai Shan will compete in martial arts with him
to address the old and new hatred.

385
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,180
It's clearly to teach Xiao Yan a lesson.

386
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,150
I'm afraid Xiao Yan's life will be over soon.

387
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,080
Bai Shan had six duels. And for the first five,
their Fight Qi was abolished by him.

388
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,340
They all packed up and returned home.

389
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,920
And the sixth?

390
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,780
The sixth one is Xiao Yan.

391
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,930
Han Xian, look at this.

392
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,020
- How about it?
- These wings of yours are pretty good, but too expensive.

393
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,940
Senior, can they be cheaper?

394
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,800
Sure. Pay me with some medicine.

395
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,350
All right.

396
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,790
I also want these wings. I especially like them.

397
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:58,250
-When I can't win, I can run away very fast.
-Go...

398
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,740
Sect Leader Xiao, you still need to promise me one thing.

399
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,440
When these pair of wings are no longer useful,
return them to me. I'll pay you the original price.

400
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,810
All right.

401
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,680
I can give you 80% percent off.

402
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,760
80% off?

403
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,060
- 80% off?
- I want them, too!

404
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,330
It's none of your business.

405
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:21,310
- Don't dream about taking advantage of me.
- He cannot fly for a few days from now.

406
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,230
- How can you talk like that?
- Forget it, Xiuya.

407
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,130
Here, these pair of wings are worth millions.

408
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:31,639
I can't afford it even with an 80% discount. How about this?
From now on, all the pellet medicines from the Yan Sect...

409
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,879
Stop. Don't even say from now on.

410
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,270
No money, right? Wait a minute
and I'll go find another pair of wings for you.

411
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,120
Look at this one.

412
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,349
These pair of wings

413
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:55,719
were obtained by a senior fifteen years ago
at the top of Magical Beast Mountain.

414
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,289
What kind of garbage are you selling?

415
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,610
I like these. I want them.

416
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,699
Really?

417
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:07,810
What do you like about them?

418
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,520
I just really like them. I'm taking these.

419
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,530
Just a minute. These pair of wings

420
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,960
are famous around the academy.

421
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,390
There's a rumor saying it's a Purple Cloud Bird,
a Five-Level Magical Beast.

422
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:22,200
But no one knows.
Countless experts have been asked

423
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,350
to use fire to roast them,
and an iron hammer to smash them.

424
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,920
None of them can produce a shape.

425
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,130
The skeleton is even harder than copper.

426
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:33,850
The Fight Qi is unable to penetrate it and unable
to bring it to life. It's like a piece of trash.

427
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:38,120
Previously, they have already passed them on to a dozen
or more people. They still haven't figured them out.

428
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,250
Believe me. He's deceiving you.
Just throw them away and leave. Ignore him.

429
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:45,580
Did I offend you? Why are you slandering me?

430
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,780
It's fine... Here's the money.

431
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,250
Okay.

432
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,140
Let's go.

433
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,100
Wealth cannot buy you happiness!

434
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,500
Xun'er, I bought these pair of wings at an 80% discount.

435
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,330
Do you know what they're all saying about you?

436
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,760
I know. Something like...

437
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,360
Bai Shan is pushing me into a do or die battle.
It's just as well.

438
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,360
Recently, everything I've bought has been discounted.

439
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:18,530
I suddenly feel every sect has been really kind to me.

440
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:23,120
If you see something you like, just buy it.
I'll go back first.

441
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,000
Go.

442
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,810
Hurry and go.

443
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,740
You go, too.

444
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,350
Are there already no more pellet medicines?

445
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,270
Can we talk to you?

446
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:05,370
Are you representing yourself as an individual
or representing the sect?

447
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,310
Representing as an individual.

448
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,130
Speak.

449
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,910
I myself feel that...

450
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:17,350
Recently, you've been going a little overboard.

451
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:20,770
- A little overboard.
- Yes, a little overboard.

452
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,690
No, I haven't.

453
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,490
In Black Point Region Forest,
you strategically beat Bai Shan.

454
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,710
Comparing the fight skills on stage
to win against Bai Shan

455
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,860
is another thing.

456
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,360
Now, comparing the strength,

457
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,810
there is no way you can use strategies.

458
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,970
Understand?

459
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:42,430
Bai Shan is an Eight-Star Fight Grand Master.
You're just a Three-Star Fight Master.

460
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:45,570
That's a difference of fifteen ranks!

461
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,830
So what you're saying is that you don't have faith in me.

462
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,600
It's not about whether we have faith or not, it's just
that you should stay in the academy for two more years.

463
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,710
Not just beating Bai Shan, I would believe
you could beat anyone. But not now.

464
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,590
We've thought of a good plan for you.

465
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:04,110
Han Xian and Bai Cheng have a good relationship.
Let him go clear the way

466
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,100
and explain you're not feeling well.
Postpone the fight.

467
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,140
Wait for him to leave the academy.
We'll then be able to brag about it.

468
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,620
That won't be a matter to deal with.
You won't be humiliated.

469
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,730
Look, Xiao Yan. Hu Jia has so much to say.

470
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,520
It proves he's considerate of you.

471
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,990
So, all of you want me to go and beg Bai Cheng.

472
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,240
I told you not to bring up Bai Cheng's name.

473
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,330
Even if we postpone it until graduation,

474
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,550
our Yan Sect's brothers will still not be able
to go down the Fen Tian Qi Training Pagoda.

475
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,970
Xiao Yan, do you really feel you can beat him?

476
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,230
And if I do win?

477
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,530
And what if you lose?

478
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,600
All the ones who fought with Bai Shan,

479
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,800
you know what happened to them. He's a lunatic!

480
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,950
At that time in the Black Point Region Forest,
you humiliated him to a point of extreme misery.

481
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:56,190
Also, you beat Bai Cheng into submission
in the water room.

482
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,210
Won't he take revenge?

483
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,430
Tell us. What's going to happen with Yan Sect
if you lose?

484
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:04,740
We've suffered untold hardships
in order to have a very good situation.

485
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,970
It will all become wasted!

486
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,860
Okay, I get it.

487
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,690
The few of you help me with something.

488
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,590
Call all the brothers in the sect to come here.

489
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,100
If you'll listen to our advice, that'll be easy to do.

490
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,910
Let's go. Let's go find the others.

491
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,580
Do you also feel that I will lose?

492
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,890
It's that I don't understand.

493
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:47,350
When we entered the first level of Fen Tian Qi Training
Pagoda, we already had difficulty breathing.

494
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:50,320
But you want to go to the underground cultivation
and refinement room instead.

495
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,370
Can you really be able to go?

496
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,990
Or else?

497
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,520
Or else...

498
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,700
I'll tell Father.

499
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,280
Don't. Why would you tell Father?

500
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,050
Xun'er,

501
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,800
if something were to happen to me,

502
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,800
if I should lose,

503
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,220
then take this Spatial Ring with you.

504
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,060
Don't say "if."

505
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,020
I won't accept this "if."

506
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,160
There's always an "if" in any situation.

507
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,650
When my mother passed away,

508
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:49,790
I found it strange to even see people selling fruit
when I roamed the streets.

509
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,820
My mother already passed away.

510
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,950
They're still selling fruit.

511
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,560
But I understood later.

512
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,340
There are some things
that will always be yours alone.

513
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,360
It doesn't concern the rest of the world.

514
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,820
Can't you wait a little longer?

515
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:13,420
I want to wait, too.

516
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,410
But this world won't wait for me.

517
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,690
The people who forced my mother to her death won't.

518
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,820
The people who forced my father
to abolish his own Fight Qi won't.

519
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,960
Those people who are thinking of all means to frame me,
all the more, won't.

520
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,360
The Blood Sect. The Soul Hall.

521
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:40,280
All the bad people in this world,

522
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,470
they won't wait for me.

523
