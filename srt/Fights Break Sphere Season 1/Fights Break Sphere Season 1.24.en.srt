3
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,000
Junior Apprentice Sister,
I'll copy this first.

4
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,400
After I'm done, then you can start.

5
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,100
Remember to change the sentences.

6
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,600
Our Yan Sect is going to end.

7
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Do you care?

8
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,800
What if I care?

9
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,200
Now this situation here

10
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,400
is called a situation which tops our ability.

11
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,800
We have to keep our heads low.

12
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,600
What is this?

13
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,800
The letter to report Mi Tengshan.

14
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,800
"I realize deeply.

15
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,000
Mi Tengshan of Soul Hall
has been a bad influence on our people..."

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,600
What is this?

17
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,200
Who wrote this?
When did he make any influences like that?

18
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,800
Then what should we do?

19
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,600
If we don't write this,
we won't make it through.

20
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,400
If you think Mi Tengshan is a good guy,

21
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
that's all right.

22
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,400
That Alchemist Guild is eager to make this public.

23
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,900
Then they can take him down as the leader of this.

24
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,200
Anyway, I won't write it.

25
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Will you all do it?

26
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,400
If we don't write it, will we get expelled?

27
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,200
Expelled?

28
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,600
That's easy to say. If we don't write it,
then we are all people of Soul Hall.

29
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,000
Not only you, but your whole family
will also be part of this.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,600
Don't be so naive.

31
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,600
They all say Elder Mi Tengshan is a traitor.

32
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,200
Where is the proof? Who saw the proof?

33
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,600
Yeah.

34
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,000
Junior Apprentice Sister, you are still young.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,100
You haven't been through a lot.

36
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,800
According to my experience,
when a situation is as urgent as this,

37
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,000
our first mission is what?

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,800
To protect ourselves.

39
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,000
Everything else is just nonsense.

40
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
The seniors outside,

41
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,000
they've had a problem with us for a very long time.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,600
You can't give them proof
that you support Mi Tengshan.

43
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,100
Right?

44
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,200
Elder Tengshan is awake now.

45
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,600
According to a reliable source,

46
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,800
Elder Mi Tengshan woke up yesterday.

47
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,200
But he had forgotten everything.

48
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,000
Xiao Yan.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,800
Xun'er, don't go.

50
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Why not?

51
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,600
His situation is still unclear now.

52
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,800
We shouldn't act rashly.

53
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,300
You coward!

54
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,800
If Brother Xiao Yan can be there, why can't I?

55
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,020
I'm holding you back,

56
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,800
so you can leave them alone.

57
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Why would I be interrupting them?

58
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,400
What if you went there, and Mi Tengshan saw you?

59
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,000
With so many people around, he will get nervous.

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,200
Then he won't be able to say anything.

61
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,600
Whose fault will that be?

62
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,600
My fault.

63
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,400
Can you please stop playing dumb?

64
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,800
They are already working on some ideas.

65
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
I saw it.

66
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,000
You were trapped by Elder Fa Ma.

67
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,400
That night...

68
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,600
There was also a bee that fell into the pot.

69
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,400
Its wings were wet, so it couldn't fly.

70
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,800
You saved that bee.

71
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Elder Fa Ma wants you to give in.

72
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,800
He said that the next day
there would be people coming from Soul Hall.

73
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,580
You couldn't see me, but I could see you.

74
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,400
But now you have to tell me

75
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,400
how many people do they have?
How much power do they have?

76
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,600
I can go to Yin City, I have my ways.

77
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,700
Elder, I can't just let people
humiliate you this way.

78
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Elder... Elder!

79
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,610
Sect Leader Xiao!

80
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,500
Elder Han wants to see you.

81
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,300
Student Xiao Yan,

82
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,170
how was the chat with Mi Tengshan?

83
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,400
Did you see these?

84
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,600
These are the letters that people wrote,
reporting on you.

85
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,200
Looks like people are quite observant.

86
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Mi Tengshan thinks you are very important.

87
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,600
The Soul Hall people... know who he is.

88
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,600
All right, I think you
have already made up your mind.

89
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,800
Didn't that Elder teach you
how to be a smart person? Huh?

90
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,600
So...

91
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,200
If you can tell me where he is,

92
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,900
I can be more forgiving of you.

93
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,000
Bai Cheng.

94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,500
Yes.

95
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,790
I remember Xiao Yan really likes
the Fen Tian Qi Training Pagoda.

96
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,400
Last time to fight for a practice room,

97
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,200
he even got into a fight with Bai Shan, right?

98
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,200
All right. Good!

99
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Lock him in on the bottom floor.

100
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
If you like practicing there,
then practice as much as you want.

101
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,900
Take him away now!

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,800
Elder Han.

103
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,600
The rest of Xiao Yan's sect...

104
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,000
Take them down and lock them into
the Fen Tian Qi Training Pagoda, too.

105
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,100
Go.

106
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,000
What is this?

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,200
Why are you taking us?

108
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,800
Even Mi Tengshan gave in.

109
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,200
Stop fighting it.

110
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,400
Lock them up separately.

111
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,200
In case they try collaborating on a story.

112
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,500
Brother Xiao Yan, are you all right?

113
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,300
Take her away.

114
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,400
You can only stay here in this place
for at most eight hours.

115
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Tomorrow when I come back,

116
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,200
if you still haven't figured out
the right thing to do,

117
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,900
then you'll just burn to ashes.

118
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,400
You listen to me, keep a close eye on them.

119
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,600
If you lose any one of them,
I'll make sure you regret it.

120
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
You understand?

121
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,800
- Yes.
- Yes.

122
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,100
Good.

123
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,900
People can't make it more than eight hours
at the bottom of the tower.

124
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,200
You can't either?

125
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,000
At our level, we can.

126
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,200
But them, it's hard to tell.

127
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Then that depends on their destiny.

128
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,800
Mi Tengshan was locked in just now.

129
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
So that means

130
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,400
we can finally get some peace.

131
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,400
Snake King.

132
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,400
Mo Basi,

133
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,400
this is very urgent, so let's make it short.
I'm in big trouble right now.

134
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:10,000
Snake King, if you need us to do anything, just say it.

135
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,200
I'm hoping your Snake people can hide in Jia Nan Academy

136
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,800
and then break into this tower and get us out of here.

137
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,200
Snake King, are you kidding us?

138
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,600
This tower is burning hot, but I can manage.

139
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,200
However, my friends can't.

140
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,200
Snake King, first, don't rush.

141
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,000
Actually, there is one other way.

142
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,400
What way?

143
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Do you know what's under this training tower?

144
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,200
What?

145
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,800
Under here is an Earth Core Giant Python.

146
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,200
He is the ancestor of us Snakes.

147
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,600
He can surely help you.

148
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,800
This is so hot. I can't take it anymore.

149
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What's going on?

150
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,800
Snake Ancestor,

151
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,200
I will bring some people later to escape
through the underground tunnel.

152
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Please let us pass.

153
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:28,350
Also, can you create a disturbance for me?

154
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
What's going on?

155
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,400
What is this? This...

156
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,100
What is really going on?
Why is this happening?

157
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,400
Let's quickly go out and hide.

158
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,600
Quickly go! Hurry!

159
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,200
Hurry!

160
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,000
Snake! There is a snake!

161
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,200
Why are you panicking?

162
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Stop panicking! What's going on?

163
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,700
There is a snake inside! A giant snake!

164
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,600
How come this happened?

165
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,400
How come this happened?

166
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,200
Where are they?

167
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,400
With so many people, where did they all go?!

168
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,400
Be careful.

169
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,000
Come. Those up there, be careful.

170
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,800
Come. Come.

171
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,200
Be careful.

172
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,000
Come.

173
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,000
Be careful.

174
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,100
Here.

175
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,300
Be careful.

176
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,200
Come.

177
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,000
Elders, let's immediately set out.
I've investigated it.

178
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The tunnel below the tower connects
to the Black Point Region Forest.

179
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,800
See? These people knew that they were exposed,

180
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,400
so they have escaped! Let me tell you all

181
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,000
that if any of you dare to beg mercy for them again,

182
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,400
you will be punished as an accomplice! Let's go!

183
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,700
Go! Go! Keep up!

184
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,000
If we go out from here,
we should be in the Black Point Region Forest.

185
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,500
Be careful.

186
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,400
Elder Tengshan,

187
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,900
have you thought about
what we should do once we get out?

188
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,200
I initially planned to stay for a little while longer,

189
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
to let them not become alarmed too early.

190
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,600
I would then be able to see a lot of things more clearly.

191
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
I am not patient as you.

192
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,900
Giving bad people time is the worst.

193
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,000
Let us go to Yin City.

194
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,200
Emperor Ye Lan is my friend.

195
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,800
He was the one who personally told me
that your crime of an attempted assassination of the Emperor

196
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,200
was fabricated.

197
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,000
He also won't issue a decree
to investigate the Jia Nan Academy.

198
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,200
And also, the real spy of Soul Hall

199
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,600
is State Teacher Fa Ma.

200
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,400
What we should do now is to go to Yin City

201
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,300
and expose Elder Fa Ma.

202
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,400
Only after defeating him
can the academy be at peace again.

203
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,000
That person is already the Emperor.

204
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
How can he still be your friend?

205
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,600
I haven't been with him that frequently,

206
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,300
but I know that he's a person
who keeps his promises.

207
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,900
Let's go.

208
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Go.

209
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,500
Brother Xiao Yan, what direction should we go in?

210
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,210
There is light over there, so we should go there.

211
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,400
We can't. Outside that cave entrance
is the Black Point Region Forest

212
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
and there are some alchemists,
brought here by Elder Fa Ma,

213
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
guarding outside.

214
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,600
What should we do then?
Does that mean we can't go out anymore?

215
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
What should we do?
The exit is being guarded by them.

216
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,600
They are guarding the stump until the rabbit comes out.
Just waiting for us to fall into their trap.

217
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,400
I recall how,

218
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,400
when I was still the leader of the Medicine Sect,
I would just eat delicious food and drink good wine.

219
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,400
I could even flirt with my juniors and court my seniors.

220
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,400
After following you all,

221
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,600
my days have gone from bad to worse.

222
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,800
Try returning to your original path then.

223
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,400
You make it sound so easy.

224
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,400
Sect Leader Xiao, what now?

225
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,000
Elder Tengshan, has your body recovered now?

226
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,200
You want to get out by force?

227
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,600
Yes.

228
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,800
I don't think your chances of winning are huge.

229
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,200
I can't use my Fight Qi at all.

230
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,600
The people guarding the entrance
must be the trusted aides of Fa Ma.

231
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,700
Each one is a great master by themselves.

232
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
The best plan now is

233
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,300
to continue moving.

234
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,900
Let's go.

235
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,800
- Let's go. - If I'd have known,
I would have brought more water jugs from the academy.

236
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,800
You say so many silly things. Let's just go.

237
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,400
Be careful!

238
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,700
- Hao Tian!
- Be careful!

239
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,600
Are you all right?

240
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm so scared.
When will there be an end to this?

241
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,200
This lava river is getting closer to us.

242
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,200
That's right. The temperature is also going higher.

243
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,000
Not a chance! I don't want to become barbecued meat.

244
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,500
That won't happen.
We'll surely get out. Let's go, Hao Tian.

245
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
Let's go.

246
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,000
Be careful.

247
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,800
Let's go.

248
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,000
All these excuses!

249
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You people have guarded that place for three days.

250
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,600
You actually didn't discover anything?!

251
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,800
Have you checked inside the cave?

252
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,600
The place is connected to the Black Point Region Forest.

253
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,600
There is one cave opening which has lava,
so you won't be able to enter that one.

254
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Couldn't you have entered through the other entrance?!

255
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,200
Have you checked that area?!

256
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
We released a pursuer magical beast.

257
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,300
Within a ten mile radius,
it didn't find anything.

258
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,400
Did they become deities,

259
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,000
or ghosts?

260
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,460
Speak up!

261
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,080
It's all nonsense! How can the floor break?

262
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,210
Not to mention that snake.

263
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,150
The Earth Core Giant Python is so big,
how can it just disappear like that?

264
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,310
A couple of students and an old man.

265
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,080
And you couldn't keep them in there.

266
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,690
What have you been learning?

267
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,470
All right, all right, all right.

268
00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:00,340
Let me ask you this.
If you want to follow in Mi Tengshan's footsteps,

269
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,360
you can just admit it right now. I won't blame you!

270
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,140
All right?

271
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,220
Han Feng, it is not our job to lock people up.

272
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,380
There is no need for you to be like this.

273
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,360
Professor Ruo Lin,

274
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:24,140
you have been good friends with these fleeing students.

275
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,920
I think this time they made it.

276
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,520
You might have also helped them a lot, right? Hmm?

277
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,290
There is a high possibility of that.

278
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,120
The tower, right?

279
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,960
The floor was made from raw iron.

280
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,300
I'm just being honest.
Even if we worked together,

281
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,060
that floor can't be broken.

282
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,670
So, Elder Han,

283
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,910
you can't blame this

284
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,710
on other people.

285
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,040
Then how should I report this?

286
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,590
This is the mission we got from the State Teacher.

287
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,820
A mission for our whole academy.

288
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,720
The Emperor's decree stated
that we needed to lock these students up.

289
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,160
They fled; they ran away.
Now what should I tell them?

290
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,450
What should we say? How should we report this?

291
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:18,750
I think you and Teacher Ruo Lin

292
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,640
might have colluded with Mi Tengshan.

293
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,090
Tell me.

294
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:30,050
Are you partners?

295
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,660
No words? No words mean you admit it?

296
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,950
People, take them down below and interrogate them!

297
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,170
Take them down.

298
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:43,550
And spread the word.
If anyone sees Xiao Yan, kill him immediately!

299
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:48,070
Han Feng, this is the Jia Nan Academy,
not your Star Fall Pavillion!

300
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,160
Take her out.

301
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,250
Take them, take them, take them out!

302
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,690
Take them out!

303
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,930
I can walk.

304
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,800
Moles!

305
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,410
How many days have we been walking?

306
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:10,500
Two or three days, maybe more.

307
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,290
We have no room left to breathe, now.

308
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,040
If we keep walking,

309
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,620
not only Hao Tian, I might not make it.

310
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,320
How can that be true?

311
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,400
The lava is still burning,
so that means there's enough air for that.

312
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,950
Besides, you're still able to breathe and talk.

313
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,590
There must be another exit.

314
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,640
You all take a break, I'll go take a look.

315
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,930
Go carefully.

316
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:47,730
Sit. Let's take a rest.
If we keep walking, it might be too dangerous.

317
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:00,150
Hu Jia, are you scared crazy?

318
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:05,160
Ever since I met you all,
my life has become so colorful.

319
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,490
You add up all my years before now and
they haven't been as exciting as the past couple of months.

320
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,940
Yeah, it's been very exciting.

321
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,890
I always thought I would die in my bed.

322
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,820
Never expected to be baked to death by lava.

323
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,060
People, we all are going to die.

324
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:30,230
If I can die with you all, then that's not bad.

325
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,770
How long do we need to walk?

326
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:39,370
If we are not being baked to death,
there's a chance we may starve to death.

327
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,740
Rest assured.

328
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,930
At that point,
I will shove you right into the lava river.

329
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:49,390
No thank you.

330
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,300
But to die with you all,

331
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,280
that isn't so bad.

332
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,060
You all...

333
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,820
Elder Tengshan, why are you laughing?

334
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,410
If you are regretting now,

335
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,550
why escape from there in the first place?

336
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,170
Yeah.

337
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:16,210
Yeah what? If we didn't go,
we would have died in that tower anyway.

338
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,930
To keep walking means there is hope.

339
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:23,410
Elder Tengshan, do we still have any chance left?

340
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,390
Why did you ask that?

341
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:30,390
During the Alchemist Contest,
I even saw the Royal Family was infiltrated,

342
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:35,410
and even the State Teacher is a traitor,
by now our academy is corrupt, too.

343
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:38,720
There's only a few of us, what can we do?

344
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,840
We can't tell the people
that the State Teacher is a traitor.

345
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,670
And he is not even the real State Teacher.

346
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,560
They will only treat us like we are lunatics.

347
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:52,520
When evil attacks, if you insist on being a good person,

348
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,330
a lot of people will think you are deranged.

349
00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:00,740
After all, there are more cowards
in this world than brave people.

350
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,290
Like...

351
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,740
Like a torch in the dark.

352
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,040
You see it as being very lonely there, right?

353
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,870
But do you know what the shortcoming of evil is?

354
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:21,580
Evil wants us to be afraid,

355
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,220
because it's not as powerful as it says it is.

356
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,880
And it doesn't have many true loyal followers.

357
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,260
So, all you need to do is to fight the fear inside of you

358
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,450
and encourage the next person.

359
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,530
It's like when you use the fire of one torch

360
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,530
to light up the next one.

361
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:49,040
Tens, hundreds, thousands.

362
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:55,470
The darkness will be defeated.
And the evil will become a joke.

363
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,900
So, let's defeat evil.

364
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,820
Not being so scared is the most important weapon.

365
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,530
Good speech!

366
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,970
I found it!

367
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,870
I found the door.

368
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,910
- Water.
- Steamed bread.

369
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:28,840
- A bath.
- A bed!

370
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,680
Calm down.

371
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,370
Thank all the mighty gods.

372
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,790
I don't care about you guys.
I'm going in.

373
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,070
Dear customers, please come in.

374
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,940
Get some rest and then go.

375
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,220
Come, please come inside.

376
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,350
- Please.
- I can do this by myself.

377
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,110
Sure. I will prepare some food.

378
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,820
I will be right back.

379
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,290
- Elder Tengshan.
- Ice.

380
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:10,090
Xiao Yan, come and drink some water.

381
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:23,520
Elder Tengshan, what is this place?

382
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,530
Have you ever heard of this place?

383
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:31,090
I always thought this place didn't exist.

384
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,890
What do you mean?

385
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,910
Everyone, here is the food.

386
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,400
Quickly.

387
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,840
- Whoa!
- Wait.

388
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:50,070
We came out in a rush,
let's ask some questions before we just eat.

389
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:53,600
This food will be more reassuring by then.

390
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,360
Surely, you know the rules,
this is Villain Valley food.

391
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,110
If you say it's tasty, it is tasty.

392
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,110
Villain Valley?

393
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,630
You don't know about this?

394
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,570
Then why are you here?

395
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,730
I... We...

396
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,820
No, no, no, don't tell me.

397
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,080
People who can make it to this place,
all have nine lives.

398
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,580
No matter what you did out there,
it has nothing to do with us.

399
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,970
After you eat this, move on into the valley

400
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,070
and live on your skills.

401
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,470
Go into... what valley?

402
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,180
I always thought this place didn't exist.

403
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,650
But it actually does.

404
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:42,160
I don't know when it started,
all the outlaws, all the escaped criminals,

405
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,860
as long as you are here,
people on the outside will stop chasing you.

406
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:52,790
I heard that in this town, you kill for a living.

407
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,790
You are right.

408
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:04,980
This Villain Valley was founded on murdering people.

409
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:10,200
If you don't kill, then the name means nothing.

410
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,930
Then we won't eat. Let's go right now.

411
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,760
All right then.

412
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,710
Let me have one more sip.

413
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:31,410
All right, all right. It's fine.

414
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,920
Anyway, we'll find another exit.

415
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,950
You are right about that. From here, go west.

416
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:49,420
And then you walk about... six months,
you will finally get out.

417
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,030
All right, all right. Stop the bluffing.

418
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,770
People, go as you wish.

419
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,410
All the dried up bodies you will see on the road,
are customers who left here before.

420
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,790
Be sure to give them my regards.

421
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:09,230
He is right. According to historical records,
the underworld is like this.

422
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:12,480
Then besides living in the valley or going west,

423
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,880
we have no other options?

424
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,360
I don't know either.

425
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,790
Waiter, serve the food.

426
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,300
Very well then!

427
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,810
Even if this is Villain Valley,
let's still go outside and walk around.

428
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,560
Eat first.

429
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,590
Elder, is there another exit here in Villain Valley?

430
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:05,680
I only read about it when I was still just very young.

431
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,900
As for the details, I don't clearly know.

432
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,410
After all, this place has existed for hundreds of years.

433
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:18,780
This is the darkest underground world here
on the Fight Qi Continent.

434
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,580
Right now, we are considered Imperial outlaws, too.

435
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:33,770
Let's just make do since we're here already.
It can't be any worse than jumping into that river of lava.

436
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,730
Those words are so right.

437
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:52,309
How about it, customers? Are you satisfied?
What else do you want to order?

438
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:54,830
No need. How much is our meal?

439
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,520
Here. Two battles.

440
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,810
Our shop is quite nice, right.
I let you all eat first before paying.

What does this mean?

443
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,560
This is the rule in our village. For food, drinks,
clothes, and daily needs, we don't accept any money.

444
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,390
All are based on your fight rank. The strongest wins.

445
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:22,420
- How about it? Which two people in your group
will join in the competition? - I will.

446
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,390
Wait a minute. Who is our opponent?

447
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:31,810
Heaven, Earth, Black, and Yellow.
A Yellow Mark, a fourth level Fight Practitioner.

448
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:34,430
My shop is not that good. We only get paired with that mark.

449
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:37,070
If you are ever able to fight in a Heaven Marked Battle,

450
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:40,290
you will be able to have good wine and dainty dishes,

451
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:43,220
the best cuisines in this world.

452
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,270
My name is Hu Jia. His name is Han Xian.

453
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,510
Write our names down.

454
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,920
- Don't write my name...
- Open the door.

455
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,200
Good. Everyone, this way, please.

Once you enter Villain Valley,

it means you're saying farewell to your past.

459
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,940
Although people here won't ask about worldly affairs,

460
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,990
anyone who enters must have the intention
to repent for their sins.

461
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,770
So please use a new identity

462
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,780
and start over.

463
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,200
How come your Villain Valley has so many rules?

464
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,920
Does it look good?

465
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,960
Please.

466
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,950
This place is so narrow. How will we fight?

467
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,380

00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,260
♫ To fulfill my promise,
I conceal an arrow inside my gold-threaded sleeve ♫

488
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,080
♫ Being mesmerized for a moment
by the purgatory and the lava ♫

489
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:21,060
♫ Jumping in with a leap with
neither grace nor resentment ♫

490
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,790
♫ Young but bothered by undiminishing worries ♫

491
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:29,410
♫ Worries adding on to worries,
the mountain calls and the sea roars ♫

492
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:32,200
♫ Rushing headlong even if
heaven is narrow and earth is small ♫

493
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,990
♫ Chaos in fighting the evil and foreign forces ♫

494
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:41,120
♫ Disturbances that no one can escape from ♫

495
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,400
♫ Disadvantaged but don’t belittle or take advantage ♫

496
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,520
♫ of the young ♫

497
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,350
♫ Heroes never ask for names ♫

498
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,720
♫ or titles ♫

499
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,040
♫ On the board of notables ♫

500
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,620
♫ I’ll showcase my martial arts skills ♫

501
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,530
♫ It’s opportune to take advantage of youth ♫

502
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:05,260
♫ and become famous sooner ♫

503
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,620
♫ Proud and aloof, holding a heavy sword in one hand ♫

504
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:22,320
♫ Young but bothered by undiminishing worries ♫

505
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,110
♫ Worries adding on to worries, ♫

506
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:28,130
♫ the mountain calls and the sea roars ♫

507
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:30,900
♫ Rushing headlong even if
heaven is narrow and earth is small ♫

508
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,580
♫ Chaos in fighting the evil and foreign forces ♫

509
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:39,460
♫ Disturbances that no one can escape from ♫
