3
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,890
When we were children, Auntie took you
to Dragon Island so we met once.

4
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,010
That was so many years ago.

5
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:49,520
Xun'er, are you married?

6
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:15,490
This set of moves was created by the Fight God.
It was the foundation of the Fight Qi.

7
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,540
No matter what Fight Techniques you practice in the future,

8
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,490
you should practice this set of moves
in the morning after you wake up.

9
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,570
This will make your blood run smoother
and make you have a solid foundation.

10
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,770
Carry on.

11
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,040
Mother, it's getting windy.
You should go back to the bed chamber.

12
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,610
Mother?

13
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,360
Mother?

14
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,990
When I was 7, I could walk on people's roofs

15
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,540
and jump from here to there.

16
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,680
Then I would jump up to the city wall from there.

17
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,000
I would spend whole days up there.

18
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,160
But now?

19
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,930
Yanran,

20
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,790
all my life,

21
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,190
what have I done?

22
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,060
How come I became old all of a sudden?

23
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,470
Don't be silly.

24
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,680
Our grandchildren are now learning Fight Techniques.

25
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,000
How could we not get old?

26
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,770
What about our six sons?

27
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,200
The oldest one took my place
and became the prime minister.

28
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,470
The 2nd and 3rd joined the Alchemist Guild.

29
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,090
The 4th and the 6th have expanded
their business to Yin City and the desert.

30
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,730
Only the 5th is at home.

31
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:57,270
Soon he'll be old enough
and then they will all have left home.

32
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,380
It feels like this life has been pretty easy.

33
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,380
What are you doing?

34
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,280
Isn't this Master Xiao?
We have just escaped from the Villain Valley

35
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,630
and we are going to Yin City
to explain ourselves in front of the Emperor.

36
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,950
Why didn't you ask me to join you?

37
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,820
You have spent your whole life being a loser.
Why should we?

38
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,490
Brother Xiao Yan, you should go back.

39
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,940
Xun'er.

40
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,170
Xun'er, why are you all so young?

41
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,410
Take me with you!

42
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,320
Xiao Yan, why are you trying to go
with those children somewhere?

43
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,240
Come back.

44
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,730
You're lying to me!

45
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,690
This is not how I should spend my life.

46
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,900
I didn't plan any tricks
and I didn't have any sons.

47
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,400
I don't want to be a loser!

48
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,620
I... I am going with them!

49
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,740
Don't go.

50
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,430
Yanran, I spent my whole life in vain.

51
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,200
I regret it so much.

52
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,360
I can't be mindful of your business now.

53
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,630
I'm sorry.

54
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,830
Xun'er!

55
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,800
What do you think? Pretty good life?

56
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,960
Do you like it? I have made it up for you.

57
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,360
This is false. It's an illusion.

58
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,860
You almost tricked me.

59
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,030
Which one is the illusion?

60
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,550
Being hunted in Villain Valley
and unable to see the future?

61
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,550
Or living a happy contented life?

62
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,770
Everything is an illusion.

63
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,120
If you like it, I can allow you to stay there.

64
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,430
You will have a happy long life and
become an important official. Isn't that nice?

65
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,760
But that's not true. That's not true.

66
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,580
Remember. You will belong to me in one day.

67
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,760
Here, drink.

68
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,990
That's fine, too. Have some peace
and quietness before the big battle.

69
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,920
It is the last battle today.

70
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:22,070
Yes. You're really unpredictable.

71
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,450
Even I misjudged you.

72
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,610
Remember your promises.

73
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,250
Did you know?
I have a lot of friends out there.

74
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,270
They like to come to the Valley,
do some gambling and relax.

75
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,200
They're all important people that I cannot offend.

76
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,090
Friends outside?

77
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,800
Sounds about right.
Gambling chickens, dogs, and crickets.

78
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,400
Nothing can be compared to watching people kill each other.

79
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,420
Every class has their own game.

80
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,270
Here, I keep my words.

81
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:04,560
On the outside, it may not be like that.

82
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,820
Say it. What do you want from me?

83
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,890
My friends on the outside are very unhappy
that you didn't kill anyone.

84
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,060
Is that so?

85
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,160
The only thing that matters is that I win.
Why do I have to kill anyone?

86
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
In Villain Valley,

87
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,590
you cannot have any sympathy.

88
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,380
That will break my rules.

89
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,320
In the Valley, only the strong ones get respect.

90
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,040
Sympathy is like an epidemic.

91
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,330
A little bit can ruin my game rules.

92
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,640
Game rules?

93
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Aren't all your rules about wearing a mask...

94
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,700
and killing each other?

95
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,390
Warrior Xiao, if you win this game,

96
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,120
I will send all your friends out of here.

97
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,330
As for you... it's all up to you.

98
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,550
You want to back out of the pact?

99
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,630
Two people in a match. One has to die.

100
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,240
I have to give something to my friends
who are above the ground.

101
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,640
I would like to see what kind of face...

102
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,770
is hiding behind this mask.

103
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,770
See you on the battlefield.

104
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,200
You lost.

105
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,400
As long as I'm alive, I didn't lose.

106
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,600
Why didn't you kill him?

107
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,800
I will not be your slave.

108
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,500
What's wrong with being my slave?

109
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,000
I can make you the Master of Soul Hall,

110
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,200
and the Leader of the Fight Qi Continent.

111
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,000
It doesn't matter if I get killed.

112
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,200
I am just happy to beat you.

113
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,200
You...

114
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You are not Hun Miesheng?

115
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I am you. You are me.

116
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:09,420
Xiao Yan, you're raving mad.

117
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,190
You killed yourself!

118
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,100
You killed yourself!

119
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,800
Yes. My teacher once said,

120
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,800
in a person's life,

121
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,600
the biggest demon inside you is yourself.

122
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,800
It's easy to defeat others.

123
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,300
It's very difficult to defeat yourself.

124
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,000
I finally understand.

125
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,000
I don't care if your name is Hun Miesheng,

126
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
or Xiao Yan.

127
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,800
You're the first person
I've ever killed in my life.

128
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,900
Medicine Elder!

129
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,300
Medicine Elder!

130
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,700
Close the door and come in.

131
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,700
Do you want some porridge?

132
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,800
Medicine Elder, I have been looking for you.

133
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,040
Why come looking for me?

134
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,590
I know I'm wrong now.

135
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,300
I will not use the Soul Hall practices again.

136
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,800
Close the door!

137
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,700
What's this?

138
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,900
This is your life light.

139
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,900
If it goes out, it means you're dead.

140
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,600
Medicine Elder!

141
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,000
How did you get all these wounds?

142
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,100
You know why there's a hurricane here?

143
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,000
The hurricane is your evil Qi.

144
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,300
Every time, as long as I can fight it off,

145
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,400
I can pluck some of your evil Qi out.

146
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,600
Now the hurricane is almost over,
which means you are quickly understanding it.

147
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,620
I knew you were the one who was suffering for me.

148
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,600
Elder Tengshan said
my evil Qi had invaded my organs.

149
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,100
I should have been dead.

150
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:42,000
But someone was removing my evil Qi.

151
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,060
I knew it had to be you.

152
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,100
But I couldn't find you anywhere.

153
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,300
Medicine Elder, it was all my fault.

154
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,300
Everyone meets this kind of bad luck in their lives.

155
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,400
But seeing that
you still have kindness left in your heart,

156
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,000
I am pleased. It's well worth the wounds.

157
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,700
But I didn't make it through.

158
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,800
I have probably already died in Villain Valley.

159
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,300
Oh? Dead?

160
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,680
But this light hasn't gone out.

161
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,600
That last technique of Hun Miesheng,
have you learned it?

162
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,600
Medicine Elder, I...

163
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,600
You have passed the test by not succumbing
to the evil temptation of Soul Hall.

164
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,200
You didn't become a bad person.

165
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,600
You can now use techniques learned from
both good and evil people if they are useful.

166
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,500
Medicine Elder, I have thought it through.

167
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,000
I will never use Soul Hall techniques again.

168
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,400
Enough! Get out! You're so full of crap.

169
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,300
You will be beaten to death
if you don't get out soon.

170
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:57,200
Remember: If you haven't reached the middle of the river,
just start the attack from there.

171
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Good! Good!

172
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,000
Brother Xiao Yan! You're amazing!

173
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,200
Have you seen enough?

174
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,800
Go home!

175
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,600
Go home! Go home!

176
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,300
Go home!

177
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,270
All your friends seemed to have left.

178
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,040
What do you think?

179
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,910
Come out with me.

180
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,700
Nobody wants to leave except you.

181
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,940
Those who have made it to the Top 10
don't want to leave either.

182
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,920
I don't understand why you have to go.

183
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:26,010
When I discovered the so-called rules
and any dignity here...

184
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:29,590
are for us to be treated like festival animals,

185
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,950
I stopped lying to myself.

186
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,280
Do you think that what's waiting for you up there...

187
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,480
is a better world than Villain Valley?

188
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,570
Don't forget the whole world up there is waiting to get you.

189
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:48,290
Once you show your faces on the Fight Qi Continent,
you will be arrested.

190
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,430
What I have done...

191
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,180
doesn't need to be judged by life and death.

192
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,440
If you come to Villain Valley again,

193
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,290
I will give you free food and accommodation
and you won't even have to fight anyone,

194
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:07,610
in case you ever stir things up again here.

195
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,710
We're... not the same kind of people.

196
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,150
We are finally out.

197
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,580
What's next?

198
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,550
You all go back to the Academy.
I will go to Yin City.

199
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,620
I will find out who's behind all this.

200
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,020
We are going with you.

201
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:47,230
No. Too many people will scare away the enemy.
You all go back to school.

202
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:51,210
Elder Tengshan, please take care of them.

203
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,010
What's wrong?

204
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:59,320
Congratulations, you're so young

205
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,730
and yet you made it through that demonic land.

206
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,560
That's all because of you.
You have worried about me so much.

207
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,190
Have you met the person
who's been removing the evil Qi for you?

208
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,590
I have.

209
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,310
He told me the biggest enemy in a person's life...

210
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,160
is always themselves.

211
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,420
As long as one can defeat their inner demon,

212
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:25,050
even if the darkness comes,
they shouldn't be afraid.

213
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,710
Let's go.

214
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:41,210
[Wanted: Xiao Yan, Xiao Xun'er, Hao Tian]

215
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,850
Young Master!

216
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,600
I can still drink!

217
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,210
Master, you're drunk.

218
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,540
I am not!

219
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,540
Slow down, Young Master.

220
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:01,430
- I am not drunk!
- Young Master.

221
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,650
Go home!

222
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,790
Son-in-law! Son-in-law!

223
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,390
Elder Hai!

224
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:17,180
Son-in-law! Long time no see.

225
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,830
My daughter said you would come here

226
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,250
and you're really here!

227
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,680
Elder Hai!

228
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,340
- How is she? Is she all right?
- Yes, yes, yes.

229
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,590
I am here.

230
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:32,470
What is there for you to worry about?
What about you?

231
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:35,140
What are you doing here in Fa Ma Manor?

232
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,220
It's a long story.
Ever since the Alchemist Competition ended,

233
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,120
everything has gone wrong.

234
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,800
As soon as we got back to school, people accused us
of being traitors and working for Soul Hall.

235
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,560
We were imprisoned by Han Feng
and almost got killed by him.

236
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,470
How did you escape from there?

237
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,490
We found a secret passage
under the Fen Tian Qi Training Pagoda.

238
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,430
We just escaped from there.

239
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:00,330
Oh, right. You've been in Yin City
for a while lately.

240
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,190
Have you found out anything?

241
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:07,500
You reminded me of something strange
that occurred recently.

242
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,650
A few days ago,

243
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:15,510
I bumped into a soldier patrolling on the street.

244
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,870
I thought something was wrong with him
as soon as I touched him.

245
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:21,150
Guess what? He was not made of living flesh.

246
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:24,000
Not made of living flesh? What does that mean?

247
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,920
I was curious, too, so I brought him home.

248
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,470
So scary.

249
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,590
That's weird.
This person doesn't eat, drink, or sleep.

250
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,860
He also bites people.

251
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:40,560
I studied it and found out
he's been dead for a long time.

252
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,400
He's got a hole in his belly that's
completely empty inside. He looks like a person,

253
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,530
but he's just a human shell that can walk.

254
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,920
The blood alliance puppets from Soul Hall.

255
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,580
Whoever made him is controlling him.
Even if you shattered all his bones,

256
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,360
he'd still bite people while he's lying on the ground.

257
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:59,170
I discovered something similar in the palace before.

258
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:02,900
The maids, guards, and eunuchs...

259
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,400
What?

260
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,630
Elder Hai, I have found out...

261
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,590
when Elder Tengshan disappeared.

262
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:13,090
State Teacher Fa Ma is behind all this.

263
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:17,130
That blood alliance puppet should have
something to do with him, too.

264
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,930
To be honest, I am here today...

265
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,390
to get into Fa Ma Manor...

266
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,210
to get to the bottom of this.

267
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,300
You?

268
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,700
I should do it for you.

269
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,740
If something happens to you,
my daughter will kill me.

270
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,350
How could you? It's too dangerous.

271
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:40,390
If you really want to thank me,
treat my daughter well. All right?

272
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,350
I have a whistle that I will blow
as soon as I see Fa Ma.

273
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:49,700
When you hear the sound,
you come looking for me. Understand?

274
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,300
I understand.

275
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,350
- I'm leaving then.
- Take care.

276
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,290
Fine then.

277
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,970
- How many people are here?
- Thirty.

278
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,460
Count them again.

279
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,240
Blood Sect?
Looks like something is wrong with Fa Ma.

280
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,240
I thought you said thirty.
Why is there thirty-one?

281
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,910
Impressive? Are you a Fight Fairy?

282
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,080
I guessed right. It was controlled
by the Blood Sect's evil tricks.

283
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,630
Someone got in. Catch him!

284
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:35,870
Looking for more fights? Sure. I will fight you.

285
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,360
Six Fight Fairies and four Fight Gods?

286
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,270
I am really flattered.

287
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,030
Old man Nalan?

288
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,690
I surrender!

289
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,760
Greetings, State Teacher.

290
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,330
You're really smart to be able
to find your way in here.

291
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:03,560
But your path has come to an end.

292
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,830
Hai Bodong, at your age,

293
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:12,270
you should be resting at home
instead of meddling around here.

294
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,420
I have always admired you.

295
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,460
When I was young,
I always wanted to be your friend.

296
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,100
I finally have my chance now that I'm old.

297
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:27,230
Everyone says Ice Emperor Hai Bodong
is superior to everyone.

298
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,760
Depends on the person.

299
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,290
I like to treat people differently.

300
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:38,000
Good. You take your pick then.

301
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,490
Do you want to be a living puppet

302
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:43,150
or a dead one?

303
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:47,390
I don't understand what you mean.
It's far too deep.

304
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:50,860
I will make you an alliance puppet.

305
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:54,410
You should feel honored.

306
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,300
This has nothing to do with me.

307
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,110
My daughter fell in love with some stupid lad.

308
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,370
He asked for my help.

309
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:07,730
You should show some mercy
and not put yourself on my level.

310
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:12,129
The lad you're talking about...
is it Xiao Yan?

311
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,050
Tell me where he is.

312
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,320
This... I can't tell you this.

313
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,120
If I tell you, my daughter will make a scene.

314
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,600
I have a family treasure
I would like to dedicate to you.

315
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,210
Can you then let me go?

316
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,870
- What is it?
- Let me look for it.

317
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,179
I brought it with me.

318
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:36,609
Wait a second. I brought it.

319
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,990
You're just a State Teacher.
I can defeat you.

320
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,800
Master Hai, it's not nice to do a sneak attack.

321
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,220
You... So what?

322
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,530
I am no hero.

323
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:15,050
If I can kill you once, I can kill you twice!

324
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,780
Old man Nalan, I didn't go to your funeral.

325
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,560
But I still need to say goodbye.

326
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,390
I will burn paper money to you on holidays.

327
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,400
Break apart!

328
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,100
What's going on?
Why are there two Fa Mas?

329
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,980
Are they fake?

330
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,420
But looking at his Fight Qi,
it didn't look fake.

331
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:59,350
This... You again?

332
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,890
Smart. You found your way to here, too.

333
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,930
But now, your path has truly come to an end.

334
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:14,610
Proceed! Let me enjoy the show!

335
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,680
Forget about it. I will just surrender.

336
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,820
I will be exhausted if I keep fighting.

337
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,780
State Teacher, it just occurred to me that...

338
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,770
I still have some magical crystals taken
from demons that are a thousand years old.

339
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:48,760
Also, I have a map of the Fight God's tomb.
I will give it all to you.

340
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,130
State Teacher? State Teacher? State Teacher?

341
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,340
I have many blood alliance puppets,

342
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,760
but I don't have many Fight Emperors.

343
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,430
Relax.

344
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,120
I will do it myself.

345
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,550
You are a pervert.

346
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,890
And you talk too much.

347
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,420
Pervert! Pervert!

348
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,590
A whistle?

349
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:34,800
- You have someone else outside?
- No. No. No.

350
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,180
Elder Hai?

351
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,530
Elder Hai?

352
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,570
You... Who's the one outside?

353
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,420
Why are there two of you?

354
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:53,690
Those are all me, but also not me.

355
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,780
Xiao Yan, I was just about to go find you.

356
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,970
Then you came running in here by yourself.

357
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:06,590
Where's Mi Tengshan? Why isn't he with you?

358
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,920
Elder Tengshan is fine.

359
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,230
Relax. He will come looking for you.

360
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:15,770
Good. I will wait for him then.

361
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:21,470
It's just...
now I'm about to make you a blood alliance puppet.

362
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,710
Do you want to be one while you're alive...

363
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,790
or when you're dead?

364
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,660
You're already so old.

365
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,790
Still so immature.

366
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:48,200
You're different. So young, and so bold.

367
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,860
I am not only bold.

368
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,020
I also like to learn.

369
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,140
Look, I am about to die.

370
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,920
Can you tell me...

371
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,690
how you make alliance puppets?

372
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:08,980
There's a lot to it.

373
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,860
Some require cutting up
and taking out what's inside.

374
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,280
For some, I don't have to do anything to the body,

375
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,210
I can just take over the consciousness of living people.

376
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,380
Which kind do you want to be?

377
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,240
So impressive.

378
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:26,930
No wonder they say blood alliance puppets
are the secret of Soul Hall

379
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:30,190
and the scariest thing on Fight Qi Continent.
