3
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,430
You will understand once you become the Leader.

4
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,700
We're such a large clan,

5
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,900
and all its responsibilities will fall on you.

6
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,520
How can you be free?

7
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,620
Be good. Don't cry.

8
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,020
Grandfather, I'll remember your words.

9
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll tell you Nalan Clan's secret.

10
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,010
Come here.

11
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,200
This— Father's health is weak.

12
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,800
You all return first. Return.

13
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
If we have anything to say,

14
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,400
I'll send you word.

15
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,800
All right. Stop trying to boast about being Eldest Brother.

16
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,300
- No, its—
- Does Father only have you?

17
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,200
- That's right. We respect you for being Eldest Brother.
- Look at you.

18
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,100
When you split up the inheritance,
you should leave some crumbs for us.

19
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,500
That's right. Don't you agree?

20
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,400
I heard his illness was cured by the Essence Flame.

21
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,500
How did he contract it again?

22
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
I remember that last time
he had to recover for months.

23
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,400
This time, he's dying in an instant?

24
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,000
- Look, look.
- Eldest Brother, you can't be like this.

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,200
Storytellers or operas
don't even make up stories like this.

26
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,700
Look at you.

27
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,900
Say, you're standing here
and blocking the two of us.

28
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,400
But you let that silly little girl inside?
If Father's breath stops...

29
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,400
Who will take revenge?
How will we split up the inheritance?

30
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,800
Who will plan the funeral?

31
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,300
You know nothing.

32
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,000
And you're claiming yourself the Eldest Brother?

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,800
These are Father's instructions.

34
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,400
Just wait a bit more.
Just wait a bit more, all right?

35
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,600
In a bit, Father will have his plans.

36
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,000
What plans?

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,500
- There really are plans.
- Sure, sure. Just let us in.

38
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,200
Move! Move! Go inside!

39
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,800
Let me in!

40
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Father! Father!

41
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,600
Your sons are all waiting outside.

42
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,200
- Third Master.
- That's right!

43
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,400
- Father!
- Be quieter.

44
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,780
Sure, sure. Eldest Brother,

45
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
you lead the way.
The three of us will enter.

46
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,200
A son caring about his father is just right and proper.

47
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Right.

48
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,600
All right, all right. Listen to me.

49
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,300
Second Uncle, Third Uncle,
Grandfather asks for you to come in.

50
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,200
Hurry up.

51
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,900
Go. Go. Go in.

52
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,600
Father.

53
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,800
- Everyone is worried about your condition.
- That's right.

54
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,200
You look better.

55
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,100
Sit down.

56
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,200
The position of the 19th Nalan Leader

57
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,000
has been passed down to Yanran.

58
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,800
Kowtow now.

59
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,400
Father, she—

60
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,200
She's still a child.

61
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,300
Father, are you muddled?

62
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,800
In these past years, it has been me

63
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,800
who has been following you
to fight with the Blood Sect and Soul Hall.

64
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,300
I've thrown away half of my life.

65
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,800
But now you want me to kowtow to her?

66
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,600
This leg of mine,

67
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,100
when I got caught by those jerks in Blood Sect,

68
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,300
it was poisoned and I cut it off myself.

69
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,600
If you want me to kowtow to her,
you first have to ask whether my leg wants to or not!

70
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Every wound on my body is for this clan.

71
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,400
But she... She's just a silly little girl

72
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,700
who grew up with protection.
She doesn't even know what Soul Hall looks like.

73
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,800
You passed on the leader position to her?

74
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,230
Second Brother,

75
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,400
look at you.

76
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,000
You're already a broken man.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Why are you still saying so much?

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yanran was chosen when Father was muddled.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,600
This is called a false order.
There's no need to follow it.

80
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,500
I've been righteous my whole life.
How did I give birth to fools like you?

81
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,400
That's enough, Father. Stop acting.

82
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,800
You can entrust the rest to Third Brother and I.

83
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,900
We'll promise to cry properly.

84
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,000
Properly— Ai—

85
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,060
Why have all eight of his guards come?

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,400
These eight men are the Leader's Iron Guards.

87
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,000
In the future they will take orders only from you, Yanran.

88
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,200
If the two of you still refuse to come to your senses,

89
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,000
then you can leave along with me.

90
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,700
Father, are you saying that you want to kill your own sons?

91
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,420
Are you crazy?

92
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,200
Thousands of coffins exit the door.

93
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,600
This family is thriving.

94
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,600
The father dies but the sons live.

95
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,400
While the grandchild lives,
the grandparent will be gone.

96
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,800
In this world,
there isn't any person that won't die.

97
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:20,200
The new clan leader has been set.
I'm helping her smooth the way.

98
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,300
This...

99
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I, Nalan Yan, bow to the 19th Clan Leader Nalan Yanran.

100
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,200
- I'm willing to make a blood oath.
- I'm willing to make a blood oath.

101
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,800
I'm willing to follow Clan Leader's command

102
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,600
to guard the clan and fight off foreign enemies.

103
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,400
Use my body as a wall.
Use my bone as my sword.

104
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,000
Use my blood as my food.
I won't surrender until death.

105
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,400
The heavens are to be my witness.

106
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,000
If I dare to be disloyal,
I will be a slave forever

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and fall into the Demon Realm for an eternity.
There is no ending to this punishment.

108
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,180
Rise up.

109
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,100
Leader, please rest.

110
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,760
Father, you can rest

111
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,700
while the three of us will be out there.

112
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,600
Go, go, go.

is here to pay his respect to the deceased.

Disciples of the Cloud Mist Sect
came to give their condolences!

Come here.

147
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,230
When did the message of the Master's death
go to the palace?

148
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,920
Between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m.

149
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,960
You were in the palace.
What did the Emperor say?

150
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,420
Speak up!

151
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:46,750
The Emperor said we should wait for his order
now that the affairs in the Nalan family aren't clear.

152
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,420
Listen to this!

153
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,230
You have been crying for the wrong reason.

154

Leader died all of a sudden.
The successor's position wasn't clear.

155
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,560
A little girl became a minister.

156
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,670
The Emperor won't be happy about this.

157
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,420
Third Brother, the three of us already kowtowed yesterday.

158
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,260
Why are you behaving like this now?

159
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,910
Did I kowtow? Huh?

160
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,090
How could I not know that?

161
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,550
In four generations of the Nalan family,
there are three Prime Ministers.

164
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:27,750
Just because of this,
we have to distinguish right from wrong.

165
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,800
But now,

166
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,780
the old man left so early.

167
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,240
He made a girl his successor
when he wasn't of clear mind before he died.

168
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,830
If the Emperor doesn't recognize her,
how can our friends recognize her?

169
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,720
If the Nalan family's foundation is shaken by this

170
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:48,770
and we get laughed at,
how can we be a role model for the world?

171
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:54,420
In my opinion, you should all stop crying.

172
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,760
The most urgent thing should be
choosing the head of the clan.

173
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,670
This is the first thing. Pick a Leader.

174
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,500
Yes! I support you. Elect a Leader again.

175
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,600
Elect a Leader!

176
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,680
- Elect a Leader!
- Why are you yelling?

177
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,210
His Highness Prince Ye Lan is here!

178
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,360
"Nalan Jie was loyal to his country all his life."

179
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,970
"He was a pillar of our empire."

180
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,690
"I am truly sad now that he's gone."

181
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,690
"I hereby award your family, fifty taels each
of gold and silver. One hundred bolts of plain silk."

182
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:15,330
"A quilt with the Buddhist Lotus Sutra sewn upon it.
This is to help with the funeral."

183
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:21,070
I, Nalan Yanran, the Leader of the Nalan Clan, thank you.

184
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,290
So it's you, beauty.

185
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:35,620
- You have gotten much taller.
- Yes.

186
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,240
This is so great.
Our empire needs a female minister...

187
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,840
as young and pretty as you are.

188
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,310
I will now read the Emperor's decree.

189
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,670
"The new leader of the Nalan clan,

190
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:06,640
Nalan Yanran, pretty on the outside
and virtuous on the inside."

191
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,370
"She shall take over her grandfather's position

192
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:14,930
and become the Prime Minister of the Empire."

193
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,300
"This becomes effective immediately."

194
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,920
Our family thanks His Majesty.

195
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,630
Aren't you going to walk me out?

196
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,800
[Nalan Hall]

197
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,290
I was so bored in the Palace.

198
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,330
- It's fun to come outside.
- Yes.

199
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,550
Don't be afraid of being the Prime Minister.

200
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,600
I will teach you.

201
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,020
I'll be thankful for your teaching.

202
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,460
Actually, it's like playing house.

203
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,060
If I say something's good,
you will say it's good, too.

204
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,510
If anyone objects,

205
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,160
just beat him.

206
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:02,730
That's how you maintain peace in the world.

207
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,190
Yes.

208
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:12,160
I came out in private today.
I will see you again in a few days.

209
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,110
Remember, you owe me a favor.

210
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,340
Elder Tengshan.

211
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,510
Are you here to pay respect to Nalan Jie?

212
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,710
Yes.

213
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,340
You were willing to risk your life to save
someone else and you didn't hold any grudge.

214
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,760
I am very pleased.

215
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:08,510
A real man should be able to tell kindness
and grudges apart. Nalan Jie bullied my family,

216
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:12,450
but he fought the Soul Hall. He was a hero.

217
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,870
Elder Tengshan.

218
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,610
You're the Leader of the Nalan family
and the Prime Minister of the empire.

219
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,740
You need to take care of yourself.

220
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,510
Farewell!

221
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,570
Wait a minute. Thank you.

222
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,090
Yan Xiao is the one you should be grateful to, not me.

223
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:42,380
Grandfather said he regretted that he went to
your Xiao family and canceled the engagement.

224
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,410
Really?

225
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:47,020
He said there were no talented boys in the Nalan family.

226
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,940
Yes. No talented boys in the Nalan family

227
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,110
and you once thought that there were
no talented boys in the Xiao family either.

228
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,020
I won't forget...

229
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,420
the insult the Xiao family once endured.

230
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,360
I won't forget the three-year pact either.

231
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,180
You can just wait for me in the Cloud Mist Sect.

232
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,510
Yes. Our family didn't realize this...

233
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,850
until now.

234
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,540
My grandfather envied Uncle Xiao.

235
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,830
Did he envy my father? For what?

236
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,950
For the fact that he lost his self-esteem and his wife
was wrongly accused of things she didn't do?

237
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,470
Or the fact that his son was deprived of his engagement
and was treated as the son of criminals?

238
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,220
You know nothing.

239
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,030
Leader Nalan,

240
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,090
I don't deserve your gratitude.

241
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:49,700
Fine. Three years. I will wait for you.

242
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,900
Someone tried to kill me last night.
It was someone from the Blood Sect.

243
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,630
They won't let me go.
They won't let you go either.

244
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,650
Here, here. Hurry!

245
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,390
Have you placed it correctly?

246
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,600
- Are you done over there?
- Yes.

247
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,760
Hurry up!

248
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,200
Here, come with me. You fellows,

249
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,120
here. Follow me.

250
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,970
Good morning to all our friends in Yin City.

251
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,460
The weather is nice today.
Sunny to partly cloudly.

252
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,340
Today... it's very sunny.

253
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,880
We will introduce an event for alchemist today.

254
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,420
It is a very impressive job.

255
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,770
In Fight Qi Continent, they have a higher position
than the normal Fight Practitioners.

256
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,260
Do you know why?

257
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,690
As the old saying goes, tooth pain is not a disease,
but when it happens it kills you.

258
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,890
It was said that Fight God had a bad tooth.

259
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,680
The pain was killing him.

260
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,760
He was so mad that he cracked down on Hun Miesheng.

261
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,420
What are you saying?

262
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,970
Stick it to the novel, please?
I didn't even understand.

263
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,990
Sorry, everyone.

264
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,980
My version should be the correct one.

265
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,790
An alchemist is a very noble occupation.

266
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,740
They help out patients and save lives.

267
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,210
The tradition of this occupation is to
help the Fight Practitioners reach the summit,

268
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,490
and help the weak and helpless.

269
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,910
If you want to be a real alchemist,

270
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,590
you need to have the gifts of a Fight Practitioner,

271
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:03,370
you also need to create fire from your Fight Qi, the ability to
recognize medicine materials, and the ability to control the fire.

272
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:07,160
But, especially, have the ability to know
those special recipes of mysterious medicine.

273
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,520
That is the backbone of the industry.

274
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,960
That's impressive! Can I get some applause?

275
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,000
In this Fight Qi Continent,
to become a top-tier clan,

276
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,150
you need to have your own alchemist in your clan.

277
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:24,530
Now we are introducing the strongest,

278
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,360
the one with the most students,

279
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,020
the most influential clan of our five clans.

280
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,700
The Cloud Mist Sect.
Their Grand Master, Yun Shan, had great insight.

281
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,770
He looked for all the good alchemists in the world
and nurtured his own alchemist, the Master Gu He.

282
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,840
Master Gu He is very impressive.

283
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,550
He is the King of Pills.

284
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,700
He is also the prominent alchemist

285
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,030
of all the young ones in this land.

286
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,970
Now we introduce the Star Fall Pavilion.

287
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,260
They are not only the team with the most potential,

288
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,060
but also the most low-key one.

289
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,880
The most impressive team would be
the students from our Jia Nan Academy.

290
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,810
Another round of applause, please.

291
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:04,680
Look at the crowd.

292
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,150
An important figure is now stepping onto the stage.

293
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,110
He is the State Teacher of the Chu Yun Empire,

294
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:13,230
the top man of the Alchemist Guild, Master Fa Ma.

295
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:17,470
Master! Master!

296
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,490
It is too hot today.

297
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,930
When I stepped out of the carriage,

298
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,970
I felt like I was on fire.

299
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:59,670
Any talents from your academy?

300
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,150
A few students are really good.

301
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,910
That is Xiao Yan. He is from the Xiao family,
one of the five clans.

302
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:10,310
He knows about medicine and has known
how to control fire since he was a kid.

303
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,460
The one next to him is named Han Xian.

304
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,380
He is the best student of Master Gu He.

305
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,110
He may look young,

306
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:21,690
but he has formed his own medicine sect at the school.

307
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,620
That young man in white robes is named Hao Tian.

308
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,800
He comes from a medicine family.

309
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,310
There are no medicinal materials
he can't recognize in this world.

310
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,560
Master Tengshan, you heaped such praise on our students.

311
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,650
Aren't you worried that Master Fa Ma will laugh at us?

312
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,500
I hope all of our students can improve themselves.

313
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,910
If they can wear the black robes
of alchemist after this contest,

314
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,890
they will be a great encouragement for the new students.

315
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:50,310
Xiao Yan. He's from the Xiao family?

316
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:53,350
Yes. That's him.

317
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:57,350
His mother killed my master.

318
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,660
It makes me angry every time I bring it up.

319
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,740
After it happened,

320
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,610
he still doesn't admit it.

321
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,130
How could such a big traitor
emerge from the five clans?

322
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,950
How come no one has questioned him?

323
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,440
Elder Han... you're in the wrong.

324
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,760
Mother is mother, son is son.

325
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,960
Not to mention that she wasn't formally charged.
Even if she was charged,

326
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,740
her children shouldn't be affected.

327
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,840
You're too kind.

328
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,660
I am just afraid we are raising a monster.

329
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,920
Master Fa Ma,

330
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:42,030
a young man from the Soul Clan is here and wants to
participate in the contest. Does he have your permission?

331
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,650
How did I not know...

332
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,250
that there might be someone
from the Soul Clan in this contest?

333
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,790
I will go out and kick him out then.

334
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,190
Hold on.

335
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,060
The Soul Hall is different from the Soul Clan.

336
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,910
Since he's here, ask him to come in
and take part in the contest.

337
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:05,580
You are really treating the world kindly.

338
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,950
I'm Fan Ling from the Soul Clan.

339
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,410
This is someone from the Soul Clan?

340
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,370
Is he alone?

341
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,300
He's here to look for death.

342
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,190
Not necessarily.

343
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:04,450
Since he dares to come,
he must have a few tricks.

344
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,930
We should be careful.

345
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,850
What is there to be careful about?

346
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,370
He's from the Soul Clan.

347
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:16,720
If he can make it through today,
I will pay for all of your dinners.

348
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,260
You'll lose for sure.

349
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,560
How could anyone be foolish enough to ask for death?

350
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,870
Could this be a conspiracy of Soul Hall?

351
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,600
Throwing him over here to die

352
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,540
and then launching an attack on us?

353
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:37,240
Does Soul Hall need a reason to launch an attack on us?

354
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,990
Hao Tian, what do you want to eat later?

355
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,410
How do you know that I will lose?

356
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:48,820
It's a deal. One dinner each for the four of us.

357
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,660
What's wrong?

358
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,200
Those eyes...

359
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,150
I have seen them somewhere.

360
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,770
Listen to me everyone. Be quiet! Be Quiet!

361
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:35,740
While we are learning
the glorious history of the Fight Qi Continent,

362
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:40,050
we must be able to tell
the Soul Clan and the Soul Hall apart.

363
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:43,260
Some bad people in the Soul Clan...

364
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,730
and some ordinary watchers
who didn't see the truth...

365
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,950
formed the Soul Hall
under the provocation of Hun Miesheng.

366
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,930
We have confirmed that this contestant...

367
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:56,480
is from the Soul Clan, but not Soul Hall.

368
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,140
This is the first time on our Fight Qi Continent...

369
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,540
- that someone from the Soul Clan is here
to participate in our contest, right? - Right.

370
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,020
This shows how merciful we are,

371
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,200
our confidence in our culture and our inclusiveness.

372
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,270
Right.

373
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,980
What a glorious event!

374
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,320
Yes!

375
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,430
Long live the Fight Qi Continent!

376
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:25,570
Long live the Fight Qi Continent!
Long live the Fight Qi Continent!

377
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,600
I hereby announce... This alchemist contest...

378
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,000
will officially begin.

379
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,170
I will now announce the rules.

380
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,000
This is the first round today.

381
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,300
You need to produce a top quality pill...

382
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,800
from the materials in front of you.

383
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,900
The purer the pill is, the higher score you will receive.

384
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,800
The first eight contestants
will go on to the next round.

385
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,500
What is this?

386
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,700
That is Turtle Coal. Officially used
by the Alchemist Guild.

387
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,200
It is much better than the ones we use.

388
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,000
♫ Constant hatred and bitter attachment become evident ♫

389
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,800
♫ In this lifetime, you will see your feat
such as has been tempered with fire ♫

390
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,600
♫ Confide in me your aspiration, that constant
dream in your heart that’s difficult to fulfill ♫

391
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,400
♫ To fulfill my promise, I conceal an arrow
inside my gold-threaded sleeve ♫

392
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,100
♫ Being mesmerized for a moment
by the purgatory and the lava ♫

393
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,900
♫ Jumping in with a leap
with neither grace nor resentment ♫

394
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,200
♫ Proud and aloof, holding a heavy sword in one hand ♫

395
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,900
♫ Young but bothered by undiminishing worries ♫

396
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,600
♫ Worries adding on to worries ♫

397
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,500
♫ The mountain calls and the sea roars ♫

398
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,300
♫ Rushing headlong even if
heaven is narrow and earth is small ♫

399
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,000
♫ Chaos in fighting the evil and foreign forces♫

400
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
♫ Disturbances that no one can escape from ♫

401
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,900
Why are you all in such a hurry?

402
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,440
Give me another portion!

403
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:28,200
♫ Heroes never ask for names ♫

404
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,500
♫ On the board of notables ♫

405
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,740
♫ It’s opportune to take advantage of youth♫

406
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,900
♫ and become famous sooner♫

407
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,500
Hao Tian, am I doing it too fast?

408
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,800
We are just slow.

409
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,400
Xun'er, how are you doing?

410
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,000
Purity level is at least a 7.

411
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,800
Watch me.

412
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,900
I will definitely get to level 8.

413
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:15,680
Xiao Yan, he can make medicine without a stove.

414
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,500
Look at that person. He has such Fight Qi.

415
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,600
He uses his own Fight Qi to heat up his medicine.

416
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,500
That's how they do it in the Soul Clan.

417
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,600
You go finish your own. Stop messing with me!

418
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,500
One more portion for me!

419
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,100
Thank you. Mine is done!

420
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,260
What about the level 8 you promised?

421
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,300
I am reserving my strength.

422
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,200
We are finished over here. You haven't even started?

423
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,600
I am getting there.

424
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,200
Look at that young man from the Soul Clan.

425
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,700
He can control his Fight Qi like that...

426
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,900
It's really spooky.

427
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,400
That's definitely a level 8.

428
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,100
Level 8. That is probably not enough.

429
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,400
It changed! It changed!

430
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,700
Xiao Yan, well done!

431
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,200
Give me Xiao Yan's.

432
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,100
Here is Xiao Yan's.

433
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:13,700
First place in the first round...
Xiao Yan from Jia Nan Academy.

434
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,100
Purity. Level 10.

435
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,800
Xiao Yan! Well done!

436
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,000
Well done!

437
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Awesome!

438
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,300
Master. Smell this.

439
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,010
Second place...

440
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,500
Fan Ling from the Soul Clan. Purity level, 9.

441
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,000
Third place...

442
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,300
Xiao Xun'er and Han Xian from Jia Nan Academy..

443
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,600
Purity level, 7.

444
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,500
Well done!

445
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,800
Level 10? Trying so hard from the beginning?

446
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,300
This is the first time
I've ever seen a level 10.

447
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,300
Xiao Yan, you're so awesome.

448
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,800
That brother over there,
if he had heated up for a while longer,

449
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,800
he could've gotten a level 10, too.

450
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,800
Dear audience,

451
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,400
the first round has officially ended.

452
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,000
Xiao Yan from Jia Nan Academy has won first place.

453
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,150
Yes!

454
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,280
Yes!

455
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,000
Fan Ling from the Soul Clan came in second.

456
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,400
Okay, okay.

457
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,200
Six other contestants...

458
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,200
have successfully produced medicine
with purity levels above 6.

459
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,400
They have made it to the next round.

460
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,000
Congratulations to them!

461
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,590
Yes!

462
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,850
[Wine]

463
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,300
Here, drink.

464
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Another plate of roast lamb leg.

465
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,400
Yes.

466
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,800
Look out. Time is not up yet.

467
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,900
If Fan Ling dies a moment before it is time
for me to pay, I won't pay for your dinner.

468
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,400
You can wait as long as you want.

469
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,400
Even if we stay here till tomorrow morning,

470
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,700
Fan Ling would be just fine.

471
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:40,000
I would kill that Fan Ling as soon as time is up.

472
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,400
Hey, how could I end up
with all you as my friends?

473
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,400
This is not how you should swindle me.

474
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,200
You are about to wear black robes of alchemist.
You should be better than this.

475
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,000
This Fan Ling...

476
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,400
I don't get it.

477
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,100
A Soul Clan member, acting so cocky.

478
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,900
Soul Clan and Soul Hall are different.

479
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,400
Have you been sleeping in your history lessons?

480
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,900
Soul Clan is like a clan,

481
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,600
just like our Five Great Clans.

482
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,700
But Soul Hall is an evil organization formed
by Hun Miesheng and some of the Soul Clan members.

483
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:20,000
So the one we should hate is Soul Hall not the Soul Clan.

484
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:46,300
If I didn't study martial arts, I could've become a poet.

485
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,900
How so?

486
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,000
Nalan Jie used to love to write poems.

487
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,400
Do you remember when I told you
how we marched into the Soul Palace?

488
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,200
Forget it. He's dead. Let's not talk about him.

489
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,600
No... Let's talk.

490
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:10,400
Fine then. Last time when we marched to Soul Palace and
walked past it to the Extreme North. It was really cold there.

491
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,800
Nalan Jie wrote a poem inspired by the snow.

492
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,000
I will recite it to you now.

493
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,600
"The snow is falling heavily.

494
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,300
The crows are munching on the tree bark.

495
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,000
My arse is cold when the wind blows.

496
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,500
I should just stay indoors."

497
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,000
Why is it better to stay indoors?

498
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,600
Because the name of the poem

499
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,500
is "Pooping in the Snow."

500
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,600
This is not funny.

501
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,600
It's really not funny.

502
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,650
Is it really cold in Soul Palace?

503
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,100
Of course.

504
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,900
Soul Palace is in the Extreme North.
That's really cold.

505
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,500
My mother... was she afraid of the cold?

506
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,400
I just thought of another poem.
I will recite it to you.

507
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,000
Every time I mention my mother,
you change the subject.

508
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,200
- I... - Why won't you tell me?
- Because you don't need to know.

509
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,800
She was my mother.

510
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,980
Why don't I need to know?

511
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,800
Let's stop talking about this.
Let's talk about something else.

512
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,600
That was my mother.

513
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,400
The time she spent with you,

514
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,000
is much longer than the time she spent with me.

515
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,000
She died for you.

516
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,400
I'm not even allowed to ask questions?

517
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,930
♫ If you want change, battle it out with no fear of chaos ♫

518
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:07,690
♫ The sky is dark, there’s misery on earth,

519
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:10,520
♫ Constant hatred and bitter attachment become evident ♫

523
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,680

524
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:27,660
♫ Jumping in with a leap with
