3
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,310
It is not my style
to kill the people I defeat.

4
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,660
I will let you go today.

5
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,960
If I see you again,

6
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,620
I will hold you accountable.

7
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,190
Get out!

8
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,760
Brother Xiao Yan.

9
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,530
Let me do this.

10
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,150
Big Brother.

11
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,050
Come. It's really cold in the desert.

12
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,360
Drink some and warm yourself up.

13
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,200
All right.

14
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,320
You should go back to Jia Nan Academy
after this trip.

15
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,880
It's too deserted here. Too harsh.

16
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,740
What can I do back there?

17
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,460
Only to hear that
I and my mother are both traitors?

18
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,370
Big Brother,

19
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,950
now I feel...

20
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,760
all the things I believed in...

21
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,630
were probably wrong.

22
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,050
All this time,
I wanted to avenge my mother's death.

23
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,190
I wanted everyone...

24
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,860
to know that my mother wasn't
a traitor to Star Fall Pavilion .

25
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,640
So ever since I was a small child,

26
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,390
I thought if I practiced as hard as I could

27
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,730
and learned Fight Techniques,

28
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,400
I could change this world.

29
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,410
The Fight Techniques you have now...

30
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,790
are already the best among our young generation.

31
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,360
What difference does it make?

32
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,340
Everyone knows I'm a traitor to the Xiao family.

33
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,000
Even if one day...

34
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,550
I become a Fight Emperor

35
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,200
and killed all of my enemies,

36
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,550
everyone will still say,

37
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,580
"Look, a traitor mother makes...

38
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,290
a monster son."

39
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:08,340
I have lost a battle that hasn't even started.

40
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,590
Are you regretting it?

41
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,770
You think you should have stayed in the shop...

42
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,520
and become an ordinary apprentice?

43
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:48,620
Big Brother, there's one thing
that I don't understand.

44
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,550
Everyone knows I burned
the Fight Technique Pavillion

45
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,760
and betrayed my family.

46
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,880
Everyone has accused me of the crime.

47
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,690
Why do you and Second Brother trust me so much?

48
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,140
Why are you willing to take us in?

49
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,150
You need to ask yourself that.

50
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,930
Why did you come to the desert?

51
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,890
I am here to figure something out.

52
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,660
What is it?

53
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,130
Everyone says I burned down
the Fight Technique Pavillion

54
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,800
but I don't have a memory of it at all.

55
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,820
Younger Brother,

56
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,740
some things...

57
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,330
take time to be seen clearly.

58
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,250
My father said the same thing.

59
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,850
When Second Brother and I first came here,

60
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,290
we were just like you, full of grudges.

61
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:14,640
As time went by, we came to like this place.

62
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,460
The sky is so high. No one can tell you what to do.

63
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,110
If you ask me to go back to the Xiao family's manor,

64
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,090
I would think it was too small for me.

65
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,620
Xiao Yan.

66
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,759
I don't read much.

67
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:45,220
I don't know
if I'm right about what I'll say.

68
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,990
Please tell me.

69
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,690
It's only a matter of other people's opinions...

70
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,170
if you're good or bad.

71
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,790
The most important thing in your life...

72
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,510
is to follow your own heart

73
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,860
and to not have any regrets.

74
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,960
If I die someday, I will choose to die here.

75
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,730
Even if I get killed here, I will be satisfied.

76
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:28,110
Even the most dangerous situations
and most powerful people...

77
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,070
can't change my mind or my faith.

78
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,200
We can't forget who we are.

79
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,720
Do you understand?

80
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,100
Motie has no enemies.
We have a free pass everywhere.

81
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,790
All rise!

82
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,970
Motie has no enemies.
We have a free pass everywhere.

83
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,670
All rise!

84
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,340
Motie has no enemies.
We have a free pass everywhere.

85
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,100
All rise!

86
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,090
Follow up!

87
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,550
Brother Xiao Yan, did you think clearly?

88
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,320
No.

89
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,620
The answer will come to me sooner or later.

90
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,130
You're talking crazy.

91
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,920
Follow up!

92
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,350
Big Brother, how is the Tiansha group related
to Cloud Mist Sect and Star Fall Pavillion?

93
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,720
We haven't seen them together before.

94
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,580
When I see them next time,
I will catch one of them and question him.

95
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,120
We should've questioned them yesterday.

96
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,090
You really scared me yesterday.

97
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,750
Looking at you,
I thought you were going to kill them.

98
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:13,110
I won't. I was just angry. I won't kill anyone.

99
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:19,090
Why didn't you tell me that my father
sent out a notice to post everywhere?

100
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,590
What difference would it make if you knew?

101
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,900
What did my father say exactly?

102
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,690
You really want to know?

103
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,880
Tell me.

104
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,990
Your father put up the notice to tell the world
that you're the traitor of the Xiao family.

105
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:38,530
Stole from the Fight Technique Pavillion
and burned it down.

106
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,980
That he officially kicked you out of the family.

107
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,640
And that from now on, it's not
the Xiao family's business whether you live or die.

108
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,130
In the future, the Xiao family
will pick a leader successor...

109
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,820
from one of the relatives' kids.

110
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,800
In a word,

111
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,840
you are not a Xiao anymore.

112
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,390
Brother Xiao Yan,
Father was just saying that out of anger.

113
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,180
Was he?

114
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,490
Yes.

115
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,940
It doesn't matter if he said it out of anger.
He already notified the world.

116
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,620
It doesn't make any difference.

117
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,120
Oh, right. Big Brother,
I have been meaning to ask you something.

118
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,780
- Ask it. - Why did you and Second Brother have to
come to the desert to start this soldier group?

119
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,610
You were doing great with the family business.

120
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,810
Why not start a business?

121
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:31,360
That's boring.
Your Second Brother and I like it here.

122
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,110
We are just like you.

123
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,570
In the Xiao family, we kept making small mistakes.

124
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:42,490
The Elders didn't like us so they kicked us out.

125
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,670
How come the Elders didn't mention it to me?

126
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,060
It's nothing to be proud of.

127
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,250
But in terms of Fight Techniques,

128
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,910
you and Second Brother
are among the best in our family.

129
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,410
All these years, how did you practice?

130
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,710
I have to thank your father.

131
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,770
When we were kicked out,

132
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,130
your father taught us two sets
of Fight Techniques in private.

133
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,390
So here, with me and your second brother,

134
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,330
nobody can mess with you in the desert.

135
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,990
Stop!

136
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,780
Tiansha Group again!

137
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,360
We couldn't get through!
Snake Tribe people are up ahead.

138
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,060
Big Brother, what's going on?

139
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,310
Snake People Empire people.
Hard to mess with.

140
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,520
Snake People Empire?

141
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,690
Is it?

142
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:05,050
Hold on to your horses.
Let's find another way.

143
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,080
Did we always take this path?

144
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,770
The Mo family eliminated the Snake People Empire before.

145
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,930
So it was peaceful for quite a while.

146
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,920
Lately, a force has been attacking the Mo family.

147
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,980
We don't know if Mo Cheng is alive or not.
The Snake People Empire has become its old self.

148
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,530
Looks like this is a dead pathway for us.

149
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,190
Let's take this one.

150
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,130
Maybe I can provide a convenience for you two.

151
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,990
Is that Qing Lin?

152
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,910
Snake King, it's you!

153
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,810
You're a general now?

154
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,540
Replying to Snake King. Yes!

155
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,390
Snake King is here! Pay your respect.

156
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,580
We are here to pay our respect to the Snake King!

157
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,190
- Big Brother.
- When did you become the Snake King?

158
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,280
I did a small favor for the Snake People Empire before.

159
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,180
I just became their Snake King coincidentally.
Don't take it too seriously.

160
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,860
Qing Lin, this is my big brother and second brother.

161
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,020
Their escort fleet wants to go past you.
Please let them pass.

162
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,810
Yes, Your Majesty.

163
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,380
They'll let our escort fleet go past.

164
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,590
Oh, right. Leave the Star Fall Pavillion and Cloud Mist
Sect people behind. I need to ask them something.

165
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,010
All right.

166
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,070
Second Brother, go arrange things
so the fleet can get past.

167
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,490
Yes.

168
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:14,360
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

169
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,150
Greetings, Your Majesty!

170
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,960
Mo Basi?

171
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,980
Get up. Here, I was a traitor yesterday.

172
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,950
Now I'm "Your Majesty." Such a difference.

173
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,160
If everyone else in the world won't tolerate you,
we are not afraid.

174
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,190
Because your enemies are our enemies.

175
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,660
Snake King, please stay for dinner.

176
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,850
No, we have to escort the goods.

177
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,730
If I run late, they will take it out of my wages.

178
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,780
This...

179
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,970
I'm just an ordinary soldier.

180
00:16:54,970 --> 00:17:00,150
Right, if the Motie Soldier Group ever
wants to go through, please allow them.

181
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,920
Yes.

182
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,520
We will treat the Motie
as our own brothers and never hurt them.

183
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,590
Thank you. Please go back now.

184
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,020
Farewell, Your Majesty!

185
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,620
Farewell, Snake King!

186
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,660
Xun'er, Big Brother, let's go.

187
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,740
All right.

188
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,250
Brother Xiao Ding. Brother Xiao Ding.

189
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,450
Can you tell the Snake King to give
our Tiansha group access to this path?

190
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,500
Don't let the Snake People Empire give us a hard time.
Otherwise, if we take a detour,

191
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,760
we need to add weeks to our journey time.

192
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,780
Now is not the time for trade talk.

193
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,050
If I knew you had such a brother,

194
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,620
I wouldn't have messed with you.

195
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,490
It wasn't my idea to stop you halfway yesterday.

196
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,230
You brought a bunch of people to
hunt me and my brothers down.

197
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,290
What? Pretending nothing happened now?

198
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:05,270
No, that... I couldn't mess with them either.

199
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:10,730
I was not with them. They put a knife
against my neck and made me do it.

200
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,760
How did you two know I was here?

201
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,140
Just a coincidence.

202
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,210
You have been following me all the way.
You think I didn't know?

203
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,470
Stop looking! Want to cheat now?
It's too late.

204
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,460
You're just an outcast son of the Xiao family.
Why are you being so arrogant with us?

205
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,610
What are you two following an outcast son for anyway?

206
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,590
What? Is it Yun Shan's order?

207
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,450
How did you kno--?

208
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,650
Forget it. Continue.

209
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,150
Speak up.

210
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:12,550
We were just poking around the Xiao family
according to the Old Master's order.

211
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,700
Did you see me burn down
the Fight Technique Pavillion the other night?

212
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,360
Why are you looking at each other?
Tell me!

213
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,030
We weren't watching you that day.

214
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:32,120
We got the message saying
you were kicked out of the family,

215
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,560
so we started following you.

216
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,110
Why did you attack us yesterday?

217
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,570
Yun Shan's order, too?

218
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,370
No, no, no.
Our superiors only wanted us to follow you,

219
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,840
to see if you were really kicked out.

220
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,400
It's just we...

221
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,960
Louder.

222
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,410
We wanted to steal some money for ourselves.

223
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,420
We thought maybe we could
steal some Fight Techniques, too.

224
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,580
Your hearts are really black.

225
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:05,210
We are the bottom feeders of the Cloud Mist Sect.

226
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,800
With your mercy and grace,
will you let us go?

227
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,270
How long have you all been watching the Xiao family?

228
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,190
One year. It's only been a year.

229
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,450
What have you discovered?

230
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,380
Other than you, everything else seems pretty normal.

231
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,140
Let's go.

232
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,000
Brother Xiao Yan, there are two more over there.
Keep questioning them.

233
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,960
Did you follow me all the way
from the Xiao family manor, too?

234
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,030
Did you see me burn down the pavillion?

235
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,400
We saw it. We saw it.

236
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,890
Brother Xiao Yan, don't get upset.

237
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:01,320
What did you see? Was that person me?

238
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,780
No, no.

239
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,970
Think hard before you say anything.

240
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,960
Don't force me to...

241
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,470
We were watching from a distance and weren't able to
see too clearly. It looked like you.

242
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:16,520
You killed a few people and entered the pavillion.
Then the room caught on fire.

243
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,580
What about you? What did you see?

244
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,010
Don't you know what you did?

245
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,340
We opened up a shop near the Xiao family's residence.

246
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,260
We monitored you as our master ordered.

247
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,890
You came out of the pavillion that night with
the scrolls of Fight Techniques in your hands.

248
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,260
Everybody saw it clearly.

249
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,730
But we can't be a lead clan anymore,
other than doing business.

250
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,140
Why would Star Fall Pavilion
keep an eye on the Xiao family?

251
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,270
We don't know. It was an order.

252
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,540
Was it the order to kill people?

253
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,060
That was our own business.

254
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,300
- You!
- Xun'er.

255
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,630
My mother was a disciple of the Star Fall Pavilion.

256
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,760
I have taken advantage of your sect.

257
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,540
You attacked us yesterday.
That was your fault.

258
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,990
But if I offended you in any other way,
please forgive me.

259
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,720
My father once said, for some things,

260
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,960
it takes time before
you can clearly understand what's going on.

261
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:33,690
Whether my mother was a traitor or not,

262
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,160
whether I am a traitor or not,

263
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,140
it could be that it'll take some time
before you can see things more clearly.

264
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,300
The two of you may go back now.

265
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,800
Brother Xiao Yan, don't get confused.

266
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,140
Was it really my doing?

267
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,820
Why can't I remember any of it at all?

268
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,490
Don’t listen to them.
They’re speaking nonsense.

269
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:22,410
Xun'er, immediately send a carrier pigeon to Father.

270
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:26,960
Tell him that the Cloud Mist Sect and the Star Fall Pavilion
are watching the Xiao family attentively.

271
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,970
Tell him that he must be careful.

272
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,480
Go.

273
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,890
Half-heartedly. One more time.

274
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,850
What are you thinking inside your head?

275
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,650
There are many matters that I don’t understand.
My mind is a little confused.

276
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,690
It's not confusion. It's dissatisfaction.

277
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:32,310
Master planned on your behalf
to marry you to Gu He.

278
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,870
It doesn’t conform to your wishes? Huh?

279
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:39,850
Does your heart still want to be with that brat?

280
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,670
I wouldn't dare.

281
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:47,740
I don’t want to get married. I only want to follow Grand Master
to practice cultivation and refinement in this lifetime.

282
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:51,520
Then why are you asking everywhere for news of him?

283
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:58,010
He's only an unfilial son
who has been driven out of his family.

284
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:02,300
You should never forget your identity.

285
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,570
I haven’t forgotten.

286
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,760
There isn't any more childhood affection
between him and me.

287
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,870
It's just that the three-year agreement time
is finally arriving soon.

288
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,870
I’m worried about this.

289
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,690
As for my marriage,

290
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:27,130
it concerns the prestige
of the Nalan family and the Cloud Mist Sect.

291
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,350
I wouldn’t even dare to be the least bit careless.

292
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,770
The three-year agreement.

293
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,260
I don't think that brat will dare to come.

294
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:45,300
I heard that he is in the desert now

295
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:50,480
with two Xiao family clansmen
and acting as mercenaries.

296
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,970
What kind of future prospect does that have?

297
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,930
Speaking of Fight Techniques,

298
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,700
I’ve passed on thirteen sword skills to you.

299
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:07,330
The Xiao family can’t keep up.
Why should you think so much?

300
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:12,720
Speaking of Elder Gu He,

301
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:18,720
he is the Chief Alchemist of our Cloud Mist Sect,

302
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,300
known as the Pellet King.

303
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,130
The reason I’m making you marry him

304
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,720
is to announce to the world

305
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,800
that the Nalan family and the Cloud Mist Sect

306
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,400
have already formed an alliance.

307
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:42,690
During the wedding, Master Han
of the Star Fall Pavilion will also come.

308
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:48,000
This is precisely a triple alliance. Child,

309
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,410
this is to preserve the Nalan family.

310
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,770
It's the best method.

311
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,730
Yes.

312
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,020
[Xiao Manor]

313
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,500
Clan Leader, look. The pigeon had a message.

314
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:44,070
(Xiao Family is observing by Cloud Mist Sect
and Star Fall Pavillion.)

315
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,270
A customer is here.

316
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,770
Please come inside.

317
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,520
Clan Leader Xiao, what's the matter?

318
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:46,790
All of you have attentively watched our
Xiao family for so long. Isn't it tiring?

319
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:51,160
Go back and deliver a message
to the Cloud Mist Sect's Grand Old Master.

320
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,790
Although my son was sent to the desert

321
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:59,300
and he no longer has the surname,
"Xiao," he's still my kin.

322
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:05,600
Come find me if there's a situation.
There's no need to give up what is close and look far.

323
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,560
I don't understand very well what you're saying.

324
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,460
Aren't you Star Picker, Yun Xing,
of the Cloud Mist Sect?

325
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:18,860
Isn't this person Bomb Maker, Yun Lei,
of the Cloud Mist Sect?

326
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:24,900
You still have two similar disciples
tracking my son into the desert.

327
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,760
I think doing it like this... is improper.

328
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,080
I came to tell you.

329
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,740
How did you know?
Cloud Mist Sect has a traitor. Who is it?

330
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,290
Have you both heard what I said?

331
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,820
Clan Leader Xiao, your words,

332
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,220
we'll certainly deliver.

333
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,090
Don’t you understand what I meant?

334
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:54,210
What I meant is if two corpses are placed
in front of Grand Old Master,

335
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,280
he’d understand right away.

336
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,620
My Fight Qi no longer exists.

337
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,630
Why should you treat a useless person this way?

338
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:12,290
Arrange the corpses properly.

339
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,970
Someone will naturally come and take them.

340
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,300
The two of you come with me
to the Star Fall Pavilion to have a look.

341
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,990
All right. Let's go.

342
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,360
Big Brother.

343
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,490
I've packed some food for you.

344
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:06,340
I didn't know what you like to eat
so I brought you all.

345
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,310
Come. See if there's anything you'd like to eat.

346
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,190
Where's Xun'er?

347
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,920
She doesn't eat these greasy things.

348
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,180
I gave her two chicken eggs.

349
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,490
Where did Second Brother go?

350
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:31,360
He went with the brothers to the world of sensual pleasures.

351
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,720
World of sensual pleasures?

352
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,120
You don't know about the world of sensual pleasures?

353
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,050
You've been here for a few days.

354
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:47,550
How about it? Are you used to it?

355
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,140
Yes.

356
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:54,310
It just so happens there's nothing going on today.
We'll chat.

357
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,930
What are you thinking?

358
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,730
Continuing to wait this long,
is this a method also?

359
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,920
Big Brother, do you want to drive me away?

360
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:18,880
As long as all of you don't drive me away,
I'll just continue to stay here.

361
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,780
Big Brother and Second Brother
can continue to stay in this place.

362
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:28,230
Naturally, I can continue to stay here, too.
I’m not some kind of noble person anyway.

363
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,320
Not a noble person?

364
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,320
That's very unlikely.

365
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,330
Let’s change the topic.

366
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,760
What about Xun’er?

367
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:48,540
She can't spend her last years here by your side.

368
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:52,560
Your father didn’t push her out either.

369
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,160
I know.

370
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,190
I’ve advised her, too.

371
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:00,140
But she just won’t listen.

372
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,800
I heard that the Gu Clan has changes, too.

373
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,380
Maybe Xun'er

374
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,980
will have to leave very soon.

375
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,580
What?

376
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,590
I know many merchant customers.

377
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:31,730
A customer told me
that there is internal disorder in the Gu Clan.

378
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:35,020
The Gu Clan has internal disorder. Why?

379
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,630
The Gu Clan are descendants of the Dragon God.

380
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,100
They live on the four islands in the sea.

381
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:44,930
Each of the four islands has a Dragon Master

382
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:48,660
and the four Dragon Masters
only believe in one Dragon Mother.

383
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,500
Each generation also has only one Dragon Mother.

384
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,990
Now their Dragon Mother

385
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,190
has been missing for a year.

386
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,290
The other three Dragon Masters suspect
that it's the doing of Xun'er's family.

387
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:06,840
So they united to force Xun'er's father,

388
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,370
who is also your Uncle Gu Yuan, to hand over that person.

389
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:16,039
I heard they're already fighting.

390
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:18,989
Does Xun’er know about this matter?

391
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:21,329
Currently, the news still hasn’t been confirmed.

392
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:27,310
If Xun’er wants to leave, you can't stop her.

393
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,930
Why not?

394
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:36,250
Your father said he wants to allow her
to change back to her surname.

395
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,860
He's really too nosy.

396
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:50,260
He must’ve known about the internal disorder in the Gu Clan.
That’s why he wants to solve the problem ahead of time.

397
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,530
Enjoy your meal, all right? I’m leaving first.

398
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,940
Big Brother.

399
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,730
You still haven't told me.

400
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,290
I'll correct the words you just said.

401
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,960
Up to even now, I and your second brother still regard you
as the future master of our clan.

402
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,930
You shouldn't belittle yourself.

403
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,780
Xun'er.

404
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,210
Uncle.

405
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,890
I’m leaving Xun’er here.

406
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:59,340
In the future, let her surname be Xiao.

407
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,290
Why is that?

408
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:06,420
Leaving a member of the Gu tribe here will make it easier
for us to keep in touch in the future.

409
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,120
Thank you.

410
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,670
Xun’er, in Aunt’s house,

411
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,770
you must be obedient.

412
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:31,640
Father! Take me home.

413
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,140
I don’t want to stay here, Father.

414
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:42,040
Xun’er, I will visit you every year.

415
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,200
Father!

416
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:52,070
Father! Let me go. I must find my father.

417
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,990
Father!

418
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,320
Uncle. Uncle, sit down first.

419
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,580
I’ll get you some water right away.

420
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,130
It's not urgent. Come. Sit.

421
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,510
Let me take a look at you.

422
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,960
You really look like your mother.

423
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,840
Uncle, both of us really

424
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,160
haven't seen each other for far too many years.

425
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,320
That's right. The Gu family isn't safe and peaceful.

426
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,360
I was unable to leave.

427
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,940
I should’ve come to see you all.

428
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,170
I previously wrote a letter to your father.

429
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:44,490
I said that you seeing your uncle
is like seeing your mother

430
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,460
and asked to let you come to Dragon Island
with Xun'er and stay for a few years.

431
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:52,790
Your Father said you both
had gone to Jia Nan Academy already.

432
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,180
Uncle.

433
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,090
Seeing you makes me think of my older sister.

434
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,760
Uncle, sit here first.

435
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,750
I’ll go ask Xun’er to come down.

436
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,830
What did she say about me?

437
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,790
Ordinarily, both of us don’t talk about this.

438
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,790
Don't worry. I will advise her properly.

439
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,960
Xun'er, come down with me, all right?

440
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,280
Let's go.

441
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,370
Uncle, sit down.

442
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:54,180
Uncle. Xun'er. Both of you chat first.

443
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,390
I’ll buy something to eat for all of us.

444
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,170
You’ve grown so big.

445
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:16,390
My daughter has grown so big.

446
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,920
You haven't seen me in so many years,

447
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,900
of course, I've grown up.
