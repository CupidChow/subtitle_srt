=Episode 28=

3
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,320
There is a lot to it.

4
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,200
Some require cutting open the body
and taking out what's inside.

5
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,620
Sometimes I choose not to touch the body at all,

6
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:49,600
making them lose consciousness and then take over.
Which do you prefer?

7
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,590
Very impressive.

8
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,390
No wonder people say the blood alliance puppets
are the secret of Soul Hall.

9
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,740
The most terrifying things on this continent.

10
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,390
Are you going to poke me with this needle?
Will it hurt?

11
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,230
No, it won't.

12
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,750
This is a Bone Piercing Needle.

13
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,770
It will lock thirteen acupoints in your body

14
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,990
and then you will lose consciousness.

15
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,220
No... I need to keep you alive.

16
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,780
Maybe you will be useful in the future.

17
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,590
Oh, yes! There's another way of doing this.

18
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,580
Right here, I'll make a cut and take out all your guts.

19
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,460
Then I'll stuff you with my special medicine.

20
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,520
After seven days, you will be

21
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,750
a long living, blood alliance puppet.

22
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,380
No...

23
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,520
That method, I will save it for you.

24
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,150
No, no, no.

25
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,970
As for you...

26
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,850
This doesn't hurt, right?

27
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,630
Actually, I was just making your mind go blank

28
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,350
as if you'd just fallen asleep.

29
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:37,780
Then when you wake up,
you'll be a whole new person.

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,370
State Teacher, I have another question.

31
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,970
It's a mystery to me, can you tell me
how someone splits themselves?

32
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,940
What is it?

33
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,420
That is the Soul Separation technique of Soul Hall.

34
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,260
But you have a shadow,

35
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,850
not like a demon, and you'll still breathe.

36
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,140
This needle will make you feel like
you're soaking in a hot bath.

37
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,750
Sleep... Sleep.

38
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:41,000
State Teacher! State Teacher,
you have to tell me.

39
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,750
This is the third level
of the Soul Separation technique.

40
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,160
It allows the Fight Qi from the middle blood vessel...

41
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,050
to seep into your consciousness.

42
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,280
You can then replicate yourself over and over.

43
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,150
They will all talk and walk like you.

44
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,560
They'll be just like the real you.

45
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,300
Fight Qi from where, again?

46
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,350
The middle blood vessel.

47
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,760
State Teacher...

48
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,970
That is so impressive.
Can you teach me how to do that?

49
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,920
Elder Hai, let's think of a way to escape.

50
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,950
I originally thought my daughter
was very stupid to have fallen for you.

51
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,050
Now I finally understand.

52
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,580
She's like her mother.
She has very keen eyes.

53
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,180
Stop the teasing. Wait, I'll think of a solution.

54
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,930
Medicine Elder.

55
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,340
Did you come to ask me how to defeat Fa Ma?

56
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,560
Yes. There are too many blood alliance puppets
out there. Elder Hai and I can't defeat them all.

57
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,690
We then have to defeat Fa Ma himself.

58
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,580
I know where his real self is,
but you can't go there.

59
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,320
Please explain.

60
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,160
He's in the sacrificial altar room of the Soul Hall.

61
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,520
There's a Yin Yang fish made from black iron in
that room, so that's where he makes the puppets.

62
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,450
There's a passageway that he uses to reach Soul Hall.

63
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,760
If you want to defeat him, you have to
separate your soul and enter Soul Hall.

64
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Whether you can escape or not, that will rely on you.

65
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,750
What's it like in Soul Hall? Do you know?

66
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,700
I escaped from there. How would I not know?

67
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,570
That is the most sinister place
I've ever seen in my lifetime.

68
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,810
In there, there's no sense of time,
no life, or death.

69
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,990
There is only endless pain.

70
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,690
The way I see it, you shouldn't go.

71
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,440
Where's the sacrificial altar?

72
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,970
I have an idea.

73
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,890
Elder Hai, please protect me.

74
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,080
I will go to destroy the real soul of Fa Ma.

75
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,990
- Protect who?
- Me.

76
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,150
Destroy who?

77
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,790
The real soul of Fa Ma.

78
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,570
This...

79
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,190
Outside Soul Hall's altar room, a huge Yin Fire from
the bottom of the sea, blocks entry.

80
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,150
You have to protect your body
with Bone Spirit Cold Flame.

81
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,340
Get through that wall as fast as you can.

82
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,890
Because once your Fight Qi
can no longer make Essence Flame,

83
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,520
the Yin Fire will burn you alive.

84
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,490
Manjusaka flowers are blooming outside of Soul Hall.

85
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,890
Manjusaka is one of the ingredients
used in making the puppets.

86
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:11,180
You need to be careful of the poison on the flower's spikes.

87
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,090
In the ship of souls,
the sacrificial altar of Soul Hall lies there.

88
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,420
That's more horrifying...

89
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,370
than all your nightmares.

90
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,100
Son-in-law! Son-in-law!

91
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,830
Hurry back soon!

92
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,560
I don't know how to use this ruler. It keeps blinking.

93
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,750
It's really here.

94
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,220
Son-in-law! It's really difficult to protect you like this.
You need to buy me drinks when this is over.

95
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:20,000
Again? When the Ice Emperor doesn't get serious,
you think I'm being nice?

96
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,370
Mother.

97
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,520
This is not real.

98
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:24,900
[Medicine Elder]

99
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,940
When you see my name,
it means you're in the right place.

100
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,760
All the souls Hun Miesheng collected are in there.

101
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,590
In the War of Soul Hall, all the heroes
who died are imprisoned there, too.

102
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:45,170
Some of them lost their consciousness.
Some of them became evil. Only a few people...

103
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,780
No, only I... escaped.

104
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,880
[Xiao Zhan]

105
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,050
[Xiao Yan]

106
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:20,139
[Xiao Yan]

107
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,800
You're finally here.

108
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,710
I've been waiting for a long time.

109
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,200
Don't be in such a rush.

110
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,040
Hear me out.

111
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,210
You traitor!

112
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,480
I will not believe a word you say!

113
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:16,260
Many years ago, I should have died.

114
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:21,470
But I was captured by Hun Miesheng.

115
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:26,500
He kept me here. He tortured me day and night...

116
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,880
with his Soul Hall tricks.

117
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,490
He forced me to create many replicas of myself
with the puppet technique.

118
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,000
Messing up the Fight Qi Continent.

119
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You knew the consequences of doing that.

120
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,030
Yet you still helped him!

121
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,750
The sacrificial altar of Soul Hall
is just a massive void.

122
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,990
I'm locked in here. Can't even kill myself.

123
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:04,000
I can only face this endless darkness alone.

124
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,740
I'll hear the cries of the dead souls...

125
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,800
until the last bit of my consciousness...

126
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,950
disappears in the void.

127
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,800
How long will that take?

128
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,640
Ten years? A hundred years?

129
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,650
Ten thousand years?

130
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,450
You're afraid?

131
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,090
When evil becomes a part of me,

132
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,860
I can only give in.

133
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,290
Good thing you're here.

134
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,840
I thought you could rescue me,

135
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,810
but now I just want to die.

136
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,290
Use your Bone Spirit Cold Flame

137
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:09,620
and burn me to ashes.

138
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,750
Hurry!

139
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,100
I've been waiting for this day for so long.

140
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,570
Hurry!

141
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,110
I'm begging you!

142
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,990
Run!

143
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,330
Run!

144
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,540
Run away!

145
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,000
Run!

146
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,440
Son-in-law! Looks like we are going to die here.

147
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,330
Daughter, you picked the right fellow.
He's just not good news to your father.

148
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,220
When did we come to the court?
What time is it?

149
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,460
How come we are here?

150
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,440
- State Teacher!
- State Teacher! State Teacher!

151
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,920
State Teacher, what happened to you?

152
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,500
State Teacher!

153
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,890
I win!

154
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:05,190
Son-in-law, it's lucky that you did it.

155
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,790
Still, bad luck for me.

156
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,560
Where's the man?

157
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,490
The real soul of the State Teacher is gone.

158
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:51,040
Slowly. Slow down.

159
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,560
Aiyo!

160
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,220
My body...

161
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,630
Aiyo...

162
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,540
I swear, I will call you Father-in-law...

163
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,320
If I do this with you one more time,
you'll really harm me.

164
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,430
Elder Hai, thanks to
that you were with me this time.

165
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:13,800
I have to go back to the academy.
I'll see you next time.

166
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,180
You're not coming home to see my daughter?

167
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:20,120
Next time. Send my regards.

168
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,630
Always so busy!

169
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,500
Slow down, slow down, slow.

170
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,680
We gather here today...

171
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,500
to add another important rule to our school charter.

172
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,340
From now on,

173
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,370
anyone, for any reason,

174
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,180
who reports a schoolmate or colleague,

175
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:09,030
will be cast out.

176
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,910
Anyone that includes me.

177
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,240
Yes. Yes.

178
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,520
Good.

179
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,630
You've all seen what happened before.

180
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:34,110
But you haven't seen the Soul Hall Army.

181
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,060
You haven't witnessed how powerful they are.

182
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:41,090
Just hearing the two words, "Soul Hall,"

183
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:44,760
your fear can become evil.

184
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,860
We didn't lose in front of our enemy's weapons,

185
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:52,800
but we were defeated by our inner demons.

186
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:57,930
The new emperor's decree declares
that Fa Ma was the man behind all this.

187
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:02,670
I don't fully agree with this result,

188
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,430
even though he was the State Teacher.

189
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,260
By only his powers alone,

190
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,340
could he terrify our academy

191
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,900
and the entire Fight Qi Continent?

192
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,730
I don't think so.

193
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:21,730
It was our doubts,

194
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:27,230
evil thoughts,
and some people interfering in the situation

195
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,540
so that he could grow more and more powerful.

196
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,940
It made us his accomplices.

197
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:41,920
Today, I hope all of you can understand...

198
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,610
No matter what, you need to think independently

199
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:49,730
and keep your faith in kindness.

200
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,430
Believe in your friends.

201
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,700
These are the only true weapons...

202
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,940
to defeat Soul Hall.

203
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:05,810
Good!

204
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,980
[Bai Shan] [Bai Yao]

205
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:30,960
Master Gu He, I thought you wanted to
teach me something. Why are we here?

206
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,230
I'm not the one who will teach you today.

207
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:40,130
He's an old friend of mine
and someone you know well.

208
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:44,260
Who is he, may I ask?

209
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,820
It's me.

210
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,700
Grand Master.

211
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,910
Grand Master Yun Shan.

212
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,570
Please accept my greetings.

213
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,770
No need.

214
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,970
I haven't congratulated you yet.

215
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:14,900
You're the Leader of the Nalan Clan
and the prime minister.

216
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,530
I dare not.

217
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,540
This is a good thing.

218
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:23,320
I'm not here as a Grand Master.

219
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,250
Only Gu He and you know.

220
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,880
So, relax.

221
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,360
Yes.

222
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:42,190
You've gotten taller in these last few years.

223
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,870
I dare not loosen up on my training.

224
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:48,560
But without your teaching,
I am progressing very slowly.

225
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,400
When you get back from Jia Nan,

226
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,620
I will teach you...

227
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,630
the best sword skills of the Cloud Mist Sect.

228
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,440
Thank you, so much.

229
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,250
Gu He,

230
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:07,590
let me talk to my student alone for a while.

231
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,430
Please make yourself at home.

232
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,570
I have to go prepare for my class.

233
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:14,870
I have told the guards not to let anyone in.

234
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:17,770
I will be leaving first then.

235
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,360
Please.

236
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,150
What do you think about this?

237
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,070
Master, you're talking about which thing?

238
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:41,960
Mi Tengshan returning to the academy.

239
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,390
I don't understand. Please enlighten me.

240
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:50,750
If everyone is as confused as you,

241
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:55,070
Hun Miesheng doesn't even need to be here

242
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:59,750
and the Nalan Clan would certainly die.

243
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,660
I still don't understand.

244
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:12,170
If you had to choose between sacrificing yourself...

245
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,200
or the Nalan family,

246
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,600
what would you choose?

247
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,420
Sacrifice?

248
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,620
Grandfather trusted me and made me his successor.

249
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,420
If the Nalan family dies,

250
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,920
I would owe his soul in heaven.

251
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,070
If someone has to be sacrificed,
of course, it will be me.

252
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,070
Good.

253
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,840
I traveled all the way here,

254
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,690
just to hear this.

255
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,910
Master, please make it more explicit.

256
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:48,560
The Darkness... is coming.

257
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:55,030
Who could've thought the State Teacher,
Fa Ma...

258
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:59,390
would be a spy from Soul Hall.

259
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:04,230
Two emperors were manipulated and deceived by him.

260
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:10,740
Now, the Fight Qi Continent is in jeopardy.

261
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:16,010
We need to think of a way to protect ourselves.

262
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,260
What do you mean?

263
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:25,750
What is left of the Five Great Clans?

264
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:29,710
The Nalan family.
In your father's generation...

265
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,620
not one is a good fighter.
The Xiao Family...

266
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,100
Xiao Zhan has destroyed his Fight Qi.

267
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:44,040
All the others are useless.
Even though there's Xiao Yan,

268
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:50,440
he's still just a kid.

269
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:55,970
The Gu family from Dragon Island are hermits.

270
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,300
In a crisis,

271
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,230
they are not reliable either.

272
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:08,870
So now there's only Star Fall Pavillion
and the Cloud Mist Sect.

273
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:12,830
Grandfather said the same thing.

274
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,240
When Grandfather sent me to the mountains,

275
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,300
it was to seek skills from
the Grand Old Master of Cloud Mist Sect.

276
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,850
He thought I could learn some skills to protect myself.

277
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,290
How do we save ourselves?

278
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,190
Thinking of those days
when we attacked Soul Hall,

279
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,620
we lost many soldiers.

280
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,810
Many Masters sacrificed their lives.

281
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:50,580
If the Soul Hall attacks us now,

282
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,630
we will undoubtedly die.

283
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,990
Then,

284
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,720
what should we do?

285
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,560
Grand Master, you must have a way.
Right?

286
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,620
At this point,

287
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:16,190
in order to save the Nalan family
and the Cloud Mist Sect,

288
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:21,130
how much are you willing to sacrifice?

289
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,220
Ten thousand deaths will not prevent me from doing so.

290
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:30,089
Ten thousand deaths will not prevent me from doing so.

291
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:33,360
Good. Good.

292
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,210
I’m extremely exhausted.

293
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:45,319
Finally back.

294
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,630
Father sent a letter,
asking us to make a trip back home.

295
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,130
There's a problem with the family's business.

296
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,080
You don’t need to send us off.
We’ll be back soon. Don’t worry.

297
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,380
If anyone is looking for trouble,
as long as you send a letter,

298
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,350
we'll travel at lightning speed all night,
no matter if we're thousands of miles away.

299
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:20,190
Thank you. I appreciate your kindness.

300
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,460
Xiao Yan!

301
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,280
If you need help with medicinal herbs, don’t hesitate
to ask the Alchemist Guild in Wu Tan City.

302
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,550
You’re a member of the guild now.
They will try their best to help you.

303
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,780
Yes.

304
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,500
If you need me to show up,
don’t hesitate to write a letter.

305
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,660
Thank you, Elder Tengshan.

306
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:41,170
How about we all request a leave of absence
and go with you to your house to play. All right?

307
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:44,070
Great! Great! Good idea!

308
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,480
All right, Teacher?

309
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,740
The academy doesn’t have this rule. Don’t say
these words in front of Elder Tengshan and me.

310
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,520
It would look like I’m plotting
with all of you to make a mistake.

311
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,980
Xiao Yan. Xun'er. You should leave soon and hurry back.

312
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,550
- Yes.
- Yes.

313
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:07,200
Let's go. Take care.

314
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
[Xiao Manor]

315
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,560
That year, we left here to go to school.

316
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,460
Don't do anything to dampen the joy.

317
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:04,450
You haven't seen Father in a long time.
He will be so happy.

318
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:06,000
Let's go.

319
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,670
[Heaven and Earth Figth Qi]

320
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,090
[Heaven and Earth Figth Qi]

321
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,800
Young Master! Young Miss!

322
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,410
Young Master. Young Miss. You've returned.

323
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,360
Shopkeeper Wan.

324
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,770
What's going on?

325
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:29,980
Is my father all right?

326
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,090
Your Father is safe and well.
He's just angry. That's all.

327
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:36,030
Both of you...
just wait a bit and then go see him.

328
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:38,830
What's the matter? Who beat
the Xiao Family's disciples to become like this?

329
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,830
Don't mention it. It's so strange.

330
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:45,640
The carriages we sent out must have been robbed.

331
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,070
I don't know where those bandits came from.

332
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,470
Wu Tan City has bandits, too?

333
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,630
Some very odd bandits, too.

334
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:55,040
They didn't care about the escorted goods
from other families.

335
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,910
They only robbed our Xiao family.
Tell me, isn't that strange?

336
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,420
Then this must be the Jia Lie family.
Wouldn't an investigation make it clear?

337
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,730
We've investigated,
but couldn't find a thing.

338
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,270
It's about time. Go in.
The Master is in his study.

339
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,810
Yes. Let's go.

340
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,300
You all...

341
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:23,010
I thought you were such fine men.

342
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:28,500
I just wanted you to protect the goods!

343
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,680
As soon as a fight started,
you all ran away first

344
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,490
and let all those defenseless and helpless people,
who don't know any Fight Qi moves, remain there.

345
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:39,580
It doesn't matter
if the medicine cart wasn't protected,

346
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,330
only the people are important.

347
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:46,120
Those shopkeepers and shop assistants
have followed me for so many years.

348
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,560
Tell me. How am I going to explain this to their families,

349
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,390
their wives and children, the young and old?

350
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,820
If I say even our own family's shop
assistants can't be protected,

351
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,520
then why is my Xiao family still
keeping a medicine shop open?

352
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,660
We might as well close the doors!
We don't need to wait here anymore!

353
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,560
- Father.
- Father.

354
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,990
Master!

355
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,550
Hurry and help the shop assistants to the back
and treat their injuries. Go on. Go on.

356
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,550
Come on. Be careful.

357
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:33,770
Be careful. Be careful.

358
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,730
You all just talk.

359
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,890
Father, we have returned.

360
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,330
Father.

361
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,090
You've both grown taller

362
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,540
and fatter.

363
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,980
Father.

364
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,690
Father, just now, we heard you from a distance
scolding the people in here.

365
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,950
We were afraid to come in.

366
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,980
Father, this time I'm back.

367
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,270
You don't need to worry about this matter anymore.

368
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:27,360
No matter who it is,
I will make him pay the price.

369
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,440
You’ve just come back. Fighting and killing.

370
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,600
What is that?

371
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,380
Here.

372
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,090
Father, as soon as Brother Xiao Yan
and I entered the courtyard,

373
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:51,590
I saw the wounded lying all over the ground.
I felt angry right away.

374
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:55,190
You even scolded them.

375
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,940
It's not the first time.

376
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:01,210
This has happened a good many times.
These days,

377
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:03,560
my mind has become a complete muddle.

378
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,130
Father, now that I've returned,

379
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,110
just give this matter to me.

380
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:11,470
I'll solve it. All right?

381
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,350
I'll help, too.

382
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,290
With both of you having returned, my mind feels
peaceful right away. Let me tell you.

383
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:27,320
When the two of you went to the academy,
I've been receiving

384
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,860
news of you. I was especially happy right away.

385
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:35,430
Every time I went to your mother's grave,
I would incessantly talk about you both and nag to her.

386
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,020
After we're done eating the meal in a moment,

387
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,710
- let's all go together to see your Aunt...
- All right.

388
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,230
...and then see your mother.

389
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:45,770
Good. We'll all go together.
