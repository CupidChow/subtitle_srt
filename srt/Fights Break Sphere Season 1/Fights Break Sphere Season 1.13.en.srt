3
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,440
Form 2!

4
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,170
You haven't learned the Bright Fragmented Milky Way
move from the Fall Star Pavilion either, have you?

5
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,270
Didn't your mother teach you that?

6
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,830
Just with these,
you dare to even fight with me?

7
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,230
Kill me if you want.
Stop speaking nonsense.

8
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,560
There’s a possibility I will not kill you

9
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,880
as long as you tell me
where the old man is hiding and hand him over.

10
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,720
In consideration for my Senior,

11
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,450
there's no harm in my sparing your life.

12
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,820
If you want me to tell you,
it's not impossible,

13
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,100
but you must also tell me something.

14
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,080
Still so many conditions.

15
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,820
Fine. Tell me.

16
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,810
How did you kill my mother?

17
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:39,090
There isn’t any harm in me telling you.
The Master of Soul Hall

18
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:44,100
promised me a benefit that I couldn’t refuse.

19
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,810
The condition was to kill Master.

20
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,510
So I took advantage of a situation when he
was unprepared and easily took his life.

21
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:57,770
At that time, I smeared his blood on my face
and went out to call other people. When I returned,

22
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,820
everyone saw your mother crying over Master’s body.

23
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,250
Your mother didn’t offer one word of explanation.

24
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,900
She immediately forced her way
out of the encirclement and ran away.

25
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:13,870
Afterward, I heard she was hounded
by the other four big clans

26
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,160
and committed suicide
because she feared punishment.

27
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,830
Actually, concerning this matter,
for a very long time

28
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,160
I was puzzled and pondered over it a hundred times.

29
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,870
Until I saw the Essence Flame on your body,
I finally understood everything.

30
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,800
Do you know what the strongest kind of fight technique is?

31
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,880
It’s the human heart.

32
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,840
It’s people who are close to you that scheme
for so many years to harm you.

33
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,380
Are the Star Fall Pavilion treasures in here?

34
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,850
Yes.

35
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,860
That year, your mother risked her life to save me.

36
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,430
I was afraid that these treasures, that had been passed on
for generations, would fall into the hands of bad people.

37
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,800
So I told your mother to move everything in here

38
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,360
so they'd be locked inside with me.

39
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,520
Now, please return the Essence Flame to me.
It was originally mine.

40
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,630
Hand over the old man, too.

41
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,320
I guarantee you won’t die.

42
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,590
You’re looking for the old man

43
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,030
and the old man is also looking for you.

44
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,140
Don’t worry.

45
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,060
Both of you will meet each other soon.

46
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,750
I dared to kill him seven years ago.
Do you think I’m afraid of him now?

47
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,850
Back then, my mother endured contempt and humiliation.

48
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,060
She risked her life to protect Medicine Elder.

49
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:02,440
The world has two words: loyalty and righteousness.
People like you

50
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,990
will never understand.

51
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,770
Medicine Elder, I was almost killed by your disciple,

52
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,900
yet you are still sleeping.

53
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,700
Thinking of stealing stuff from the Lion King?

54
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,380
I will kill whoever I see, one by one.

55
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,970
Miss, I’m not your enemy.

56
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:49,679
It’s you?

57
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:01,490
Miss, I have several bottles
of pellet medicine on my body.

58
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,930
There is a bottle that’s used for healing.

59
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,150
Help to take it out for me

60
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,320
and then give me a pill, all right?

61
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,830
I also have some for detoxification here.
Look, you've been poisoned.

62
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,830
You should also eat a pill.
Both of us will leave here together tonight.

63
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,920
You are here already and you still want to go out?

64
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,340
You've been poisoned. How can you still smile?

65
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,230
I haven't been poisoned. The condition I'm in is due to
being distressed from a poison within my body.

66
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,320
Ever since I was born, I have had this poison in my blood.

67
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,530
It’s more poisonous than venomous snakes.

68
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:39,270
This constitution of mine has been passed down
from generation to generation. My mother was also like this.

69
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,320
This distress from the poison within my body
has a special martial arts skill.

70
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,110
It's the Heaven Poison Skill. All these poisonous snakes and
insects are raised by me and used to practice martial skills.

71
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,670
All of them obey my command.

72
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:54,090
Miss, the Heaven Poison Skill is an evil skill

73
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,710
that kills humans invisibly everywhere it goes.

74
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:00,310
People who practice it
don’t live past thirty years old.

75
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,170
Is it worth your troubles?

76
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,720
Listen to my advice.

77
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,670
Although you were born with a body
distressed from the poison within,

78
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:17,130
you can also choose to be a good person. Right?

79
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,880
You’re really a trite and hateful person.

80
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,620
Just say whatever you want.
Why are you becoming hostile?

81
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,010
You’re just like my father. You're also someone
who tries to be on good terms with everyone.

82
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,520
From the moment I was born,
he really wished he could kill me off.

83
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,380
Luckily, my mother was there to protect me and
I was able to survive until I was five or six years old.

84
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,480
When other children beat me,
bullied me, and scolded me

85
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,030
my father always said that it was my fault
and forced me to apologize to others.

86
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:46,360
So at that time, I knew that in this world,

87
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,870
even my father thought that my being born with a body
distressed from poison within was innately wrong.

88
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,070
Afterward, my mother taught me
the Heaven Poison Skill out of anger.

89
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,550
She made others fear me. If anyone dares to bully me,
I’ll just poison that person to death.

90
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:05,260
Then your mother... No...
Then your father was really a worthless being.

91
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,660
This time around,
you really said something that's humane.

92
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,900
Miss, why did you come to
the Magical Beast Mountain Range?

93
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,160
Why does the Amethyst Winged Lion King obey you?

94
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,860
Why are you so powerful?

95
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,720
Later, my father knew that my mother
was secretly teaching me martial arts skills.

96
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,100
He quarreled with my mother. Then he left her.

97
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,310
I was angry and also left home.

98
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,590
I thought I'd go somewhere where
there was no one around, and just die.

99
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,870
It was the Amethyst Winged Lion King who saved me.

100
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,060
Since then, the Amethyst Winged Lion King
and I became mutually dependent on each other.

101
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,120
That day, those with white clothes and a sword

102
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,320
wanted to steal
the Companion Amethyst Source from the Lion King.

103
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,570
Furthermore, the Lion King was also injured.
In order to protect the Lion King,

104
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,610
I secretly laid in ambush in the woods
and released poison at them.

105
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,100
The worst thing in this world

106
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,900
isn't a body suffering from a poison within
or some magical beast, it's humans.

107
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,340
Miss, the Cloud Mist Sect's actions

108
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,500
are indeed hateful.

109
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,440
But... you need to know...

110
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,600
that in this world,
there are still many good people.

111
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,400
We can also try to be good people, right?

112
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Do you think that you're a good person?

113
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,600
In any case, I'm not a bad person.

114
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,980
Then let me ask you.
Why did you come up this mountain?

115
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,800
- For my smelting trial.
- What will the smelting trial help you do?

116
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,300
- To attack magical beasts.
- To attack magical beasts?

117
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,400
Did those magical beasts attack you?

118
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,400
They were naturally born with those magical crystals.
So what right do you have to take them?

119
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,200
Attacking the magical beasts and taking their
magical crystals can increase our Fight Qi skills.

120
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,900
Don't tell me that you think that magical beasts were born
just for you to practice your martial arts skills?

121
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,100
What if other people wanted to practice their martial skills
and needed to hurt you now and then, would you be willing?

122
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,000
When I practice my martial arts skills, I don't even kill
any of these poisonous snakes or poisonous worms.

123
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,200
I even feed them blood every day.
I take my own blood to feed them.

124
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,400
You and others like you are really the worst.

125
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,600
And you have nerve to say
that you're a good person.

126
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,500
But taking the magical crystals
will enable pellet refinement to save lives.

127
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,100
Save what lives?

128
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,300
Those that become sick, those that become hurt,
if they die, let them be then.

129
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,500
If they die, that's because they deserve to die. Don't tell me
magical beasts were born to allow you to make medicine?

130
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,600
All of you from that Jia Nan Academy,

131
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,000
don't you all say time and time again
that you want to do good and to eliminate evil?

132
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,400
In my opinion, you all are the most evil ones.

133
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,800
The mercenaries and the Fight Practitioners
who practice cultivation and refinement,

134
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,300
all of you deserve to die.

135
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,300
I can't win over you in this debate.

136
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,800
Miss, please be merciful.

137
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,700
Can you please let me eat that medicine?

138
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:09,000
Right now, I already can't see clearly anymore.

139
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,600
My ears are also buzzing.

140
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,600
If I don't take the medicine,
I really will die soon.

141
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Eat what medicine?
After all, you'll be dead soon.

142
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,000
You can't get out of here anyway,
and the lion is also injured.

143
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,600
Just obediently stay right here
and be buried along with us.

144
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,800
Don't be like this.

145
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,800
In life, as long as one still has a single breath,

146
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,400
one will still have...

147
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
still have unlimited possibilities.

148
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,200
Miss, please help me heal.

149
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,930
I... I will definitely help you

150
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,900
get revenge against the Cloud Mist Sect.
How about it?

151
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,200
I'm already satisfied with having killed several of them.

152
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Right now, the Lion King has suffered serious injuries
and won't be alive for much longer.

153
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,900
And me? I've already thought it through.

154
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,200
I also don't want to go out there.
I'll just stay here by its side.

155
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,600
And you? You came to kill magical beasts.

156
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,400
You didn't come with good intentions anyway.

157
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,800
Would it still be an injustice if you die here?

158
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,100
Don't struggle anymore.

159
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,400
Consider where you have arrived
to be where you should be.

160
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,200
Miss...

161
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,000
My master

162
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,200
is the world's first alchemist.

163
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,000
As long as I can survive...

164
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,400
Your poison... I can cure you.

165
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,700
The Lion King... Perhaps I can also cure it.

166
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,000
But please, help me.

167
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,570
I still feel that it's better for us to die together.

168
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,300
Be free of worries.

169
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,500
Never mind then...

170
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,880
Xiao Yan!

171
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,400
Brother Xiao Yan!

172
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:12,600
Xiao Yan! Xiao Yan! Xiao Yan!

173
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
What are you doing?

174
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,400
It was you that harmed him.

175
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,300
Last night, he went to find you.

176
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,200
I just knew that as soon as he saw you,
something would happen to him.

177
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,700
What does that have to do with you?

178
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:26,100
Just remember. If he's been harmed in any way,

179
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,900
I'll kill your entire family.

180
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,200
Don't unjustly blame a good person.
Follow me.

181
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,300
Let go.

182
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,900
It was right here.

183
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,500
Last night, Xiao Yan and I went our separate ways
as soon as we finished speaking with one another.

184
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,700
Look at this tree and the grass all around it.

185
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,800
They all show signs of having been harmed by Fight Qi
and have been burned by fire.

186
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,300
It must have been after I have left
that Xiao Yan was attacked by someone.

187
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,200
Do I have to believe whatever you say?

188
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,400
I only remember that yesterday, Xiao Yan only went missing
after he saw you. You can't escape that connection.

189
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,600
You!

190
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,400
Xun'er, I see that the signs
of a fight extend up to here only.

191
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,200
Maybe Xiao Yan went forward in this direction.

192
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Let's go look for him together.

193
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,900
Hurry. Let's go.

194
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:38,499
How is it? The feeling of being dead
is very comfortable, isn't it?

195
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,230
Have I died?

196
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,100
Yes.

197
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,000
Just now, you've already appeared in court
before Yama, the King of Hell.

198
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,700
He said that you've done too many bad things.

199
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,300
He's punishing you by making you stay by my side forever.

200
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,300
It seems like you are also not a really good person.

201
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,800
How was it? Did you fall for my trick?

202
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,390
Yes. Miss, you're simply too amazing.

203
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,300
I'm Xiao Yan. What about you?

204
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,500
First, come over here. Greet His Highness,
the Amethyst Winged Lion King.

205
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,190
The Lion King is inside?

206
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,300
What is it? Are you scared?

207
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,100
Let's go.

208
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Tell him that I need to examine his wound.

209
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,000
I did hear earlier
that you know the practice of alchemy.

210
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,200
Which is the only reason I spared your life.
You must cure the Lion King.

211
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,000
I'll do my best.

212
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,900
He's just trying to treat your wound.
Why are you throwing such a big tantrum?

213
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,500
How is it?

214
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,200
The energy from the sword has already
crushed the bottom of his heart.

215
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,080
He probably can't endure for much longer.

216
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,290
There's not much I can do.

217
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,700
If you die,

218
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,200
I will also stop living.

219
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:26,400
You must not die. Do you understand?

220
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,400
You must not die. You definitely cannot die.

221
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,300
Cannot.

222
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,400
- What are you doing?!
- I'm going to refine the sword energy in his body.

223
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,300
This way, I can at least alleviate some of his suffering.

224
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,900
Are you okay?

225
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,100
I'm fine.

226
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,400
A magical beast like this
shouldn't die without honor.

227
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,400
Eat this. This is a gift from the Lion King.
It's the Companion Amethyst Source.

228
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,400
This is the Companion Amethyst Source?

229
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Every year, several hundred people lose their lives

230
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,600
coming here for it.

231
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,800
You may leave. Light a fire in the entrance to the cave

232
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,200
and burn us as completely as possible.
It's also a good way to end our friendship.

233
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,710
I can't take this Companion Amethyst Source.

234
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,890
The Little Lion King is in here, right?

235
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:46,150
Leave it for him. When he grows up later,
he'll have a good memory of his mother.

236
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,960
Why are you being so wishy-washy?

237
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,340
Being born or being buried is nothing unusual at all.

238
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:58,020
Besides, when the Little Lion King grows up,
he'll have his own Companion Amethyst Source.

239
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,430
Touch him. He'll remember you in the future.

240
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:18,350
Fine. You may leave now.

241
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,560
Remember to start a fire in the entrance to the cave
so that the Lion King and I will be cremated together.

242
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:28,590
I know that being born and being buried is nothing unusual.
Even a magical beast like this had a mother.

243
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,870
Don't tell me you emerged from inside the crack of a rock?
I can cure the condition of your body.

244
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:37,040
Afterward, just let me take you back home. All right?

245
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,120
A moment ago, what did you say your name was?

246
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,140
Xiao Yan.

247
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,920
Grandmother Xiao, quickly get lost!

248
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,640
I’m not leaving. Tell me where your parents are.
I’ll go find them.

249
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,180
I won’t let you die here alone.

250
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:59,240
- Or else, what?
- What do you mean “or else”? How old are you?

251
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,840
I have many good friends by my side.
They’re all good people. I can introduce them to you.

252
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,120
I don’t like good people.

253
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,840
- Then... Then you can deal with me, all right?
- I don’t want to deal with you.

254
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,530
- Then what about the Little Lion King?
- Let the heavens take care of it.

255
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:15,030
Let the heavens take care of it?
Everyone on this mountain wants to kill it.

256
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:19,140
You and the Lion King go see the King of Hell.
What about him? I saw you tearing up just now.

257
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,300
That doesn’t mean anything.

258
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,390
At least it shows you can like a beast.
If you can like a beast, you can like people.

259
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,320
I don’t like people. I like my mother,

260
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,530
but I can't find her. Maybe she's already dead.

261
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:33,720
- My mother is already dead, too. - That's good. In that case,
I'll greet her when I go down the netherworld.

262
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,020
- In this world, there must be someone
who cares about you. Right? - No. There isn't.

263
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,360
- Then, where is your father?
- If I were to return, my father wouldn't want me either.

264
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,760
What?! Why?

265
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,060
He said I was too ugly.

266
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,270
- Nonsense. You’re very pretty. - I have a body distressed
from a poison within. - I can treat it.

267
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,040
- My father said no man will want me in the future!
- I would!

268
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,440
You...

269
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,370
What did you say?

270
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,250
I...

271
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,170
I... Just now...

272
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,730
I’d definitely want you.

273
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,160
Why do you want me?

274
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,930
I want you to come back with me to receive treatment.

275
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:25,880
I want you to live like a normal girl.

276
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,500
I want you to be by my side instead of staying
inside this rotten cave every day

277
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,300
with these poisonous insects, centipedes, and snakes.

278
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,270
You’re feeling sorry for me.

279
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,220
I like you.

280
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,310
Then will you marry me?

281
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,520
Yes. I will marry you.

282
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,380
I must also bring you to see your father

283
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,230
and tell him that this is a very good girl,

284
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,460
but she belongs to me now.

285
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,260
My father was wrong.

286
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,980
It wasn't that no one would want me.

287
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,470
What’s that sound?

288
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,560
Amethyst Winged Lion King.

289
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:57,320
Hao Tian. Your Fight Qi isn’t good.
Stay here. Don't move.

290
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,950
My Fight Qi isn't good. Can all of you

291
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,890
beat the Lion King?

292
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,220
Are you going or not?
If you really run into it,

293
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,370
you certainly won’t be able to return.

294
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,410
Go! Just gloomily returning this way,

295
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,460
we will be despised by people.

296
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,760
That's right.

297
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,660
In this lifetime, being able to fight
with the Amethyst Winged Lion King

298
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,950
is a heroic feat, too.

299
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,260
Fine. I’ll just be as insane as all of you for once.

300
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,240
- Hao Tian.
- What?

301
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,860
You go a bit farther away from us.

302
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,730
If we fail, just turn around and run away.

303
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,140
Return and spread the word.
Don't let us die in vain.

304
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,550
Senior, you really like to nag.

305
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,630
Go!

306
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:30,050
Xiao Yan. My name is Little Medicine Fairy.

307
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,130
Have you remembered it?

308
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,410
I’m Little Medicine Fairy.

309
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,730
I'll remember.

310
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:09,590
Then... here... I sincerely apologize
to all my teachers and classmates.

311
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:14,330
Due to my extreme playfulness,
I went to the Mirror Rock in the middle of the night.

312
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:19,300
As a result of my carelessness,
I came across a

313
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,800
big wild dog, like this.

314
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,410
- Is there a such a big wild dog?
- Yes. Very ferocious.

315
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:31,480
It also has Fight Qi.
It even snatched my Mystical Heavy Ruler.

316
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,150
Elder Han, have you heard of a wild dog
in the Magical Beast Mountain Range?

317
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:39,010
Have you heard of it?

318
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:44,890
That wild dog was as tall as Elder Han when it stood.

319
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,630
Such a ferocious wild dog
and it didn’t bite you to death?

320
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:59,240
Because that dog was stupid.
It was stupid to let me escape from such a calamity.

321
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,780
Fortunately, it was stupid.

322
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,150
I really have not heard of a wild dog that has Fight Qi.

323
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:14,210
Yes. His Fight Qi is a bit similar to mine.

324
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:17,410
Then later, I was bitten by that dog.
It was really unbearable.

325
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:22,100
I jumped off the cliff. It just so happened that I fell
near the entrance to a cave. Afterward, I went inside.

326
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,100
You said you fell near a cave.
Why didn’t you call out to us?

327
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,990
Don’t you have a whistle?

328
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:30,890
Don’t you know that day,
everyone spent all day long trying to find you?

329
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,970
If you act this way again
and make people worry about you,

330
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,120
tell me how I am to explain it
to Elder Mi Tengshan when I return?

331
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,590
I’m really sorry, Teacher Ruo Lin.

332
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:42,860
At that time, my Fight Qi was drained.
I didn’t even have the strength to blow the whistle.

333
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:47,180
Afterward, an Old Grandfather saved me.

334
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,720
There was an Old Grandfather?

335
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,340
Then, who was that person?

336
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:58,530
I also don’t know who that Old Grandfather was.

337
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:03,430
He wouldn’t let me say. But that Old Grandfather told me

338
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,460
that I didn’t need to be afraid of that vicious dog.

339
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,780
If that vicious dog still dared to show up again,

340
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,710
he would personally smash that dog’s head.

341
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:19,270
But if that vicious dog continued to be good
and stay for a few years,

342
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:23,110
then he will let that vicious dog live a few more years.

343
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,690
It’s a very thrilling story.

344
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:35,990
Elder Ruo Lin, shouldn’t we go to
the Old Grandfather’s house and give him proper thanks?

345
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:39,480
After all, the Old Grandfather saved our student. Right?

346
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:43,360
- Where is the Old Grandfather staying now?
- He wouldn't let me say that either.

347
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,720
He immediately left after he finished speaking.
Before he left, he even told me

348
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,500
he’d always be around.

349
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:55,840
Furthermore, he’ll always continue

350
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,080
to attentively watch that vicious dog.

351
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,930
Here.

352
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,400
What are you doing?

353
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,590
- Xiao Yan, it’s best you hide a bit far away.
- What am I hiding from?

354
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,780
Xiao Yan, you are really going to be ruined this time.
Really ruined.

355
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:30,330
- No matter how high your Fight Qi is,
you can’t offend a woman. - What?

356
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:34,700
- Xiao Yan, good job.
- I have experienced it before. You won't be ruined.

357
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,090
What are you talking about?

358
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,170
Xun'er.

359
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,780
Follow me.

360
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,230
Wonderful.

361
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:07,730
Does it have anything to do with you?
It’s none of your business.

362
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,000
- Why won’t you let me see?
- What is there to see? Let’s go!

363
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:17,390
That girl inside your tent,
what is that all about?

364
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:23,110
You're referring to Little Medicine Fairy?
She... She was unexpected.

365
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,820
When did you go out and get married on your own?

366
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,650
Why don't I know about it?

367
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,640
It really was unexpected.

368
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,030
Besides, I'm a male.
How can I be married off?

369
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,570
That... Don't joke about it.

370
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:45,540
She... I was talking in such a hurry and
that's why I said those words. I didn't want to either.

371
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,900
Just because you were talking in a hurry
you got yourself married off?

372
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,170
I haven't seen you in just one day
and you already belong to someone else?

373
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,820
How is that possible?
How can I belong to someone else?

374
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,930
I am me. Xun'er, you're a girl—

375
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,920
Don't give me that nonsense.

376
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,770
You have to believe me.

377
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,290
I was left with no other choice.

378
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:09,790
She's already calling you "husband"
and you're still left with no other choice?

379
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:12,010
She's calling me husband now?

380
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,770
Xun'er, that time, inside the cave,

381
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,810
she was bent on dying with that Amethyst Winged Lion King.

382
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:21,870
So, I couldn't just watch her and...

383
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:28,280
Right? Also... Also, I haven't sought out
vengeance for my family yet.

384
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,030
I still have an arranged meeting in three year's time
with Nalan Yanran that's yet to be settled.

385
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,760
The most important thing is...

386
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,370
What?

387
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,790
Xun'er, you have to believe me.

388
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:49,330
Fine then. Then tell me, that night,

389
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:52,210
why did Nalan Yanran look for you?

390
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:54,360
She asked me about the Blood Sect and the Essence Flame.

391
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,000
You didn't say anything in a hurry with her, too. Right?

392
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,940
I'll go write Father a letter.

393
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,420
You...

394
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,570
are actually quite good-looking.

395
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,730
Not as good-looking as your husband.

396
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,620
Husband!

397
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:55,880
Husband, I was talking with your little sister.
I like her.

398
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,270
We surely will be good sisters-in-law in the future.

399
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,010
Lin Xiuya!

400
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,500
- Outside—
- Lower your voice.

401
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,990
What?!

402
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:10,290
That... Lin Xiuya,

403
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,660
someone's ouside looking for you.

404
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,740
Looking for me? Who?

405
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,650
Seems like a mercenary.
He claims to be your family.

406
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,600
My family? I'll go out and look.

407
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,980
All right.

408
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:32,400
- Little Medicine Fairy.
- Call me Wife.

409
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,960
That...

410
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,410
We use this box to carry our blankets and daily stuff.

411
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:44,030
Now, it's to be used to contain you.

412
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,970
Right now, the Cloud Mist Sect is still looking for you.

413
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,230
If you are discovered, none of us can escape.

414
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,670
Then, once you leave the mountain,
you'll go see my father

415
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,770
and then marry me. Right?

416
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,870
Of course, we have to go see your father.

417
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:59,960
After handing you over to your father,
I'll be at ease.

418
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,700
It's just that I...

419
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,790
I have to continue school.

420
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,710
Then when will you marry me?

421
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,490
Let's not talk about that right now.
Look, we're both still kids.

422
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:14,510
Even though we...
Nevermind, there's no "even though."

423
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,740
Jia Nan Academy does not allow its students to be married.

424
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,090
Right?

425
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,460
Then you'll just not go to school.

426
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,440
How can I not go to school?

427
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,290
Come... I have already paid the tuition.
I have to go.

428
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,970
Come... I'll go back first

429
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,020
and think of a way to cure your body
suffering from the poison within.

430
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,100
Once I have a cure for your poisoned body,
I surely will come to look for you.

431
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,790
Let's just talk about future things in the future.
All right?

432
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,910
All right then. I won't go home anymore.
I'll go to school with you.

433
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:49,770
When you go to school in the morning,
I'll hide here in this box.

434
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:52,440
And then at night, when you come back,

435
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,510
I'll come out and be with you.

436
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:58,090
No. How can you do that?

437
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,360
If I go to school, I should act like a student.
A good student. Right?

438
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,400
- Don't say anything anymore. Didn't you already
call me husband? - Yes.

439
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,210
- Then am I your husband already?
- Yes.

440
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,990
- Then shouldn't you listen to your husband?
- Yes!

441
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:10,300
Now, get in and hide yourself well.

442
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,010
My goodness.

443
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,080
This is more tiring
than fighting with a magical beast.

444
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,930
All of you, if you speak nonsense outside,
no matter who it is, I'll--

445
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,970
Student Xiao Yan.

446
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,710
- We will go out to get some fresh air.
- Get some fresh air.

447
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,280
- Don't.
- Keep up the good work!

448
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,180
- Go ahead and get busy first.
- Weren't you all so excited to pack your things earlier?

449
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,290
What is it?

450
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:46,760
I heard you just returned.
Where did you go?

451
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,290
Did a stray dog bite you?

452
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:52,900
Yes. Almost got bitten to death.

453
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:57,450
But I'm fine. That stray dog wasn't beckoned by you.

454
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:02,940
It's good that you're fine. Xiao Xun'er
even got mad at me, as if I harmed you.

455
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,700
I know that you two have a close sibling relationship,
but I'm from the Nalan Clan.

456
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,700
I must clear it up since this concerns my clan's reputation.

457
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,060
That's it?

458
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,410
You--

459
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,050
Someone fainted over there!

460
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,040
Come here...!

461
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,700
Are you okay?

462
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,550
Husband.

463
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,680
What?

464
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,360
Help me with something.

465
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,550
Speak.

466
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:02,960
Can you go see
if that girl from a while ago has died?

467
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,320
What did you do?

468
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,840
She was so mean and so harsh to you
when she talked to you a while ago.

469
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,630
I couldn't stand it,

470
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:20,050
so I secretly shot a poison needle at her.

471
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,980
If you still don't go see about her now,
she may really be dead soon.

472
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,840
Be good.

473
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,310
- Here, I have the antidote.
- What medicine is it?

474
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,310
It's the Spiritual Snake Pellet.
It probably can cure her poison.

475
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,590
Teacher Ruo Lin,

476
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:17,490
students from our Jia Nan Academy actually use
stealth weapons. That is not a simple matter.

477
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:21,990
Xiao Yan, I heard that earlier

478
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:25,090
she came out of your tent before she fainted.

479
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:27,000
Is that what happened?

480
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,720
If it really has something to do with me,

481
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,120
then why would I come here to give her the antidote?

482
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:39,610
That's true.

483
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:44,460
Her poison isn't that deep yet.
She must have been poisoned just a little while ago.

484
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:50,300
If it wasn't done by our students,
is there an outsider here?
