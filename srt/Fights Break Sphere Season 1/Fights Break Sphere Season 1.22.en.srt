=Episode 22=

3
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,200
Xiao Yan...

4
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,500
- Say, can't you two move aside first? I'll
transfer some Fight Qi to him. - I will, too.

5
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,400
No, no... you two can't.
Your Fight Qi isn't that strong.

6
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,900
Say, will it be faster if we pass it
through his mouth? Like eating medicine?

7
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,000
His mouth?

8
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,900
What? How?

9
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,700
Using your mouth to transfer the Fight Qi to him.

10
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,060
Can that work?

11
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,900
Give it a try.

12
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,700
That is such an eyesore!

13
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,900
Aren't I doing it to save him?!
Why don't you do it then?!

14
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,600
Come!

15
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,200
You all are overthinking this.

16
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,400
It's me who will still do it.

17
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,600
I can't do it. I can't kiss him.

18
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,800
Your Xiao Yan is already awake.

19
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,300
Awake?

20
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,500
Brother Xiao Yan.

21
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,800
Xiao Yan.

22
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,400
- Brother Xiao Yan.
- Xiao Yan.

23
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,600
- Han Xian...
- He's awake!

24
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,900
What rotten idea was that?

25
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,800
You want to kiss me?

26
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,530
Isn't it all thanks to my rotten idea?
If not, would you wake up this fast?

27
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,400
- Alright already.
- This is so great.

28
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,200
- Did everyone safely come out?
- Come.

29
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,100
- Are you all right?
- Give me a hug.

30
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,500
Come.

31
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Your Majesty!

32
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,400
Slow down!

33
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,900
Your Majesty!

34
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,100
Slow down!

35
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,800
Your Majesty!

36
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,500
Your Majesty.

37
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,300
Wasn't he still feeling well this morning?

38
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,200
The vitality of the Former Emperor has been exhausted.

39
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,100
Your Majesty... you must not.

40
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,100
The unhealthy atmosphere around the Former Emperor
is too grave. You must not approach him.

41
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,100
The Former Emperor has passed on !

42
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,100
Imperial Father...

43
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,200
What's wrong, my son?

44
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,300
Afraid now?

45
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,500
You're that jerk from Soul Hall...
you can't fool me.

46
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,700
I don't plan to deceive you.
From the start—

47
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,510
It's you...

48
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,600
It's you who killed my Imperial Father.

49
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,400
Your Imperial Father...

50
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,700
Mediocre and incompetent. A good empire

51
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,200
became half-dead in his hands.

52
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,240
When I entered his body,

53
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,000
the Chu Yun Empire started to turn around, didn't it?

54
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,400
Don't be nervous.
I just want to chat with you.

55
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,700
You want to enter my body?
That's not that easy.

56
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,600
My son's age is the same as yours.

57
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,700
Too bad, he's dead.

58
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,800
These next few days,
I don't want to kill anyone

59
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,400
and don't want to possess anyone.

60
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Whatever you say now,
I won't believe you.

61
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,800
You don't know my name?

62
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,200
My name is Fan Lao. My son is Fan Ling.

63
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,600
He disappeared with the Mystical Mountain Painting.

64
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,400
He will never return.

65
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,200
You are the father of Fan Ling?
You're a slave of Soul Hall!

66
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,600
In my opinion, there are only two
kinds of people in this world.

67
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,400
Slaves and those who want to be enslaved
but are not given the chance.

68
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,500
What's wrong with being a slave for Soul Hall?

69
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,000
When a rabbit gets eaten by an eagle,
it becomes a part of the eagle.

70
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,400
The rabbit also becomes stronger.

71
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,500
Rotten reasoning.

72
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,100
I'll talk and you listen.

73
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,580
Let's see who between us is the rotten one.

74
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,600
The so-called Five Great Clans... the Xiao Clan

75
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,200
only has that friend of yours, Xiao Yan left.

76
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,400
If Soul Hall deals with him,

77
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,800
I think that it will be easier
than killing an ant. Right?

78
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,000
Cloud Mist Sect, Star Fall Pavilion,

79
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,490
they all have Soul Hall forces among them.

80
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,500
Gu Clan? They are far across the sea

81
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,100
and they have unending troubles.

82
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,600
They don't really want to meddle in your problems.

83
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,600
As for the Nalan Clan,

84
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,200
that little girl is not worthy
of being mentioned at all.

85
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,600
Think about it.

86
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,000
Who else can help you go up against the Soul Hall?

87
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,900
Is that rotten reasoning then?

88
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,800
Do you really want to go
against a boulder with an egg?

89
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:57,030
But if you're willing to work with us,

90
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,000
I can put down seeking vengeance for my son's death

91
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,590
and... I can give you unimaginable power.

92
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,100
But I'm already the Emperor.

93
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,900
There are still a lot of empires
on the Fight Qi Continent and a lot of citizens.

94
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,600
The Master of Soul Hall

95
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,200
has no interest in ruling over the world.

96
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,600
If you work for him,

97
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,000
he can help you become the Emperor of the World.

98
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,700
Your name will inspire awe throughout the world
and be remembered forever.

99
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,200
The younger generations will know
that you are a mighty emperor

100
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,800
and no one will know that the person
behind you is the Soul Hall Master.

101
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,290
What will I have to give in exchange?

102
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,300
Your heart's loyalty.

103
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,700
How about it?

104
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,400
I don't understand.

105
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,100
Listen to the words of the Master of Soul Hall.
Do the things he wants you to do.

106
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,000
Our enemy is the Five Great Clans.

107
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,900
After they are eliminated,

108
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,700
the whole world will be yours.

109
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,000
Go back and tell him then

110
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,400
that my loyalty belongs to my ancestors.

111
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,200
The ancestors of the Chu Yun Empire followed
the Fight God in sealing in Hun Miesheng.

112
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,600
If I became a slave of Soul Hall today,

113
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,200
I fear that I won't be able to face them in death.

114
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,900
You're too stubborn. If I am your Imperial Father, too,

115
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,600
I also urge you to accept it.

116
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,600
When I was little, my Imperial Father once
told me a vulgar commoner saying.

117
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,900
In one's life, you'd rather freely eat shit,

118
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,700
than eat meat in a lowly manner.

119
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,300
You... are not my Imperial Father.

120
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,500
You dare refuse me.
What's waiting for you

121
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,940
is an unending nightmare.

122
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,900
Unending...nightmare.

123
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,700
Unending... nightmare.

124
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,700
I have an idea.

125
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,200
Let's draw portraits of Elder Tengshan
and then paste them everywhere.

126
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,100
Below it, we'll write, "Anyone who sees
this person will be heavily rewarded."

127
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,100
- What will you use to reward them?
- Put it on our account first.

128
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,800
The Soul Energy requires that you draw the Fight Qi

129
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,100
from your four limbs and hundreds of bones into your heart.

130
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,700
Imagine that your root chakra is
turning into a red lotus flower.

131
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,300
If you have one moon above you,
the sacral chakra becomes the yellow lotus flower.

132
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,900
If you have two moons above you,
the heart chakra turns into a white lotus flower.

133
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,500
If you have one sun above you,
the throat chakra turns into a red lotus flower.

134
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,300
With the sun and moon rising,
your Fight Qi will shoot straight up toward the crown chakra.

135
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,900
In the crown comfortably sits the black supreme nothingness.

136
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,300
Within the nothingness are numerous stars

137
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:23,300
forming and dying in an instant. Using this Soul Energy,
you can be released from your body.

138
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,000
A thousand mile journey can be done in a moment.

139
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,600
Oceans and all the people are just in front of you.

140
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,900
- Without form or traces, this is the first technique.
- Jerk...

141
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,900
Do you know what it is you're doing?

142
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,200
Don't mind me!

143
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,200
What are you saying?
You better believe I'll kill you with one hit!

144
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,000
Why did you secretly remove the spatial ring?

145
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,800
Say it!

146
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,600
I'm trying to learn the martial arts techniques
written on the Mystical Heavy Ruler.

147
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,900
Didn't I tell you not to learn the things written
on the Mystical Heavy Ruler? Didn't I?!

148
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,530
Why must you learn them?!

149
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,800
You think I really want to?!

150
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,400
This is my only way. I can only do this!

151
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,700
I claim to be the world's number one.

152
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,900
Never thought that in these past years,
I've raised a child for the Soul Hall.

153
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,200
I wasn't raised by you!

154
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
My mother gave birth to me and my father raised me.

155
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,200
I know what I'm doing!

156
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,200
I won't kill you. Leave now.

157
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,220
I disappointed your mother's hopes for you.

158
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,800
When everything is doomed,

159
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,400
don't blame me for not warning you.

160
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,500
I knew you wouldn't like it,

161
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,000
that's why I removed the spatial ring.

162
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,300
Medicine Elder, I won't become a lackey of Soul Hall.

163
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,500
Elder Tengshan has been so kind to me.

164
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,099
If I learn only this one technique,

165
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,699
there will be a chance for me to save him.

166
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,200
It was written on the Mystical Heavy Ruler

167
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,300
that this technique can make you invisible.

168
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,500
In looking for a person or an item,
despite how far the distance,

169
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,800
as long as you imagine it, you can appear there.

170
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:30,599
I am also out of any other ideas.

171
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:34,299
I really was left with no other choice,
that's why I'm learning this technique.

172
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,600
Soul Energy...

173
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,100
Is there a problem with this technique?

174
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,200
Or did I learn it wrong?

175
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,600
So what if you correctly learn it?

176
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,400
Training in this technique from Soul Hall indeed
can help you immediately find Mi Tengshan.

177
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,300
From now on, you don't need to find people
by searching from place to place.

178
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,700
Even if he is thousands of miles from here,

179
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,800
as long as you desire it,

180
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,500
you can casually kill people.

181
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,500
I won't.

182
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,600
Have you ever thought how those people
started to follow the Soul Hall?

183
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,800
You couldn't even control one little temptation
and you're falling deeper and deeper.

184
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,380
I thought that with you being from the Xiao Clan,

185
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,410
you could resist these temptations.

186
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,380
I was wrong.

187
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I only want to find Elder Mi Tengshan.

188
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,400
Why must you assume that I will surely become evil?

189
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,000
Since time immemorial, a blade killing people

190
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,100
is never the blade's fault,
but the fault of the person wielding it.

191
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,300
Because there is no good or evil
with martial arts techniques,

192
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,100
the ones determining if they're used
for good or bad are the people.

193
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,700
Are you the only person who has ever figured that out?!

194
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,200
There are so many great fighters on our Fight Qi Continent,
but how come they don't train in the Soul Hall techniques?

195
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,700
Is it because they are inferior to you?

196
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,800
The frightening thing about the Soul Hall
is not that they'll destroy you,

197
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,600
but that they slowly lure you into becoming another person.

198
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,900
Once your desire begins to blossom,

199
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:16,000
you will want to train in higher ranking martial arts techniques,
achieve more outstanding feats, or have even greater power.

200
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,200
By then, Soul Hall will readily offer you a contract

201
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,100
and what will you do?

202
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,200
I will never become like that.

203
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,800
I surely can control myself.

204
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,340
I've heard so many people say those words.

205
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,390
Just do as you want.

206
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,800
If you have time, think about my words,

207
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,400
that is if you're still alive.

208
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,600
Medicine Elder! Medicine Elder!

209
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:03,800
Throw away the spatial ring.
Don't come here again.

210
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,200
Medicine Elder! Medicine Elder!

211
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,900
Medicine Elder!

212
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,800
Why are you here?

213
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Do you know how long you fainted?

214
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,600
I'm fine.

215
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,490
I was just too tired.

216
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,500
Liar! I heard you arguing with someone.

217
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,400
Who is it?

218
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,200
I want to learn a martial arts technique of the Soul Hall.

219
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,700
Then I want to find Elder Tengshan and save him.

220
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,500
A martial arts technique of the Soul Hall?

221
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,500
We don't know if Elder Tengshan is still alive or not.

222
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,700
This is the only way.

223
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,300
- Then... You still can't—
- Do you trust me?

224
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,750
I do.

225
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
That's good.

226
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,600
I never lie to you.

227
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,400
I don't believe that a person will become evil

228
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,800
just because he learned some Fight Qi Technique.

229
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,970
It is not like that.

230
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,300
A man should do what he can do.

231
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,900
If you have a way but you don't do it,

232
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,960
that is being irresponsible.

233
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,900
Elder Tengshan must have been taken by someone.

234
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,500
One day more in the hands of the bad people

235
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,000
is one day more of danger.

236
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,400
I can find him.

237
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,200
Elder Tengshan!

238
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,000
Elder Tengshan!

239
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,500
Elder Tengshan...

240
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,700
Elder Mi, have you been well?

241
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm well and not well.

242
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,600
Really?

243
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,200
After staying here for some days,

244
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,600
my stomach has become smaller from the hunger.

245
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,900
If you lock me up for a few more days,
no one will be able to recognize me anymore.

246
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,900
Would you like to go out?

247
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,630
Sure you would.

248
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,000
I can let you out now,

249
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,400
but it will be a bit hard to explain

250
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,300
where you've been these past few days.

251
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,300
Tell them that I got lost.

252
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,400
This reason is not that great.

253
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,500
I'm already this old,
so how could I still get lost?

254
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:45,200
Or... you went to visit a friend,
had drinks every day and forgot about it.

255
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,500
That's impossible.

256
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,000
Students are my life.

257
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,510
How could I forget about them?

258
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,500
I'll say that I got captured by bad people

259
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,500
and then I escaped.

260
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,590
Which bad people?

261
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,400
State Teacher Fa Ma.

262
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,900
We were chatting quite well,

263
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,400
so why are you suddenly hitting me?

264
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,400
You are still being tough-mouthed, even now.

265
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,100
Tomorrow, the envoys of Soul Hall will be arriving.

266
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,000
I'll hand you over to them.

267
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,200
I'll let you experience how it is
to get imprisoned in Soul Hall.

268
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,800
A place in the Extreme North.
Dark and bitterly cold.

269
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,600
I hope that your body will be
tough enough to endure it.

270
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,500
Sure, all right.

271
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,100
I have never been to Soul Hall.

272
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,000
I'll wait for your answer tomorrow morning.

273
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,100
This is your last chance.

274
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,600
In dealing with Fa Ma, we should use speed.

275
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
If we alarm him,

276
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,400
that's equivalent to having no chance of succeeding.

277
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,500
Do you still have the heartbreaking herbs from last time?

278
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,200
I do.

279
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,000
We'll go look for State Teacher.
We'll say that we found

280
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,200
a small multicolored snake for him to see.

281
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,300
When I open the lid,
immediately throw the heartbreaking herb

282
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,400
toward his neck. When Queen pounces on him,

283
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,600
I'll make my three kinds of flames appear and burn him.

284
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,200
I got this from the market.

285
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,600
When Fa Ma stands up,
I'll stab his foot with this

286
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,500
and let him get beaten by you.

287
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,400
Correct. I'll then stuff his mouth,

288
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,400
so that he can't shout even if he's getting battered.

289
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,000
Xun'er, you and Hu Jia will guard the door
and kill anyone who comes.

290
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,700
All right.

291
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,200
That is the State Teacher.
What if we're unable to suppress him?

292
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,200
We still have to make him half-dead.

293
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,500
And then? Let's not talk about
being able to escape or not first.

294
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,800
The person we are dealing against is the State Teacher.

295
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,910
What if he dies?

296
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,800
What if he doesn't die?

297
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,600
Xun'er, if you're afraid—

298
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,600
What are you saying?

299
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,900
All right, all right already.

300
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,300
So what if he's the State Teacher?
It's as if we didn't fight with an emperor before.

301
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,000
If we don't act now,

302
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,790
Elder Tengshan will get imprisoned
by the Soul Hall forever.

303
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,200
Why then are we still learning Fight Qi?

304
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,000
Xiao Yan, are you sure that
Elder Tengshan is with the State Teacher?

305
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,200
That matter,

306
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
I've already explained it the whole morning.

307
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,000
Are you all in or not?

308
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,000
Let's do it!

309
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,890
State Teacher, this is their visitation letter.

310
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,600
Why did these kids come here?

311
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,500
Not only are they here,

312
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,000
I'm even unable to refuse them
after these words of theirs.

313
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:48,200
"I, Xiao Yan, with Xiao Xun'er,

314
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,000
Han Xian, Hao Tian, and Hu Jia, we five people

315
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,300
were decreed by His Majesty

316
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,700
to thank the State Teacher for your guidance during

317
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,000
the Alchemist Competition.
We have also prepared a gift.

318
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,100
Bowing to you..."

319
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:16,100
In just a few moments,
the envoy from Soul Hall will be coming.

320
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,500
You have no time to talk with them.

321
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,800
Just let them go back.

322
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,800
Xiao Yan is currently a favorite of the Emperor.

323
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,400
He even used the name of the Emperor to come here.

324
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,100
It's not proper to drive him away.
It will cause us trouble.

325
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,200
Could it be...

326
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,200
they have smelled something fishy?

327
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,080
Impossible.

328
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,100
No one can easily come in and out of my place.

329
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:53,600
Show them in.

330
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,990
Yes.

331
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,920
Hide for a while first.

332
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,450
Yes.

333
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,400
State Teacher, the guests are here.

334
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,700
- Leave now.
- Yes.

335
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,400
Seeing people from the younger generation,

336
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,800
I am really happy.

337
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,800
Greetings, State Teacher!

338
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,000
Forego with the formalities.

339
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,800
I've seen your heroic might during the competition.

340
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,600
I feel that the Alchemist Guild has promising future members.

341
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,900
The guild has decided

342
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,700
that all those who passed the first round of competition

343
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,100
will be given a First-Grade Alchemist Badge.

344
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:00,410
As for Xiao Yan, he's a young outstanding talent.

345
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:03,000
Not only are his alchemy skills good,

346
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,100
he even saved so many people
in the Mystical Mountain Painting.

347
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:11,500
The guild has decided to make an exception
and grant you a Third-Grade Alchemist Badge.

348
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:16,000
Thank you, State Teacher, for the promotion.
I will never forget this.

349
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,600
Why did you all come here?

350
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,000
We have a treasure that we want to show you.

351
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,400
Really?

352
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,200
At the Magical Beast Mountain Range before,

353
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,600
we were able to find a very small
Multicolored Ingesting Heavenly Python.

354
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,300
Really? Ancient legends say

355
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,100
this kind of magical beast has become extinct.

356
00:31:55,100 --> 00:32:00,100
That's right. The treasures in this world
are usually controlled by a virtuous one.

357
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,400
Kids like us can't possibly control
this kind of magical beast.

358
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,200
Hence, we especially brought it for you to see.

359
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
State Teacher!

360
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,600
- You have a guest.
- Who?

361
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,000
It's the special guest that you've been waiting for today.
May Lord go greet him.

362
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,490
Really so sorry. I'll be back right away.

363
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,700
Is it very hot here?

364
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,500
Not hot.

365
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,800
You all are perspiring a lot.

366
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,000
Drink more tea to cool your internal heat.

367
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
I was so scared.

368
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,200
My heart... was about to jump out of my mouth.

369
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,400
Don't be nervous. Once he comes back,

370
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,000
we'll do as we originally planned.

371
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,000
I'm so nervous. This is such a torment.

372
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,600
State Teacher, Lord Fan is here.

373
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,600
Greetings, Lord Fan.

374
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,800
State Teacher, you have worked hard.

375
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,400
I dare not say that.

376
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,500
Lord, Mi Tengshan is here.

377
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,200
You can take him away at anytime.

378
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:16,700
One more thing.
When you hear this, you surely will be happy.

379
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,900
- The person who killed your son just came.
He's in the study. -Really?

380
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:25,100
Xiao Yan and his four accomplices.

381
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,600
I know my Lord hates them a lot.

382
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:32,400
Why don't you kill them too today?

383
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,699
Let Mi Tengshan go!

384
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,620
Let him go?

385
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,600
Mi Tengshan was just our springboard
to control the Jia Nan Academy.

386
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,900
If he won't listen, just change to another one.

387
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:04,500
Making such a grand move
is going to make people suspicious.

388
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,700
Yes. Lord has thought about this thoroughly.

389
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,700
As for Xiao Yan, my son didn't die in vain.

390
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,700
When I arrived here, I already sensed Xiao Yan.

391
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,600
Within him is the scent of Soul Hall.

392
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,300
He is already half a Soul Hall disciple.

393
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:29,500
In the future, he will surely provide us good assistance.

394
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,000
Lord, you're saying
that he's also a member of Soul Hall now?

395
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,200
Not now, but soon.

396
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,200
The Lord Hun Miesheng is very interested in him.

397
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,700
Yes...

398
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,900
I initially wanted to deal with your enemy

399
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,100
and bring his head to you. That was close.

400
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,000
The Lord Hun Miesheng asked me to send you a message...

401
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,700
Let me tell you some good news.

402
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:07,250
Your teacher, Mi Tengshan, has been found.

403
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,800
Take Elder Tengshan back to the inn first.

404
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,000
If there are any mishaps, you can find me anytime.

405
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,600
I'll go to the palace now to see His Majesty.
I have finally fulfilled

406
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,700
the task given to me by His Majesty.

407
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,200
State Teacher, where was Elder Tengshan found?

408
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,000
What happened to him? Why is he unconscious?

409
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Look at his chest.

410
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,680
The Blood Sect.

411
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,300
At the time, there were a lot of Blood Sect disciples
that came and caused trouble.

412
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,000
My men kept following them.

413
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,900
Finally, in a cave where they were hiding,
my men also found Mi Tengshan.

414
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,200
This foiled their evil scheme

415
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:17,100
and Elder Tengshan was rescued.
It was really fortunate.

416
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,800
Was he not harmed further?

417
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,700
I already had him take a life-saving pellet.

418
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,800
He will wake up later.
Whatever really happened,

419
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,700
you can ask him yourself.

420
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,400
Elder Tengshan, how are you?

421
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,440
In these past days, how did you survive it?

422
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,400
Elder Tengshan...

423
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,700
I don't remember anymore.

424
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,600
I'm sleepy.

425
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,000
I want to sleep.

426
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,200
Elder Tengshan...

427
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,800
Brother Xiao Yan, just let Elder Tengshan
recover a little before asking.

428
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,600
Go make preparations.

429
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,900
We'll immediately escort Elder Tengshan
back to the academy.

430
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,840
Let's go out.

431
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,840
Medicine Elder!

432
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,100
Medicine Elder!

433
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,800
Medicine Elder!

434
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,090
