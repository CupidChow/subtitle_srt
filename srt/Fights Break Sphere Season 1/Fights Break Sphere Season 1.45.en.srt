3
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,200
Did the Master of the Soul Hall teach you
this set of Fight Techniques?

4
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,700
There's no need for your words,
son of the traitor.

5
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,200
Pavilion Master Han is right.

6
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,200
I, Yan Luotian, am on your side.

7
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,800
Working hand in glove together
to a nefarious end.

8
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,700
Come on, all together.

9
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,200
You've destroyed my Fight Qi.

10
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,400
You might just as well kill me.

11
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Kill you? You're unfit for that.

12
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,200
The Cloud Mist Sect was established
for thousands of years.

13
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,600
It's unimaginable that we should encounter
such a calamity today.

14
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,100
Rascal, be done with your song and dance.

15
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,600
Now, evil has become rampant
in the Fight Qi Continent.

16
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,200
There's not even one
from the Cloud Mist Sect to battle it.

17
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,000
As the leader of the Five Great Families

18
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,900
you insisted on saying that you needed to
practise asceticism behind closed doors.

19
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,400
Are you really not afraid that you will become
the laughing stock of the entire world?

20
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,800
- Has the Cloud Mist Sect sought refuge with the Soul Hall?
- Haha...

21
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,000
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

22
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,800
You have the audacity to slander the Cloud Mist Sect in
the presence of all the heroes from the different sects.

23
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,600
Accusing us of being the pawn of the Soul Hall?

24
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,200
You assigned the Thirteen Elders
of the Cloud Mist Sect

25
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,000
to completely destroy my entire Xiao family.

26
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,200
Captured my father and gave him to the Soul Hall.

27
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Every single one of the few hundred lives
of my Xiao family

28
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,300
has become a dead soul under your sword.

29
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,800
I'm here at the Could Mist Sect today.

30
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,200
The third thing

31
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,400
is to avenge for my Xiao family.

32
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,300
To kill Yun Shan. To get back justice.

33
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,600
Yun Shan old devil

34
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
come down to meet your death.

35
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,400
Display the formation.

36
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,400
Cloud Mist Covering the Sun Formation.

37
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,200
Yun Shan

38
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,400
you renounced and abandoned the Five Tribes,
and sought refuge with the Soul Hall.

39
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,400
You completely destroyed the entire Xiao family
and captured the clan leader Xiao Zhan.

40
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,000
Today, my Gu Clan will enforce justice
on behalf of the Heaven.

41
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,400
It will not end until you are dead.

42
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,800
Dragon Mother of the Gu Clan.

43
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You should ensure that your clan is taken care of.

44
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You have nothing to do with
this matter of Cloud Mist Sect.

45
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,600
I grew up in the Xiao family,
just like a biological child.

46
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,000
On the other hand, you sought refuge with the Soul Hall.

47
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,200
Do you still remember your own surname?

48
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,800
Xun'er, there's no need to talk nonsense with him.

49
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,100
How dare you two half grown children

50
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,800
make slanderous charges against me.

51
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Do you really think that you can

52
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,100
battle for awe inspiring authority here?

53
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,200
Xiao Yan, you align yourself
with the Dragon Mother of the Gu Clan

54
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,600
against the Cloud Mist Sect and Star Fall Pavilion,

55
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,000
and even the Nalan Clan, inciting discord among them.

56
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,600
You destroyed the camaraderie
of the Alliance of the Five Tribes.

57
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,100
You are the traitor.

58
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,200
A villain with ulterior motives.

59
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,800
Still trying to quibble.
Let me flatten your Cloud Mist Sect to the ground

60
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,600
and we'll see if your Blood Sect Master

61
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,800
will come out to take charge of you.

62
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,700
Arrogant.

63
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,000
Imperial General of the Snake Tribe,

64
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,400
Mo Basi

65
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,800
pays his respect to the Snake King.

66
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,800
Paying my respect to Your Majesty,
the Snake King.

67
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,800
Didn't I tell you not to come?

68
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
The Snake King has bestowed grace
upon the Snake People Empire.

69
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,400
When you are in trouble,
how can we sit idly and not help?

70
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,200
We will act according to our words,
and pay our debt of gratitude.

71
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,400
This is also the wish of our Queen, Her Majesty.

72
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,900
Thank you.

73
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,400
Are all of you here?

74
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,800
There are many people helping you.

75
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,900
Since they are all here,

76
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,200
don't leave.

77
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,900
Change formation.

78
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,300
Close in on the formation.

79
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,600
You killed my entire tribe.
Enough of living!

80
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,800
I didn't mean anything to happen to your father.

81
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,800
He refused to let me have the Ancient Jade.

82
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,400
So I can only bring him to the altar of the Soul Hall.

83
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,800
Let him think through and understand.

84
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You are like your father.

85
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,200
Stubborn in temperament.

86
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,800
When the time comes for me to hang you at the altar

87
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,800
let's see if you would still be so stubborn.

88
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,800
Three Changes of Heavenly Fire.

89
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,100
Heaven and Earth Change.

90
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,000
How can he have such Fight Techniques?

91
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Unbounded Transformation.

92
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,300
Retreat!

93
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,600
Boy,

94
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,400
I will now let you have a taste

95
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,600
of the flavor of Cloud Mist Sect's 13 Blows.

96
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,240
It's this boy!

97
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,800
That incited this dispute among the Five Clans.

98
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,000
He wants to destroy our Cloud Mist Sect.

99
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Kill him!

100
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,600
You want to destroy my Cloud Mist Sect!

101
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,800
I will flay you!

102
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,060
You finally came out.

103
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,000
Which of you is the Breaker of Clouds?

104
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,800
I am!

105
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,000
So it is you.

106
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,200
What darn Fight Emperor?

107
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,200
You're just someone with flexible morals
that acts as a slave of Soul Hall!

108
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,400
Today, all of Cloud Mist Mountain

109
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,600
will become the coffin of the 14 of you!

110
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,100
Break!

111
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,000
You were able to bring the Cloud Mist Sect
that shows disdain for the whole world to this stage.

112
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,600
Even if you die, you can close your eyes and die contentedly.

113
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,400
Lord Fan,

114
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,600
save me. Save me.

115
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Start another formation
and I'll give you a hand.

116
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,200
This time, I fear that I really will have to
extinguish all of my body and soul.

117
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,200
Medicine Elder,

118
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,800
It's all my fault. I dragged you into trouble.

119
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,400
Didn't you say you only came
for the three-year pact?

120
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,800
Why didn't you stop
when the time is right?

121
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,630
My Xiao Family has already been extinguished.

122
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,200
Yun Shan and Han Feng acted together to defect.

123
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,000
Of the Five Clans, 3 have already broken.

124
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,800
The Nalan Family and the Gu Clan
are also on the brink of crisis.

125
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,400
The three-year pact of mine

126
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,200
was only to finish a personal grudge.

127
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,700
But if these rotten apples are not eliminated,

128
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:24,410
there will be no peace in the Fight Qi Continent.

129
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,000
I, Xiao Yan,

130
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,200
have never been this kind of person
to bow and bend the knee.

131
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,400
Well spoken, boy!

132
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,800
I said from the beginning that I am prepared
to put forth everything for that person.

133
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,900
If you can survive today,
then you are definitely that person!

134
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,600
Let's send them another big present!

135
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,600
Three Thousand Thunder Movement!

136
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,200
Three Thousand Thunder Movement!

137
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,800
Three Thousand Thunder Movement!

138
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:17,500
Three Thousand Thunder Movement!
Three Thousand Thunder Movement!

139
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,700
Angry Buddha and Firey Lotus. Go!

140
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,700
Husband.

141
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,860
Husband.

142
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,400
Husband.

143
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,100
Husband.

144
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,200
I'll take you away.

145
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,500
We'll return to the Magical Beast Mountain Range.

146
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,800
Husband.

147
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,600
Husband!

148
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,400
At the time when Uncle Xiao
was caught by the Cloud Mist Sect,

149
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,800
I saw him.

150
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,400
He told me

151
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,500
that I must take care of myself
and strive to keep on living.

152
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,100
If you see him, please tell him for me

153
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,600
that I'm sorry.

154
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Take him away.

155
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,700
Husband. You've woken up.

156
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,600
Why are you crying?

157
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,400
Your eyes swell when you cry
and will not be pretty.

158
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,800
Husband. Your arteries and veins
were broken by thunder.

159
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,600
I couldn't save you.

160
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,700
I didn't know how to save you.

161
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Sorry.

162
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,800
I understand.

163
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,700
I can't be saved. So I'll die.

164
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,400
I was able to kill so many traitors,

165
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,000
I'm satisfied.

166
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,800
No. You can't.

167
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,200
You can't die. You cannot die!

168
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,500
I won't let you die.

169
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,000
Wait. Wait here. I'll go find medicine for you.

170
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,400
You must wait. I'm going immediately
to find medicine for you.

171
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,400
You must wait for me to come back.

172
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,400
You're not allowed to die! Do you hear me?

173
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,000
Wake up. Wake up now.

174
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,600
This time, you really will die quickly.

175
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:54,780
When you get down there and have seen your mother,

176
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,000
deliver a message for me, okay?

177
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,050
Ask how she is.

178
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,100
Actually, Senior Sister treated me very well.

179
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,400
Medicine Elder.

180
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,300
Master.

181
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,200
You came.

182
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,810
I came to apologize for my offense.

183
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,500
Master,

184
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I have let you feel wronged.

185
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,500
You've been waiting all along within this Spatial Ring.

186
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,800
I apologize to you.

187
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,600
At the time when I first killed you,

188
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:16,200
your hair was still black.

189
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,600
Now, it's all already grizzled and white.

190
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,400
I apologize to you.

191
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,800
When a disciple has grown up,
the master naturally has become old.

192
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,600
You came to see the Star Fall Pavillion's treasure, right?

193
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,000
I came to see you.

194
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,200
It's all here.

195
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,810
Master, this is...

196
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,800
This is what your Senior Sister drew.

197
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
This, this was drawn by Little Six.

198
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,300
Oh. And this.

199
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,600
This was drawn by you.

200
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,200
Master unexpectedly even keeps the homework
from when I was a child.

201
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,800
When you were young,
I had you all copy medicine charts.

202
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,200
Your Senior Sister was obedient.
She copied a full sheet.

203
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,200
The rest of you all wanted to be lazy.

204
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,800
It was only you that drew the Fight God
and Hun Miesheng.

205
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,800
At that time, I thought,

206
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,200
this disciple will accomplish great things in the future.

207
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,500
But I never thought

208
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,000
that it would be this kind of deed.

209
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,240
I know that Master hates me.

210
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,720
I came

211
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,300
because I wanted to apologize to you.

212
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,000
Master,

213
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,200
I know that in your eyes

214
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,800
I am just a jerk that betrayed out clan.

215
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,000
But there are things you don't know.

216
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,100
Everything that I did isn't at all like
what you think it is.

217
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,200
I want to beg you to forgive me.

218
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,900
And let me explain everything to you slowly.

219
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,400
You really know that you've done wrong.

220
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
I know that I've done wrong.

221
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,000
Please forgive me.

222
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:29,640
You really go beyond my expectations.

223
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Master.

224
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,600
Listen to what I have to say.
The darkness is coming.

225
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,600
Hun Miesheng will soon come here to kill everyone.

226
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,400
Xiao Yan at the moment is out there but he's useless.

227
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,800
We of the Star Fall Pavillion
can only rely on me at the moment.

228
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,000
I need you

229
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,400
to give those hidden treasures,
the Fight Techniques,

230
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,700
and also the Essence Flame to me
as quickly as possible.

231
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,400
Hurry and allow me to become the best in the world.

232
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,200
I'll save you from here.

233
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,400
I need to let you watch with your own eyes
as I kill Hun Miesheng.

234
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,000
At that time, you will know what kind of person I am.

235
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,200
Hidden treasures.

236
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,600
What hidden treasures are you talking about?

237
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
When your Senior Sister defected, she took all of those
and gave them to Hun Miesheng.

238
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
Didn't she tell you?

239
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,400
I know you don't trust me.

240
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,700
Master.

241
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,200
Everything that I've done has been for us,
the Star Fall Pavillion.

242
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,800
At the time I killed you,

243
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,200
it was entirely because I was forced
and had no other choice.

244
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,400
I had to first make it so that Hun Miesheng
trusted me. Don't you understand?

245
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,200
Trust me.

246
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,600
If I didn't act that way at that time,

247
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,600
every single one of us

248
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,000
would have been trapped and killed on the altar
and would never have been reincarnated.

249
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,800
You have no other choice, Master.

250
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,400
The altar. Clan Leader Xiao is still in there.

251
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,000
Then, that's just right.

252
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,600
If I go, I can even chat with him about his good son.

253
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,500
This is pretty good, too.

254
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,800
I know that if I fiercely try
to make you believe me now,

255
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
that will also be impossible.

256
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,800
But it’s too late.
Hun Miesheng will be coming soon.

257
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,410
How about this?

258
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,000
Hand over the Ancient Jade first.
Give it to him

259
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,600
and stall him. This is generally pretty good. Right?

260
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,800
Oh? It’s not on you?

261
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,800
Pavilion Master of Star Fall Pavilion surprisingly
doesn’t have the Di Tuo Ancient Jade.

262
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,200
Master, are you handing it over or not?

263
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,800
Don’t beat around the bush.

264
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
If you don’t want to hand it over,

265
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,700
I’ll go out now and kill Xiao Yan immediately.

266
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,200
Han Feng!

267
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:27,799
Brat, I owed you so much in the past life.

268
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,199
I’ll go with you,

269
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:35,999
But I want to personally
give the Ancient Jade to Hun Miesheng.

270
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,400
Fine.

271
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,769
By the way,

272
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:48,799
when will you give
my Bone Spirit Cold Flame back to me?

273
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,000
I must give what you really want to you?

274
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,100
You originally promised that you must give
it back to me! Have you forgotten?!

275
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,600
It’s you who broke your promise first, Master.

276
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,400
Then I had the desire to kill you!

277
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,700
It has come to this stage.

278
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,800
It’s all because you only have yourself to blame.

279
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,700
You’re the biggest sinner of Star Fall Pavilion!

280
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,600
Master, I’ll take you back home right away.

281
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,600
Did you grow roots from your feet?

282
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,200
If I were able to go out,

283
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,200
I would personally extinguish you,
you evil disciple!

284
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,700
I am a traitor or I am loyal.
There will come a day when you will understand this.

285
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,200
Kid, this treasure was originally mine.

286
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,880
If you can't accept this,

287
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
then come to Soul Hall to take it.

288
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,800
What...What has happened here?

289
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,600
How can you say that?
Isn't it all your fault?

290
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,000
You're late again.

291
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,700
What about Xiao Yan?

292
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,200
Xun'er.

293
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,000
Your arteries and veins
have been destroyed by thunder.

294
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,100
I can't save you.

295
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,200
I have something that I have to tell you.

296
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,600
This matter

297
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,100
has been like a thorn
pricking my heart for so many years.

298
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,400
When I was young,

299
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,000
and I was sent to the Xiao Family
to be your little sister,

300
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,300
I brought a mission from the ancestors.

301
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,400
For the sake of the ancestors, I had no choice.

302
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,600
I didn't have a choice.

303
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,200
Xun'er. Xun'er.

304
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,400
Brother Xiao Yan.

305
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,000
If there's a life after this one,

306
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:11,760
I hope that I can simply love you.

307
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:59,000
Brother Xiao Yan. I will avenge you.
