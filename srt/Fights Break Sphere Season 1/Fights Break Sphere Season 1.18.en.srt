3
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,890
That was my mother.
The time that she spent with you

4
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,550
was longer than the time she spent with me.

5
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,530
She died for you.

6
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,120
Am I not even allowed to ask questions?

7
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,690
That is because you've never died before.

8
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,080
You don't know how it feels.

9
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,710
A cold blade seems to have punctured your body. You can
feel the cold sensation down to the marrow in your bones.

10
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,320
All around you are familiar cries and sobs.

11
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,610
Friends' and families'.

12
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,890
But I am still alive.

13
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,610
The person who endured these things
on my behalf was your mother.

14
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,190
The one who fell into that nightmare wasn't me,

15
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,360
but the one disciple I loved the most.

16
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,030
You must think that I didn't feel
sad at all when your mother died.

17
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,550
It's enough that I'm the only one
left with the nightmares.

18
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,790
I hope that in your dreams

19
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,490
she is still the very beautiful and very warm mother.

20
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,450
If you still hate me because of all this,

21
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,620
then just remove the spatial ring and throw it away.

22
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,330
Throw it away in any place that satisfies you.

23
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,580
Medicine Elder, I'll give you a hand.

24
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,600
You're too clumsy. Don't break any of my good wines.

25
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,140
Medicine Elder, how do you think I did
when I refined the medicine today?

26
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,170
So-so. It is a bit effective
in treating headaches and hot-heads.

27
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,610
What's the problem?

28
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,240
It is so easy
and you've been training for so long.

29
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,790
It is a good thing
that you didn't take me as your teacher.

30
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,750
If I could use the Essence Flame,
I would also make it.

31
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,180
Don't you have a Beast Flame? Why didn't you use it?

32
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,250
Medicine Elder, this Beast Flame of mine is too strong.

33
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,790
The usual cauldrons can't endure it and they explode.

34
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,590
That... How about you lend one to me?

35
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,360
No way.

36
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,780
Don't be like that, Medicine Elder.

37
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,940
That... Great Master Medicine, Grandfather Medicine,
you are just arguing with me, right?

38
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,520
Even if I lose, you'll have no reputation.

39
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That does make some sense.

40
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,610
Don't be so stubborn next time, all right?

41
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,910
You're so annoying.

42
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,600
You're really shameless by saying that you're a child;
and therefore, this matter should be tolerated.

43
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,160
Your mother didn't even dare do that to me before.

44
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,850
My mother before—

45
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,830
I won't ask anything. I really won't ask anything.

46
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,800
Medicine Elder, you've gone overboard.

47
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,680
You are, after all, the top alchemist in the world.
You only chose a...

48
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,210
street vendor quality item to give me?

49
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,190
You don't want it?
If you don't want it, give it back to me.

50
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,160
I want it.

51
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,330
That Fan Ling today from Soul Clan
used Blood Sect martial arts.

52
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:33,170
And that Fan Lao from last time.
So, what's the background of the Blood Sect?

53
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:37,220
The Blood Sect is a very ancient sect
and is the lackey of Soul Hall.

54
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,360
They especially train in techniques
of controlling other people through their blood.

55
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,850
Since Hun Miesheng has been sealed up,
this Blood Sect disappeared with him.

56
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:50,060
But the reappearance of Blood Sect right now
is surely connected with him.

57
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,540
That I know. Lei Xiong and the others
were inflicted by that last time.

58
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,760
But there's one thing I still don't understand.

59
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,530
Why did the Blood Sect only send Fan Ling?

60
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,670
Could it be there are reinforcements eventually
coming or is he just testing the waters?

61
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,500
The people of Soul Hall
are very loyal to their superior.

62
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,120
As long as the superior gives the order, the subordinates
will risk their lives just to fulfill the mission.

63
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,260
Unlike us righteous sects
who only know how to have internal strife.

64
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,800
Even if the evil schemes are right
in front of us, what can we do?

65
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,610
Brother Xiao Yan, give it your best.

66
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,530
- Do your best.
- Okay.

67
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,210
Brother Xiao Yan.

68
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,730
You don't have money, so this is it?

69
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,520
So murky. Where did you dig this up?

70
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,350
Go away.

71
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,350
May the judges examine
the medicine cauldrons of the contestants.

72
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,929
Are you a child of the Gu Tribe?

73
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,729
Yes.

74
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,330
A Yellow Deep Cauldron?

75
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,980
I haven't seen one in a long time.

76
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:29,260
This is a medicine cauldron formed from a yellow stone
that has absorbed the essences from thousands of years.

77
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,360
It can be said to be a magical artifact.

78
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,760
Really?

79
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,560
Ancient yellow stone,
this is a very good item.

80
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,410
Where did you get this?

81
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,130
I bought this from a small shop.

82
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,960
Who did you learn your alchemy from?

83
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,820
My father.

84
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,230
Only Fight Qi Continent has this alchemy technique.

85
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,620
The Soul Clan lives outside of our continent.

86
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,320
There is actually a person there
who knows our alchemy?

87
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,210
Our Soul Clan

88
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,120
also has headaches, hot-heads,
the aging, and sickness.

89
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,900
How can you just assume

90
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,420
that we don't know alchemy?

91
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,730
Good.

92
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,180
With your abilities, you have a bright future.

93
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,190
At such a small age, why lose your life here?

94
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,820
Quickly give up and leave.

95
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,090
I came here to tell you all

96
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,930
that our Soul Clan also has alchemy and alchemist,

97
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,920
so that the so-called righteous people
will cease from belittling us.

98
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,370
Distribute the medicines!

99
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:25,780
Black Iron Spiritual Wood? I finally see a real one!

100
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,530
Are the steps to refine this similar with other medicines?

101
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:35,110
Yes, it's the same. The spiritual solution produced
by refining this Black Iron Spiritual Wood

102
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,680
is the most important ingredient of the Fengxing Pellet.

103
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,780
I heard that if you take in the Fengxing Pellet,
your Fight Qi will increase very fast.

104
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,940
It increases the person's speed
by four times within two hours.

105
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,790
But it's very hard to obtain the spiritual solution
of this Black Iron Spiritual Wood.

106
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,030
My god, is that an Essence Flame?

107
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,260
The fire is weak and unstable.

108
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,530
It must have been borrowed.

109
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,020
From the aspect of an alchemist,

110
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,030
this child indeed has abilities.

111
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,570
But as the ancient saying goes,

112
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,360
"Irises and orchids blocking the path
should be removed."

113
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,160
You are a person who loves talents.
Of course, you can't bear to do it.

114
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,370
How about this? Just leave these things to us.

115
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,840
Hold on.

116
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,190
Since he dared to come here,
he must have prepared.

117
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,490
I think we should just observe and act accordingly.

118
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,100
Elder Tengshan, you're too forgiving and soft-hearted.

119
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,950
State Teacher, after the competition,
let's have a chat.

120
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,610
It's all over. I've used up all my Fight Qi.

121
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,990
Xun'er, how are you doing?

122
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:42,440
Even if this wood is made of iron, it should have
dissolved by now after burning for this long.

123
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,970
Why isn't there any reaction?

124
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,650
We are just students and have so little Fight Qi.

125
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,770
Is this group of old men trying to kill us?

126
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,330
Quickly go back and meditate.

127
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,110
Brother Xiao Yan,

128
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,760
I can't go on either.

129
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,470
I'll wait for you in the back.

130
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,310
Go on.

131
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,000
Are you all right?

132
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,610
A medicine cauldron made from ancient yellow stone

133
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,010
can resist even the Dragon Flame.

134
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,550
How come it exploded
with just a little Beast Flame?

135
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,950
Didn't you hear him just now?

136
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,430
He bought it in a little shop. It's a fake.

137
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,510
Looks like this year,
we really are going to give first place

138
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,340
to this young man from the Soul Clan.

139
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,780
Never thought that the one who is able to last
until the end would be from the Soul Clan.

140
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:40,360
This joke has gone overboard.

141
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,750
Give me another piece. Give me another piece!

142
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,260
This boy is quite something.

143
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,780
There's not much time left.

144
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,060
This young lad also has an Essence Flame.

145
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,360
At such a young age, he is already able
to absorb an Essence Flame.

146
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,840
The Xiao Family is indeed not simple.

147
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,720
Who knows what demon magic he is using?

148
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,060
He has already used up his Fight Qi.

149
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,180
I think that he'll just harm himself with this.

150
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,160
- Look! He has two kinds of Essence Flames!
- That's right!

151
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,370
How is that possible?
I've never seen it before.

152
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,150
[Xiao Yan]

153
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,790
How satisfying!

154
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:58,380
Elder Mi, I haven't drunk wine for decades.

155
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,920
Tonight, we must have a good drink!

156
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,140
I will surely keep you company.

157
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,890
Today, Xiao Yan made us proud.

158
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,540
Two flames at once.

159
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,390
It really scared that Soul Clan fellow.

160
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,180
Keep it down. Keep it down.
Xiao Yan's meditating.

161
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,830
He's exhausted.

162
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,230
I've never seen him like this before.

163
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,860
Let's all allow him to rest, all right?

164
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,530
Right... Say,

165
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,710
how come it's only us, the eliminated ones,
celebrating here?

166
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,740
The person who should be celebrating
is meditating over there.

167
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,280
- Don't know what abnormal topic they'll come up
with for tomorrow. - That's right.

168
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,070
When I recall that brat from the Soul Clan,
my whole body feels uneasy.

169
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,590
It's as if bugs are crawling all over me.

170
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,400
Don't touch me.

171
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,510
Brother Xiao Yan.

172
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,390
Brother Xiao Yan.

173
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,010
Brother Xiao Yan.

174
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,090
Where's my cauldron? Give it back to me.

175
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,750
Cauldron? It exploded.

176
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,930
Nonsense!

177
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:11,070
That cauldron was made from ancient yellow stone.
It can even endure a Dragon Flame.

178
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,560
How could it not endure some little Essence Flame?

179
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,220
Right under your eyes,
you didn't even see that you'd been tricked.

180
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,030
- Huh?
- Huh, what?!

181
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:25,630
That jerk Han Feng used Yin Power to shatter
the yellow stone from the inside.

182
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,150
I just knew it. No, why didn't you warn me that time?

183
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,450
He was right in front of you.
If I gave you a warning, then...

184
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,620
I so want to see him? I'm so afraid
that he can't find me?

185
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,400
That's right.

186
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,570
Let me remind you again.

187
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,750
Even if you're able to merge the Beast Flame
and the Essence Flame here inside the spatial ring,

188
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,320
it doesn't mean it'll work outside.

189
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,880
If you're unable to
keep it under control and it explodes,

190
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,390
you and I and everyone present

191
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:11,140
will die right then and there!

192
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:19,250
You should always be considerate of the people around you.
This way, your good skills won't be in vain.

193
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,180
I'll remember it.

194
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,980
It's especially nice to watch.

195
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,930
Come, take a look.

196
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,390
All of you, stand up.

197
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,300
Who are you looking for?

198
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,530
An Imperial Decree!
Kneel and listen to the Imperial Decree!

199
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:47,130
"Tonight, Elder Mi Tengshan entered the palace,
committed an assassination, and has escaped with injuries.

200
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:51,200
All soldiers and citizens should help in his capture."
Did you hear it clearly?

201
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,920
We did...

202
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,960
People over there,
did you hear it clearly?

203
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,990
We heard it well.

204
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,640
Brother Xiao Yan.

205
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,660
Brother Xiao Yan, wake up.

206
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,170
Brother Xiao Yan.

207
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,820
Wake up.

208
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,070
Let's see if you dare use Fight Qi
as just some fire to burn up logs again.

209
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:27,490
You hardly had any energy left to come in here, am I right?

210
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,220
So what? It's not like I can lose.

211
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,760
If I lose, I will bring shame to my master.

212
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,590
Smooth talker.

213
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,960
I've carefully observed that Fan Ling.

214
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,900
Although he's young, he's already
an elite disciple of the Blood Sect.

215
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,110
His alchemy technique isn't any different from others.

216
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:56,900
It's just that he's already well-trained.
He's probably been training for at least ten years.

217
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,600
Also, his Fight Qi cultivation

218
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,620
can't be inferior to his alchemy abilities.

219
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,340
Anything abnormal is deemed evil.
The evil techniques of the Blood Sect and Soul Hall

220
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,950
are unimaginable. You must be extra careful.

221
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,540
As for why he joined the competition,

222
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,820
you'd better quickly investigate it.

223
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,500
Have you all seen Mi Tengshan?

224
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,330
No, we haven't.

225
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,800
Listen! Mi Tengshan is a criminal
that attempted to assassinate the Emperor.

226
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,910
If you youngsters dare to hide him,

227
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,570
you'll be executed!

228
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,530
[ The Yan Sect Meeting Room ]

229
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,220
Elder tried to assassinate the Emperor?

230
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,520
That's not possible.

231
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,570
What's going on?

232
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,920
Who among you saw Elder Tengshan
after the competition?

233
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,450
- I didn't see him. We didn't see him.
- What about you?

234
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:56,850
No. No.

235
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,920
I didn't see him either.

236
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,560
None of us saw him.

237
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,930
Brother Xiao Yan, you woke up.

238
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:10,030
There are a lot of people outside,
a lot of soldiers.

239
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,190
Just great. You're finally awake.

240
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,200
Something big happened.

241
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,420
What is it?

242
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:22,020
Those soldiers. Soldiers came here.

243
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:26,020
- They said Elder Tengshan tried to
assassinate the Emperor. - No way.

244
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:30,660
It's true. They already read the decree.
The person who captures him will be heavily rewarded.

245
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,950
Those that hide him or not
tell his whereabouts will be executed.

246
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,500
After the competition today,

247
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,670
did any of you see Elder Tengshan?

248
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,750
No.

249
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,990
Elder Mi... you've come.

250
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,390
I never expected...

251
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,760
that you would also defect.

252
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,120
Tonight, there were seven great fighters
of the Blood Sect that surrounded you,

253
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,460
yet you still were able to escape.

254
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,160
Your martial arts skills have improved.

255
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,890
Hence, you sent out a "wanted" decree.

256
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,660
I don't understand.

257
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:43,690
As the State Teacher of the Chu Yun Empire,
Leader of the Alchemy Guild,

258
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:47,130
top alchemist of the Fight Qi Continent,

259
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:51,680
what else can they give you
that's enough to tempt you?

260
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,490
Tengshan, you are not me.

261
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,620
You wouldn't understand.

262
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,070
This alchemy room,

263
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,590
you were able to enter here,

264
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,160
but will you be able to leave?

265
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,090
We were once friends, after all.

266
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,590
Why must you seek death?

267
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,760
As past friends, let me understand

268
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,640
what thing

269
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,770
has made you betray all of us

270
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,880
and willingly become a slave of the dark force?

271
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,740
Tell me, so I can die knowing why.

272
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:47,280
I've been an alchemist all my life,
but there is one illness

273
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:52,490
that I will never be able to cure.
That's death.

274
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,860
So what?

275
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,130
Every person will die.

276
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,750
Dying isn't frightening.
What's scary is

277
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:08,440
watching oneself slowly dying.

278
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,090
Power, position, intelligence,

279
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:15,200
all that can't resist this kind of torment.

280
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,040
You have been possessed.

281
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,050
You've sacrificed so much,

282
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,360
what have you gained?

283
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,800
Just an ignoble existence.
Just living without a purpose.

284
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,520
Tengshan, you're not me
so you won't understand.

285
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,800
It's been 1,000 years.
The Fight God's bones have already decomposed.

286
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,740
But what about Hun Miesheng?
He's still alive.

287
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,930
And he will continue to live on.

288
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:51,400
Isn't that worthy enough for me
to exchange my life for?

289
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,830
Even if it means you'll become a slave?

290
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,360
What's so bad about that?

291
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,860
Too bad, you're too stubborn.

292
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,160
I fear that you won't even have the right
to become a slave.

293
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,560
Today, State Teacher Fa Ma isn't feeling well.

294
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,930
He asked us to host the third round of the competition.

295
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,960
Just do as we have discussed.

296
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,020
Next, I'll announce that the contestants
who have qualified for the final round. They are...

297
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:55,360
Jia Nan Academy's Xiao Yan and Soul Clan's Fan Ling.

298
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,700
At a specified time, you two must create a poison

299
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,700
after freely selecting its ingredients
and have the other party take it in.

300
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,390
And then, based on your symptoms,

301
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,930
create an antidote for yourself.

302
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:12,240
In between the match, we judges won't intervene.

303
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,830
We'll leave your life to Heaven's will.

304
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:19,340
Well? Is anyone withdrawing?

305
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
- It will be fine.
- What does Elder Gu mean?

306
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,820
Is he forcing the Soul Clan to withdraw?

307
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,370
Little Sister Xun'er, you're really good to me.
Earlier, I was pestering and trying to coax the guards

308
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,990
of this Alchemy Contest
and they still wouldn't let me in.

309
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,500
I only needed to tell you about it
and you already brought me in.

310
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,560
How is it? Do the clothes fit you?

311
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,900
A female classmate of mine just happened to
have diarrhea and couldn't come.

312
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,060
I then borrowed her uniform.

313
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,880
It's a bit large, but still fine.

314
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,200
Thank you, Little Sister Xun'er.

315
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,490
Just call me Xun'er.

316
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,660
You are the little sister of my husband,
so you're my little sister, too.

317
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,200
From now on, I'll be your protector in Yin City.

318
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,120
This is a novel, exciting,
and dark-to-it-kind round,

319
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,700
specially designed for this year's Alchemist Contest.

320
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:17,210
It will also be our third round of competition.

321
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:19,060
That's right.

322
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,310
What will happen if a life-threatening situation
arises in the middle of the competition?

323
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,300
All our contestants

324
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,460
signed a death waiver before the competition.

325
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,520
After the contestant takes in the poison,

326
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,710
not knowing what the poison is, he must use
his body to quickly sense the ingredients of the poison

327
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:40,320
and create an antidote. If he fails,
that's not just simply accepting defeat,

328
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,990
he might even die from it.

329
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:45,470
Isn't it too cruel to design a competition like this?

330
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:49,640
I think that this must be a way to cherish
the memory of the ancient deity, Farmer God.

331
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,100
He tested hundreds of herbs and took in
hundreds of poisons for the Fight Qi Continent.

332
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,820
His heroic act established our alchemy industry.

333
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:59,240
A true alchemist must have enough sacrificial spirit.

334
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,640
He must understand the sufferings of his patient.

335
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,820
Only by doing that can he really improve himself.

336
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:10,030
The competition begins now.

337
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,610
Soul Breaking Herb and Black Mountain Tuber

338
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:23,310
paired with cinnabar and red arsenic?
What drug is that?

339
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,020
Two poisons, two antidotes.

340
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,020
Brother Xiao Yan, don't take it in! Just surrender!

341
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,380
Husband, don't eat it! Hus--

342
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:53,360
Little Sister Xun'er, what are you looking
at me for? Watch the competition.

343
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,790
Really just making yourself suffer.
Why the heck did you bring her along?

344
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,130
Little Sister Xun'er, what
did you say just now?

345
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,830
Did I say anything?

346
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,170
I must have heard wrong.

347
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,490
That Soul Clan fellow used
Black Iron Spiritual Wood,

348
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:26,940
Black Carapace, and a Drought Hulv (a four-legged snake).

349
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:31,190
His lead ingredient is heart's blood.
I can understand the first 3,

350
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:34,950
but I don't know about his blood.

351
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:58,950
Husband.

352
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,220
- Brother Xiao Yan!
- Husband!

353
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,220
You!

354
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,870
What is that?
There's still another poison in his body?

355
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:52,930
That's not poison.
It's Xiao Yan being mischievous.

356
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,130
He used Beast Flame to burn him.

357
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:03,160
Looks like today,
there surely will be one person dying here.

358
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:22,020
This poison can't be suppressed by my Fight Qi.

359
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,650
What poison did you give him?

360
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,800
Soul Breaking Herb and Black Mountain Tuber
paired with cinnabar and red arsenic.

361
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,700
So promising? You're letting him win.

362
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,240
Do you know the main ingredient that I used?

363
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,250
I congealed a Beast Flame into the drug.

364
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:40,020
What I gave him isn't a poison.
It's a vial of gunpowder.
