=Fight Break Sphere=

2
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,980
=Episode 20=

3
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,730
When did it start?

4
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,580
When I was fighting that old Emperor today,
his blood tainted the Mystical Heavy Ruler.

5
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,860
Afterward, these new markings appeared.

6
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,530
That was not human blood,
but the blood of an envoy of Soul Hall itself.

7
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,430
This Mystical Heavy Ruler
is a magical weapon of the Soul Hall.

8
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,490
Unless you use their blood,
you won't be able to break the seal.

9
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,210
Then these markings...
Medicine Elder, can you decipher them?

10
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,770
Let me see.

11
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,830
Medicine Elder.

12
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,870
Medicine Elder.

13
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,620
Medicine Elder.

14
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,930
Medicine Elder!

15
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,540
What is wrong?

16
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,810
This is a magical weapon of Soul Hall.

17
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,050
This Mystical Heavy Ruler is also a weapon

18
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,340
that Hun Miesheng once used.

19
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,060
This is the weapon of Hun Miesheng?

20
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,670
But after it had these markings,

21
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,510
I was able to use it more smoothly and easily.

22
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,290
Do not use it again.

23
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,270
Why not?

24
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,070
I told you to stop using it!

25
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,820
That is a very evil item.

26
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,270
If you continue to use it,
it will affect your mind.

27
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,470
You will become bloodthirsty.

28
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,840
When a blade kills a person,
the one at fault is the person and not the blade.

29
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,740
Medicine Elder.

30
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,520
I want to continue using the Mystical Heavy Ruler.

31
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,360
Why are you still not sleeping?

32
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,730
When I close my eyes, I can see that fellow
glaring at me with his red eyes and laughing.

33
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,500
All right, already.
I will stay by your side.

34
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,970
If you have a nightmare, I will wake you up.

35
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,440
Oh, right! Is the item
that Nalan Yanran retrieved from the Emperor

36
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,320
the Di Tuo Ancient Jade of the Nalan Clan?

37
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,500
Seeing how she was so anxious,
it most likely is.

38
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,320
Does our family have one?

39
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,580
I heard that each of the Five Great Clans have one.

40
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,470
Why?

41
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,740
Father told me once

42
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,290
that I must not ask about the Di Tuo Ancient Jade

43
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:12,540
and that I must never mention it.
Or else, it will invite death.

44
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,870
Why?

45
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,320
I also do not know.

46
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,790
But based on father's expression,
he didn't look like he was joking.

47
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,340
All right then. I won't ask about it again.

48
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,850
Thinking about it now, when father urged me

49
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,270
not to become a Fight Practitioner,
he actually had a point.

50
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,360
If I just stayed in the medicine shop forever
and had been a shop attendant,

51
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,870
I would never encounter all these things then.

52
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,620
Are you regretting it now?

53
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,860
If your mother didn't die
and you were still a big idiot,

54
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,460
would you have just stayed at home
and been a medicine shop attendant?

55
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,940
Never leaving Wu Tan City forever.

56
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,500
I can't be sure.

57
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,080
Why not?

58
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,860
Think about it. You are such a coward,

59
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,240
that if I didn't accompany you to Jia Nan Academy,

60
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,910
no one would be there to amuse you
whenever you start crying out of fear.

61
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,460
Rubbish.

62
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,770
If you are so brave,
why aren't you closing your eyes and sleeping?

63
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,940
I'll go to sleep right away then.

64
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,610
Xun'er...

65
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,010
Father, Second Uncle, and Third Uncle,

66
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,660
rise.

67
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,700
Although I'm the clan leader,
I'm still a lower generation than all of you.

68
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,460
We can change the rules of Grandfather
when it comes to me.

69
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,900
Uncles, from now on, you can just bow with
a hand-palm greeting and reply while standing.

70
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,770
Yes.

71
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,870
In a few days, the Emperor will be abdicating.

72
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,230
The Crown Prince will then be ascending to the throne.

73
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,010
There will be a lot of state affairs to handle.

74
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,320
They will need our Nalan Clan to assist them.

75
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,560
I do not understand state affairs at all.

76
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,300
Father accompanied Grandfather for so many years.

77
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,140
For the Prime Minister position,
I have to ask Father to help me with it.

78
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,390
I will still continue my studies.

79
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:10,330
From now on, any matters concerning our clan,
tell me the major ones and the minor ones

80
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,460
can be decided by Father.

81
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,710
Why don't you two, father and daughter,

82
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,390
just decide all the Nalan Clan affairs then?

83
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,990
Grandfather said that the Clan
is made up of thousands of people,

84
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,970
but only one person takes charge of the affairs.

85
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,060
Second Brother, don't you still understand?

86
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,320
The Prime Minister position
can already be illegally transferred,

87
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,170
so why not the Clan Leader position?

88
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,140
This can... still be discussed.

89
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,640
It still can be discussed.

90
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,730
It's settled then.

91
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,090
Just because you say so? Huh?

92
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,660
How much of the Nalan Clan affairs do you know about?

93
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,400
Ignorant little girl.

94
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,060
When your grandfather was around,

95
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,380
there is one matter that he never clarified.

96
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,590
The heirloom of the Nalan Clan,
the Di Tuo Ancient Jade.

97
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,470
Where is it now?

98
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:12,090
Ever since Grandfather died,
you have dug into every crevice three times.

99
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,800
So now you are asking me?

100
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,800
This Di Tuo Ancient Jade

101
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,000
hides all the wealth and secrets of the Nalan Clan.

102
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,100
The person who holds it is like our ancestors here in person.

103
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,600
Grandfather used this jade to suppress
the evil spirit inside the old Emperor;

104
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,200
hence, the government would not become chaotic
in these past few years.

105
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,200
Now that the evil spirit has been driven out by me,
I took the jade back, too.

106
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,600
Do you still have any questions?

107
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,530
Daughter...

108
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,100
Since your grandfather made such arrangements,

109
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,500
there is hope for the Nalan Clan then.

110
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,300
I will follow all your commands.

111
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,800
Father, leave first then.

112
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,600
Go prepare the matters concerning
the Crown Prince's ascension to the throne.

113
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,300
If there are any important matters, write them down

114
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,300
- and accompany me to the palace tomorrow.
- Yes.

115
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,390
Looks like the Nalan Clan doesn't need us anymore.

116
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,000
Fine, we'll separate from the clan then!

117
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Separate?

118
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,100
Third Uncle, why are you bringing up
separating from the clan out of nowhere?

119
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,100
Why? Can't we?

120
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,580
Of course, you can.

121
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,290
But I have some questions I want to ask you two.

122
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,850
How were you able to sneak
that Lao Poison into our home?

123
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,200
And when did you start colluding with the Blood Sect?

124
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,300
Wh-What nonsense are you saying?!

125
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,400
I am saying nonsense?

126
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,220
Where did the Lao Poison come from?
It just fell down from the sky?

127
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,200
It got in through the walls?

128
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,600
Just to prevent the hearts of the Nalan Clan from scattering,

129
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,400
he left in such a dubious manner.

130
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,200
You really think that no one would investigate it?!

131
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,000
You two are his biological sons.

132
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,700
Can Soul Hall be better than your family?

133
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,800
Clan Leader! Niece...

134
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,800
You must not listen to the lies of outsiders,
who want to drive a wedge between us!

135
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,400
Shut up!

136
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,600
Xiao Yan used the Green Lotus Earth Core Flame
to push the poison back.

137
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,800
Who then repoisoned grandfather's medicine?

138
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,000
You just had to leave no room for him to survive.

139
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,200
What are you planning to do now? Tell me.

140
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,000
For this matter, I...

141
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,500
You!

142
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,900
The Nalan Clan owns boundless wealth and Fight Techniques.

143
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,200
As long as you two are focused on improving yourselves,

144
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,100
Grandfather never treated you unfairly.

145
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,800
But you two instead joined hands with Soul Hall

146
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,600
and did such a despicable thing!

147
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Did your hearts get blinded

148
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,600
or got possessed just like the old Emperor?!

149
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,920
Even if I have tears,
I can only swallow them.

150
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,200
All right. Second Uncle and Third Uncle,

151
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,800
you both saw me grow up.

152
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,500
Now, you want to kill me?

153
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,600
You said things so beautifully.

154
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,700
In the eyes of your grandfather, there was only you.
When did he look at us?

155
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,100
You have Eight Clan Leader Bodyguards

156
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,000
but we have hundreds of men!

157
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,300
If you want to create a disturbance,
then let's do it all together.

158
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,900
I'm fed up with these decades of hard life.

159
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,900
Yes.

160
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,230
Grandfather told me

161
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,600
that you two would not easily admit your crime.

162
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,100
And you'd surely request to separate yourselves.

163
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,400
Then if you didn't succeed,
you'd surely try to kill me.

164
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,800
But I told Grandfather,

165
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,350
if I killed you both,

166
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,900
and killed the disciples under you,

167
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,600
then the Nalan Clan would surely suffer a huge setback.

168
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
I can't bear such a sin.

169
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,400
Grandfather then said that if you two
are willing to destroy your own Fight Qi

170
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,800
and openly admit your mistakes,

171
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,100
you could be spared.

172
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,500
You think my father went out

173
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,800
just to really handle
the future coronation of the Crown Prince?

174
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,500
As long as you don't hurt my family and disciples,

175
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,070
you can do whatever you want with me.

176
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,640
Take them out.

177
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,300
Let them clearly explain things in front of everyone.

178
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,400
Destroy their Fight Qi. Just that for now.

179
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,770
Grandfather...

180
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,320
Is it you, Grandfather?

181
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,600
You're back.

182
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,000
Just for the reputation of the Nalan Clan,

183
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,600
you died bearing hatred.

184
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,800
I've sought revenge for you.

185
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,200
Daughter! Daughter!

186
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,610
Clan Leader.

187
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,600
Your Second Uncle and Third Uncle

188
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,400
have publicly admitted their mistakes to our clan members.

189
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,200
I heard that you are going to destroy their Fight Qi.

190
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,600
Your Second Aunt and Third Aunt kept crying out,

191
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,100
asking me to beg for leniency from you.

192
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,200
Your Second Uncle has meritorious war deeds.

193
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,300
Your Third Uncle had suffered a lot from your grandfather.

194
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,800
They are willing to leave Yin City

195
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,500
and get exiled into the wilderness.

196
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,500
They swear to never enter the gates of the Nalan Clan again.

197
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,300
I say, isn't that more or less enough?

198
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,000
I understand.

199
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,600
Is that a yes or a no?

200
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,300
Father,

201
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,600
how come you are always willing to be the good one?

202
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,800
They killed Grandfather.

203
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,400
Before you came in here,
I'd already instructed the Eight Clan Leader Bodyguards

204
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,000
that after Second Uncle and Third Uncle

205
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,250
publicly apologized,

206
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,400
they were to destroy their Fight Qi

207
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
and execute them both.

208
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,600
Their family members and disciples

209
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,400
will also be killed.

210
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,400
How many people did you order to kill then?

211
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,600
A soft heart can never govern a clan.
Grandfather said—

212
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Is everything that your grandfather said right?

213
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,200
Has he never committed any mistakes?

214
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,000
He is dead.

215
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,800
If you also kill your Second Uncle and Third Uncle,

216
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,400
then... who else will be left in the Nalan Clan?

217
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,500
Next time,

218
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,590
will you also have me killed, too?

219
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,200
Father, how come you think that way?

220
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,430
I said too much.

221
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,800
I offended you.

222
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I will strictly follow

223
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,950
your command.

224
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,400
Father...

225
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,000
Xiao Yan! Xiao Yan!

226
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,800
Wake up!

227
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,400
What is it?

228
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,600
There are three people outside.

229
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,400
They said they want to do business with you.
Should I let them in?

230
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,000
Business? Who are they?

231
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,400
Three weird people.

232
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,000
All right then. Tell them to wait for me in the garden.

233
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,300
Yes.

234
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,000
Here. This way, please.

235
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,000
Sirs,

236
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,400
ha-have we met?

237
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,000
My name is She Buwu.
My older brother, She Busan.

238
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,800
This is our master, Mo Basi.

239
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,600
That... How about we go over there first to talk.

240
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,400
My little sister is sleeping in my room,
so I won't invite you inside.

241
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,100
- That will be better...
- Please.

242
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,000
This way, please.

243
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:19,770
We brothers are amateurs and do not know how
to do business. Sorry, if we embarrass ourselves.

244
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:23,030
Young Warrior, please look at this.

245
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:37,370
Qilin blood? This is Qilin blood!

246
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,720
With it, we might be able to cure Little Medicine Fairy!

247
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,580
For this item, just name your price.
I'll take it.

248
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,100
Look at this also.

249
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:02,520
And you say you don't know how to do business.
You wrapped this within so many precious containers.

250
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,100
If you say that this item can cure hundreds of illnesses,
I might even believe it.

251
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:18,050
This is the magical crystal of a six-ranked Cloud Snake.
If you melt this crystal and absorb it into your body,

252
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,480
it can cure any kind of poison.

253
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,490
This is indeed a good item.

254
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:29,250
But... I fear that we might have
only enough to buy the Qilin blood.

255
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:33,010
It'll be rare to see a magical crystal like this again.
If you are able to refine it,

256
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:37,030
you will not be affected by any poison.
Its benefit is very large.

257
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:41,060
Of course, I know that. But I'll just consider
this magical crystal next time, once I have the money.

258
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,770
I know that you are an honorable person.
Just treat it as a loan.

259
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:48,280
Once you have the money, just pay us then.

260
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,380
I also have not much use for this magical crystal.
It's better that you keep it.

261
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,590
Looking at the state of your eyes,

262
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:58,030
you still have poison inside your body.
It surely will be useful to you in the future.

263
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:04,100
That's right. Young Warrior, just keep it. If you need it
in the future, just use it. If not, just return it to us.

264
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,850
How come you are doing business this way? Aren't you
afraid that I'll flee and you won't be able to find me?

265
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,000
Don't worry. We will surely find you.

266
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,240
Just take these two items first.
Also, we have one more item to gift to you.

267
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,660
Buy two and get one gift without cost.

268
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,270
This will also draw attention to ourselves.

269
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,160
Wait a minute...

270
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,520
Why are you insisting on
giving me this magical crystal?

271
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,270
It's not just that.

272
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,310
This is a six-ranked Red Spider Lily.

273
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,640
Be careful. It has a lethal poison.

274
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,480
I am never at ease accepting things
that just fall down from the sky.

275
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,130
I have bad luck. I was born with misfortunes.

276
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,600
You three must not fool me.

277
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,840
All right then. We're done talking.
We'll take our leave.

278
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,740
Hey...

279
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,350
Is there anything weird about that drug?

280
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,570
This drug is surely clean.

281
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:24,430
Good. Since it's clean, quickly use it
to make the antidote for Little Medicine Fairy.

282
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,730
All right.

283
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,420
You're awake?

284
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,770
Let me show you a great item.

285
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,490
What is it?

286
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,030
Six-ranked Red Spider Lily.

287
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,600
Be careful. It has a lethal poison.

288
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,520
Where did you get it?

289
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,590
There were three men who insisted on giving it to me.

290
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,120
Why did they give you this?

291
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,020
I also don't know. I have no use for this item.

292
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,200
I don't make poisons.

293
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,200
The Queen is awake.

294
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,260
Could she have smelled the scent of the Red Spider Lily?

295
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:50,590
Too bad. She just ate it.

296
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:55,070
Queen, so you love eating poisonous plants.

297
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,900
Queen, look.
I'm letting you eat such an expensive item.

298
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,860
Don't be mad anymore, all right?

299
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,230
Is it that rare?

300
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,930
Queen, let's go back in and sleep, all right?

301
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,000
Queen, be good. Go back in and sleep.

302
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,050
You're killing me with your silliness.

303
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,420
But she is indeed a queen.

304
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,530
Queen, go back...

305
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,990
Disgusting!

306
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,700
She did not leave even a little bit.

307
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,920
Greetings, Your Majesty.

308
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,370
I am allowing you to not bow to me from now on.
That is an Imperial decree.

309
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,090
You all may leave.

310
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,550
Come... I want to say something to you.

311
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:21,740
There's this one thing that's troubling me.
Help me decide.

312
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,380
Your Majesty, please tell me.

313
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,350
You have made such a huge merit.

314
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:29,140
I must give you something, right?

315
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,610
Then may Your Majesty do as you say.

316
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,650
Not a problem.

317
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:43,630
Immediately announce that Elder Mi Tengshan
of Jia Nan Academy is innocent and to be pardoned,

318
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,340
then use all means to find him.

319
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,290
Fine, fine... I will immediately issue the decree.

320
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:51,280
What about yourself? What do you want?

321
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,140
I don't have anything that I want.

322
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,270
It's just that there is something lately
that I can't figure out.

323
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:03,670
Don't you feel
that you got your emperor's throne too easily?

324
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,740
Easily?

325
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,000
Just to prevent Soul Hall from harming me,

326
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,460
I pretended to be an idiot for so many years.

327
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,800
My Imperial Father was possessed without consciousness,
and I couldn't publicize neither of those things.

328
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,610
If not for us being able to drive them away this time,

329
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,270
I don't know for how long my father
and I would still have to suffer.

330
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,040
How can you say that it was won easily?

331
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,090
That's not what I meant.
It's just that, the first time

332
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,600
that Nalan Yanran and I snuck into the Royal Palace,

333
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,760
we already had a hard time handling those weird eunuchs.

334
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,220
And this time, those eunuchs all disappeared.

335
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,090
That Fan Lao who had possessed old Emperor,

336
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:44,200
also seemed to have not exerted his full strength.
This is worrying me.

337
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,890
Don't worry.

338
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,000
Since, even the Blood Sect Master is gone,

339
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,030
those weird beasts he was controlling
would also naturally be gone.

340
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:57,880
I was also afraid that problems would arise.
Hence,

341
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,920
in these few past days, I've changed all the

342
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,820
maids, servants, guards, and eunuchs
both inside and outside of the palace.

343
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,720
So be at ease.

344
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,950
- Your Majesty--
- All right...

345
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:09,410
Don't say anything more. I...

346
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:12,120
still have to go out
and accept the congratulations of my subjects.

347
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,300
In regards to pardoning the crime of Mi Tengshan,

348
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:19,190
I will immediately issue the decree. Don't worry.
Even if I have to dig down three feet,

349
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:22,650
I will help you find him.

350
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,650
Thank you, Your Majesty.

351
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,390
Come closer.

352
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:34,280
Later, I still have a big surprise for you.

353
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,050
I, Fa Ma, greets Your Majesty.

354
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,420
Why is State Teacher making such a grand bow?

355
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,330
I am ashamed.

356
00:30:55,330 --> 00:31:00,170
Thinking about how the former Emperor
was harmed by the evil people from Soul Hall,

357
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:04,660
as the State Teacher,
I actually did not notice anything.

358
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,730
Even if Your Majesty does not punish me for it,

359
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:12,530
I do not have the face
to continue being the State Teacher.

360
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:15,560
- State Teacher, quickly get up.
- Thank Your Majesty.

361
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,000
This matter is not your fault.

362
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,740
For the past years, everything that happened here
in the palace is like a nightmare to me.

363
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,060
I knew that there was a Soul Hall monster
living inside the body of former Emperor,

364
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,420
but I could not say it to anyone.

365
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:35,630
I was afraid that if I said it,
not only would my life be in danger,

366
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,950
it might also bring harm to the former Emperor.

367
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,970
By then, the nation's foundations
would have been rattled.

368
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:44,020
A good Chu Yun Empire

369
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,320
might have gotten destroyed by my hands.

370
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,520
No wonder that in the past years,

371
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,300
the former Emperor refused to see me.

372
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:57,030
Good thing, Your Majesty is young and brave.
You were able to prevent the collapse of this empire.

373
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:04,140
Our generation is old, blind, and useless.

374
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:08,340
State Teacher, I just ascended to the throne.

375
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,570
You can't leave me.

376
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,240
You are currently the top alchemist
for the Fight Qi Continent.

377
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,280
I need you to help me reorganize the Alchemist Guild.

378
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,660
You must not let any forces of Soul Hall
infiltrate it as deeply again.

379
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,930
I surely will do my best.

380
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,500
Where did Mi Tengshan go?

381
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,620
This...

382
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,940
I indeed don't know.

383
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:45,120
I read the Imperial decree before that said he entered
the palace and tried to assassinate the former Emperor.

384
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,950
Could it be that it was not true?

385
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:57,380
This is a new imperial decree
pardoning the crime of Mi Tengshan.

386
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,800
Help me find him.

387
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,750
I know that you two have a good personal relationship

388
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,540
and both are alchemists.

389
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,410
Maybe, your news is more accurate than mine.

390
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:17,180
I've already sent soldiers to do it.
May State Teacher also keep an eye out for him.

391
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,770
Yes, Your Majesty.

392
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:25,320
That previous decreewas indeed written by the Soul Hall
monster with the borrowed hands of the former Emperor.

393
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:31,620
Hence, if State Teacher had secretly
protected Elder Mi Tengshan,

394
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,390
I also won't find that surprising.

395
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,000
I dare not, I dare not.

396
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,030
Go and carry this out then.

397
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,460
Yes.

398
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,980
Greetings, Emperor Ye Lan!

399
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,050
Rise.

400
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:10,300
This is the treasure of the Chu Yun Empire,

401
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,510
the Mystical Mountain Painting.

402
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,219
Is this Emperor stupid?

403
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:25,599
That is clearly just a wall.

404
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:30,280
This Mystical Mountain Painting
might just look like a clean white wall,

405
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,060
but it actually has a secret behind it.

406
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:38,510
Legend says that this item
was personally created by the Fight God.

407
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,520
He sealed the mystical mountain he cultivated

408
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,480
into this painting.

409
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,179
It will be revealed once every sixty years.

410
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:48,619
Every time, it will only appear for 2 hours,

411
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,210
allowing fated people to go up the mountain
and pick medicinal herbs.

412
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:55,699
Coincidentally, the State Teacher told me a few days ago,
that the 60-year date will be happening soon.

413
00:34:55,699 --> 00:35:00,209
After calculating it, it exactly falls on today.

414
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,540
Look... This is too magical.

415
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,980
That's right. So magical.

416
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,490
This is indeed magical.

417
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,730
It's magical...

418
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:32,730
Today, to reward you all for your outstanding
performance during the Alchemist Contest,

419
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:37,780
I am especially allowing everyone to enter
the Mystical Mountain painting to gather medicinal herbs.

420
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,690
But...

421
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:45,500
you must exit exactly from where you entered.

422
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,200
The elders also said
that you must come back within two hours;

423
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,130
or else, you'll be locked inside
this mountain painting for 60 years.

424
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:57,360
That would be very reckless of you then.

425
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,380
Also, you must not go to the dark side
or the back side of the mountain.

426
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:06,600
As for why... no one has told me that.

427
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,800
Anyway, the front side of the mountain has
a lot of treasures. There are enough for you all to pick from.

428
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,300
Good then. Next, Master Fa Ma will announce

429
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,440
the detailed rules.

430
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,830
Yes.

431
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,770
The greatest rule in picking treasures
from the Mystical Mountain

432
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:34,860
is that you must come out at the designated time.

433
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,710
From the time the first person enters

434
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:42,730
up to the time the last person comes out,

435
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:46,790
all must be within two hours.

436
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,070
Those that do not come out on time

437
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,960
will get sealed inside the painting
for the next 60 years.

438
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,910
No one can save you then.

439
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:01,080
Second, to increase the joy in your medicine picking,

440
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,670
I've written a list of ingredients here.

441
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,370
The first person who can gather them all will win.

442
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:12,750
The Alchemist Guild will then give him a special gift.

443
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:17,370
Third, to protect this mystical mountain, each team

444
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:20,750
can only send five members to enter and pick herbs.

445
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:25,530
As for the specific members, your team will decide.

446
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:32,790
May all the chosen members of each team gather
in front of the Mystical Mountain Painting.

447
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,920
Which student has the courage to enter first?

448
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:47,160
Each member of the team must enter in order.

449
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,350
I'm warning you all again. Don't get greedy.

450
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:53,740
You must return within two hours.

451
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,150
Who will go first?

452
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,700
This... How do you enter?

453
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,570
Charge toward it.

454
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,770
Really?

455
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,920
- Seems so.
- Seems so?

456
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,390
Seems so...

457
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,440
This Mystical Mountain Painting opens every 60 years.

458
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,660
I also haven't entered it.

459
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,070
You all just give it a try.

460
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:32,210
At most, just suffer a little pain.

461
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,710
How about I go first?

462
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,550
But if I'm unable to enter,
you all must not laugh at me.

463
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,190
Mystical Mountain, I'm coming!

464
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,480
I'm still a bit scared.

465
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,640
All right already. I'll go in first.

466
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:30,470
That was so magical! So great!

467
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,350
I'm going in, too.

468
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,010
It's so beautiful here.

469
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,120
Senior, look. There are so many herbs over there.

470
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,890
I'm rich.

471
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,660
Let's go over there.

472
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,910
Throwing things at me?

473
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,530
So stupid.

474
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,930
Han Xian!

475
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:40,980
We're rich...

476
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,870
Just with these plants,

477
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:47,030
if we sell them to any medicine shops,
we'll become very rich.

478
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:49,080
I don't have many dreams.

479
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:54,210
Just to be a little wealthy is fine.
About preserving the peace, I'll leave that to you.

480
00:40:55,290 --> 00:41:00,610
This Black Mushroom is a hot item, too, outside.

481
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:03,130
I'm not giving it to you.
This is for me.

482
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:08,100
Xiao Yan! Xiao Yan!
I think we should divide and conquer.

483
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:12,860
There's only two hours. It won't be easy
to gather all the medicinal herbs.

484
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,440
Right... Hao Tian is also from the alchemy department.

485
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,300
I'll follow him.
You all are not very interested in this.

486
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,570
Just look around. Let's just meet
at the starting point in two hours.

487
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,250
- Let's go.
- Goodbye!

488
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,910
Be careful.

489
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,530
Wait for me! I'll go with them, too.

490
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:27,830
There are still some over there!

491
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,680
Let's go there. There are fewer people over there.

492
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,040
Let's go... All of these are mine.

493
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:36,240
Brother Xiao Yan, we're the only ones left.

494
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,680
Those few over there.
Those will be yours, these will be mine.

495
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,630
Don't fight with me.
Come with me over there.

496
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,020
Let's go.

497
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,820
♫ If you want change, battle it out with no fear of chaos ♫

498
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,580
♫ The sky is dark, there’s misery on earth,

503
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:13,570
♫ Being mesmerized for a moment

504
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:19,550
♫ Jumping in with a leap with
neither grace nor resentment ♫

505
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:22,280
♫ Young but bothered by undiminishing worries ♫

506
