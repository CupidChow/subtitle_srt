You're scaring me? Even if she was the Golden God,
I would fight her. No one can change my mind.

4
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,760
Will Gu He and Yun Shan agree?

5
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,900
I will still do it.
Yun Shan put my mother to death.

6
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,540
I was going to take care of him also.

This time, we are here for you.

We will let you and Nalan Yanran fight.

If Yun Shan and Gu He bully you,

10
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,669
we the Yan Sect won't forgive them.

11
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,740
Yan Sect?

12
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,210
Don't mess around.

13
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,580
All right, let's stop talking about this.

14
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,140
I will apologize to you with water instead of wine.

15
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,740
I let you make the trip for nothing.

16
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,040
Tomorrow, the Xiao family
will send someone to see you back.

All ancestors of the Xiao family,
your humble descendant Xiao Zhan,

20
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,620
having broken the rules...

21
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,310
by opening up the Fight Technique Pavillion
for my son, Xiao Yan,

22
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,700
hope all of your souls in heaven...

23
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,700
can forgive me and bless our family and my children.

24
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,650
Bless us and make sure we remain safe for a long time.

Even though Angry Lions
is a Black Rank skill,

27
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,760
when you reach the third level,

28
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,650
it can definitely be as effective
as the Heaven Rank ones.

29
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,370
Child, our Angry Lions technique...

30
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,120
is talked about by every elder person
as how impressive it is.

31
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,560
This is the Xiao family's specialty.

32
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,240
It's perfect. Even compared with the others
on the whole continent.

33
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,390
It's really powerful.

34
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,150
Practice it well.

35
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,520
I have only just started.

36
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,530
I need much more practice.

37
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,370
Xiao family skills are more
about being manly and powerful.

38
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,050
If you lack Fight Qi.

39
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,860
It's harmful to practice too much.

40
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,870
So, son, keep that in mind.

41
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,480
Yes.

42
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,060
Xiao Yan said he wants to practice Heaven Rank skills.
What do you all think?

43
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,720
Heaven Rank skills?

44
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,690
It's already rare to reach
the top levels of the Black Rank skills.

45
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,120
You won't reach Heaven Rank
even if you want to.

46
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,890
Son, I think...

47
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,990
it's probably a good idea to stop practicing
the higher ranked Heaven Rank skills.

48
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,950
Why?

49
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,120
I fear that you will hurt yourself
if you don't have enough Qi.

50
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,550
Father, I have practiced Angry Lions.

51
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,360
What's the point of entering this pavillion
if I don't practice the Heaven Rank skills?

52
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,350
Such arrogant words coming from someone so young.
You talk about that three-year pact all day.

53
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,040
If you really learn the Heaven Rank skills,

54
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,700
you will cause trouble for the Xiao family.

55
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,360
Wait, Father, what do you mean?

56
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,960
Fine. In front of the three Elders here,

57
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,410
you should swear
that you will forget about the three-year pact.

58
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,730
Don't mention revenge for your mother either.

59
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:44,420
Otherwise, you can't keep practicing
the Heaven Rank skills again.

60
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,180
Father, I can stop practicing.

61
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,810
But the three-year pact, I have to do it.

62
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,180
My mother can't have died for nothing.
Otherwise, what am I practicing for?

63
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,720
Do you want to be everyone's enemy?

64
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,890
That will cause trouble for the Xiao family.

65
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,410
How can we tolerate that?

66
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,200
Father, we know the truth.

67
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,600
Why should we be afraid?

68
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,700
Shut up! You don't listen to me,

69
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,050
then you're not my son. Get out!

70
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,810
Leader, calm down.

71
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,270
Hey! Hey!

72
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,640

What's going on?

75
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,900
Father? Why is the pavillion on fire?

76
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,900
Rebellious son!

77

Leader!

80
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,650
- Father!
- Xiao Yan, what are you trying to do?

81
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,680
You killed so many clan members.

82
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,790
Do you want to kill your father, too?

83
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,040
Killed clan members? I didn't!

84
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,730
You didn't?

85
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,550
Bring out the Fight Technique you stole.

86
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,620
What's that behind you? Quit pretending!

87
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,600
I have...

88
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,330
That... What is it for?

89
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,910
You killed so many people for that?

90
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,330
You burned down the Xiao Family's
Fight Technique Pavillion to the ground.

91
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,860
It held a history of thousands of years...

92
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,240
How did we raise an animal like you?

93
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,250
Father, I didn't know.

94
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,970
I didn't do this!

95
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,110
Still denying? You brat!

96
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,480
Our family's Fight Technique Pavillion,
which was thousands of years old!

97
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,590
Burned just like this!

98
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,330
There's nothing left!

99
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:10,080
Who saw me kill people?

100
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,590
Everyone saw!

101
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:17,460
They saw you enter the pavillion
after you fought with me.

102
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,620
The First Elder tried to convince you
and you killed him!

103
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,950
You burned down the pavillion.

104
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,340
What more do you want me to say?

105
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,690
I didn't!

106
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,150
What do you have in your hand?

107
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,830
Father, I r-really...

108
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,300
Don't call me Father!

109
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,460
Kneel! Kneel down!

110
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,630
Kneel down!

111
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,590
Confess your sin to the ancestors!

112
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,990
Father, it was my fault
in talking back to the elders.

113
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,940
But I didn't take the Fight Technique.

114
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,010
The pavillion... This is not my doing!

115
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,600
If our ancestors' souls are in Heaven,
they wouldn't blame me!

116
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,000
How dare you deny this?

117
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,090
Still denying?

118
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,820
I didn't! I didn't!

119
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,020
I didn't!

120
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,700
Leader!

121
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,720
God doesn't bless my family.
You have grown up.

122
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,320
Leave. Leave!

123
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,980
- Father.
- Don't call me Father!

124
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,870
How could you not believe me?

125
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:48,930
I don't have... you as a son.

126
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,630
I'm cutting our ties!

127
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,830
Father, wherever Brother Xiao Yan goes,

128
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,790
I go, too.

129
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,060
Do you know what he's done?

130
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,890
I don't care what he did.
I believe him.

131
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,090
He must be wrongly accused.
I need to be with him.

132
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,390
Fine. You've both grown up.

133
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,310
Fine. Go with him.

134
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,000
Your surname isn't Xiao anyway.

135
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,650
The Xiao family won't have any offspring from now on.

136
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,000
Father! Father! Father!

137
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,200
Brother Xiao Yan.

138
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Let's go!

139
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,600
Did you see it?

140
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,400
Did I do this?

141
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,200
Did I kill all these people?

142
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,500
When I heard the noise,

143
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,100
the fire was already burning.

144
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,000
I only saw you rushing out of the room.

145
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,300
They all said it was you.

146
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,800
How could I not remember anything?

147
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,150
These are all my family.

148
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,220
I would die before I'd do anything to hurt them.

149
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,100
How could I? How could I?

150
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,000
How could I?

151
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,600
Brother Xiao Yan, I believe you.

152
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,400
Father has been very strict with me
since I was little.

153
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,900
My Fight Qi reached level nine
when I was nine.

154
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,000
That's because Father pushed me to practice harder.

155
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,200
When I got into fights with Xiao Ning and Xiao Ke,

156
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,400
Father always told me to behave myself.

157
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,900
In other people's eyes,
he was useless as a leader.

158
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,400
But in my eyes, he's the father
who protected me and loved me.

159
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,800
If you're too greedy
you will come under an evil curse!

160
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,500
Evil curse?

161
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,600
If I had the treasures,

162
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,000
the gods will punish me!
They will punish me!

163
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That's ridiculous!
How do you prove it?

164
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
We need an explanation!

165
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,400
This is too arrogant!

166
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
Yes!

167
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
You want an explanation?

168
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,200
Then I will give you an explanation.

169
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
To prove that my mother didn't steal
the Star Fall Pavilion's treasure,

170
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,000
he abolished his own Fight Qi.

171
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,800
When the Nalan family called off the betrothal,
he forgot himself

172
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,400
and blocked that one punch from Yun Zhen
and got injured.

173
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,600
You're about to go.

174
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,000
I will teach you the six-word wisdom
of our Xiao family.

175
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,200
I had gotten the broken classics
of the Blood Sect.

176
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,400
but he was still worried I might walk on the wrong path,
so he gave me a lesson.

177
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,600
"Can't beat someone, run away fast."

178
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,000
This time, when I went home,

179
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,500
I think father has changed.

180
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,800
I have always wanted to get back
the dignity of our Xiao family.

181
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,900
All I want is to go to the Cloud Mist Sect
and avenge my mother.

182
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,600
Whenever I mention that,

183
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,300
Father thinks I'm being arrogant.

184
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,990
I don't understand

185
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,400
what he is afraid of.

186
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,100
He used to be so brave

187
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,000
and he had nothing to fear.

188
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Brother Xiao Yan, I don't want you to be so sad.

189
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,400
Please stop thinking about it.

190
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,700
Maybe some things, we can't see clearly now.

191
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,400
When time passes, everything will have its answer.

192
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,700
Father might have his own worries.

193
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,000
I don't understand.

194
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,800
After my father and I had that fight,
I went back to my room.

195
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,900
But I woke up in the Fight Technique Pavillion.

196
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,800
What on earth happened in between?

197
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,100
I can't remember anything.

198
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,900
What do you think of my new song?

199
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,200
What on earth happened?

200
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,100
How would I know?

201
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,600
Medicine Elder, I must have been framed.

202
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,200
Who do you think it is?

203
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,800
Be thankful for your father's consideration.

204
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,600
What does that mean?

205
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,000
Your father didn't want you to seek revenge.
He has legitimate reasons.

206
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,600
How could you fight the Nalan family,
Star Fall Pavillion, and Cloud Mist Sect?

207
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,300
It will be like looking for death.

208
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,030
That's because my father wasn't brave enough.

209
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,400
Stupid boy, do you think there are no great fighters?

210
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,800
With your skills, you want to fight those old-moneyed clans?

211
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,000
It's better this way. Your surname isn't Xiao anymore.

212
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,600
Xiao family business has nothing to do with you.

213
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,000
How is my surname not Xiao now?

214
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,600
Your father doesn't want you to be a Xiao.
You should take my last name, Yao Yan.

215
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,200
Yao Yan...

216
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,400
I need to beg for a living now. (Yao Fan)

217
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,000
This is so strange.

218
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Everyone says it was me.

219
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,220
Medicine Elder, do you think someone was wearing
a Yan Xiao mask and pretended to be me?

220
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Or is it...

221
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,000
that Soul Hall attached their soul to me?

222
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,500
Can you get out after you finish your book?

223
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Don't get in the way of my creativity.

224
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,400
Medicine Elder, I'm homeless
and you're still playing here.

225
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,400
So what if you're homeless?

226
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,700
I stay in this place I can't even get out of.

227
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,000
That's misery.

228
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,600
Who could it be?

229
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,800
Please get out if you don't have anything else
you want from me. Thanking you.

230
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,400
You're awake?

231
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,900
Eat something.

232
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,200
You looked like you lost your whole soul.

233
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,500
I worked so hard and cooked this
so you have to eat some.

234
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,200
A few more days
and we will reach the Ta Ge'er Desert.

235
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,400
Why are we going there?

236
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,600
I asked Father if he didn't allow you to come home,
where could you go?

237
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,500
You said you were once wrongly accused.

238
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,000
He needs to look into it.

239
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,600
He said... the Xiao family has a soldier group...

240
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,800
based in the desert.

241
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,000
He's asked us to go there.

242
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,100
Wait it out until the truth comes out.

243
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,300
Did he really say that?

244
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,700
Yes.

245
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,040
He said that just to make you feel better.

246
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,860
I can't explain myself and I don't have a witness.

247
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,730
He and the Elder Masters have determined
that I am guilty.

248
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,200
Even if I go to the desert

249
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,900
and stay there for twenty years,
they wouldn't take me back.

250
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,400
Don't worry.

251
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,800
Father is very angry now.

252
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:14,600
After a few years, when he calms down,
you can go back.

253
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,470
Just kowtow a few more times.

254
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,200
You know how stubborn he can be.

255
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,400
Even if I break my head,

256
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,700
he wouldn't forgive me.

257
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,600
Xiao family's soldier group?

258
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,700
Why have I never heard of them before?

259
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,800
My two cousins founded that group.

260
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,600
I have two cousins, Xiao Ding and Xiao Li.

261
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,100
They had already left the family before you came.

262
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,800
Then I heard they settled down in the Ta Ge'er Desert.

263
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,800
Many years have gone by.

264
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,400
I wonder... if they still remember me.

265
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:01,970
♫ The flowers on the dam are beautiful ♫

266
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:07,010
♫ Not as beautiful as your smile ♫

267
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:12,200
♫ Young man has a long way to go ♫

268
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,950
♫ With the Osmanthus Wine you are in Heaven ♫

269
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,770
♫ Mountains and rivers ♫

270
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:29,880
♫ Lovers' shadows ♫

271
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,870
♫ Waters are far away/You want a message ♫

272
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:41,750
♫ The flowers don't speak ♫

273
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,630
♫ Look back on the sunset ♫

274
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:53,610
♫ Your face shows up in my dream ♫

275
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:58,790
♫ Our pact under the flowers,
like flowing sand ♫

276
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:03,430
♫ I am left sad and alone ♫

277
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,920
Second Brother!

278
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,500
Stupid boy, you're so tall now!

279
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,150
Big Brother!

280
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,480
- You little brat! Hold it right there!
- Don't cross over. - Stop right there!

281
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,480
- Big Brother!
- Get over here!

282
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,660
- Stop messing around, Big Brother!
- Stop running! I'm going to get you!

283
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,840
You little brat!

284
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:27,300
- Enough! All right! Stop already.
- Give up.

285
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,740
You little brat.
It's been so long since you've been back.

286
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,730
Have you forgotten about the two of us?

287
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,120
How's that possible? I'm here, am I not?

288
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,580
Little brat.

289
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:44,710
You've heard about
what happened with the family, right?

290
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,920
Yes, we've heard.

291
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,710
But, no matter what happened,

292
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,920
nobody can gossip now that you're in the desert.

293
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,310
Furthermore, I don't believe a word
the family elders are saying.

294
00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:00,130
Otherwise, I wouldn't have followed
Big Brother out of there.

295
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,200
I really didn't do it.

296
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,060
I don't care about who did it.
It's far from here.

297
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,530
Nobody will accuse you.

298
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:11,450
We will defend you
even if the leader comes here!

299
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,000
Thank you.

300
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,310
I always heard that there was a beautiful sister at our manor.

301
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:24,250
Xiao Yan, aren't you going to introduce her to us?

302
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,570
Xun'er, this is my big brother, Xiao Ding.

303
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,980
This is my second brother, Xiao Li. Big brother,
Second Brother, this is my family's "little sister," Xun'er.

304
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,450
Big Brother, Second Brother, nice to meet you.

305
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,140
All right, all right. Let's get moving.

306
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,450
We've been waiting for you all morning.
We're starving.

307
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,290
Let's go home.

308
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,590
Let's go home to eat.

309
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,580
Let's go.

310
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,890
Xiao Yan, this is the passage
that leads to the Snake People Empire.

311
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,690
This is also the boundary
between the Jia Ma Empire and the Chu Yun Empire.

312
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:00,390
Lots of soldiers, merchants,
and also many thieves.

313
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:04,050
If you like to get into fights,
you're in the right place.

314
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,270
A lot of thieves?

315
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,570
Don't listen to your second brother.

316
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:11,420
Sometimes it's thieves but sometimes it's other
soldier groups stealing from businesses here.

317
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,220
Your second brother has a bad temper.
He's just not comfortable when he can't get into fights.

318
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,410
Haha.

319
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,170
Xiao Yan, Xun'er, our house is up ahead.

320
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:30,100
♫ Disappearing in the wind ♫

321
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,500
Big Thumb is back!

322
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:45,350
Big Thumb is back!

323
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,020
- Give me that.
- Have some water.

324
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,900
Here.

325
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,350
Hand it to me. Hand it to me. Here, here.

326
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,320
Get some rest.

327
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,820
Many thanks.

328
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,460
Big Brother, just now, what did they call you?

329
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,780
It's the dialect around here.
Big Brother is Da Mu Zhi, Big Thumb.

330
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,780
Second Brother is Er Mu Zhi, Index Finger.

331
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,820
Move! Make some place for my brother and sister!

332
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,200
Come on.

333
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,830
Move!

334
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:36,250
Drink! Bring the lamb!

335
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,490
Faster!

336
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,020
- Is that enough?
- Eat!

337
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,400
Drink! Drink!

338
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,520
Pour the wine!

339
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,500
Hey, have you ever seen something like this?

340
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,240
Never saw this before.

341
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,320
Use this.

342
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,880
Take it. Use the knife.

343
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,410
Use your hands.

344
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:01,060
Everyone! Listen!

345
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,370
Pour the wine!

346
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,990
This person is my little brother, Xiao Yan.

347
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,310
He's a genius whose Fight Qi
reached level nine when he was nine.

348
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,360
Impressive!

349
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,030
From now on, he's San Mu Zhi. Third Finger!

350
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:22,490
- That's right, Third Finger!
- Third Finger! Third Finger!

351
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,530
Louder!

352
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,100
- Third Finger!
- Big Brother, forget it. I won't be any third thumb.

353
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,310
Don't be modest!

354
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,080
No, you have to.

355
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,920
Finish this bowl
and you'll be the third thumb here.

356
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,430
Yes! Finish it!

357
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,530
I can't drink.

358
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,400
If you drink, you can.

359
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:51,990
This one... This one is my little sister.

360
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,330
Xiao Xun'er.

361
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,990
From now on, she's one of us.

362
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,060
Si Mu Zhi! Fourth Finger!

363
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,550
Nonsense!

364
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:08,570
What Fourth Finger? She's a lady.

365
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,770
Call her... Young Lady.

366
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,940
Young Lady.

367
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,460
Louder!

368
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,800
Young Lady! Young Lady!

369
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,390
Come, let's drink!

370
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,570
Xiao Ding!

371
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:34,300
What are you calling your father for?

372
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,230
The Chu Yun Empire has a batch of goods.

373
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:39,280
This job belongs to our Tiansha Soldier group.

374
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,810
Our big boss let me inform you.

375
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,660
I nailed down that job a long time ago.

376
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,340
How is that your business?

377
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,200
Our boss said...

378
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,990
your Motie Group is a bully
and steals everyone's jobs.

379
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,580
You have so much money.

380
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:06,200
We are from the same town.
Why can't we look out for each other?

381
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,170
Look out for each other?

382
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,960
It's like no one in their group is competent.

383
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,070
That's right!

384
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:18,860
You lose your goods all the time.
If you really want a job,

385
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,690
have your boss come here and beg for it.

386
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:24,390
I have no time for you bottom feeders. Get out!

387
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,300
Get lost! Get lost!

388
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,890
Our boss said...

389
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,190
we have hired a great fighter.

390
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:34,210
We are here to show you...

391
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:37,690
if we are capable enough.

392
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,520
You should've said that sooner.

393
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:44,230
You all eat. I have to deal with this great fighter.

394
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:48,380
Your Xiao family are losers in Wu Tan City.

395
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:54,020
Pretending to be heroes here?
That's so funny!

396
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,920
Second Brother... allow me.

397
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,270
Who did you call a loser?

398
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:15,930
I was talking about the Xiao family.
Are you one of them?

399
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:21,030
My surname is Xiao. I'm Xiao Yan.

400
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:24,140
Oh... I know about you.

401
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:29,200
But your father has already announced to the world
that you are no longer part of the Xiao family.

402
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,650
So you escaped and came here?

403
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:38,330
Cut the crap. If you want to fight, fight.

404
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,620
With your Fight Qi, you call yourself a great fighter?

405
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:01,730
Great! Impressive!

406
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,760
Great fighter! Third thumb!

407
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,860
Do you want to keep fighting?

408
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,780
Nice!

409
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,620
Get out!

410
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,490
Brother Xiao Yan.

411
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,990
- I didn't kill him, did I?
- Nope.

412
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,100
Impressive! Third Thumb!

413
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:25,030
Do you think... I really killed those people?

414
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:28,680
No. Your punch can take over these thieves,

415
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,610
but not enough to take over the elders.

416
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:34,340
Great! Third Thumb!

417
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,710
Nice!

418
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:41,280
I knew my brother was no ordinary person.
Here,Drink it.

419
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,000
Big Brother, I really can't drink.

420
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,300
Brother, I'm telling you,

421
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,800
we have received a carrier pigeon from the leader.

422
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,200
Second Brother and I both believe you didn't do it.

423
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,800
If you were really like that,
you wouldn't have come to the desert

424
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,800
to follow me and Second Brother.
Toasting to you for this.

425
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,400
Drink it up.

426
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,000
Many thanks.

427
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,300
But I really can't drink.

428
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
When I drink...

429
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,400
Drink it up.

430
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,800
I know you're sad.
Drink and you will be less sad.

431
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,700
Listen to me.

432
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,309
Xun'er.

433
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:27,639
Brother Xiao Yan really can't drink.
I can drink for him.

434
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,700
Stop!

435
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,000
Don't move, you two.

436
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,200
It's the Tiansha Soldier Group.

437
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,800
They chased us all the way here.

438
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,200
Bring out the brother you picked up from Wu Tan City

439
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,000
so we can meet him!

440
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,500
You?

441
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,400
Brother Xiao Yan. Brother Xiao Yan.

442
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
His surname isn't Xiao anyway,

443
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,800
why are you two still protecting him?

444
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,800
I heard from the merchants of the Jia Ma Empire

445
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,400
that he robbed the Fight Technique Pavillion
of the Xiao family.

446
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,800
He has many treasures.

447
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,100
He should give us half of them!

448
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:51,600
Second Brother,
they want our Third Brother's treasures.

449
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,800
What do you think we should do?

450
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,100
Why are there Cloud Mist Sect people?

451
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
How are you? Are you all right?

452
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,300
I'm fine.

453
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,300
Big Brother.

454
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,200
Big Brother, Second Brother, are you all right?

455
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,100
We are fine.

456
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,700
Why are Star Fall Pavilion people here, too?

457
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,600
You two rest. I will take over from here.

458
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,500
Be careful.

459
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,400
How do you know the skills of our Star Fall Pavilion?

460
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,120
The Medicine Elder.

461
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,600
What do you call him?

462
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,000
Medicine Elder.

463
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,400
Medicine Elder is the eldest master of our clan.

464
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,900
We are from a lower level
so we only know of him from afar.

465
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,200
We haven't been taught by him.

466
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,800
Sorry that I offended you.

467
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,000
If you want to kill me, do it.
Don't pretend to be nice.

468
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,100
Do you know who I am?

469
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,600
Of course, I know.
You are the son of Xiao Zhan.

470
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,700
You are also Sister Gu--

471
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,800
Wait, that evil Gu woman's son.

472
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,600
Your mother betrayed her teacher.
You even surpassed her.

473
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,200
You betrayed your whole clan.

474
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,000
Like mother, like son.

475
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,470
Betrayed my clan?

476
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,000
Betrayed my clan?

477
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,980
Well said.

478
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,900
Well said.

479
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,200
Who let you talk rubbish here?

480
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,200
Xiao Yan, don't listen to him.
He just wants to provoke you.

481
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,600
Betrayed my clan.

482
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,300
Betrayed her teacher.

483
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,600
Evil woman?

484
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,500
Traitor?

485
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:56,200
Big Brother, don't mind about me.

486
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,800
I am your brother.
Of course, I need to mind about you.

487
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,820
It's not my style to kill those I defeat.

488
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,190
So I will let you go today.

489
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,400
If I see you again,

490
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,100
I will hold you accountable!

491
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,600
Get out!

492
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,930
♫ If you want change, battle it out with no fear of chaos ♫

493
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:48,690
♫ The sky is dark, there’s misery on earth,
the people are living in a terrible state ♫

494
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:51,520
♫ Constant hatred and bitter attachment become evident ♫

495
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,310
♫ In this lifetime, you will see your feat
such as has been tempered with fire ♫

496
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:57,080
♫ Confide in me your aspiration, that constant dream
in your heart that’s difficult to fulfill ♫

497
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,860
♫ To fulfill my promise,
I conceal an arrow inside my gold-threaded sleeve ♫

498
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,680
♫ Being mesmerized for a moment
by the purgatory and the lava ♫

499
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:08,660
♫ Jumping in with a leap with
neither grace nor resentment ♫

500
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,390
♫ Young but bothered by undiminishing worries ♫

501
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:17,010
♫ Worries adding on to worries,
the mountain calls and the sea roars ♫

502
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:19,800
♫ Rushing headlong even if
heaven is narrow and earth is small ♫

503
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,590
♫ Chaos in fighting the evil and foreign forces ♫

504
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:28,720
♫ Disturbances that no one can escape from ♫

505
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,000
♫ Disadvantaged but don’t belittle or take advantage ♫

506
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,120
♫ of the young ♫

507
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,950
♫ Heroes never ask for names ♫

508
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:40,320
♫ or titles ♫

509
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,640
♫ On the board of notables ♫

510
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,220
♫ I’ll showcase my martial arts skills ♫

511
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:49,130
♫ It’s opportune to take advantage of youth ♫

512
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:52,860
♫ and become famous sooner ♫

513
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,220
♫ Proud and aloof, holding a heavy sword in one hand ♫

514
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,920
♫ Young but bothered by undiminishing worries ♫

515
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,710
♫ Worries adding on to worries, ♫

516
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:15,730
♫ the mountain calls and the sea roars ♫

517

♫ Rushing headlong even if
heaven is narrow and earth is small ♫

♫ Chaos in fighting the evil and foreign forces ♫

♫ Disturbances that no one can escape from ♫
