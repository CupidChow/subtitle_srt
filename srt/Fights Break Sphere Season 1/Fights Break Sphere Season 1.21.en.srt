=Episode 21=

3
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,200
Xiao Yan! Xiao Yan!
I think we should divide and conquer.

4
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,580
There are only two hours available.
It won't be easy to gather all these medicinal herbs.

5
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,300
Right... Hao Tian is also from the Department of Alchemy.

6
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,890
I'll follow him. You two aren't very interested
in this. Just look around.

7
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,160
- Let's just meet at the starting point in two hours.
Let's go. - Goodbye.

8
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,540
Be careful.

9
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,390
Wait for me! I'll go with them, too.

10
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,150
There are still some over there!

11
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,460
Let's go there.
There are fewer people over there. Go...

12
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,030
All of these are mine.

13
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,300
Brother Xiao Yan, we're the only ones left.

14
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,259
There's a few over there.

15
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:20,289
Those will be yours. These will be mine.
Don't fight with me.

16
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:23,340
Come with me over there. Let's go.

17
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,510
What's wrong with you?

18
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,800
Just now, I saw Fan Ling came in here, too.

19
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,420
Where is he?

20
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,640
Let's go over there. Go.

21
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,400
Both of us should go find some things, too.

22
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,530
State Teacher, the Alchemist Guild received the decree

23
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,760
for a full-scale search for Elder Mi Tengshan.

24
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,960
This the first decree of the new emperor.

25
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,260
You must do it seriously.

26
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,410
Yes.

27
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,980
Return my Clear Spiritual Stone to me!

28
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,960
I'd already loaded it in the bag.
You all are bullying people too much!

29
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,380
Don't you know that here on the Fight Qi Continent,
the strongest become the most respected ones?

30
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,220
If you want to place blame, just blame your parents
for not teaching you any good skills.

31
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,160
You’re simply an intolerable bully!

32
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,070
Just blame this Clear Spiritual Stone
to be on my list.

33
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,000
Bro, go home and practice for a few more years.

34
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,240
Return my Clear Spiritual Stone to me!

35
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,990
- Come.
- Give it back to me!

36
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,140
- Come.
- Bullying me too much! You all...!

37
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,300
- Give it to me!
- What?

38
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,150
Do you still want to fight?

39
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,870
With just those tricks of yours?
Don’t show yourself off.

40
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,360
You...

41
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,230
- What are you doing?
- What?

42
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,590
- Who asked you to bully people?
- You're taking advantage of the few.

43
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,480
Do you still have any dignity?

44
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,830
Jia Nan Academy, how is it your concern?

45
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,710
I just hate all you bullying people.
How’s that?!

46
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,860
Mind your own business!

47
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,010
Come up here if you have the ability
and take it from me!

48
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,890
What are you doing?! If you throw it again…!
What do you want to do?

49
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,340
I just tossed it. I'll just toss it once again.

50
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,480
You! If you have the guts to face me, come down here!

51
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,310
What are you doing?
Can you let me fight?

52
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,820
Fine. Fine. Don’t fight anymore.
Time is running out.

53
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,790
Let’s all leave together.

54
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,370
Just a lousy piece of rock.
I’m giving it to you as a present.

55
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,670
All right. See if there’s any ahead.

56
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,970
- That plant! That big plant!
- That one.

57
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,650
Let me.

58
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,420
Be careful.

59
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,080
This is good. We've harvested a lot today.

60
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,640
Everyone, I think we should separate at this point.

61
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,330
Why?

62
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,060
It’s a little too inconvenient.

63
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,320
Where is it inconvenient?

64
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,380
Everyone is looking for the same thing.

65
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,010
Just in case we find it together. Whose is it?

66
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,510
- What this senior said is reasonable.
- Right.

67
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,910
Time is urgent. Let’s separate here.

68
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,450
By the way, I’m Yao Jie of the Star Fall Pavilion.

69
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,130
After we leave here, I’ll properly thank everyone.

70
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,620
I'm taking my leave. I'm taking my leave.

71
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,830
Yao Jie, if you meet them again, come quick and find me.

72
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,250
All right.

73
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,340
Goodbye.

74
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,010
Showing off like you’re a hero. Let's go.

75
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,690
Pick the medicine!

76
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,430
Over there! Go...

77
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,280
Do you see it? That plant.

78
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,900
Be careful.

79
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,170
Be careful.

80
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,070
I have one here. You?

81
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,180
I have one over here, too.

82
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,090
That’s right. This Yellow Ground Dragon
is even more powerful than the Qi Spirit Grass.

83
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,530
It can make a broken limb be reborn.

84
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,230
It will still be a baby plant
until it's lived for 500 years.

85
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,490
But the plant over there has absolutely aged 500 years.

86
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,650
It’s already fully grown up, and it can still run.

87
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,930
If you agitate it, it’ll just run away.

88
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,650
But by all means, you must not hurt it.

89
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,730
If its medicine bleeds out,
its efficacy will decrease tenfold.

90
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,300
Gently! You need some water.

91
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,870
I’m your senior! Don’t I understand?

92
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,590
- How can it be done without water?
- Right.

93
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,000
How can there be no water
in the Mystical Mountain Painting?

94
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,300
The Mystical Mountain water comes from Heaven.

95
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,360
Get ready.

96
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,670
It’s coming out! It’s coming out!
No more water. No more water.

97
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,310
- What to do? What to do?
- Hurry to catch it.

98
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,930
Oh, all right.

99
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,400
Don’t go!

100
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,410
You...

101
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,690
Give it back to me!

102
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,350
Give it back to me!

103
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,630
Brother, what did you say?

104
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,600
It’s ours. We waited on it for a very long time.

105
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,330
Yours?

106
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,970
This is my painstaking catch from the ground.

107
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,530
I’m very busy. I won’t keep you company.

108
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,980
Hand it over!

109
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,470
What? Do you want to grab it?

110
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,820
Hand it over!

111
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,640
Hel--

112
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,470
It's running away!

113
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,430
Xun'er.

114
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,270
Don’t run! Where is it?

115
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,510
It's there!

116
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,660
Where is it? It ran away!
Here. It ran that way.

117
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,800
Don’t run! Don’t go!

118
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,000
- What are they doing?
- Stop!

119
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,100
They’re chasing after the Yellow Ground Dragon.

120
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,020
- Yellow Ground Dragon?
- Grab it!

121
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,140
Let’s go take a look.

122
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,000
- Don’t run! Is that it?!
- No. They going toward the dark back side.

123
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,110
The Emperor said we can’t go there.

124
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,130
Then, shouldn't we call them back?

125
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,630
Let's go. Come on.

126
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,080
Yellow Ground Dragon!

127
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,220
Don’t go! Hurry...

128
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,680
Stop! Stop! Grab it!

129
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,380
Xun'er!

130
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,170
Youngsters nowadays.

131
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,500
Let’s see where you can run to now.

132
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,120
What’s all the fuss about?

133
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,440
Xun'er.

134
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,960
Qilin Blood!

135
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,440
Such huge Qilin Blood.

136
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,440
This is the first time I’ve ever seen it.

137
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,280
Oh heavens.

138
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,050
Hurry. Look! Sixth-Rank Magical Crystals.

139
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,660
Have you seen such a huge pellet medicine?

140
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,320
I'm fine with being the last one.
I have to take this back with me.

141
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,470
Brother Xiao Yan, we don’t want to
take the first place anyway.

142
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,800
Just take however many you can.

143
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:37,600
All right. But why does this place
have so many treasures?

144
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,400
You all, look over here!

145
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,080
Medicine Elder!

146
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,280
Medicine Elder.

147
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,340
These are the Magical Crystals over eighth rank.

148
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,130
As long as you use these,

149
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,990
your strength will come back as the greatest
on the Fight Qi Continent. It’s imminent.

150
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,340
Good. You're considerate.
You're considerate. That's rare.

151
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:12,510
That... We're like locusts tied to one rope.
In it together for better or worse.

152
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,470
You don’t need to exert so much effort going back
and forth. Wait until Mystical Mountain Painting closes.

153
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,030
Everything on that side will be yours.

154
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:24,310
All right. All right. Don’t scare me.
We'll go out in a moment.

155
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,790
All right.

156
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,190
Then, do you know the history of this mountain?

157
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,250
Isn’t it a place where the Fight God cultivated?

158
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:40,770
Yes. But the dark side of this mountain is a cauldron.

159
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,990
Now you are covered by the cauldron.

160
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,180
And you still have time to come flatter me?

161
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,190
Hurry and leave.
Go back and save your brothers.

162
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,130
My heavens!

163
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,600
Hao Tian. Hao Tian.

164
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,970
Han Xian.

165
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,410
Hu Jia.

166
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,280
Xun... Xun'er.

167
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,800
Xun'er!

168
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,090
Brother Xiao Yan! Hurry.
Come over here and see.

169
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,880
What happened?

170
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,080
This is bad.

171
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,590
Hu Jia.

172
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,850
Let go of me! Don’t steal from me.

173
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,830
Who’s stealing from you? Wake up a bit.

174
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,260
See what is over on that side.

175
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,950
Hurry. Go... Han Xian.

176
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,380
- Han Xian. Han Xian...
- Mine.

177
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,220
All these are mine.

178
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,260
Hao Tian, come...

179
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,410
- What are you doing?
- Let's go. Come...

180
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,120
My... My pellet medicine! My pellet medicine!

181
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,940
- You all, look at this.
- My pellet medici-

182
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,350
Wake up. We should leave.

183
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,430
Let's go.

184
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,460
Let's go. Go...

185
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,010
Why are we here again?

186
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,300
Let's go. Hurry. Let's go.

187
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,770
Xun'er, let's go.

188
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,590
This side.

189
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,750
Didn’t we already walk by here?

190
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,920
Yes. We did walk by here.

191
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,280
Let's go. Hurry up.

192
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,270
Hurry up.

193
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,760
Brother. Brother. How was it? How was the harvest?
What things are inside?

194
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,740
Let's go. Let me tell you.

195
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,080
How come only a few people came out?

196
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,320
Once entering the treasure mountain, what reason
is there for returning empty-handed?

197
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,250
People die because of money.
Birds die because of food.

198
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,520
I only hope these disciples aren’t too greedy.
That wouldn't be good.

199
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,320
Does State Teacher think we need to
send people to find them or not?

200
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,470
When an Alchemist sees good medicinal ingredients.
One is even willing to lose one’s life.

201
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,790
If you advise them at this moment.
Why would they be willing to listen?

202
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:09,170
Your Majesty Ye Lan, don't worry. The proverb says, "If you want
something wonderful, go to a perilous peak." There's still time.

203
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:18,669
We're trapped by ghosts.
We're definitely trapped by ghosts.

204
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,390
We're trapped by ghosts?

205
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,680
The time for going out is quickly ending.
If we’re trapped in here,

206
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,790
that would be a huge trouble.

207
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,650
An evil place. Why can’t we go out?

208
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,369
This place must be the mouth of a big cauldron.
If my guess isn’t wrong,

209
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:39,760
we’re currently right in the middle,
inside the cauldron.

210
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,630
Both Seniors, I know you must have died unjustly,

211
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,690
but it wasn’t us who harmed you.

212
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,120
Please show us your spirits
and tell us how we can get out.

213
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,680
I promise to burn incense every year to you.

214
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,860
No... I promise there will be wine and meat.

215
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,820
I’m still not married.

216
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,880
How can there be ghosts?
Wake up. Think of a way.

217
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
All right. All right.

218
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,000
We have to pray.
Don't care about the competition.

219
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,770
Return all their items back to them.
Let’s see if that will work.

220
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,250
Pour them out.

221
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,980
- Hurry. Pour them out.
- I can't give it up. I can't give it up.

222
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,020
Let's go.

223
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,740
Why are we still here again?

224
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,710
We probably really won't be in here
for sixty years, right?

225
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,580
It's all your fault for bringing us here!

226
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,670
What did you say? You...

227
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,090
What are you two arguing about?

228
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,630
Hao Tian, if it wasn't for you insisting on
chasing that thing, would we be here?

229
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,490
At that time, we also yelled for you not to come in!

230
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,900
You insisted on coming in here yourself.
Who are you blaming?

231
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,450
Brother Xiao Yan.

232
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:04,060
Do all of you remember
how many corpses there were a moment ago?

233
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,870
Two corpses.

234
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:17,560
Xiao-Xiao Yan, don't scare me.

235
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,140
There's only one corpse left now.

236
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,620
One less corpse.

237
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,460
Who are you? Why do you want to deceive people?

238
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,890
What must we do to leave this place?

239
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:49,040
Brother Xiao Yan, if you continue to
grab his neck like that, he'll die.

240
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,210
What are you laughing at?

241
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,950
Funny. Oh, so funny.

242
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:04,020
You guys have run around eighteen times.
I was counting.

243
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,120
You're the one who caused all this trouble!

244
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,980
Young lad, don't be so fierce.

245
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,140
You should be more polite toward an old man.

246
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,190
Stop beating around the bush.

247
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,030
Say it. Who are you?

248
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,300
I'm an alchemist.

249
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,260
Sixty years ago, I snuck into the Imperial Palace
and found this painting.

250
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,010
I then went into it.

251
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:34,040
So that's how it was.
Elder, sorry for offending you earlier.

252
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,900
Please tell us how to leave this place.

253
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,990
We'll take you out with us.

254
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,000
Why go out? It's so good in here.

255
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,170
On Fight Qi Continent,
is there any place better than here?

256
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,540
Those medicinal herbs, pellets, magical crystals,

257
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,590
you can have as many as you want.

258
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:00,260
Elder, we are still students.
We still have to go back to study.

259
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,030
- That's right.
- Please help us. Tell us the way out.

260
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,500
There is no way out.

261
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,650
This is the mystical mountain of the Fight God,

262
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:15,210
the dream place of so many people
on the Fight Qi Continent.

263
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,540
Are you all stupid?

264
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,190
Elder, we're begging you.

265
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,080
Please tell us the way out.

266
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,830
Elder, you like this place,

267
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,680
but we don't.

268
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,470
If you don't help us today,
even if I have to destroy this mystical mountain,

269
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,880
we must go out.

270
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,700
Essence Flame? What are you doing?

271
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,550
You said earlier that there was no way out.

272
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,940
- Then I'll blast a way out then.
- Wait!

273
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,420
You really don't know how to appreciate good things.

274
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,370
Fine. Come with me.

275
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,460
Hurry! There's no more time!

276
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,620
Hurry! You're always the fastest
when escaping for dear life.

277
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,200
Hurry!

278
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,870
This... What is happening here?

279
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:52,770
How come it's like this?
Someone is setting fire to the entrance.

280
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,570
You all don't move!

281
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,670
Step back...

282
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,850
If this doorway fails,

283
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,660
the people inside can't get out for sixty years.

284
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,460
If you are so confident, then enter.

285
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,830
The designated time will be up soon.

286
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,590
I won't hinder you if you want to go in.

287
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:20,700
But... no one can save you afterward.

288
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,570
Hurry! Hurry!

289
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,990
Who's out there? How do we get out? Right...

290
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,120
- The doorway will be closing soon. Oh, no. I don't want
to get locked in here for sixty years. - Me either...

291
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,610
What should we do?

292
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,860
- We can't get out?
- Yes.

293
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,380
What's going on?

294
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,490
Someone set up a poisonous fog.
A lot of our brothers have already fallen.

295
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,360
If you get poisoned again,
we don't have an antidote this time.

296
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,340
I have the Beast Flame and the Essence Flame.

297
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,540
I surely can control this poison.

298
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,630
Don't worry. We can't really stay on
this rotten mountain for sixty years, right?

299
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,850
I don't know. Hurry. Look.

300
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,080
- He actually went in there.
- That's right.

301
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,130
Is he that strong?

302
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,200
Brother Xiao, you still came.

303
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,730
You are burning up your Fight Qi.

304
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:23,010
Fine then. Let me see how long you can burn.

305
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:27,510
You joined in the Alchemist Competition
just to wait for this day, right?

306
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,710
You said it correctly.

307
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,650
This place will be sealed with the essence
of the youth from all Five Clans inside.

308
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,900
With just me, in exchange for so many of you,

309
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,760
it's well worth it.

310
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,230
How about it? Do you admit defeat?

311
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:29,700
- Do you want to die? Don't go in there.
- Right, don't go in there!

312
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,640
Oh, right. I forgot to tell you.

313
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,100
The poison you took in during the competition
actually can't be cured.

314
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,850
I used my own blood as the main ingredient.

315
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:46,700
What you don't know is, the person who takes it in

316
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,890
will be forever loyal and serve Soul Hall.

317
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,330
This is called a blood alliance.

318
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:09,790
Brother Xiao, should I turn you into
my slave or just a lackey?

319
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,000
But that's not enough to vent my anger.

320
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:26,740
You hurt my father.

321
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:31,670
I'm going to seek revenge for him and behead you.

322
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,840
Who is your father?

323
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,440
The person who possessed the old emperor.

324
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,070
We almost succeeded,
but you just had to interfere.

325
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,270
Now, you can't interfere anymore. Right?

326
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,590
Say farewell to me.

327
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:24,040
Xun'er, go!

328
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,180
How will they get out? What's going on?

329
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,270
Who is causing this trouble?

330
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,660
You... quickly go in!

331
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,370
Why are you not moving? Hurry up!

332
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,860
Your Majesty, please spare me.
If I go in, I won't be able to get back out.

333
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,870
- Stop your nonsense. Quickly go in! Go in!
- Your Majesty!

334
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:19,090
If I go in, I won't be able to get back out again.

335
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,530
Your Majesty, calm down...
With only him going in, it won't solve the problem.

336
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,510
Those students have already been trained
in their respective schools.

337
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:26,360
Each one has exceptional abilities.
They surely can turn this misfortune into a good one.

338
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,990
Your Majesty, calm down.
Stop making things difficult for him.

339
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,170
Brother Xiao Yan, do you still remember the items
given to you by those three weird merchants?

340
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:14,000
Xun'er, step back.

341
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,100
You're terrific, Brother Xiao.

342
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,950
Let me tell you all.
So what if your poison has been cured?

343
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:58,230
This doorway will be collapsing soon.
None of you can get out.

344
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,920
I also forgot to tell you

345
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,860
that during the competition,

346
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:11,010
the poison you took in, not only has the Beast Flame,

347
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,720
it also has the Bone Spirit Cold Flame.

348
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:18,810
I... carelessly left a seed of them inside.

349
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:24,110
Now, it's time for you to bid us farewell.

350
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,760
- We can go out now!
- Yes, there's now hope!

351
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,800
This is great!

352
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:31,500
- Brother Xiao Yan, let me help you!
- Xun'er!

353
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,710
Xun'er, quickly tell them to leave!

354
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,429
Hurry! Make them leave!

355
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:46,699
Go! Go!

356
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,109
Hurry!

357
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,760
Quickly go! Hurry! Run!

358
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,130
Hurry! Hurry!

359
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,840
Xiao Yan, let me help you!

360
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,530
You leave, too! Hurry!

361
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,760
I'm not leaving!

362
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,199
Hurry! Be obedient!

363
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,589
Once you get out, I will immediately follow.
All right?! Quickly go!

364
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,400
- I told you already that I'm not going!
- There's no more time!

365
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,120
- It's collapsing.
- Go!

366
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,160
Hu Jia and Hao Tian, take her away!

367
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,630
Let's go!

368
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,360
- Go!
- Xun'er!

369
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,140
Let's go!

370
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,720
- Take her away!
- Brother Xiao Yan!

371
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,820
Let's go!

372
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:22,290
Brother Xiao Yan!
Brother Xiao Yan is still inside!

373
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,940
Xun'er! Xun'er!

374
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,100
- It's dangerous!
- Brother Xiao Yan is still inside!

375
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,060
Xun'er!

376
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,450
- Brother Xiao Yan!
- There's no use even if you go in!

377
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:01,930
Such a good treasure just got destroyed like that.
Too bad.

378
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,310
- Xiao Yan is out!
- Xiao Yan!

379
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,860
- Brother Xiao Yan! - He's out!
- Turn him over.

380
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,700
- Are you all right?
- Brother Xiao Yan...

381
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,630
- Quickly save him.
- What to do? Medicines...

382
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,960
Here.

383
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,540
Here. Give him some water.

384
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,920
He just exhausted his Fight Qi.

385
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,600
I had him take a Qi Returning Pellet.

386
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,220
Now, it's all up to him.

387
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:00,760
- Xiao Yan.
- Brother Xiao Yan.

388
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,590
Mother!

389
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,840
Mother!

390
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:40,370
Mother, don't go!

391
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,680
Mother!

392
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,380
Mother!

393
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,470
Mother! Where are you?

394
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,090
Mother!

395
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,500
Mother...

396
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,830
Mother.

397
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,890
Mother, how come I can't find you again?

398
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,850
Is it that hard to find your mother?

399
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,740
So noisy.

400
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:51,060
Say it. Where can I find my mother?

401
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,480
I can tell you, but I'm afraid that you won't dare.

402
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,230
What is there that I can't dare to do?

403
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,020
Okay then.

404
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:07,170
Use a dagger to slit your throat

405
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,280
or hang yourself with a rope on a house beam

406
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,960
and you'll see her already.

407
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,470
Medicine Elder,

408
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,900
please stop mocking me.

409
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,390
So what if I'm mocking you?
Let's see if you dare to be greedy again next time.

410
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,370
It's so easy if you want to die.

411
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:31,040
If not for my Fight Qi protecting you,
you would have died so many times.

412
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,670
But this time, it's a bit more troublesome.

413
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,630
What's wrong?

414
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,270
You drank the blood of a Blood Sect clan member.

415
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:42,650
Fan Ling wasn't lying to you about that blood alliance.

416
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,870
It indeed can't be cured.

417
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:48,560
Technically speaking,
you're already a member of Soul Hall.

418
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:53,300
It's fine. The Bone Spirit Cold Flame can suppress it.

419
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,450
Bone Spirit Cold Flame can indeed suppress it,
but it can't completely cure it.

420
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,260
Bring that Mystical Heavy Ruler of yours over here.

421
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,190
The Mystical Heavy Ruler is indeed a magical weapon,

422
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,020
but it is also an evil weapon.

423
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,490
On this, all the martial arts
techniques of Soul Hall are written.

424
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,540
You must be very careful.

425
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,900
What am I being cautious about?

426
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,400
Entering into a blood alliance is equivalent
to opening up the gates of Soul Hall.

427
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,330
On here are the top ranked martial arts techniques
that Soul Hall never teaches to outsiders.

428
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:01,690
If you don't have any other weapons on hand,
you can temporarily use this Mystical Heavy Ruler.

429
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:06,440
You must remember
that you're a member of the Xiao Clan.

430
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,190
Your mother died fighting Soul Hall.

431
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:14,260
You must not read any of
the martial arts techniques written here.
