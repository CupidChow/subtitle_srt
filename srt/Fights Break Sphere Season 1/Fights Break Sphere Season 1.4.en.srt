3
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,160
It's like this. Inside this ring,

4
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,160
lives an exceptionally great fighter.
He's the master of my mother, who died many years ago.

5
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,550
I usually go into this ring to train.

6
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,380
I think your mind got muddled from being burned.

7
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,650
But it's true. Let me tell you! Inside this ring,
there's a really huge mountain and waterfalls.

8
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,870
There are all kinds of pellet medicines in there, too.
Seriously, I'm not lying to you.

9
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,110
And I tell you, that there's even an earring sprite
inside my earrings. Do you believe it?

10
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,420
No, Xun'er. I'm not joking around.

11
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,510
I'm serious.

12
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,860
I don't believe it.
If you don't want to tell me, then let's forget it.

13
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,740
I have no more interest in knowing
how you became so good either.

14
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,150
But I do believe you are gifted.

15
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,080
You will eventually make everyone admire
and look up to you.

16
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:32,050
Xun'er, for so many years,
I have lived in a muddleheaded manner.

17
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,030
Don't worry. I won't ever be like that again.

18
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,260
Fortunately, you have always been by my side.

19
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,600
When I was little, my health wasn't so good.

20
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,640
Each night, someone would come to my room
and transfer his Fight Qi energy to me

21
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,880
and help warm my vital channel.

22
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,530
As a result, he caused himself
to be drenched in sweat.

23
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,550
Who would you say that was?

24
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,360
I...

25
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,300
Father said that once you're awake,
go to the inner courtyard to find him.

26
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,410
I will.

27
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,330
Father.

28
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,890
Why did you take this?

29
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,660
Because... it's an Earth Rank Fight Technique.

30
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,300
Heaven and earth are black and yellow,
the universe is vast and in primal chaos.

31
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,870
Why didn't you take the Heaven Rank Fight Technique?

32
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,870
Heaven Rank Fight Technique...
I was afraid that I...

33
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,360
What were you afraid of?

34
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,460
Father, what's wrong?

35
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,610
What you took is the Three Thousand Thunder Movement.

36
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:18,000
It was initially a Heaven Rank Fight Technique. However,
it's a remnant scroll and was downgraded to Earth Rank.

37
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,890
The other half is currently in the hands
of the Blood Sect, a subordinate of Soul Hall.

38
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,100
I really didn't know that.

39
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,680
Is that so?

40
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,600
Why did you take this then?

41
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,960
You went to get an Earth Rank Middle Level Fight Technique
located in the darkest area of the FightTechnique Pavilion.

42
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,550
Why?

43
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,860
I...

44
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,120
Does your Master covet this Heaven Rank Fight Technique?

45
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,270
Master? What Master?

46
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,570
I was just lucky.

47
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,130
Lucky?

48
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,830
In one month's time,

49
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,400
you've increased by 7 stages in your Fight Qi Skills.

50
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,320
Your Fight Qi whirl was condensed into a very solid manner.
You also did the Eight Extreme Collapse well.

51
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,240
That day, you were even able to break the seal

52
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,330
and obtain a remnant scroll
of a Heaven Rank Fight Technique.

53
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,920
For so much good luck to end up with one person,

54
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,280
don't you think that's strange?

55
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,040
Who's teaching you martial arts skills?

56
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,660
Son,

57
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,940
a person can be incapable,

58
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,200
but he cannot lack moral character!

59
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,080
Get up. Let me see what you're capable of!

60
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,550
Father...

61
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,770
Eight Extreme Collapse!

62
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,330
A technique of the Star Fall Pavilion.

63
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,530
Your mother didn't teach you that martial arts skill.

64
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,750
Indeed, Mother didn't teach me that before.

65
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,440
But she did leave behind many good things for me.

66
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,790
Keep this matter a secret.

67
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,090
Do you hear me?

68
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,750
Yes.

69
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,560
Father, you gave me a good scare.

70
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,400
It's you who almost scared me to death.

71
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,370
Increasing one's Fight Qi Skills by 7 stages
to become a Fight Qi Practitioner within a month.

72
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,870
Your Eight Extreme Collapse almost killed me.

73
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,490
How about it?
Have you decided on your path for training?

74
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,600
I've thought about it already.

75
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,510
I want to enter Jia Nan Academy.

76
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,820
I want to get stronger.
I want to defeat Nalan Yanran.

77
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,970
I want to seek revenge for Mother.

78
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,190
I want all those who have taken advantage of us

79
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,780
to pay the price.

80
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,860
The path to cultivation is long.

81
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,040
You never know
what will happen in the next moment.

82
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:34,270
You've grown up. Change your hairstyle.

83
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,780
You'll be leaving soon.

84
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:48,720
I will pass to you the Precept passed down
for generations in our Xiao Family, all right?

85
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,940
Father.

86
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,070
When you can't defeat someone, run away quickly.

87
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,450
Jia Nan Academy is the top academy
on the whole Fight Qi continent.

88
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,530
It was created by the Fight God, thousands of years ago.

89
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:14,030
Every year, outstanding students chosen from
all over the Fight Qi continent will travel far

90
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,090
[Black Point Region Forest]
to Jia Nan for advanced training.

91
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,290
To take revenge for mother,
to seek justice from the Five Great Clans,

92
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,060
and also there's the arranged meeting
in three year's time with Nalan Yanran.

93
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,690
Going to Jia Nan to learn
is the first step that I must take.

94
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,640
I set out full of happiness,
but who would have thought

95
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,410
that just walking into the gates of Jia Nan Academy
would be very difficult.

96
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,050
Stay closer to me. All of you, keep up!

97
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,200
Prepare to set up camp and eat.

98
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,460
The Energy Talisman is the monetary unit here
at Jia Nan Academy.

99
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,450
Inside the academy, if you want to improve
your food, refine, obtain medicine pellets,

100
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,420
or improve your skills inside the special cultivation rooms,
all of you will have to use these.

101
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,490
For the first month, each of you will get 10.
If you lose them,

102
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,160
you will just have to become a beggar inside the academy.

103
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,520
After you pass through
the Black Point Region Forest up ahead,

104
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,360
you will reach the academy.
Our academy has a tradition.

105
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,690
All freshmen must undergo a Smelting Trial.

106
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,230
You all are on your own from here.

107
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,510
Entering the forest for the Smelting Trail
will also be your first lesson since entering the academy.

108
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,940
You have to think of a way to charge through it.

109
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,300
There will be teachers
secretly keeping watch over you!

110
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,800
That's so strange.
She leaves just as she sees fit.

111
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,230
That's right. Smelting Trial?

112
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,390
Don't know what's inside this forest.

113
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,620
Are you all right?

114
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,600
- Are you all right?
- He fell so badly.

115
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,510
There are Magical Beasts inside there.

116
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,950
There are Magical Beasts within the academy?

117
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,740
What should we do now?

118
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,590
You're fine. Take your time and tell us.
Who hit you?

119
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,670
Just after I went in, there were older students
who suddenly stole my energy talismans.

120
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,130
They said that first years deserve
to be beaten and stolen from.

121
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,890
This is the Smelting Trial. If they wanted to steal, they could
have just done so. Why did they still have to hit me?

122
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,150
It's fine... How many of them are there?
What Fight Technique did they use?

123
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,520
I... I didn't even see anything clearly

124
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,670
and before I knew it, I-I was beaten up
and sent flying out of there.

125
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,860
Where's Hao Tian?

126
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,900
Oh, no! Hao Tian said that he had diarrhea.

127
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,040
Back to back!

128
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,460
Let's go.

129
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,140
Are you all right? Is anything wrong?

130
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:09,180
- What are you doing?
- What do you want?

131
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,520
- Give it to me.
- Bring it here. Bring it over here.

132
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,280
Do you know who I am?

133
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,980
I've got people watching my back.

134
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,330
They're people from the academy.

135
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,620
Once we arrive at the academy,

136
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,290
we'll resolutely tell on all of you!

137
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,120
- Brother, if you have something to say, say it.
- Hand it over!

138
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,570
- Tell on me?
- No...

139
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,210
Lad, take out your energy talismans.

140
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:33,100
- Don't have any.
- Don't have any?

141
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,810
What are you doing?

142
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,530
Run!

143
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,860
Eight Extreme Collapse!

144
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,170
Hurry!

145
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,400
- Let's run!
- Go.

146
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:28,800
- It was so dangerous today.
- That's right. So scary.

147
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,530
Such bad luck. Each year, I come here,

148
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:35,190
and each year I end up going home.
What a lousy academy!

149
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,980
I'm not going to learn anymore.
I'll just go back and do business.

150
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,150
This is the third time already.

151
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,220
For the previous two times,
my energy talismans were all stolen.

152
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,340
I was forced to drop out of the academy.

153
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,340
In passing through the Black Point Region Forest,

154
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,960
1/3 of the first years will get eliminated.

155
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,600
Even if we're able to pass the Smelting Trial,

156
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,750
if all your energy talismans are stolen,

157
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,560
you'll have no food to eat
and no means of exchange for medicine pellets,

158
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,830
and the difficulty level of cultivation will be so high,
even an iron man would collapse from exhaustion.

159
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,230
Also, after a month, 1/3 will get eliminated again.

160
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:12,040
What you mean is that among us,

161
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,510
there will only be a small number of us who
will truly stay in the Jia Nan Academy?

162
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,730
- Just a small number of us?
- Why is it like this?

163
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,150
Aren't you a student in alchemy?
Don't tell me you are also joining them?

164
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,740
I... I only have Stage 2 Fight Qi Skills.

165
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,340
Stage 2 Fight Qi Skills? How did you get in then?

166
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,950
Was it really like what you were shouting
about earlier, that your family has connections?

167
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,140
I... I was just trying to scare them back then.

168
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,920
But I do know all about medicinal formulas.
There's no formula that I don't know about.

169
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,920
Hence, I was a special recruit.

170
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:52,690
But the academy will choose
the best Fight Practitioners.

171
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,410
Every batch, they would eliminate 2/3 of the first years.

172
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,700
In the best school,

173
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,840
of course, only the best Fight Practitioners can get in.

174
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,930
What do you mean by that?

175
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,690
Who are you?

176
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:17,450
My parents once joined the expedition
of the Great War with the Soul Hall.

177
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,690
All of them went but none returned.

178
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,430
Since I was little, I followed my uncle

179
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,030
and grew up in a mercenary group
within the Magical Beast Mountain Range.

180
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,110
I've been a magical beast hunter for seven years.

181
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,250
Only this year did I gain admittance into the academy.

182
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,020
What's the use of being loyal and brave?
Won't we still get bullied by these seniors?

183
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,820
Other than stealing our energy talismans
and spending them,

184
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,190
they don't really care if we can survive it.

185
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,760
Everyone, don't despair.

186
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,030
We will all be Fight Practitioners in the future.

187
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:52,020
We're just starting. What's the use
of abandoning ourselves to despair?

188
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,030
What Xun'er said is right.

189
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,170
We mustn't resign ourselves to adversity.

190
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,260
Who said that first years must lose to the seniors?

191
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,060
Anyway, when you encounter a stronger opponent,

192
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,300
I have never seen a Fight Practitioner
who would just sit by and wait for death.

193
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,300
Since the academy was built, I have never heard

194
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,240
of any first years defeating the seniors.

195
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,050
That was the past, not the present.

196
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,170
It wasn't easy for us to get to where we are now.

197
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:22,130
Now, either we go home dejected, or...

198
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,040
let's give it all we've got!

199
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,670
Let's give it all we've got!

200
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,400
What if we fail? Isn't that just suffering in vain?

201
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,360
There are so many of us.
I'm sure we can come up with something.

202
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,920
How's this? Let's all share
what our special skills are.

203
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,270
I know how to surround magical beasts and create traps.

204
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,800
I'm able to scout for information.

205
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,560
Scout information? Where are you from?

206
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,890
I... am an orphan.
Born from Heaven and raised by the Earth.

207
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,670
Let's not talk about others.
What about you?

208
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,380
Me?

209
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,110
I know a lot about medicinal herbs. Will that help?

210
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:05,370
Of course. You'll be our medic and be in charge
of taking care of the wounded students.

211
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,060
Good.

212
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,810
When you hunted all those magical beasts,

213
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,800
the magical beasts usually had levels higher
than humans, but you were always successful.

214
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,670
What method did you use?

215
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,630
Know yourself and know your enemy.
Find the target's location and weakness.

216
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,620
Right, you've been in this forest many times.

217
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,720
Do you remember the location of those seniors?

218
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,450
And you still say you don't have much to contribute?
You're the most useful out of all us!

219
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:38,090
The first pass is being guarded by Bai Cheng's group.

220
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,260
They will hide in the deep parts to surround you.

221
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,870
Most are unable to get past this stage.

222
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,010
Upon entering the forest, you'll be ambushed.

223
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,840
Here, the second batch of seniors guarding are

224
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,810
with Black Evil Lei Xiong and White Evil Ye Xun.

225
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,660
They rank fifth
among the top fighters of Jia Nan Academy.

226
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,110
Both of them have completed the cultivation
to Fight Grand Master.

227
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,560
If you luckily pass through this stage,

228
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,190
getting past the third obstacle
is a hopeless case.

229
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,880
The third obstacle is Bai Shan.

230
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,610
No one knows what his strength is.

231
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,900
The first years that were eliminated at this stage
either suffered broken hands or feet,

232
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,490
or were so scared that they never wanted
to be Fight Practitioners again.

233
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,800
Come over here. Take a look, everyone.

234
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,710
This is the grape juice that my auntie personally made.

235
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:12,550
Let me tell you that inside this,
she added Green Spiritual Herbs and Snake Saliva Fruit.

236
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,630
After drinking this, your Fight Qi will increase.

237
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,150
This is a very rare kind.

238
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:23,040
More importantly, you can only find this
in the Magical Beast Mountain Range.

239
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,660
We won't leave anything today.
Let's drink it all!

240
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,200
Good! Good!

241
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,550
Up!

242
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,170
-Let us down!
- Let us down!

243
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,770
This gang of scoundrels!

244
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,300
Pieces of trash! What are you looking at?

245
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,760
- Let-Let us down!
- Aren't you the amazing ones?

246
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,410
We are talking to you!

247
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,300
- Brats!
- Brats!

248
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,090
I'm going to kill you!

249
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:28,800
Senior Brother, no matter how old you are,
you are still a student.

250
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,000
No vulgarity.

251
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:38,390
- What are you doing?
- What are we doing? You took my roast rabbit away.

252
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,960
You need to pay for it.

253
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,580
Let me warn you. You should know your place.

254
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,380
Wasn't it just a lousy rabbit?

255
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,890
Let me down. I will catch eighty
or a hundred of those for you.

256
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:51,660
That's not needed. When we were hunting
in the Magical Beast Mountain Range,

257
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:56,070
we'd kill some hunters and roast them
for our meal when we were out of food supplies.

258
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:59,170
Let me tell you, he really is from the Cannibal Clan.

259
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:02,590
He just caught an old man and ate his arm raw.

260
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,490
It was so bloody that I could hardly watch it.

261
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,540
No, Brother! People will die!

262
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:15,090
Let's negotiate, Brother.
I feel like my hair is burning.

263
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,110
Bai Cheng took all the rabbits on his own.

264
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:20,780
- Darn you.
- He did it alone. Just roast him only.

265
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,800
Traitor! You are disloyal. Someone can die over this!

266
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,520
- Are you going to pay back Lin Xiuya's rabbits?
- Yes.

267
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,930
Release them.

268
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:34,220
Take off all their clothes.
Don't leave any clothes behind.

269
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,350
What are you doing?

270
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:43,260
Xun'er, why don't you go away for a bit.

271
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,700
It's not something for a girl to see.

272
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,330
- All right.
- Let go!

273
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,300
What are you doing?

274
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,040
Hey!

275
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,000
Don't undress me.

276
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,100
- Don't undress me!
- Quick... Take it off.

277
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,860
Do your best!

278
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,330
Where did you hide the energy talismans?

279
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,980
Thinking of leaving?

280
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:33,600
What are you laughing at? Just let us go.

281
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,150
Aren't you feeling great?

282
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:38,340
Those brats are really sly.

283
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:42,520
"Been catching eagles your whole life, but you let
an eagle slip away within a blink of an eye."

284
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,300
And you let the first years
snatch away the energy talismans.

285
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,660
Capture them later

286
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:52,630
and strip them bare. Then, take back the energy talismans
and distribute them equally.

287
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,570
- Did you hear that?
- What does it have to do with you?

288
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,000
Your share will go to us as fees
for sealing our lips about this.

289
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,180
No, Big Brother... This...

290
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,520
Let them down.

291
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,410
Quick, quick!

292
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,880
Stop laughing.
Give me something to wear.

293
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,130
- I don't have anything...
- Give me something to wear.

294
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,350
Stop laughing already.

295
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:22,010
Big Brother, do you have any extra clothes?

296
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,740
- Find him some clothes.
- Did you hear that? Hurry.

297
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,240
Hurry.

298
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,720
Everyone, look what I found!

299
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:47,540
These mushrooms are hard to find in the marketplace.

300
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:51,020
And no one picks them in the woods.

301
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,840
These morchella mushrooms along with a fish

302
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,680
and then densely stewed in a pot.

303
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,250
Savory. Savory.

304
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,440
That's enough.
Once that pot of yours lets out any smoke,

305
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,640
the Black White Evil Duo will come and pursue us.

306
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,980
I think none of us
will have a chance to drink the soup.

307
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,180
Let me tell you. There is no need to worry.

308
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,360
If the Black White Evil Duo dare to show up,

309
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,110
we will make them look for their teeth on the ground.

310
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:26,920
See this tree? We will beat them, undress them,
and tie them to this tree.

311
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,480
They will then watch us drink our soup.

312
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,550
Once we are done drinking our soup,
we will feed them our piss,

313
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,120
take their energy talismans and
return to the academy. How about that?

314
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,990
- Great!
- Sounds good!

315
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,690
Brother Xiao Yan, I never imagined
you would have so many trivial thoughts.

316
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,020
Hu Jia, let's go catch some fishes.

317
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,590
Let's go.

318
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,970
- Catch a big one!
- Sure.

319
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:50,070
Brother Ye. Brother Lei.
Did you hear what those brats said?

320
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,860
I don't care what they say about me.

321
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,530
But I can't tolerate them insulting you two.

322
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,340
He makes me so angry that I feel faint.

323
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,240
Then you go fight them.

324
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,370
No... I will follow your orders, of course.

325
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:05,180
The fish is here!

326
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,950
We've been waiting for so long.

327
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,030
- The soup is ready.
- Come, take this.

328
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,450
What do you think?

329
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,990
I don't think it'll be so easy.

330
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:18,460
It's so bold of them to cook in the forest.

331
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,650
It looks like they are trying to lure us out.

332
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,740
The one named Xiao Yan is too sly.

333
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,700
We need to know clearly
what's going on before going in.

334
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,050
Of course.

335
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,250
You will do the cooking from now on.

336
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,870
No problem!

337
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:33,110
The few of you, move to their rear.

338
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,260
Once we attack, no one should be spared.

339
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,630
It smells so good!

340
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:50,210
- Let me taste it first...
- Let me taste it, too.

341
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,150
- How is it?
- Good soup! Very tasty.

342
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,340
Xun'er, do you want to have a taste of it?

343
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:03,750
Leader, if we don't attack now,
the soup will be all gone.

344
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,980
Shut up. Move aside.

345
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,940
- Come. I'll scoop a bowl for you.
- Let me...

346
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,460
Delicious.

347
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:17,600
There is a total of 500 energy talismans. I'll take 300.
Divide the remaining 200 among yourselves.

348
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,330
Why should you alone get so much?

349
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,870
Why? If not for me,

350
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,570
you would all have pissed in your pants out of fear.

351
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:28,160
All these energy talismans
would have been stolen for sure.

352
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:32,220
It was your idea, but everyone did their part.

353
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,070
Xun'er, why are you being so silly?

354
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,640
If I get more, you won't lose out either.

355
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,120
This isn't fair.
Everyone should get an equal share.

356
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,750
- How is this unfair?
- Hey, that's enough.

357
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:47,060
How about this? Xiao Yan gets a share of 200.

358
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,560
- How can it be like that?
- Soft-boned (Unethical). - Indeed.

359
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,490
- Bring it out!
- Hey! What are you doing? Even drawing out your knife?

360
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,430
Let me tell you. If not for me,

361
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,200
all of you would not have any energy talismans.

362
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,010
Now that there are some,
you are being picky. Right?

363
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:05,590
Reckless people.

364
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,650
We really overestimated them.

365
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,650
500 energy talismans.

366
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,560
The two of us have hit a small bonanza.

367
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,250
- Right. Each of us gets 200. Divide the 100 among the rest.
- And me?

368
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,300
In regards to Bai Cheng,
no need to give him any.

369
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,580
No, my two leaders. That's too careless, right?.

370
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,170
I was even tortured into such a state.

371
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,700
At least give me some compensation.

372
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,710
Big Brother.

373
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,750
But there are many of us.

374
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,820
After we have distributed them,
how much is left?

375
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,560
What are all you up to?
Thinking of snatching them, right?

376
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,230
You've forgotten how I saved you all?

377
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,610
Brother Xiao Yan, there are so many of them
and there's just one of you.

378
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,350
We're at a disadvantage.
Maybe you ought to think about this again.

379
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:45,380
Stop talking nonsense.
Quickly divide it equally.

380
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,860
Xiao Yan, can you fight all alone and defeat so many of us?

381
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,810
I can't fight and defeat? Do you believe
that I'll dump these into this fire right now?

382
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,610
- All of us won't get any! Don't come near me!
- What are you doing?

383
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,600
Back away! Keep backing away
or I'll throw them in!

384
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,220
- Don't do anything rash!
- Back up... - Xiao Yan, you idiot!

385
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,290
- Try throwing them in. - Do you believe
that I'll throw them in now? I'm really throwing!

386
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:06,350
- Just try to move and I'll kill you!
- I'm really throwing!

387
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:09,240
I'm really throwing! I'll throw--

388
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,370
That soup isn't bad. Be my chef from now on.

389
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,550
Our money.

390
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,900
Bai Cheng, come over and hit him.

391
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,480
Sure.

392
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,750
What are you laughing at?

393
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,010
You must be Xiao Yan.

394
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,700
Senior Brother Hei, you've gotten what you wanted.
How about letting us go?

395
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:00,440
Let's be friends. High like the mountain and long like the river.
If it's fated, we'll joyfully meet again.

396
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,330
You brat, still trying to smooth talk me.

397
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:09,160
Who was the one who said that
this tree stump was prepared for us?

398
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,740
And would even tie us to it,
making us watch all you drink your fish soup?

399
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,830
Who said it?

400
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,200
It wasn't me. It really wasn't me.

401
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,850
Senior, he was the one who said it.

402
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,020
We can give you all our energy talismans.

403
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,230
But you must teach that scoundrel
a lesson on our behalf!

404
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,360
Help us vent our anger!

405
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,740
Quiet!

406
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,640
Watch them well.

407
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,380
This soup looks good.

408
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,580
Drinking this soup will make my day.

409
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,790
This soup smells delicious.

410
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,640
Still laughing? Tell me,
where did you put my clothes?

411
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,070
They won't even call me to have some of that fish soup.

412
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,920
I don't get a share in the distribution
of the energy talismans either.

413
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,730
What Black White Evil Duo are they?

414
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,900
Pshaw! They are Black White Scoundrels!

415
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,290
Later, I'll go steal some by myself.

416
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,820
Delicious.

417
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,220
Give me some.

418
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,780
Wait for me! Give me some. Give me some.

419
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,940
Brother, give me some of yours.

420
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,420
Brother Ye, give me some.

421
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,890
Brother, leave some for me.

422
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,260
Oh no!

423
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,730
You... This...

424
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,320
What is wrong? Brother...

425
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,550
No. What did you all do?

426
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,130
You all even resorted to poisoning?!

427
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:12,830
Don't... Don't undress me.
I just put them on.

428
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,340
Two hundred. Xun'er!

429
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,170
Awake?

430
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:30,560
- You plotted against me.
- Plotted against you?

431
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,050
The 1000 energy talismans in their hands

432
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,920
were all found on the two of you.

433
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,679
Tell me. How many students did you thieve?

434
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,779
We're going easy on you as it is.

435
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,129
Xiao Yan, just wait for me. Don't hide.

436
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,200
I absolutely will not hide.

437
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,730
Since you came looking for us,
you have to remember clearly

438
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,380
and not be mistaken.

439
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,409
This is Hao Tian, a medicine smelt genius.

440
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:59,439
His poisoning and detoxification skills are extraordinary.

441
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,440
This is Lin Xiuya,
number one in masterly martial arts skills.

442
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,330
He has hunted more magical beasts

443
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,340
than the amount of hair on your head.

444
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,430
That person is Hu Jia, with the worst temper.

445
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,470
No one dares to provoke him.

446
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:15,790
I'm Xiao Yan. Nothing special about me.

447
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:19,280
Just that I'm a little smarter than the two of you.

448
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,900
Brother Xiao Yan, what about me?

449
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,900
This is my little sister, Xun'er.
She's the best girl in the world.

450
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,090
If any of you ever bullies her,

451
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:31,680
I'll definitely skin all of you.

452
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,400
Xiao Yan, is not your mother just--

453
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,450
Everyone, the hatred between them and me is set.

454
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:44,010
Now, when they talk, they also insult my parents.

455
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:48,600
It'll bother me if I don't punish them now.

456
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,250
What did you say a moment ago?

457
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,290
After drinking the soup, what should be done?
Do you remember?

458
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,820
What are you planning to do?

459
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,380
- Stop joking!
- Brother Xiao Yan.

460
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,520
- Don't take it too far...
- It'll be fine.

461
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,450
Are you really doing it? Don't...

462
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:09,260
Brother... Brother Xiao... Warrior Xiao...
Don't joke around!

463
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,180
- Brother Xiao. You really...
- Brother Xiao. Noble Warrior Xiao.

464
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,310
Why are you just sitting there? Help me beg for mercy!

465
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:18,530
Noble Warrior Xiao, we're also
reputable people inside the school.

466
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:21,490
If you do that, we might as well kill ourselves.

467
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:25,800
Right. Don't worry. In the future,
if anyone mocks you at the academy,

468
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,230
- we will support you.
- That's useless.

469
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,510
- From now on, we're your sidekicks.
- Your errand boys.

470
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,190
- Little labor force.
- Little flea.

471
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,180
More. More.

472
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,670
Today is a beautiful and bright day.

473
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,880
Jia Nan Academy begins its General Assembly.

474
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,280
This is to welcome the first years.

475
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,130
It is also Jia Nan Academy's fifth...

476
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,430
F-Fifth...

477
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,010
Good.

478
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:15,730
F-Fifty-fifth General Assembly for first years.

479
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,830
Royal Father ordered me to give his sincere regards

480
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:22,400
to all the teachers h-here.

481
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,520
Jia Nan Academy's long history

482
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,190
has cultivated

483
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:35,230
c-c-count...

484
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,400
- Good.
- Good.

485
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,910
Who wrote this speech?

486
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:44,270
Doesn't he know when this Crown Prince Ye Lan
mentions the word "wu," he stutters.

487
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,070
...c-countless talents.

488
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:53,490
During the confrontational battle with the Soul Hall,

489
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:59,160
continuously injecting fresh...

490
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:03,560
blood...

491
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,530
This...

492
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,360
This... What is this?

493
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,220
Good speech. Give him a round of applause.

494
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:10,220
Excuse me, Senior. May I ask, from here to the academy,

495
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,050
how far is it?

496
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,230
It's not that far.

497
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:22,950
But even if no one gives you directions,
I'm afraid you won't get there today.

498
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:25,520
- Why not?
- There are too many energy talismans on you.

499
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,630
Hand them over.

500
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,460
I can then consider letting you go home.

501
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,330
If not, I'll break your legs today
so you'll have to stay here.

502
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:36,760
Senior, may I ask how we should address you?

503
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,970
I am Bai Shan.

504
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,790
Take one fist from me!

505
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,490
Xiuya! Lin Xiuya!

506
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:10,710
Eight Extreme Collapse!

507
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,150
Brother Xiao Yan.

508
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,420
Interesting.

509
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,380
No wonder Black White Evil Duo were defeated.

510
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,240
Come at me again.

511
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,430
Move aside.

512
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:47,280
Eight Extreme...

513
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,210
Run!

514
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:26,490
Where are the energy talismans? Hand them over.

515
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,180
What are you doing?

516
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,480
Medicine Elder!

517
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,560
Medicine Elder!

518
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:49,400
Medicine Elder. Medicine Elder!
