00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,720
Yan Sect is the winner!

4
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,310
Yan Sect wins for sure!

5
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,950
Yan Sect wins for sure!

6
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,870
Yan Sect wins for sure!

7
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,680
Yan Sect! Yan Sect! Yan Sect!

8
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,270
Brother.

9
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,680
Yan Sect! Yan Sect! Yan Sect!

10
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,830
Yan Sect! Yan Sect! Yan Sect!

11
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,240
Yan Sect! Yan Sect! Yan Sect!

12
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,960
Yan Sect! Yan Sect! Yan Sect!

13
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,440
Dear classmates,

14
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,910
the time when Bai Sect solely cccupied

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
the underground training rooms
of Fen Tian Qi Training Pagoda is over.

16
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,270
The Student Council

17
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,720
officially became the buying agent

18
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,960
for tickets to the underground training rooms.

19
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,880
Only 998 yuan

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,080
to bring it home.

21
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,520
998.

22
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,000
You will not be tricked

23
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,550
or swindled.

24
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,030
You can't buy anything with 998.

25
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,630
But you can buy

26
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,000
tickets to our underground training rooms.

27
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,830
Do you think it's a bargain?

28
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,440
Yes!

29
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,440
I want to apply for an annual membership card.

30
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,910
An annual membership card, right?

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,600
We'll give you a gift pack

32
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,110
of Magic Crystals for Fight Qi.

33
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,750
Plus a bottle of Yan Sect High-Level

34
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,630
Gather Qi Powder.

35
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,960
Congratulations.

36
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,630
You're finally at the last level.

37
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,270
Thank you, Elder Tengshan.

38
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,670
Now it's me teaching you.

39
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,670
If you want to thank me,

40
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,630
stay here to teach others

41
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,110
in the future.

42
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:51,960
Yes.

43
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,720
Can I

44
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,910
take a look at your level?

45
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,510
I can hear

46
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,070
the sound of grass sprouting.

47
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,350
and the sound of flowers blooming.

48
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,640
It's like birth.

49
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,670
That's right.

50
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,830
A word of advice.

51
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,920
A lot of people

52
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,320
on Fight Qi Continent know Bone Spirit Cold Flame.

53
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,830
I thought it was long lost.

54
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,640
I never thought

55
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,550
it would reappear.

56
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,720
Innocent people can be harmed
due to their hidden talents.

57
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,550
Another trouble will be stired up in the world.

58
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,160
All the seniors in the school

59
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,950
know that

60
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,350
whenever the holiday comes

61
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,320
in Jia Nan Academy,

62
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,670
there is an interesting

63
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
activity.

64
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,040
This year,

65
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,230
freshmen can join too!

66
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,110
The Magical Beasts Mountian Range,

67
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,110
a place that's both dangerous

68
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,040
but also rich.

69
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,950
This year,

70
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,040
the old students and the new students

71
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,000
together will take part in the hunting.

72
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,160
Calm down.

73
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,790
I hope

74
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,790
everyone can be safe.

75
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,320
And I hope everyone

76
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,040
can obtain the Magical Crystals of Magical Beasts

77
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,160
instead of becoming its lunch.

78
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,640
Magical Beasts Mountain Range

79
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,160
is at the border of

80
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,160
Chu Yun Empire and Jia Ma Empire.

81
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,040
Here is the richest treasure trove

82
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,670
as well as the most dangerous place

83
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,440
in Fight Qi Continent.

84
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,550
That's why

85
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,110
magical beasts are exceptionally ferocious.

86
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,790
So,

87
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,640
the treaty was reached

88
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
when the two empires were founded

89
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,110
to ensure the independence
of Magical Beasts Mountain Range.

90
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,000
This is an independent kingdom.

91
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,640
It's the kingdom of Magical Beasts.

92
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,160
Take a look!

93
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,920
Don't go. Take a look.

94
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,640
A little pendant.

95
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,880
Sold at a cheap price.

96
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,510
Come and have a look!

97
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,790
Don't go.

98
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,000
We have herbs.

99
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,440
So many herbs.

100
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,230
Here you are.

101
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,230
Keep the change.

102
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,550
Come and take a look!

103
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
You like it?

104
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,510
Is this for me?

105
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,270
Students,

106
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,670
the weather in Magical Beasts Mountain Range

107
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:42,670
varies from minute to minute.

108
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,470
Although the weather is sunny,

109
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,470
in my experience,

110
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,350
there will be a big storm later.

111
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,150
So after you enter the mountain,

112
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,470
everyone needs to keep up.

113
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,710
Don't fall behind.

114
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,320
Well, this place...

115
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,880
Wait for me!

116
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,710
Hurry!

117
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,880
Students.

118
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,030
This is it.

119
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,200
Ruo Lin.

120
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,520
Tell the kids

121
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,150
some remainders.

122
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,520
I'll inspect the surroundings.

123
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,110
Yes.

124
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,400
Students.

125
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,440
This is our academy's supply point.

126
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,670
Look around

127
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,910
and dig out all the supplies.

128
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,670
Got it.

129
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,470
I'll go first.

130
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,030
That way.

131
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,790
One, two, three.

132
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,080
Come on, give me a hand.

133
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,550
Prepare to camp.

134
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,320
Most of the academy's reserves

135
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,550
are around here.

136
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,280
Set up the supply station

137
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,910
as soon as possible today.

138
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,230
At night, everyone

139
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,840
must get their equipment and materials

140
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,840
of their own ready.

141
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,880
What the hell is this place?

142
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,760
It's burning during the day

143
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,320
and freezing at night.

144
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,400
Bear it.

145
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,030
We're not out

146
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,790
to enjoy the scenery.

147
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,640
We should work harder these days

148
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,320
and try to get more Magical Crystals.

149
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,790
It's easy to say.

150
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,590
Magical beasts are hard to deal with.

151
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,350
Magical beasts?

152
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,150
Magical beasts are nothing.

153
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,320
No matter how powerful it is,

154
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,080
it can't be cleverer than human.

155
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,000
Hu Jia.

156
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,710
You don't understand.

157
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,030
Fight Practitioners pick herb,

158
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,030
kill Magical Beasts
and take away the Magical Crystals.

159
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,230
In the eyes of Magical Beasts,

160
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,470
we are the invaders.

161
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,080
They will fight with their lives

162
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,030
against human.

163
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,320
Ma'am.

164
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,880
What is Magical Crystal?

165
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,670
Magical Crystals are the co-living creature

166
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,760
inside of Magical Beasts.

167
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,880
Can only appear on

168
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,590
magical beasts with good quality.

169
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,960
Once Magical Crystal is found inside them,

170
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,230
they were considered the Beast King.

171
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,840
The Beast King

172
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,200
relies on Magical Crystals

173
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,710
to lead his own clan

174
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,710
and maintain his status.

175
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,280
That's why

176
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,000
when we took the Magical Crystals,

177
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,840
the whole clan

178
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,150
will fight against us.

179
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,880
The main purposes of this trial

180
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,470
include picking herbs

181
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,520
and hunting of Magical Beasts.

182
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,200
Taking the Magical Crystals

183
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,110
is a very dangerous thing.

184
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,590
Don't do it casually.

185
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,400
Ma'am.

186
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,640
This is bad.

187
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,200
What's up?

188
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,110
San is sick.

189
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,790
When did this happen?

190
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,470
Why is he so ill?

191
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,080
What happened?

192
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,110
What's wrong with him?

193
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,440
Elder Han.

194
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,550
He's seriously ill.

195
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,350
Child.

196
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,790
You're very ill, do you know that?

197
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,080
You can't go

198
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,840
with us.

199
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,230
Someone,

200
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
carry him into the tent.

201
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,030
No, I can do it.

202
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,200
You will die

203
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,080
if you keep on doing it.

204
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,110
Do you know that?

205
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,080
Stay at the supply station

206
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,670
and wait for us to pick you up.

207
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,470
Elder Han, let him go.

208
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,400
We'll take care of him together.

209
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,520
No way.

210
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,200
The journey ahead is perilous.

211
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,110
It will harm him

212
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,030
if we take him with us.

213
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,230
OK. It's getting late.

214
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,320
Have an early rest.

215
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,470
Ma'am.

216
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,760
What's up?

217
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,110
He...

218
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,350
Send him back to the supply station.

219
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,710
He can't go any further.

220
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,670
Ma'am, I can handle it.

221
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,880
This is for your own good.

222
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,840
Any carelessness in this place,

223
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,030
his life will be in danger.

224
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,230
Send him back to the supply station.

225
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,150
Alright.

226
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,350
Students at the front, don't mess it up.

227
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,200
Students at the back, keep up!

228
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,960
Catch up!

229
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,080
What's wrong with you?

230
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,710
Students.

231
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,840
Please hang in there.

232
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,350
We must reach the next supply depot

233
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,550
before it gets dark.

234
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,000
Hurry up! Get up!

235
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,550
Why is everyone so tired?

236
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,320
We've only walked a few steps.

237
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,640
It's too dangerous here.

238
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,670
We can't stay here.

239
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,960
Get up and move on.

240
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,000
Let me rest for a while.

241
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,760
I can't go any further.

242
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,840
If you have a rest

243
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,400
by the hillside before dark,

244
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,840
you're basically

245
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,590
sending yourself to the mouths of Magical Beasts.

246
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,910
Hao Tian, hang in there.

247
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,880
Get up. Hurry up.

248
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,080
I'll pull you up.

249
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,470
Everyone.

250
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,350
Students at the back keep up.

251
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,400
Hang in there.

252
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,350
Get up, hurry up!

253
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,760
Come on.

254
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,840
Hurry!

255
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,190
Everyone.

256
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,040
Keep it up.

257
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,800
We'll reach the academy's camp

258
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,430
after the hill up front.

259
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,590
This is great.

260
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,400
Come on.

261
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,350
We're finally here! Go!

262
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,000
Come on.

263
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,830
Here we are!
We've finally arrived!

264
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,800
Here we are.

265
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,000
I once set up camp here

266
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,190
when I was young.

267
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,640
This is the safest place

268
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,560
in the Magical Beasts Mountain Range.

269
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,430
The Magical Beasts here

270
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,520
are all low in level.

271
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:11,920
Those mercenary groups

272
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,760
would never come here.

273
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,400
You two...

274
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,230
But even a low-level

275
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,310
Magical Beast,

276
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,880
it's not easy for us to fight against it.

277
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,520
What happened?

278
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:27,710
come on.

279
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,920
The multicolored Cloud Mist and the Five Sacred Mountains,
a subject is here to meet the chief!

280
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,640
The multicolored Cloud Mist and the Five Sacred Mountains,
a subject is here to meet the chief!

281
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,400
The multicolored Cloud Mist and the Five Sacred Mountains,
a subject is here to meet the chief!

282
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,710
Cloud Mist Sect can shout so loudly.

283
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,950
Why don't you go sell bean curd?

284
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,950
Are you the elder of Jia Nan Academy?

285
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,640
My name is Ruo Lin.

286
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,560
What are you doing here,

287
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,640
Cloud Mist Sect?

288
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,760
Search the place!

289
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,160
A beast appeared in the mountain today,

290
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,190
and killed five of us.

291
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,710
Sect Leader Yun has decreed

292
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,710
to catch the killer

293
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,190
and kill him.

294
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,950
Every sect and mercenary group

295
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,070
near the Range

296
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,310
should be searched thoroughly.

297
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,040
The land behind me

298
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,350
is the campsite

299
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,310
for the students from Jia Nan Academy.

300
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,160
If you insist to go in and search,

301
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,590
that's fine.

302
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,680
However...

303
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,470
Please tell me clearly.

304
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:22,950
Go past it first.

305
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,310
I don't know

306
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,590
when the Range

307
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,400
falls into the hands

308
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,040
of the Cloud Mist sect?

309
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,400
I'm ordered

310
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,230
by the elder of Jia Nan Academy

311
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,590
to protect them.

312
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,800
If you break in,

313
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,710
don't blame me for being ruthless.

314
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,920
Who is acting wildly here?

315
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,400
Master Han.

316
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,160
These are all my students.

317
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,830
There's nothing to be searched.

318
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,520
Retreat right away.

319
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,590
Master Han,

320
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,070
I am just following orders.

321
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,680
What monster

322
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,520
did you say?

323
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,040
A girl with green hair.

324
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,110
A girl?

325
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,230
Killed five disciples

326
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,760
of your Cloud Mist Sect?

327
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,470
Green hair.

328
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,760
What's her trick?

329
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,400
She...

330
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,920
She devoured them!

331
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,920
Devoured?

332
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,880
Is she a human or an animal?

333
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,000
That girl has a poisonous body.

334
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,430
Even her steps were poisonous.

335
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,760
We Cloud Mist Sect have Fight Qi to protect us.

336
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,040
It doesn't matter.

337
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,710
But she is with

338
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,470
the Amethyst Winged Lion King.

339
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,800
They are hard to deal with.

340
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,230
You mean that

341
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,190
you have seen the Amethyst Winged Lion King?

342
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,110
It means that

343
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,590
there is such a mythical beast?

344
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,350
She rode a lion,

345
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,230
sneaked into our territory,

346
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,560
and killed five of our seniors.

347
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,520
Those five people were bitten to pieces

348
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,400
and have no remains.

349
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,160
Here it comes. The lion is here again.

350
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,470
Alright. Let me meet it.

351
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,640
Back off!

352
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,230
Come on! Hide!

353
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,350
Cloud Mist Sect really knows no limit.

354
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,230
Are you here for your death again?

355
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,000
Brother Xiao Yan.

356
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:56,880
Xiao Xun'er!

357
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,830
Come back!

358
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,190
Xun'er.

359
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,000
Well,

360
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,830
if we want to hunt big beasts,

361
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,470
we need to go up.

362
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,230
When I was hunting here

363
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,230
with my uncle,

364
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,920
we were never bothered to come here.

365
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,590
Still go up?

366
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,110
How cold will it be?

367
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,430
There are other Magical Beasts?

368
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,710
Come here.

369
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,230
In Magical Beasts Mountains Range,

370
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,560
after this point,

371
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,230
it is hard for you to make any progress.

372
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,590
So we'll go down.

373
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,230
There's a canyon
in the Magical Beasts Mountains Range,

374
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,880
called Mirror Rock.

375
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,190
Mirror Rock?

376
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,190
Mirror Rock is

377
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,070
is the hinterland
of Magical Beasts Mountains Range.

378
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,110
The real big beasts

379
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
are all hidden here.

380
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,400
Well, let's go find

381
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,110
a big lion

382
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,310
like the one we saw.

383
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,000
What's wrong?

384
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,470
You dare not do that?

385
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,590
You

386
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,950
better pray to God to bless us

387
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,110
not to meet it.

388
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,110
Haven't you heard from the disciple

389
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,040
fro Cloud Mist Sect say

390
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,590
it eats people.

391
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,760
It will bite you to death.

392
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,590
And you won't be able to go back to school.

393
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,590
You'll be elixir in its stomach.

394
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,280
The four of us

395
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,470
can lure it out.

396
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,710
Doesn't Xiao Yan have wings?

397
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,560
You can smash it in the air.

398
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,760
It can fly, okay?

399
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,040
Actually, there are not many flying Magical Beasts.

400
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,830
We happenend to come across one.

401
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,110
The Amethyst Winged Lion King

402
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,310
is the legendary Magical Beast.

403
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,000
I heard about it when I was little.

404
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,470
Let's not offend

405
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,800
the strong beasts.

406
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,710
I'll repeat this one more time.

407
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,190
Return to the base

408
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,070
before dark.

409
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,400
If there is danger,

410
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,230
then blow the whistle on your chest

411
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,040
and the rescue team will come to your rescue.

412
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,190
Got it?

413
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,160
The most important thing is that

414
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,830
no one is allowed

415
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,920
to leave this forest.

416
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,160
You mustn't leave here.

417
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
Or you'll be given a serious demerit.

418
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,430
One more thing.

419
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,430
Protect yourselves.

420
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,470
Don't be hurt.

421
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,760
Got it?

422
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:32,950
Got it.

423
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,230
Let's go.

424
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:55,830
This way.

425
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,640
What did you find?

426
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,040
Magical beasts!

427
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,560
Where are Magical Beasts?

428
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,560
Don't be anxious.

429
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,160
It'll take hours to get it out.

430
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,560
What kind of Magical Beasts are these?

431
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,350
That one?

432
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,710
This is first-level Bloodthirsty Rat.

433
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:10,830
The Bloodthirsty Rat.

434
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,520
That's right.

435
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
This is a first-level magical beast.

436
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,190
Its two eyes are red.

437
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,310
After the Magical Crystal is taken out,

438
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,040
it can make elixir.

439
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,800
Taking this pill

440
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,070
can cure bed-wetting.

441
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:21,710
You know what?

442
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,760
You are not playing Magical Beasts,

443
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,640
you're bullying animals.

444
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,160
Just go.

445
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:24,950
Come on.

446
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,640
Mind your own business.

447
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,590
Put your finger into another's pie.

448
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,110
It's your turn.

449
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,000
What's it?

450
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:48,920
That way.

451
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:49,710
Come on.

452
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,520
Xiuya.

453
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,430
Elder Han.

454
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,800
Disciples of Cloud Mist Sect

455
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,520
came here again.

456
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,830
They want us to retreat down the mountain.

457
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,560
Why?

458
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,470
Magical Beasts Mountain Range

459
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,470
isn't theirs.

460
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,280
They said

461
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,160
they found

462
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,710
the disciple who was kidnapped by

463
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,590
from Amethyst Winged Lion King.

464
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,280
His face was burnt

465
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,640
and his body is incomplete.

466
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,430
I'm just worried

467
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,590
about the students' safety.

468
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,800
But if we do

469
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,680
what they asked to do,

470
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,680
it'll be a shame on the academy.

471
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,590
Don't worry.

472
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,070
Within the limited range,

473
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,680
nothing serious will happen.

474
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,110
Come on.

475
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,880
What is this?

476
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,230
What a strong venom.

477
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,950
It at least is

478
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,070
an Immortal Bug above the third-level.

479
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,710
Keep the medicine in your mouth.

480
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,560
Don't let the liquid of Immortal Bugs

481
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,350
get in your mouth or your eyes.

482
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,400
How big is this?

483
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,590
My goodness!

484
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:52,920
Be careful.

485
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,280
This way.

486
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:56,590
Retreat!

487
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,470
Don't fight it by force.

488
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,680
Use your crossbow!

489
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:15,710
Come on.

490
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,160
Alright.

491
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,280
Xun'er, leave!

492
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,430
This way.

493
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,230
Hurry.

494
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:19,710
Get up.

495
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,280
It's all right. It's all right.

496
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,520
Don't be scared.

497
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,070
I'm not scared when you're here.

498
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,310
Don't you fear death?

499
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,310
If we have to die, let's die together.

500
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,560
Brother Xiao Yan.

501
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,350
The bug is gone.

502
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,230
What's so funny?

503
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,120
Come on.

504
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,430
Hurry up.

505
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,120
Run! Go!

506
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,520
Hurry!

507
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,520
Lin Xiuya.

508
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:37,950
Hao Tian.

509
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,520
Hu Jia.

510
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,800
Brother Xiao Yan.

511
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,760
Would they have died?

512
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:46,670
They can't be.

513
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,320
They should be able to protect themselves.

514
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,430
What should we do now?

515
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,150
There is

516
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,190
a very narrow channel over there.

517
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,430
The space is small there.

518
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,190
We can only kill it there.

519
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,390
I will lead it there later.

520
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,760
You hide yourself.

521
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,910
I'm going with you.

522
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,320
Hurry up, hide!

523
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,120
Go inside now.

524
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,470
Brother Xiao Yan!

525
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,120
Brother Xiao Yan!

526
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,390
Brother Xiao Yan!

527
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,190
Xun'er.

528
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,080
Are you all right?

529
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,040
Don't touch me.

530
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,760
It's dirty.

531
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,430
Where is the bug?

532
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,040
It's everywhere.

533
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,710
It's dead.

534
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,120
Are you all right?

535
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,600
Where is the bug?

536
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,670
It's dead.

537
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,600
Where were you?

538
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:09,870
I was so worried.

539
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,000
I was with Hu Jia

540
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,870
and Han Xian just now.

541
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,950
We escaped to a lake outside the cave.

542
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,670
The bug is afraid of water.

543
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:16,800
That's why it didn't follow us.

544
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,670
Who knew that

545
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,630
Hu Jia can't swim.

546
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,040
Once into the water,

547
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,430
he was drowned.

548
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,150
We pulled him out

549
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,630
and treated him.

550
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,840
Then he woke up.

551
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,950
That scene...

552
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,760
Mouth to mouth.

553
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,470
I didn't dare to look at it anymore.

554
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,430
What is this?

555
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:45,520
This

556
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,080
came out of the bug's stomach.

557
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,560
Let's carry it out quickly

558
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,710
and leave the darn place.

559
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:54,670
Alright.

560
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:57,910
Lin Xiuya,

561
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,430
your mouth-to mouth method

562
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,040
can actually save people?

563
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,600
What mouth to mouth?

564
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,910
What just happened?

565
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,120
Ask him yourself.

566
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:07,840
I...

567
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,360
What about you?

568
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,760
Weren't you just with Xun'er

569
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,910
and Xiao Yan, weren't you?

570
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,560
Don't mention it.

571
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,630
When I entered the cave,

572
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,760
and it winds,

573
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,280
I got lost in a short time.

574
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,190
And then

575
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,080
I've actually gone out
of a cave into a forest.

576
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,320
And it took me long

577
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,910
to find the entrance
where we got into the cave

578
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,840
and then meet you.

579
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,150
That's bad.

580
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,560
Another bug is here.

581
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,600
Prepare yourselves.

582
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,390
Let me have a look.

583
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,040
You haven't finished?

584
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,840
I was scared to death just now.

585
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:17,950
I'm thirsty.

586
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,150
If you are so afraid of death,

587
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,630
go back to the academy.

588
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,150
See the girl,

589
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,360
they knew how to speak gently.

590
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,190
But I didn't see him talking to us

591
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,320
with that voice.

592
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,470
I grew up in the Magical Beasts Mountain Range.

593
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,040
I've been a hunter for many years.

594
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,230
Miss.

595
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,040
Hey!

596
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,630
Don't be scared.

597
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,190
Brother, you're so handsome.

598
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,390
All you freshmen

599
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,360
are boring.

600
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,000
Have some water.

601
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,520
Be decent.

602
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,600
After Han Xian saw the girl,

603
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,190
he doesn't even know how to walk.

604
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,120
Look at his shoulder.

605
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,870
It's almost twisted.

606
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:21,910
My...

607
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,710
My father asked me to hide in a box

608
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,320
but the box was crooked

609
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,430
and it stinked inside.

610
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,280
That's why I fainted.

611
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,080
I thought I was dead.

612
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:33,910
Miss,

613
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,430
don't be scared.

614
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,190
Where are you from?

615
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,750
♫ If you want change, battle it out with no fear of chaos ♫
