2

=Episode 7=

3
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,100
Forget it. After leaving the Blood Sect, I don't think
that it'll be able to exert its original evil tendencies.

4
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,900
Have you learned to use any weapons?

5
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,100
I learned a sword technique,
but I wasn't very good at it.

6
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,800
I'll teach you a fight technique.

7
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,000
Flame-Splitting Wave-Devouring Ruler.

8
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,400
It takes strength to lift this.

9
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,900
I know that. I'm just not
strong enough to lift it up.

10
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,600
What do you use to lift things?

11
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,200
You are using your strength,
but your Qi did not follow.

12
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,400
Strength is strength. Qi is Qi.
Do you get it?

13
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,500
How about this? Imagine that you are
a Buddha statue inside a temple.

14
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,900
As heavenly kings,
they are there without moving,

15
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,400
but their robes just naturally float up like so.

16
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,800
This phenomenon is called
"Brimming With Fight Qi."

17
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,660
Once you can truly master your strength and energy,
you'll be able to lift this.

18
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,000
Take a good look.

19
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,000
Flame-Splitting Wave-Devouring Ruler, Form 1!

20
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,500
Flame-Splitting Wave-Devouring Ruler, Form 2!

21
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,600
Flame-Splitting Wave-Devouring Ruler, Form 3!

22
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,100
This third form is the hardest one to learn.
You have to use your Qi to guide your ruler (sword).

23
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,400
Let it continuously swirl
and attack in front of you.

24
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,000
Only then can both your hands remain free.

25
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,500
That way, it will become your best helper.

26
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,500
You can practice the first form now.
Once you're done, you can then leave.

27
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,400
Even if I practice it well, it won't be enough.
When I fight Fan Lao,

28
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,900
I will probably still need to rely on your Fight Qi.

29
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,400
Why are you always borrowing from others?
Can't you train your own?

30
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,100
I'm afraid it'll take too long. To be sure,
it's still better to use your Fight Qi and Essence Flames.

31
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,400
Don't forget that time in the Spatial Ring
is slower than outside.

32
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,600
You can make it.
Fan Lao is definitely looking for this, too.

33
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,000
So before he finds it,
he won't harm your friends.

34
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,700
As for you, carry it on your shoulders
and run a few laps to get used to its weight.

35
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,250
- Go ahead.
- Yes.

68
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,200
Ever since entering school,
I haven't seen Xiao Ning or Xiao Ke.

69
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,200
I didn't expect that the two of them
would be attracted by the Soul Hall.

70
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Since they were young,
they were never well-behaved.

71
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,800
And also caused the Xiao family embarrassment.

72
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,799
Let's not talk about this.

73
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,199
Xun'er, it's getting late.

74
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Isn't it quite inappropriate for you to remain here?

75
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,100
What's not appropriate? I can't believe
you're even thinking about this right now.

76
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Do you think maybe they have also taken
Lin Xiuya out of the academy?

77
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,800
That's not possible. All around the campus,
there are elders keeping watch.

78
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,600
Even if that fellow from the Blood Sect
has impressive skills,

79
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,300
he won't dare to cause such an unfortunate situation.

80
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,800
Then could he have...

81
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Big mouth!

82
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,300
For such a risky matter,

83
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,300
I shouldn't have called on Lin Xiuya.

84
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,900
His parents died at the hands of the Soul Hall.

85
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,200
If anything happens to him,
I won't be able to forgive myself.

86
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,200
What about it? I still haven't forgiven you yet.
You two didn't let me go with you.

87
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,300
Exactly. You didn't bring me along either.

88
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,400
You think that I'm not good enough.
You look down on me.

89
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,400
You probably thought I'd be a burden, didn't you?

90
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,620
If you know the answer, why ask the question?

91
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,200
You.

92
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,600
No, I didn't mean it that way.

93
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,090
I was just worried about your safety.

94
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,000
When you were locked up,
the seniors came to beat us up.

95
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,970
They took away all the energy talismans we got
from the Black Point Region.

96
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,000
Lin Xiuya told me that he was afraid
that you'd react impulsively once you knew.

97
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,200
It'll be fine. I'll go and look for them again.

98
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,300
See? You're not bringing us along with you again.

99
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,200
If you're going to go and be a hero by yourself,

100
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,400
you don't need this group of brothers.

101
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,400
As your brothers, we do have our usefulness.

102
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,800
I said I didn't mean it that way.

103
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,300
I remember I closed the door.

104
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,700
Where's my Mystical Heavy Ruler?

105
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,100
What are you saying?

106
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,200
Where did you take my weapon to?

107
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,500
I...

108
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,600
It's not with me here.

109
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,900
Where is it?!

110
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,700
It's with my teacher. I'll go get it.

111
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,700
I'll send it to you tomorrow.

112
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,500
Tomorrow night, come to
the Martial Arts Transfer Forest to find me.

113
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,400
Bring the Mystical Heavy Ruler
in exchange for your friend.

114
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,200
If you play any tricks,
you will all have to die!

115
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,940
I brought your weapon. Release my friend.

116
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,600
Your lousy weapon is so heavy.

117
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,910
I wonder how you can possibly use it.

118
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:34,300
You want it? Come back with me to explain
to the Sect Leader. You will be rewarded.

119
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,920
How about your dozens of disciples?

120
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,120
They couldn't keep this secret,
but let you find out about it.

121
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,270
Their Fight Qi has all been abolished.

122
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,950
They deserved it!

123
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,620
But if I can bring back a disciple
from the Xiao family,

124
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,890
it will indeed be a good gift for the Sect Leader.

125
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,790
I will go and look for him myself.
I don't need to trouble you.

126
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,290
Release my friend.
I have already brought your object here.

127
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:17,000
If you don't follow me,
then you'll just have to die along with him!

128
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,010
Fire-Splitting Wave-Devouring Ruler!

129
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,800
That was the first form.
Now witness my second form!

130
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,520
Not possible. This is not possible!

131
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,680
Of course, adults never abide by their words.

132
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,980
Watch me use Form 3!

133
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,770
I'm not ready yet.

134
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,810
That was really dangerously close.

135
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:12,350
Medicine Elder, your Fight Qi is too powerful.

136
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,660
Are you all right? Did he torture you?

137
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,550
What do you think?
I've been hung upside down for one whole day.

138
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,330
My legs are numb already.

139
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,620
Are you all right? Do you want me to carry you?

140
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,430
Why is your Fight Qi so awesome?

141
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,890
I told you, that it only works on certain occasions.

142
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,960
Don't ask.

143
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:54,420
You've just progressed to the Fight Master stage. That's why
you couldn't hold out and your vital channel got wounded.

144
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,790
I really want to become stronger as quickly as I can.

145
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,860
I don't ever want to be so passive when facing the enemy.

146
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,400
Don't be so anxious, lad. I will help you heal first.
When you have recovered,

147
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,430
you will immediately begin to train
on the second form of Flame-Splitting Wave-Devouring Ruler.

148
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,230
Sit down and cross your legs.

149
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,779
Last night, the elders asked dozens of students.

150
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,860
Some students said they saw Xiao Yan fighting
with the envoy of the Soul Hall.

151
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,630
And they were evenly matched.

152
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,560
If one or two said so,
I would think they were crazy.

153
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,630
But when dozens of people say the same thing,

154
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,360
could they have lost their minds collectively?

155
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,580
How many of us went out to find Lin Xiuya yesterday?

156
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,260
To prepare for the attack from the Soul Hall,

157
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:10,370
one elder brought a whole team of senior students
to find him and they failed.

158
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:15,020
But he brought the person back so easily.
How did he do it?

159
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,190
Lin Xiuya was gravely injured
and Xiao Yan was also slightly injured.

160
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:22,240
I asked them to go back to their dormitory to recuperate.

161
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,220
I asked him the same question.

162
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,490
He said that he was just lucky.

163
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,530
Does Elder Mi believe that?

164
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,980
In my opinion, we should summon these two
to the elders' compound.

165
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:41,400
Watch them very closely so that
they can not corroborate their statements beforehand.

166
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,870
What do you think?

167
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,060
Xiao Yan, this kid.

168
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:52,530
Last time, when he was in my class,
he was already a 9-star Fight Practitioner.

169
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,160
But to compare that to the envoy of the Soul Hall,

170
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,270
he is just a tiny flea.

171
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:03,280
That's to say that there is still
an expert that we haven't seen yet.

172
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,470
I went to the woods to look at the marks
at the scene where they fought.

173
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,890
That Fight Qi,

174
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:15,020
I'm afraid that no one in this academy
has accomplished that.

175
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,610
Last night, that wounded envoy of the Soul Hall

176
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,170
rushed out of the academy before dawn.

177
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:26,390
Teacher Ruo Lin, you were guarding the gate of the academy.
Tell us the situation yourself.

178
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,070
I heard a laugh and then a bright red light flashed by.

179
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,270
When the sun rose, I found that

180
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:37,300
he left a handprint near the name of the academy
which was written by the Fight God.

181
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,990
I have chipped it out.

182
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,560
What handprint?

183
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,290
This is someone at the level of Fight Ancestor.

184
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,190
This matter... That's even more strange.

185
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,770
Xiao Yan is only a 9-star Fight Practitioner.

186
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:20,720
How dare he challenge a high-level Master
from the Soul Hall?

187
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,360
And according to everyone at the scene,

188
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,660
the two of them were evenly matched.

189
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,980
Could Xiao Yan have also entered some cult organization?

190
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,460
Xiao Yan's fight techniques are
from the Star Fall Pavilion and the Xiao family.

191
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,680
There's no suspicion.

192
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,400
But I think the first question here is...

193
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,600
Who was it who brought the envoy
from the Soul Hall to the academy?

194
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,780
Except for the dozens of students
that Lei Xiong admitted,

195
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,120
who else could it be?

196
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,000
We don't know that yet.

197
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,520
We don't even know how long
they have stayed here in the academy.

198
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,810
The darkness is coming.

199
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,170
The world will become chaotic again.

200
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,690
Do you think Mi Tengshan and Xiao Yan
are in this together?

201
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:33,790
Every time I said I was going to investigate Xiao Yan,
he always changed the subject.

202
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,990
And then it's over, what's all that about?

203
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,300
How the envoy from the Soul Hall got into the academy
is not something that can be investigated.

204
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,720
If we do and there is no result,

205
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,430
how do we account for it?

206
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,930
In the future, what student
would want to stay at the academy?

207
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,660
And if the news gets to the Royal Family,

208
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,220
how do we tell them?

209
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,310
The elders want to minimize the problem

210
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,470
and put an end to the problem.

211
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,390
These old foxes.

212
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,570
It's these old foxes who have been working
before we were born.

213
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:25,150
They are so old that their tails
have grown white hair.

214
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,200
You'll just have to tolerate it.

215
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:07,530
Brother Xiao Yan, are you washing clothes?

216
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,900
It seems you still haven't accepted your lesson.

217
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,740
What do you mean?

218
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,290
Wherever there's trouble, there's you.
How should I explain it to you?

219
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,120
This isn't the Black Point Region.

220
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,500
Your little comrades are also not here.

221
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,490
You're going to be broken right here today.

222
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,510
In this academy, private fighting isn't allowed.

223
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,780
A private fight?

224
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,610
Two days ago, in here, we

225
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,040
grabbed three of your little comrades.

226
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,250
Lin Xiuya, Hao Tian,

227
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:52,070
and Hu Jia. We kicked them till they were like
balls rolling all over the floor.

228
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,090
They obediently handed over all the stuff they stole
from us in Black Point Region.

229
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,960
Do you know why they don't dare mention it?

230
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,630
It's because they will die much quicker that way.

231
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,440
So, what you mean is...

232
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,570
you also want me to hand over
any and all stolen items?

233
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,330
That is right.

234
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:26,510
Furthermore, I don't care if you rob other people

235
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,190
or get them from your family,
that is also good.

236
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:34,780
Every month, you have to give your seniors
10,000 energy talismans.

237
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,120
This request is not too high, right?

238
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,350
- Not high at all.
- Not high at all.

239
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,110
Ten thousand.

240
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,680
I really do not have that much.

241
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,320
How about this? You lend me some.

242
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,740
It looks to me like you really lack a beating.

243
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,750
Come. If we don't beat him into obedience today,

244
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,690
we should stop our demands!

245
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,920
Good.

246
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,920
Come! Everyone come out!

279

Xiao Yan, if you're so brave,
go acttack my brother.

280
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,180
No... Or you... Wait...

281
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,930
Wait for me to prepare properly. I obey.

282
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,630
I obey. I obey.

283
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,420
You still want to resist?

284
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,720
Hold him.

285
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,620
Listen to me well!

286
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,460
We're hitting back at you all today

287
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,650
so you can all remember

288
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,440
that we, the first years, will not allow
our seniors to take advantage of us!

289
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,270
That's right!

290
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:09,370
If you want revenge, you can.

291
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,120
If you touch one person in this room,

292
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,160
all of us will find all of you!

293
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,180
- Do you hear me?!
- I heard you.

294
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,760
What did you say?!

295
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,950
I heard you!

296
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,650
Since you heard me, leave.

297
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,090
- Get lost!
- Get lost!

298
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:33,390
Get lost! Hurry up, get lost!

299
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,210
How was that? Any injuries?

300
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,720
- There are no injuries.
- No injuries.

301
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,440
It wouldn't matter if there were injuries.

302
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,860
Today is great but what about tomorrow?

303
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,590
Tomorrow...

304
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,270
What? Are you scared?

305
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:06,000
There were four or five of us today
taking on one person, and that's fine.

306
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,800
But if a person is left to fight alone,
he won't be able to fight back.

307
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,750
- Then, what should we do then?
- How about we form a sect, too?

308
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,620
Everyone unites together.
As long as everyone unites together,

309
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,540
we will not be taken advantage of
by the older students, right?

310
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,830
- Right...
- Right...

311
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:27,160
What will we name our group?
Water House Sect?

312
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,120
Name it the Yan Sect.
If it wasn't for your plan today,

313
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,610
we don't know
how long we'd all be taken advantage of.

314
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,170
You will be the Sect Leader.

315
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,000
I approve.

316
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,710
What? I will be the Sect Leader?
The Yan Sect?

317
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,350
Change the name. Think it over some more.

318
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,740
Yan Sect, it is!

319
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:48,230
- Just name it Yan Sect.
- Everyone approves? - Yan Sect...!

320
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,010
From now on, Xiao Yan will be the Sect Leader.
We will unite together.

321
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,950
We will not be taken advantage of
by anyone anymore!

322
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:04,080
- Good. Yan Sect!
- Yan Sect!

323
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,900
Yan Sect!

324
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,800
Hurry.

325
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,820
Teacher Ruo Lin.

326
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:33,490
Why did all of you come so early today?

327
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,200
It's like this. We've established a sect.

328
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,680
We want to ask for your signature.

329
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,630
We've already completed the application.

330
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,580
The name "Yan" is like a warm flame,

331
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,410
warmly helping the classmates in our group.

332
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,230
The abbreviation is Yan Sect.

333
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,880
Right, the Yan Sect wants to launch
activities and events that include

334
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,470
uniting the first years
and forming an alliance with the elders

335
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,830
to help the weak students catch up with
the more advanced students.

336
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:02,170
To let everyone in the big family
that is this academy feel that warmth.

337
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:07,020
Sect Leader Xiao Yan will be the main representative
to help the classmates.

338
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,720
The Assistant Sect Leader will be Xiao Xun'er.
The backbone members will be

339
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,580
Lin Xiuya, Hu Jia, and Hao Tian.

340
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,550
We promise to affectionately unite,
learn properly,

341
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,720
- and never cause trouble to the teachers.
- Right.

342
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,330
- Please sign your name here.
- Right.

343
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,440
Xiao Yan.

344
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,380
Speak of the devil and he is here.

345
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:44,610
I went to the latrine.
Is the application form completed?

346
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:48,340
I already heard all about the matter
in the water room yesterday.

347
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:52,060
The student, Bai Cheng,

348
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,700
had been bawling for four hours under my window.
It was so noisy

349
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,980
that I could not sleep all night long.

350
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:03,890
Teacher Ruo Lin, about that matter,
it's like this.

351
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:06,320
Bai Cheng was very homesick yesterday.

352
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,690
Since childhood, his parents have been
helping him with his bathing.

353
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,760
Now that he attends the academy alone,
he isn't used to it.

354
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,680
So every time he's in the water room
or the public baths,

355
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,950
he feels sad as soon as he sees water.
He then immediately wants to cry.

356
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,920
Don't worry. Several of us

357
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,900
- already consoled him yesterday.
- Right.

358
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,370
The academy forbids students fighting in private.

359
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:29,750
When new students enter the academy, it is especially
strict about the setting up of a special interest group.

360
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,760
Concerning this matter, I can't agree casually.

361
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:42,260
Teacher Ruo Lin, I know you treat us the best.

362
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,840
Then what should we do?

363
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:50,420
Just now... Just now, all of you mentioned
having formed a special interest group.

364
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,570
What is it called again?

365
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:57,400
It's like a flame, a small group warmly
assisting other students.

366
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,850
All right.

367
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,270
Since that's the case,
all of you should keep your word.

368
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,810
As for Bai Cheng,

369
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:12,320
you must also care and unify more for him.
After all, he's your senior.

370
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,080
If ever there's any further
kind of misunderstanding between you,

371
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,980
wouldn't it be best to talk about it in the open?

372
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,090
Yes, we'll be sure to do that.

373
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,850
Also, your group's rules must have punitive measures.

374
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:26,490
We do have... Teacher, we've already prepared them.
Please, move aside. Let me.

375
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,570
Teacher, look.
These are the Yan Sect's punitive measures. Look.

376
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,590
If anyone privately fights,

377
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,880
the person responsible will be Sect Leader Xiao Yan.

378
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,560
If the facilities are damaged, the person responsible
will be Sect Leader Xiao Yan.

379
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,280
If anyone accepts bribes or

380
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,590
secretly stashes away energy talismans,
it will still be Xiao Yan.

381
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,930
No wonder you all finished writing this
and didn't show me.

382
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,520
Since the person to be held responsible is clear,

383
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,370
you must adhere to those responsibilities
if anything happens.

384
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:06,060
Understood, Student Xiao Yan?

385
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,220
Yes. Understood. I have to follow the rules.

386
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,760
- Do I sign here?
- Yes.

387
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,000
Then according to the academy's rules,

388
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,080
the academy will allow the first years
to use a room for their activities.

389
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,050
After school, all of you come to the Elder's compound
to find me and get the key.

390
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,280
Yes.

391
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,440
Great! We have our own training studio.

392
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,699
During our usual time,
we can practice our martial arts skills there.

393
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,419
- Right.
- As long as there's a room,

394
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,210
we can renovate it nicely. Money?

395
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,350
Not a problem.

396
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:39,469
Good. Remember what all of you have promised today.

397
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,330
Go for it.

398
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,800
Thank you, Teacher Ruo Lin. Thank you.

399
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,850
Thank you, Teacher Ruo Lin.

400
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:45,940
Hurry, let's go.

401
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,639
Let's go.

402
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,369
Thank you, Teacher.

403
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:14,770
Hey, bro. You are making progress again.

404
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,210
I'm doing quite fine.

405
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:18,680
In any case, I wouldn't be as humiliating as you.

406
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,990
How was I humiliating?

407
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:26,130
No. Brother, can you speak
a little more respectful towards me?

408
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,880
I was not the only one
who got tricked by those kids

409
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,090
in Black Point Region.

410
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:35,120
Besides, I was beaten by them in the water room.

411
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,320
Don't you care which group
was also humiliated by that?

412
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:42,500
In our house, you are the only highly skilled master.

413
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,870
Can you just watch me being bullied this way
and not lend a hand?

414
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
Don't you feel bad?

415
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,970
Actually, I wanted to beat him up long ago.

416
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:59,270
It's just that I haven't found the right opportunity.

417
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:04,100
Private fighting is a violation of the academy's rules.
I won't do it.

418
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:08,100
Just like you, running to the water room
and letting the first years beat you.

419
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,780
I... I'm a person who can't be humiliated.

420
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:15,270
Send a written challenge then.
Send him a written challenge!

421
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:18,410
How old am I? How old is he?
Why should I send him a written challenge?

422
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,270
Does he even match up to me?

423
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,970
No. But are you just going to watch me being beaten?

424
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:26,030
The insult to us, two brothers,
do we have to just endure it?

425
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,300
Just wait till I get an opportunity.

426
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,130
I'll beat this kid up.

427
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:51,020
Didn't you say that raising the money
wouldn't be a problem?

428
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,570
At that time, was I not just overly excited?

429
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,000
Idiot.

430
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,150
Who are you calling an idiot?

431
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,040
You!

432
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,260
Renovating this place
will require many energy talismans, right?

433
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,990
Let me tell all of you.
We can partition this place into several rooms.

434
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,810
Then, we can make a room here
for the practice of alchemy.

435
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:10,770
Over there, those who are tired can rest.

436
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,200
Over there, we can put two tea tables
where we can drink tea.

437
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,280
Moreover, I also want to have a really,
really wide and winding corridor.

438
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,140
The barren land in front

439
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,730
can be tidied up to grow flowers.

440
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,300
No matter what, we definitely need a room
for practice and cultivation.

441
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,680
Fine, then we'll have this practice and cultivation room.

442
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,460
As for those energy talismans,
we'll just have to figure it out.

443
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:37,730
But we've agreed that the Yan Sect would under no
circumstances be like the seniors who rob from other people.

444
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:41,380
I thought of something. While I was at the flea market,

445
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,160
I saw many people buying this high-level Gather Qi Medicine.

446
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,870
I studied this at home. We can make it
and then go out and sell it.

447
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:51,360
That's right. We can refine medicines to earn money.

448
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,700
All right. Quickly gather everyone together.

449
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,630
Today, marks the anniversary day
of the establishment of our Yan Sect.

450
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,390
Yes.

451
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,920
- Forget it. How could I? How could it work?
- Then...”

452
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,130
If you don't speak, who will?
You have to.

453
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,570
No. I can't.

454
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,250
You can.

455
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:13,150
If the Yan Sect's Xiao Yan won't speak,
who will?

456
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,930
Everyone, listen up.

457
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:19,590
We invited Sect Leader Xiao
to speak a few words to everyone.

458
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,370
Speak a few words.

459
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,840
Today, our Yan Sect

460
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,790
is officially establishing itself.

461
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,310
Well, since all of us don't drink alcohol,

462
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:33,430
we'll just drink some water.
Just as a gesture.

463
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:36,080
The mission of our sect is...

464
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,040
not to bully others
and to not allow others to bully us.

465
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,550
Well, since all of you want me
to be the sect's leader,

466
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,570
fine, then I'll be it.

467
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:48,150
But from now on,
all of you will have to listen to me.

468
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,730
- We'll listen to you!
- We'll listen to you!

469
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:53,150
Cheers!

470
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:18,400
In novels, don't people
who make an alliance break their bowls?

471
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,330
Aren't all of you going to break yours, too?

472
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,730
Hey, let's see how he'll be able
to have dinner tonight.

473
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,060
I feel like we can find a better place
with better Feng Shui.

474
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,400
Look, what do you think about this shop?

475
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,230
No, let's go further up front
and see what's there.

476
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,030
All right.

477
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,470
How about this pet shop?

478
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,730
This shop looks quite big.
Go and take a look, Xun'er.

479
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,360
All right.

480
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,790
- Senior.
- Yes?

481
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,850
We want to discuss something with you.

482
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,460
Not a problem. Just tell me.

483
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,690
My name is Xiao Xun'er.
We're from the Yan Sect.

484
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,960
Seeing how big your shop front is,
can you rent us half of it?

485
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,800
Which one of you is Xiao Yan?

486
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:12,780
I heard that he beat up
all the seniors in the water room.

487
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:18,900
None of us is Xiao Yan. He's currently refining medicine
and didn't have time to come.

488
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,600
Xiao Yan is even learning to make immortality pellets.

489
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:26,550
You can rent the shop front,
but did you bring enough energy talismans?

490
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:30,540
- What is the price? Senior, please state it.
- Sure.

491
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:34,100
Considering that you are first years,
I'll give you a bit of a discount.

492
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,410
For one day, 60,000.

493
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,370
- How much?
- Are you crazy?!

494
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,440
Senior, 60,000 is too expensive, isn't it?

495
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,130
Among you, who is in charge?

496
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,830
Senior, wait a minute, please.

497
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:48,090
Come over here...

498
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,430
- 60,000 is too expensive.
- What should we do?

499
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,840
None of you can haggle?

500
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,760
- No one can haggle?
- No.

501
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:06,370
Senior, 60,000 a day is really not a small amount.

502
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:09,130
How about we put a down payment first?

503
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:12,410
And we'll give you the rest later.
Will that do?

504
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:15,450
Sure. First, give me 20,000.

505
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:17,400
10,000.

506
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,810
How about 10,000?

507
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:26,200
Leave... Don't get in my way.
I'm running a business here.

508
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,100
All right. We are not renting then.
Not renting it anymore.

509
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,530
Although your place is big, the location isn't that good.
Yet, it's so expensive.

510
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,360
- We're not renting. Not renting anymore. Let's go.
- Indeed...

511
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,100
I know someone from the Department of Alchemy
who can rent us a shop front at a much cheaper rate.

512
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,390
You didn't say how much money it was earlier.

513
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:44,030
It's only several hundred energy talismans per day.
Let's go...

514
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:46,890
- It's much cheaper.
- Let's go. We're not renting. Not renting anymore.
