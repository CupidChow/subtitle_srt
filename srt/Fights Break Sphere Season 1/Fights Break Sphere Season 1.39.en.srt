3
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,200
Listen to her.

4
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,100
Come in. Take him away.

5
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,200
I-

6
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,900
- Dad.
- Don't worry about it.

7
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,600
Don't be so rough.

8
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,100
Dad!

9
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,800
- Second Uncle.
- What's going on?

10
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,600
Third Uncle, Dragon Mother
wants to capture my dad.

11
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Saying...Saying that he's dealing with the Soul Hall.

12
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,400
Dad! Dad!

13
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Xun'er, they're your own flesh and blood uncles.

14
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,200
Even if they have been confused in the past
and have had the intention to surrender in the past,

15
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,600
that doesn't necessarily mean
that they are Soul Hall's people.

16
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,700
Dad, it's been so long.

17
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,000
But you still can't see clearly?

18
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,200
Xun'er, you have been Dragon Mother
for only a few days.

19
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,800
How is it that you've already distanced yourself
so much from human relationships?

20
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,100
He is your flesh and blood uncle!

21
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,500
Okay.

22
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,900
I'll prove it to you.

23
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,200
Xun'er was reckless today.
I've already persuaded her.

24
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,300
Tomorrow, I have to leave.

25
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,600
Today, I came to say goodbye to everyone.

26
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,500
Xun'er, where are you going so urgently?

27
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,600
If I don't leave, I fear that
there will be some people who won't feel at ease.

28
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,000
You can go down.

29
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,200
Yes, Dragon Mother.

30
00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:00,350
Fourth Uncle, last night's assassin was you.

31
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,000
Second Uncle, last night,
the other person that was there,

32
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,200
was you, right?

33
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,000
The people who attacked Xun'er last night were you two?

34
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,100
Why did you do this?

35
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:06,700
Father, you're loyal
towards Second Uncle and Fourth Uncle.

36
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,520
But it might not be mutual.

37
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Truthfully, that day when
I took the Dragon cavalry to save my dad,

38
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,000
I already began to have doubts.

39
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,100
Both Uncles have been fighting in battles for a long time.
If they really intended to face the enemy,

40
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:32,300
why did they let my father face the attack alone
and the reinforcement was even unprepared?

41
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,000
Not to mention, that day
when the East Dragon Island was in crisis,

42
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,800
my father was the only person
to go down in the city.

43
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,700
Regardless of life or death,
he fought to the death against the enemy.

44
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,000
At that time,
where were Second Uncle and Fourth Uncle?

45
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,800
You were waiting for my father to die.

46
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,600
If the East Dragon Island was destroyed,
can you still be alive?

47
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,800
This is the second scroll
of Three Thousand Thunder Movement .

48
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,500
When Brother Xiao Yan entered
the Xiao family pavilion the first time,

49
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,600
the remaining scroll that he brought out was precisely
the first scroll of the Three Thousand Thunder Movement.

50
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,800
Because of this,

51
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,100
my other father, Xiao Clan Leader, almost killed him.

52
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,400
Because the second half of the Three Thousand Thunder Movement
is in the hands of the Blood Sect,

53
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,800
Clan Leader Xiao suspected
that Brother Xiao Yan will hand the first half

54
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,000
to the Blood Sect.

55
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,400
This second scroll

56
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,800
was given to me by the Dragon Mother while I was
at Thunder and Lightning Valley.

57
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,200
She said, this is what Fourth Uncle bought
to show filial respect to her.

58
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:13,000
Fourth Uncle, please explain

59
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,400
how you would have something
belonging to the Blood Sect?

60
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,800
Xun'er, I admit.

61
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,500
This was something Fan Lao gave.

62
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,400
Honestly, five years ago,

63
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,200
Fan Lao was already active in our old clan.

64
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,800
First, he instigated the other 3 islands to revolt

65
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,000
and then lastly visited our East Island.

66
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,000
I know about that. Didn't we refuse him back then?

67
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,800
My dear Third Brother, don't be too naive.

68
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,000
Do you think this matter can be so easily resolved?

69
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Let me tell you
that once the Blood Sect developed the idea,

70
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,800
they will stop at nothing to fulfill it.

71
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,800
That time, Fan Lao has aroused the wild ambitions
of the masters of the other three islands.

72
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,600
Even if we refuse,
they will just join forces to attack us.

73
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:10,500
In the end, they'll just set a new Dragon Master
and Dragon Mother in our East Island.

74
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,870
So that's why you guys made the promise?

75
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,200
We're all sensible people here.

76
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,600
We don't have any choice.

77
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:35,500
But that time, there were three very stubborn people
here in the island. Old Dragon Mother

78
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,000
and Old Dragon Master,

79
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,600
are people that would rather die than compromise.

80
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,100
The last stubborn person...

81
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,310
is you.

82
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,400
That time, the situation was very urgent.

83
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,000
To protect the East Dragon Island,
we can only come up with a scheme first

84
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,400
to agree with Fan Lao and replace Dragon Mother.

85
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,800
And then let the Dragon Masters
of the other three islands surround the city,

86
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,300
and force Old Dragon Master to give in.

87
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,800
I went to negotiate

88
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,000
and my life was put in danger
but you didn't come save me.

89
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,800
It's to eliminate me, right?

90
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Isn't that so?!

91
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,900
Forget about it.

92
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,600
Actually, we don't want it this way.
We're also thinking about the clan.

93
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,200
Fan Lao only requested us
to take a neutral position.

94
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,600
Isn't this type of demand too much?

95
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,380
If I haven't been to Thunder and Lightning Valley,

96
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,190
What you're saying, I might really believe it.

97
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,790
But Dragon Mother told me something.

98
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,000
What Fan Lao wants isn't the Gu Clan
taking a neutral position,

99
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,200
but the Di Tuo Ancient Jade of our clan.

100
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,690
She wouldn't give it, so you locked her up.

101
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,490
You then employed all kinds of scheme to pressure
my grandfather and ignored my father's safety!

102
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,270
What does this matter have to do
with the Di Tuo Ancient Jade?

103
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:18,380
If you don't want to know anything from Dragon Mother,

104
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,440
why don't you just kill her?

105
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,020
Imprisoning her

106
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,370
is because you want to know
the whereabouts of the Di Tuo Ancient Jade.

107
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,130
The ancient jade...

108
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,700
The ancient jade was actually embedeed in the bow.

109
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,920
The reason you ambushed me last night
was also because of it, right?

110
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,180
Dragon Mother instructed me

111
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,380
that the ancient jade concerns the future
of our clan and that of Fight Qi Continent.

112
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,090
Even if I die, I won't hand it out.

113
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,410
Just for this reason,

114
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,640
how many people have died.

115
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,480
Blood relatives

116
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,970
and in order to save the Gu Clan?

117
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,970
All of them are completely fake. All of you are
only interested in saving your neck.

118
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,750
I originally thought you weren't thoughtful.
In the end,

119
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,460
we adults still made you disappointed.

120
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,020
Xun'er, go, all right?

121
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:03,370
This foul place is unworthy of your stay.

122
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,950
Father, it's true I should leave,

123
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,020
but it's not because of disappointment.

124
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,620
The Ancient Jade is with me.
If I leave,

125
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,650
those evil people won't bother you anymore.

126
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,260
You're the Dragon Master of East Island.

127
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,160
I believe you’ll manage the East Island well.

128
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,180
I’m using the name of Dragon Mother

129
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,290
to sentence Second Uncle and Fourth Uncle
to life imprisonment.

130
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,330
Xun'er, if we can use the piece of jade

131
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,510
to preserve the safety of our Gu Clan,

132
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,180
then why should we risk our lives

133
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,140
or exterminate the entire clan,
to resist the Soul Hall?

134
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,750
Then, let's forget about it and surrender.

135
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,790
Hand me over and hand over the Subdue Heaven Bow, too.

136
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,870
Everyone will be safe.

137
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,140
Why...Why can't you understand

138
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,360
that the reason I'm doing these things
is for the good of the Gu Clan?

139
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,190
Surrendering to the Soul Hall
is for the good of the Gu Clan?

140
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,190
Because of fearing evil,

141
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,110
you just become an evil person?

142
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,160
Second Uncle, Fourth Uncle,

143
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,430
I really don't understand all of you.

144
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,740
I don't understand your world.

145
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:54,030
Brother Xiao Yan and I and all of you

146
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,730
are probably really people
from two different worlds, right?

147
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:05,250
All of you like to scheme, betray, slaughter,

148
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,740
and believe that the weak are prey to the strong.

149
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,240
All of you don't care about evil

150
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,990
because as long as you can achieve your goal,

151
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,570
all of you can also become evil.

152
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,570
All of you want me to accept
because evil is hard to resist

153
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:28,100
so we can only surrender. I disagree.

154
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,900
Adopting conspiracy and betrayal

155
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,180
can't obtain good results.

156
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,640
I don't believe it.

157
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,740
The Soul Hall and the Blood Sect
aren't scary at all.

158
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,180
They’ve already failed.

159
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,580
They’ll definitely fail in the future, too.

160
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,940
Senior. Senior.

161
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,750
Senior, save me!

162
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,900
Senior, please save me!

163
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,470
Senior!

164
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,500
Sect Leader.

165
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,180
I heard you have something to say to me.

166
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,800
Yes.

167
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,760
I'm listening.

168
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:23,180
I have the Ancient Jade of the Nalan Clan.

169
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,020
If Sect Leader wants it,
I’ll voluntarily offer it.

170
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,770
But I have a condition.

171
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:41,700
Staying inside the prison for several days,
you’ve learned to discuss conditions?

172
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,520
If I want to kill you,

173
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,000
it’ll just be like suffocating an ant.

174
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,550
Naturally, I understand this.

175
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:59,360
But if Sect Leader kills me,
you will have a very big loss, too.

176
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,440
I’m the Clan Leader of the Nalan family

177
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:09,320
and the Prime Minister of the empire,
whether you admit to these things or not.

178
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,600
But if I die, the Ancient Jade

179
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,020
will never be yours.

180
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,970
You're speaking sensibly.
You've matured.

181
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,410
I’m willing to listen to your condition.

182
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,310
Is my wedding day with Gu He set?

183
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:39,360
It's set. It'll be this year.

184
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,330
Then, Sect Leader,
please invite the sects from all over the world.

185
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,700
Announce that I’m
the new Sect Leader of the Cloud Mist Sect.

186
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,090
You’ll go into seclusion
to practice cultivation and refinement

187
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,650
and no longer be involved
with the matters of the Cloud Mist Sect.

188
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:58,120
This way, the Nalan family and the Cloud Mist Sect
will be bonded as one and will not request to be separated.

189
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,280
I’ll give the Ancient Jade to you.

190
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,980
Consider it as giving it
to an elder of the clan family.

191
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,820
Grandfather in the after life
will also not blame me for it.

192
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:14,190
Do you think if I announce that you become
the Sect Leader of the Cloud Mist Sect,

193
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,430
you can just command the Cloud Mist Sect?

194
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:22,030
Naturally, Yanran wouldn’t dare to dream wishfully
that I can command the Cloud Mist Sect.

195
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,410
It’s just that Yanran wants to choose

196
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,260
some outstanding and capable disciples
from the Nalan family.

197
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,040
Sect Leader, please open the door wide
and accept them to join the Cloud Mist Sect.

198
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,560
Of course,

199
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,510
my power is the power of yours, too.

200
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,640
I’m standing on your side.

201
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,090
I’m willing to rely on help from the Soul Hall.

202
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:01,640
Using the Ancient Jade to exchange
for the Cloud Mist Sect,

203
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,140
that’s indeed blackmail.

204
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,920
If Sect Leader is unwilling,
I’ll go back.

205
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,260
It's an important matter,
Sect Leader should think slowly.

206
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,360
No need to think.

207
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,270
It’s possible to do this business.

208
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,720
You choose the people.
I’ll accept the disciples.

209
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,010
The marriage matter and the ceremony
to take over the Sect Leader

210
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,960
will be done simultaneously.

211
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,430
In that case, thank you Sect Leader.

212
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:44,030
When the wedding is over,
I will offer the Ancient Jade with both hands.

213
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,870
Good.

214
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,400
I’ll just believe you this time.

215
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,550
From now on,

216
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,580
you’re my successor,

217
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,460
the young Sect Leader of the Cloud Mist Sect.

218
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,550
Servants.

219
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,540
The seclusion of the young Sect Leader is finished.

220
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,090
Help her to return and rest.

221
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,280
Young Sect Leader, please.

222
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,790
Young Sect Leader, please go.

223
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,130
Greetings, Sect Leader.

224
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,580
The day is coming soon, right?

225
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,140
That’s right.

226
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,100
Leave immediately.

227
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,160
Thinking of that brat,
I want to cut his body into ten thousand pieces.

228
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,230
You’re still not careful enough.

229
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,530
How is it my concern?

230
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:21,180
This Fa Ma is dead. Those puppets
of his are all done for. Correct?

231
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,960
I’m at the academy.
If it wasn’t for Mi Tengshan

232
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,400
and that Ruo Lin giving me trouble. I would’ve
killed Xiao Yan more than a hundred times.

233
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,580
Stop complaining, okay?

234
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,530
The matter of Xiao Yan,
Lord Fan Lao has already instructed.

235
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:39,490
That person is appointed by Lord Hun Miesheng.

236
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,990
I just can't understand.

237
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,670
What is it that this Lord Hun Miesheng wants?

238
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,510
Regarding qualification and seniority in the clan,

239
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,270
which isn’t better than him?
Whether it’s you or me,

240
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,280
aren't we more loyal than him?

241
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,660
I’m telling you. Think about it.
If this child knows

242
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,670
their family was exterminated, just wait.

243
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,980
Someone naturally will deal with Xiao Yan .

244
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,300
After returning to Jia Nan Academy this time,

245
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:14,290
destroy the Fen Tian Qi Training Pagoda
as soon as possible.

246
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:18,250
Take advantage of the chaos to deal with Mi Tengshan

247
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,300
and those elders who are disobedient.

248
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,320
Also, the students who are close to them,

249
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,710
dispose them together.

250
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:32,260
Sect Leader, please state clearly.
Do you want to take them alive or dead?

251
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:36,110
If alive, take the person.
If dead, take the soul.

252
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:40,540
There’s definitely a place for them
on the altar of Lord Hun Miesheng.

253
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,340
Understood.

254
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:11,940
Xun'er.

255
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,670
- Xun'er.
- Brother Xiao Yan. -Xiao Yan.

256
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,740
Xun'er.

257
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,850
- Xun'er. Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

258
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,140
The life pearl you gave me has cracked.

259
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,430
I thought that you're in danger.
I was going to the dragon island to look for you.

260
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,600
I'm alright. There was a little incident at home.
But everything is alright now.

261
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,240
I was going to Ta Ge'er to look for you.

262
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,760
What really happened during this period of time?

263
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,090
Your life pearl cracked a few times.

264
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,440
I have succeeded the position of Dragon Mother now.

265
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,910
You've gone through so much on your own.

266
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,350
It's so hard for you. I'm sorry.

267
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,920
Teacher Ruo Lin.

268
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,250
I met up with Teacher Ruo Lin on my way back
to Fight Qi Continent a while ago.

269
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,150
We were going to look for you.

270
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,980
Look for me?

271
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,880
That's right, Xiao Yan. Xun'er said that this was the way one
must pass through to arrive at the barren land of Ta Ge'er.

272
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,050
Imagine really meeting you here.
Come with me quickly.

273
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,580
There are many people waiting to meet you.

274
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,890
Okay.

275
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,080
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

276
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,920
Okay, okay, stop fighting, stop fighting. I have not seen you
for a while and now you dare to fight with your sect leader.

277
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,880
How many times have you caused me to be beaten up?

278
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,340
That's right. You invited Han Xian to your home
but you didn't invite the rest of us.

279
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,860
Well anyway, we've fought one another
after he came back.

280
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,990
We've already decided about this before embarking on
this trip. We'll fight you one more time when we meet you.

281
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,070
That's right.

282
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,780
When you didn't come back, the new students
of the Medicine Sect didn't get to meet you.

283
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,620
They could almost write a chronicle on Xiao Yan.

284
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,650
The main person at work
was Elder Han of Medicine Sect.

285
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,710
He was competent at publicity work.

286
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,840
Lin Xiuya.

287
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,660
You're back! Welcome back!

288
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,140
We've not met for such a long time. I trust that
you've not forgotten the brothers of Yan Sect.

289
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,500
It's not possible. Not a day passed that
I didn't wish to come back to Jia Nan Academy.

290
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,160
But I heard about you guys taking part in
the alchemist competition in the Yin City.

291
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,110
Breaking into Magical Mountain Painting,
fighting with the Old Emperor,

292
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,750
crossing the Lava River,
and going into the Villain Valley.

293
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,160
That was really advanturous and stimulating.

294
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,060
I was really envious.

295
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,180
Were you able to solve the problem
concerning your mercenary soldiers?

296
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,440
Ay... don't you know that

297
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,900
Lin Xiuya is now the leader of the most radical mercenary
group surrounding the Magical Beast Mountain Range.

298
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,510
This is a fact that no one does not know,
or get terrified of,

299
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,010
every time one talks about
warring with the mercenaries.

300
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:18,350
I, the Leader of the Medical Sect,
am nothing compare to him.

301
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,130
The situation now is critical. I'm worried
that you may be in grave danger.

302
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,890
We're in danger...?

303
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,380
Mm.

304
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,700
Let the elder of the academy explain to you.

305
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:33,510
Come, Xiao Yan and Xun'er.
Come and speak with Elder Mi Tenshan.

306
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,390
Greetings to Elder Tenshan.

307
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,860
This is Elder Qi.

308
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,360
Greetings to Elder Qi.

309
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,120
Xiao Yan, your reputation precedes you.

310
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,430
Huh.

311
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,250
Although you've returned to Wu Tan City,

312
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:56,560
we keep getting news about you even though
we are far away in Jia Nan Academy.

313
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,690
One incident after another. We had a fright
not knowing if they were real or fake.

314
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,680
I was rash in my actions.

315
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,150
Elder, Teacher, why are all of you here?

316
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:11,330
What did Lin Xiuya mean just now?

317
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,080
The Soul Hall is rising up again.

318
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,850
I know that the Soul Hall has been
plotting revenge all this while, but..

319
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:36,610
You don't understand the situation now because
you two have been out there for a long time.

320
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,890
In the past we said darkness is coming,

321
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,460
now darkness is here.

322
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,820
In the past, the Blood Sect
conducted its activities secretly.

323
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:52,690
Now, it is unbridled and unscrupulous,
devastating everything and everywhere.

324
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:57,670
Several important sects have already shut themselves in,
fearful of getting into trouble.

325
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,730
Members of the Blood Sect

326
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:04,300
are found near the Academy,
challenging the seal of the Fight God.

327
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,560
Why are there so many Blood Sect members?
Isn't there anyone controlling them?

328
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,490
Part of them are the direct power of the Blood Sect.

329
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:24,720
Another group are the renegades
who had consumed their blood.

330
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,290
This power is getting stronger,
spreading like a plague.

331
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,160
The Five Great Clans

332
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,810
have been unable to rise again after the set back,
all scattered in different direction.

333
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:40,180
The emergence of the Soul Hall is now totally
and completely successful.

334
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,360
It's not a wonder then.

335
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,120
What are you wondering about?

336
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,840
No wonder Hun Miesheng was in such a hurry
to collect the Di Tuo Anciet Jade of the Five Tribes.

337
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,540
He must be ready with his preparations
to attack the Fight Qi Continent.

338
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,240
You are the bloodline of the Xiao family.

339
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,720
Xun'er is the Dragon Mother. I'm sure they have
observed all this from the start.

340
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,950
So, the Elders of the Academy have decided to

341
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,260
bring the two of you back to the Academy first.

342
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,860
We have, after all, the Seal of the Fight God
to defend us for the time being.

343
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,680
For this reason, the Academy has sent out seven elders,

344
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,640
fourteen stuents, all going in three directions

345
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,350
to search for you in different places.

346
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,730
Thank you, Elders, for your kindness.

347
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,170
But I wish to make a trip home first.

348
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,870
I had a slight misunderstanding with my family
before I came out.

349
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,980
I don't have any peace of mind all this while.

350
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,610
And the whereabouts of my two brothers who are
mercenaries in the Ta Ge'er Desert remains unknown.

351
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,860
I'm worried about all these.

352
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:54,260
But to go back now..
it is not a good timing.

353
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:59,770
Xiao family is a large family. It will have its own ways
of protecting itself that outsiders are unaware of.

354
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:05,230
But instead, you are all alone by yourself.
You are too obvious a target.

355
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:10,000
You should go back to the Academy first,
and quietly observe any changes in the situation,

356
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,700
so that you can make your plans for the future.

357
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,370
That's right, Brother Xiao Yan.
Father was still angry when you left.

358
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:20,170
Let's wait a little while more, and we can go back
when Father is not angry anymore.

359
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:27,370
Okay. Then we'll go back to the Academy first
and see how things go from there.

360
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:31,380
Time is of the essence.
Let's separate and go three ways.

361
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,170
Han Xian and Hu Jia follow me.

362
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:37,950
Lin Xinya and Hao Tian will follow Elder Qi.

363
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:42,130
Xiao Yan and Xun'er,
the two of you follow Elder Tenshen.

364
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,600
Will Senior be pleased to direct me?

365
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:17,770
You're now the Young Sect Lader. There's no
need for you to bestow greeting on me like this.

366
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:24,150
All of us following the Lader of Cloud Mist Sect
are to obey the Young Sect Leader.

367
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:28,340
This is entirely due to your help.

368
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:33,420
What other matters do you know
about the Sect Leader?

369
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:38,100
Why did you tell me
that Xiao Zhan is imprisoned in dungeon?

370
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,050
You said you were the one who dreamt of this before me.

371
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,800
What happened after that?

372
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:50,250
Practise your sword skills well. Didn't you learn
your lesson from the time you spent in the dungeon?

373
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,170
I'm a really stupid person.

374
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:59,390
I'm just beginning to understand the principle that one may
still not gain self awareness after going through hardships.

375
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,820
What do you understand?

376
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:08,390
You'll die sooner if you know more.
I'm being kind.

377
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,080
Being kind?

378
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:21,260
You had me under your control
these last few days.

379
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,570
If I'd perished in the dungeon,

380
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:26,160
you'd not have shed a tear.

381
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,300
Sect Leader is right.

382
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,550
The dungeon is really a good place
to ponder our problems.

383
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,330
What do you mean?

384
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,320
Tell me everything that you know.

385
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,120
Or else, I'll ask the Sect Leader

386
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,950
why my dear Senior Yun Yun

387
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:49,160
is privy to so many secrets.

388
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,890
You're really a poisonous snake,

389
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:01,570
one bite from you is fatal.

390
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:04,300
I must know more about all these.

391
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,610
I gambled my life on it

392
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:11,050
And I want to come out of it alive.

393
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:14,960
The Nalan family wants to be alive too.

394
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,110
To the back mountain.

395
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,710
Good. Senior’s sword skill is really fast.

396
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:28,120
You can ask me after you beat me.
Receive my sword first.

397
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:32,860
You... you...

398
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:38,200
This Night Fighting in All Directions
was passed on to me by the Sect Leader.

399
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,360
You were secretly practicing?

400
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,700
It turns out that your Fight Technique is very good.

401
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,430
You hid it really well.

402
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,190
This is the Fight Technique that’s been handed down
in the Nalan family.

403
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,200
Roaming Dragon Palm.

404
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,680
Every time we practiced the sword skills,
you deliberately lost to me.

405
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,650
Surprisingly, it’s been going on for so long
and I didn’t find out about it.

406
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,920
You hid it really well.

407
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,120
I had to be careful.

408
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,490
Before Grandfather died,
he passed on all his Fight Qi cultivation,

409
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,610
Fight Techniques, and Martial Arts Skills to me.

410
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,360
With your inner power, even if you were
to practice ten years, you still can't rival me.

411
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,770
Senior, you better speak truthfully.

412
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:26,940
The appearance is beautiful like a flower.
Yet, it’s like a snake. The heart is of a scorpion.

413
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,130
These words describe you perfectly.

414
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:32,320
Senior, you flatter me.

415
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,030
I’ve been the Young Sect Leader.

416
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:48,930
I was originally the Zhu slave of an aristocratic family.
I’ve lived by the coast since childhood.

417
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:52,790
My parents went out to the sea to collect pearls
and gave them to the royal family of the empire.

418
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:55,310
This is the skill that has been passed down
from generation to generation.

419
00:37:55,950 --> 00:38:00,930
Afterwards, a group of bandits killed my parents

420
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:04,020
and took me away.
They forced me to go beg on the streets.

421
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:08,830
It was Sect Leader...
It was Sect Leader who appeared and saved me.

422
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:12,160
He accepted me as a disciple and passed on
the martial arts skills of the Cloud Mist Sect.

423
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,720
I swore that I would repay him.

424
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:19,420
That’s why I’d go to the ends of the earth
to find the treasure for him.

425
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:29,130
Really? Either Senior has an especially effective nose or...

426
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:34,680
I can hold my breath underwater for five days
and use fish and shrimp as food.

427
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,770
I can live together with a magical beast
inside the same confinement.

428
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,590
In the Magical Beast Mountain Range, I have entered
the place where the Fight God practiced his qi.

429
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:47,730
I’ve searched countless
pellet medicines for Sect Leader.

430
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:51,510
Once, I went down the ocean in the extreme north

431
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:55,930
to steal a sharp military weapon for him
and was almost killed by the Blood Sect.

432
00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:00,580
At that time, he promised me right away to let me
become the Sect Leader and be married to Gu He.

433
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,280
I was extremely happy at the time.

434
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,560
I had always previously thought that the words
of Sect Leader had enormous weight.

435
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:13,220
So, I sacrificed my life even more
to find the treasure for him.

436
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,720
Then what did Sect Leader say to you afterwards?

437
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,350
Afterwards, didn’t he accept you as a disciple?

438
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:29,810
He thinks your value is more useful than me.

439
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:32,540
Therefore, he discarded me right away.

440
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:36,670
I originally thought that
as long as I find a better treasure,

441
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:40,210
then I still have a gleam of hope,
but I was wrong.

442
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:45,210
He has never truly treated me as a successor.
In front of him,

443
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:49,500
I'll never be his successor.

444
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,480
I’m only a dog looking for treasures for him.

445
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,540
How can I be on the same level as you
for the Sect Leader position?

446
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,980
I was indeed angry.

447
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,950
I just want to incite you to fight with him
and let him be sad.

448
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:07,350
Never thought that you are also a little fox
that would trick him.

449
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,000
This way is good, too.

450
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,630
I don't get it.

451
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,050
What don't you understand?

452
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:18,160
Since Sect Leader used and insulted you like this,
why didn't you leave?

453
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,710
You're here everyday accompanying the disciples
of Cloud Mist Sect to train their swords,

454
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:25,570
watching them surpassing you step by step.
Don't you feel tormented?

455
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,480
Do you understand now?

456
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,230
I'm now a member of Blood Sect.

457
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:50,020
My life and death is not mine to decide.

458
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,830
Where else can I escape to?

459
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,420
A wicked person will be taken care of
by another wicked person.

460
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:07,010
With a little fox like you,
this act has become interesting.

461
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,730
Young Sect Leader, don't worry.
I will not tell anyone

462
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:35,640

463
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,990
♫ If you want change, battle it out with no fear of chaos ♫

464
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:56,750
♫ The sky is dark, there’s misery on earth,
the people are living in a terrible state ♫

465
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,580
♫ Constant hatred and bitter attachment become evident ♫

466
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,370
♫ In this lifetime, you will see your feat
such as has been tempered with fire ♫

467
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:05,140
♫ Confide in me your aspiration, that constant dream
in your heart that’s difficult to fulfill ♫

468
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,920
♫ To fulfill my promise,
I conceal an arrow inside my gold-threaded sleeve ♫

469
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,740
♫ Being mesmerized for a moment
by the purgatory and the lava ♫

470
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:16,720
♫ Jumping in with a leap with
neither grace nor resentment ♫

471
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,450
♫ Young but bothered by undiminishing worries ♫

472
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:25,070
♫ Worries adding on to worries,
the mountain calls and the sea roars ♫

473
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,860
♫ Rushing headlong even if
heaven is narrow and earth is small ♫

474
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,650
♫ Chaos in fighting the evil and foreign forces ♫

475
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:36,780
♫ Disturbances that no one can escape from ♫

476
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:40,060
♫ Disadvantaged but don’t belittle or take advantage ♫

477
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,180
♫ of the young ♫

478
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,010

479
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:48,380
♫ or titles ♫

480
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:51,700
♫ On the board of notables ♫

481
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,280
♫ I’ll showcase my martial arts skills ♫

482
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,190

484
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,280
♫ Proud and aloof, holding a heavy sword in one hand ♫
