3
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,320
If this matter really has any connection with me,

4
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,740
why would I come here
just to give her the antidote?

5
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,690
That's true.

6
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,010
She is still not deeply poisoned.
It must have happened just a while ago.

7
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,340
If it wasn't done by our students,

8
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,110
is there an outsider here?

9
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,330
Could it be... the girl that Cloud Mist Sect
is currently looking for?

10
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,040
Earlier, there were students who said
they saw a girl wandering in the woods.

11
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,160
She seemed to behave crazily.
Maybe she did this.

12
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,540
Is everyone here?

13
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,220
You faked it pretty well.

14
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,790
No one can find out about this.

15
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,140
Lin Xiuya is leaving.

16
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,220
I...

17
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,790
I won't be going back with all of you.

18
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,730
What happened?

19
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,830
Earlier, my family member came to look for me
and told me about my uncle.

20
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,940
He's the chief of the Bloody War Mercenary Army.

21
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,620
He was killed a few days ago.

22
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,290
Now the crew has no leader
and is having internal conflicts.

23
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,960
My uncle's subordinate found out that
I was in the Magical Beast Mountain Range

24
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,530
and was hoping that I could come back

25
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,990
to inherit the leader position.

26
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,360
You are going to inherit the Mercenary Army?

27
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,100
Are you leaving right away?

28
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,560
I was raised by my uncle.

29
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,780
He was my parent.

30
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,780
I have to find the killer

31
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,980
and seek revenge for him.

32
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,960
Then what about the teacher?
What did she say?

33
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,360
Teacher Ruo Lin has approved.
I can take some time off.

34
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,870
Then, will you return to the Jia Nan Academy?

35
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,050
Maybe it will take some time. But when I'm done
taking care of the matters in my family,

36
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,340
I will definitely come back.

37
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,800
Good. Then take care when you go back.

38
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,400
If you need any help, let me know any time.

39
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,220
I will.

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,560
Should you have to fight while outside, don't you dare lose!
Don't humiliate us, the Yan Sect.

41
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,190
I know.

42
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,200
When you get rich, don't forget us.

43
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,220
Then return as soon as possible.
We will wait for your return.

44
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,790
The Yan Sect will win!

46

[Jia Nan Academy]

47
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,800
Quick...

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,510
Come in quick! Everything's fine. The way you are looking
is making it seem like something's wrong.

49
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,280
Be careful.

50
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,800
Almost suffocated to death in there.

51
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,120
Are you a little bloated?

52
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,300
This is how a body suffering from an internal poison looks
like. I haven't been bitten for days by any poisonous bugs.

53
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,770
If I have no poison in my body,
I will be dead very soon.

54
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,730
No, you won't die.

55
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,860
I promise I will cure your body of its internal poison.

56
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,390
Remember our deal?

57
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,320
Of course, I remember.

58
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,370
Husband, I will listen to you.

59
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,400
I will stay away from poison bugs and will not inject
myself with any more poison needles.

60
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
I will also stay in this box obediently.

61
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,760
Rest assured. Even if I were to die,
I will still listen to you.

62
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,580
Quick...

63
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,930
Hide well.

64
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,020
Quickly!

65
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,450
Xun'er let me bring a set of blankets here.

66
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,130
Don't you know how to utter any sound
when you knock? I was almost scared to death.

67
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,950
Coward.

68
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,390
Where is my sister-in-law?

69
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,490
I'm in here!

70
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,460
A rod is the ancestor of all weapons.

71
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,620
A spear is the king of all weapons.

72
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,660
This is how you use the soft whip of a spear.

73
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,930
This is the protruding piercer.

74
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,260
The key point is to blend
your Fight Qi energy within your spear.

75
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,560
The changes of the spear's shadow are unimaginable.

76
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,620
Medicine Elder! Medicine Elder! I'm in trouble!

77
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,190
How do you cure a body distressed from a poison within it?

78
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:51,650
One, tighten the eyebrows together.
Two, tighten the heart.

79
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:58,740
Three, tighten the navel.
Four, tighten the genitalia.

80
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:05,030
Five, tighten the knees and six,
the feet to lightly touch.

81
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:12,410
Seven, tighten the shoulders and the neck;
separately, first the left and then the right.

82
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,790
This mnemonic chant, everyone...

83
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,810
Xiao Yan.

84
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,200
Xiao Yan?

85
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,660
Xiao Yan!

86
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,590
Do you hear me?

87
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,250
Falling asleep in my class?

88
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,240
Is my class so boring?

89
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,920
Teacher, he has a toothache today.

90
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,980
Come. Show us some moves.

91
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,660
Your Fight Qi skills have improved drastically.

92
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,190
Don't try to hide it.

93
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,620
Soft whip move!

94
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,170
The protruding piercer.

95
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,230
Xiao Yan.

96
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,790
Let me teach you a few moves.

97
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,610
Don't you move. My Fight Qi energy hasn't returned.

98
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,840
If I pierce a hole in your neck, don't blame me.

99
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,730
Elder Ge's spear skills are amazing!
Let's give him a round of applause.

100
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,680
Everyone, listen carefully!
Next time, when you are in my class,

101
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,030
no one is allowed to fall asleep!

102
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,910
Class dismissed!

103
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,330
Brother Xiao Yan, are you all right?

104
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,450
Why did you pick Ge Ye's class to be absentminded?
He has never liked you.

105
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,540
I was thinking about a way to save Little Medicine Fairy.

106
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,200
The poison within her is very toxic
and it's flaring up. She will be dead soon.

107
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,200
You aren't really interested in her, are you?

108
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,200
What? Jealous?

109
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,190
It's a good deed to save a life.
So, where is she right now?

110
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,090
We hid her in a very safe place.

111
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,380
After I have cured her sickness,
I will send her home.

112
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,400
What? You got in a fight with Ge Ye?

113
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,100
I didn't start it; he wanted to pick a fight with me.

114
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,800
Xiao Yan, next time when you are in Ge Ye's class,
can you not be absentminded?

115
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,300
I was so nervous beside you.

116
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,800
Little Medicine Fairy. Little Medicine Fairy!

117
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,000
Little Medicine Fairy!

118
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,500
Come.

119
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,000
Little Medicine Fairy. Little Medicine Fairy.

120
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,100
Husband, I fell alseep again.

121
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,200
I don't know why.

122
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,400
Recently, I get so sleepy.

123
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,600
Come, drink some water.

124
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,600
Take this medicine; protect your heart pulse first.

125
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,100
Come.

126
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,100
Please rest assured. I have already found a way
to treat your body's distress with the poison within.

127
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,400
I will definitely cure you.

128
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,500
I won't let you suffer the pain
of having poisonous bugs bite you.

129
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,290
I believe in you, Husband.

130
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,100
Little Medicine Fairy.

131
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,600
The sickness of a body that's suffering from
an internal poison born within it, is not treatable.

132
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,300
The body has to depend on poison as its food.

133
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,600
How long has it been since we got back
from the Magical Beast Mountain Range?

134
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,000
Ten days? Nine days?

135
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
If she can't get some new poison into her body,
she will go crazy and die.

136
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,060
What do you mean?

137
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,800
Do we send her back
to the Magical Beast Mountain Range then?

138
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,400
You really can't tell. She's indeed suitable to stay there.

139
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,100
She is a person, not a magical beast!

140
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,300
Calm down. Look at you,
all day you've been absentminded.

141
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,300
But have you found a way yet?

142
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,500
I have already found the formula,

143
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,000
but I was distracted by Ge Ye.

144
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,700
Even if you found the medicinal formula, in this world,
whether anyone can cure a sickness like this,

145
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,000
no one knows.
Whether your formula will work or not, it's hard to tell.

146
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It will work. I will definitely be able to cure her.

147
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
If you don't want to help,
stop talking sarcastically.

148
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,600
I want her to be treated as much as you do!

149
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,500
But this is how her body works.

150
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Stop your wishful thinking, okay?

151
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,200
Okay... Stop arguing.

152
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,000
What about this? You keep looking for the formula.

153
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
We will go up the mountain to find
some poisonous snakes and scorpions,

154
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,700
to first let her have something to keep her alive.

155
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,700
As for the medicinal formula,
you'll have more time to work on it.

156
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,140
This plan should be workable.

157
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,400
I have one more unpleasant thing to say.
Do you want to hear it?

158
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,800
Speak.

159
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,700
Jia Nan Academy was blessed by the Fight God.

160
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,400
It is where the Spiritual Qi loves to gather
and it won't tolerate any poisonous element.

161
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,200
All of you, if you can find any poisonous snakes,

162
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,600
the Fight God will come back alive
from his grave to apologize to all.

163
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,000
You watch her well. I will go find the medicinal formula.

164
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,800
He is meditating again!

165
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,700
It's just like when we were fighting with Bai Shan.
Exactly the same.

166
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,700
Xiao Yan, take a look!

167
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,000
It's over, over...! I told you!

168
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,700
Little Medicine Fairy! Little Medicine Fairy.

169
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,400
Poisonous snakes. Poisonous snakes...

170
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,700
There are poisonous snakes in Gu He's pellet room.

171
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:36,399
I found one poisonous snake!

172
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
Quick, try giving it to her.

173
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,300
Let's go out.

174
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,200
Husband, I dreamed that we were
in the Magical Beast Mountain Range.

175
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,200
Let's go back.

176
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,300
I don't want this.

177
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,200
If you don't have this, you will die for sure!

178
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,800
After all, you don't like me
and you have been ignoring me.

179
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,200
I might as well die in the mountains.

180
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,600
Why did I bother to come here?

181
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,010
Stop talking nonsense.

182
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,400
Let's treat your sickness first.

183
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,700
The matters about the future, we will discuss in the future.
Is that all right?

184
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,700
Actually, I know you are just comforting me.

185
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,800
You don't want to be my husband at all.

186
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,300
You are just like my father.

187
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:32,100
You dislike me from the bottom of the heart
and think I'm troublesome.

188
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,960
Little Medicine Fairy, don't say that.

189
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,390
You are not a beast.

190
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,760
You shouldn't live in the Magical Beast Mountain Range.

191
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,100
Then do you agree that I may call you, Husband?

192
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,600
Husband, I owe you my life.

193
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,300
As long as you can stay alive.

194
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,100
You can call me anything.

195
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,390
You are such a nice person.

196
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,730
[Jia Nan Academy]

197
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,700
Such a matter is really hard to deal with.

198
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,400
Yes.

199
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,200
Every year there are some weird matters,
but this year, we have too many.

200
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,300
- What happened? - Earlier, I was refining some
pellet medicine and needed to extract some snake poison.

201
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,400
But the snakes that I have been feeding
for many years had no poison at all.

202
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,700
Don't you think that's strange?

203
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,800
How could something like that happen?

204
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,500
Yes. They are all extremely poisonous snakes
I caught in the Magical Beast Mountain Range.

205
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,600
-There are thieves who have infiltrated the academy.
-Who is it?

206
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,400
Elder Mi just said,

207
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,000
that the Cloud Mist Sect just informed us,

208
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,400
that the person who killed several of their disciples
in the Magical Beast Mountain Range,

209
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,000
was that girl known as Little Witch
and is perhaps here in our academy.

210
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,300
Little Witch?

211
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,100
That it's the girl who was with a lion.

212
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,200
Moreover, her body is distressed from poison within
and so she needs to have a lot of poison every day.

213
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,100
I guess then it was stolen by her.

214
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,300
Yun Shan is getting more and more disrespectful.

215
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,900
I have already rejected him.

216
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,800
Unexpectedly, he used
Chu Yun Empire's State Teacher, Fa Ma,

217
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,700
to challenge us.

218
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,900
It will be good to do some investigating.
Perhaps we may even find the accomplice.

219
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,200
Ruo Lin, come with me.

220
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,200
Teacher Han Feng, do you still have any classes?

221
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,000
Later.

222
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,380
I'll leave now.

223
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,600
Elder Han, you were staring at me
yesterday throughout the class.

224
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,700
Do you want me to...

225
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:24,300
No rush, there are many matters for us to discuss slowly.

226
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,000
All right...

227
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:40,240
Elder Tengshan, are you looking for me?

228
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:45,380
I heard that your trip to
the Magical Beast Mountain Range was quite fun.

229
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,730
If I had known, I would have gone with all of you.

230
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,720
We hunted for an Immortal Bug.

231
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,970
And got this one good piece.

232
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,510
It's quite nice.

233
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:03,940
Later, I will teach you the formula of the Longevity Pellet,
and using this will be just right.

234
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,620
Thanks a lot, Elder Tengshan.

235
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,940
You still won't tell me the truth?

236
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,730
You brought back something else, didn't you?

237
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,450
I didn't.

238
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:23,510
Cloud Mist Sect has sent us a pigeon message
and the Sect Leader Yun Shan personally wrote to me.

239
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:27,220
He said he will come to our Jia Nan Academy
to look for a Little Witch.

240
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,570
Cloud Mist Sect.

241
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,820
Their hands are everywhere.

242
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,730
Even extending into Jia Nan Academy.

243
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,880
Cloud Mist Sect lost quite a number of people.

244
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,220
That's because they deserved it.

245
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,180
Those who go to the Magical Beast Mountain Range,

246
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,090
how many of them are not evil people?

247
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,090
I told you before.

248
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,800
An innocent person can be burdened
with his hidden talents.

249
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,630
When someone has the skills,

250
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:56,390
when a magical beast has the magic crystal,
then trouble follows.

251
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:03,600
Cloud Mist Sect is one of our sponsors and they even
dragged Chu Yun Empire's State Teacher, Fa Ma, into this.

252
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,270
I can't say no anymore.

253
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,800
You have the girl here, right?

254
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:22,510
- Yes.
- If she is found by them, we will be in serious trouble.

255
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,370
What do you want to do?

256
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,410
You want an honest answer?

257
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,540
Of course.

258
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,690
Then we will fight them.
This girl did nothing wrong.

259
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:41,570
Cloud Mist Sect's interest in the Amethyst Winged
Lion King's magic crystal is why they were killed.

260
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,360
They should not have transferred
what was their fault and blamed it on others.

261
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,410
Also, they were taking advantage of one little girl
as a group. That was shameless.

262
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,830
You alone can't fight them all.

263
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:54,070
It's not possible for Jia Nan Academy
to support you either.

264
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,780
But I still need to fight.

265
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,280
Then prepare yourself well.

266
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,660
Cloud Mist Sect's people do mean what they say.

267
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:24,620
Xiao Yan, come, let's have a good conversation.

268
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,380
What did you do to her?

269
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,160
She can't move and she can't speak.

270
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,030
Later, when I hand her over
to Sect Elder Yun Shan, I need her to be alive.

271
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,930
Don't move. Don't move! All right?

272
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,000
Your Fight Qi ranking is too low.

273
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,160
Why do you want to make me beat you up first

274
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,120
and then have a conversation?

275
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,440
How did you find your way into my room?

276
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,150
Oh! That's a long story. Listen carefully.

277
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,050
Miss Nalan, from our family,

278
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:58,220
when she came out of the Magical Beast Mountain Range,
she was shot by a needle.

279
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,200
And that needle that was shot,
was a lethally poisonous one.

280
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,000
Luckily, Elder Han was there.

281
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,130
He acted according to the circumstance;
otherwise, Miss Nalan would be dead by now.

282
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,380
But, I have questioned Miss Nalan meticulously.

283
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,020
I asked her, "Who have you seen?"

284
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,800
She said when she left, the only one she saw was you.
But you don't know how to use secret weapons.

285
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,490
Besides, this Grand Old Sect Leader Yun Shan...

286
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,660
He got someone to thoroughly investigate it.

287
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,490
The Amethyst Winged Lion King is already dead.

288
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,540
But... the scent of that Companion Amethyst Source is

289
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,330
here, hidden inside our Jia Nan Academy.

290
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,490
Especially on this girl.

291
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,920
In conclusion, when I connect the clues all together,

292
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,880
I understand fully. So, this is it.

293
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,880
It's on you.

294
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,370
What about that?

295
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,220
- I'm so impressed...
- That's for sure.

296
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,080
Elder Ge Ye, your analysis is indeed amazing.

297
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,120
I only have one question.

298
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,420
I'm not sure about the chain of events.

299
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:59,830
Did you figure it out yourself
or did someone else figure it out for you?

300
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,930
This... it was Elder Han who figured it out with me.

301
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,270
Then, why didn't he come here himself?

302
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:10,760
This... Why do you ask so much?

303
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,310
Quickly, hand over the stuff and it'll be fine.

304
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,200
There's something I don't understand.

305
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,010
The Companion Amethyst Source...
Do I give it to you or...

306
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,630
do I give it to the Cloud Mist Sect
Grand Old Master Yun Shan?

307
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:26,690
This... Actually, Cloud Mist Sect Grand Old Master
Yun Shan wants this child's life.

308
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,760
But, on her body, I couldn't find

309
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,250
the Companion Amethyst Source.
So I believe it must be on you.

310
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,390
What? What else are you thinking about?
I'm telling you to hand it over quickly.

311
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,450
After that, I will abolish your Fight Qi skills
and expel you from this school.

312
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,260
How about that? Isn't that a sweet deal?

313
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,440
How could it be a sweet deal?
I would end up with neither the person nor the treasure.

314
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,420
I won't do it.

315
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,760
When is it about whether you would like it or not?
Don't argue with your teacher!

316
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,680
I ask you to hand it over and you just do it.
It's confiscated. Understand?

317
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,820
Does Yun Shan know that you are planning to take
the Companion Amethyst Source privately for yourself?

318
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,370
I have figured it out.

319
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:12,550
If I really can't do that,
I will just kill you to silence you.

320
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:17,020
But if you kill me to silence me, how will you know
where the Companion Amethyst Source is?

321
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,540
Then I will kill this girl to silence her.

322
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,680
If you kill her to silence her, what will you do
when Yun Shan finds out about it?

323
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,530
Yun— Why do you keep mentioning Yun Shan?

324
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,290
Do you really think I am afraid of that old jerk Yun Shan?

325
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:36,530
The multicolored Cloud Mist and the Five Sacred Mountains,
a subject is here to meet the chief!

326
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:39,870
I'm Yun Yun, a disciple from the Cloud Mist Sect. Greetings!

327
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:43,830
That... Earlier, I wasn't cursing Grand Old Master
as an old jerk. I was—

328
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,920
Elder Ge Ye!

329
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,600
That... What happened was...
I was just spouting nonsense earlier.

330
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,010
- It's fine.
- Please don't mind it.

331
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,540
Husband.

332
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,490
It's fine. I'm here. Don't be afraid.

333
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,590
Lad?

334
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,680
Did you find the item that you wanted?

335
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,460
I'm here by the order of our Sect Leader

336
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,090
to capture her.

337
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:19,420
There are so many of you here
trying to bully a little girl.

338
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,320
Your Cloud Mist Sect is really shameless.

339
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,690
Little girl?

340
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,670
She killed six juniors of mine
and you call her "a little girl?"

341
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,320
Instead, I feel that she's a little demon.

342
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,710
She has no connection with you, right?
Please move aside.

343
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,040
He's my husband.

344
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:43,290
Elder Hai, no matter here is related to you.
If you're here to be a spectator,

345
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,850
please stand a bit farther away.

346
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,150
Oh, my. Just because there's a fight,
I've become Elder Hai?

347
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:50,160
Don't worry, old man.
I won't attack you sneakily behind your back.

348
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,190
Hai Bodong, is any matter here related to you?

349
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:59,250
My relationship with the Xiao Family, as compared to you,
only lacks one granddaughter. Stop with your nonsense.

350
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:05,930
Young fellow, you've grown-up.

351
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,220
Ice... Ice Emperor?

352
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,420
Father.

353
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,700
Father?!

354
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,290
Ice-Ice Emperor is...

355
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:22,030
The Ice Emperor is your father?

356
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:28,350
Excuse me, Elder. She's the person
who is wanted by my Sect Leader.

357
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,890
Tell Yun Shan to put all the tallies for the people
that my daughter killed on me.

358
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,580
Teacher Ruo Lin, my sect leader
has written a letter to the academy.

359
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,210
The academy has also agreed to let us take her.

360
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,810
The academy has indeed agreed to let you take the person.

361
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:52,380
As for whether you're able to take her away or not,
that's not a decision I can make.

362
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,720
You—

363
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,960
I'll shout from 1 to 3. All of you must leave immediately!

364
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,030
One! Two!

365
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,660
Also, I'll have to ask both the teachers to go back

366
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,590
and convey a message of "thank you"
to Elder Mi on my behalf.

367
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,950
Yes. Fine. This...

368
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,830
Elder Ge, let's go.

369
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,870
Do we just leave like this?

370
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,640
I gave Ge Ye a shot with my needle earlier.
He surely will die in a tragic way.

371
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,020
That's enough!

372
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:41,050
You... You've been gone from home for a year.
Are you a ghost without a home?

373
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:44,180
Do you know how many people
I've sent out to find you?

374
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,740
Temperamental. Willful.

375
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,560
Just a word and you left! Tell me, in this world,

376
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,620
other than me, who else can take care of you?

377
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,140
There's also my husband!

378
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,760
Young Medicine Fairy is a good lady.

379
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,870
This... I...

380
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,410
Really?!

381
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:07,320
I just knew it! The Xiao Clan is so dependable!

382
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,590
Son-in-law, please accept a bow from your father-in-law.

383
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:12,820
You mustn't...! Look, you're my father's friend.

384
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:17,300
Elder, at that time, I did that just
to save Little Medicine Fairy. It's not for real.

385
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,240
That... My father doesn't even know about this matter yet.

386
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,580
My father doesn't know about our matter yet.

387
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,260
I'll handle your father.

388
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,970
Don't look at this lady always arguing with me.
She's my beloved daughter .

389
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:33,220
As long as you treat her well,
you can ask me for anything.

390
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,050
Quickly say it. What do you want?

391
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,260
Just treat her well from now on.
Stop shouting at her.

392
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,660
Don't drive her out of your house either.

393
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,650
That's not a problem. Don't worry.

394
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:52,120
From now on, if I say any harsh words to my daughter,
I'm not a human anymore.

395
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:57,060
Daughter, the most correct thing
you've done in your life is this.

396
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,790
I surrender to you. Son-in-law,
come out and have some drinks with me.

397
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:04,900
I'll not be afraid even if you let me drink 2 jins.
[1 jin equals 500 grams]

398
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,170
Elder Hai, how about this? Take her home first.

399
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:11,050
I still have to attend classes here.

400
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:14,780
Once I'm free, I'll visit you.

401
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,750
Son-in-law's studying is serious business.
Let's just wait for him at home.

402
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,930
Come... Let's go...

403
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,170
I've given you the Companion Amethyst Source

404
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:46,360
and the Lion King's Beast Flame to you.

405
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,590
Keep them well.

406
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,490
Remember to think of me.

407
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,280
Let's go, let's go...

408
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,730
You said that you'll visit me!
You mustn't go back on your words!

409
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:15,980
- Let's go. Hurry.
- All right.

410
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,380
You must visit me!

411
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,500
Where's the Little Witch?

412
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:09,900
Let me tell you. The minute I went outside,
she shot me with a needle

413
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,200
that caused me to be poisoned all over.

414
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,000
Where is she?

415
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,400
Little Witch?

416
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,000
She just left with her father.

417
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,600
If you go after her now,
you might still be able to catch her.

418
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,200
Sure. Sure.

419
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,100
Hold on. Do you have the antidote?

420
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,600
Antidote?

421
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,100
You wanted to kill me to silence me.
Would I still give you the antidote?

422
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,500
Go find Elder Gu He instead.

423
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,030
Elder Gu He isn’t here.

424
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,200
Let's do this.

425
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,600
In the future... In the future when we are in class,
I will hit you a few times less.

426
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,200
All right?

427
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Xiao Yan! Student, why are you messing with me in this way?

428
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,800
Naughty! Hurry...!

429
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,650
Don’t give your teacher any more trouble.

430
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:00,000
Hurry and take out the antidote!

431
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,300
The academy is so big and there are so many capable people.

432
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,800
Why do you have to look for me?

433
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,400
I...

434
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,700
Let me explain it to you.

435
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:14,700
You... Aren’t you interested in our Miss Nalan?

436
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:18,580
I-I will help you to c-communicate with her.

437
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,600
Communicate...

438
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,600
- That should be fine, right?
- Communicate?

439
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,400
What are you blabbering about?
Who has any relationship with Nalan?

440
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,000
This medicine...

441
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,600
Indeed. I did refine an extra one.

442
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
St-Stop messing around.

443
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,300
Hurry-Hurry up and give me the antidote.
Let me ask you, the medicine...

444
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,300
This is very lethal.

445
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,900
Elder Ge, this antidote, I will surely give it to you.

446
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,700
But I'm giving you the medicine
not because I’m afraid of you.

447
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,300
It’s because I want to thank you.

448
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,400
- I want to thank you for beating me up during our classes.
- That's great.

449
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,600
- Thank you for making me strive harder.
- Yes. - And one more thing.

450
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,100
- One shouldn't be too greedy.
- Right...

451
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,800
- We should know when to stop.
- Yes.

452
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,500
- We mustn't be disrespectful to our elders, right?
- Yes. - Look at that Han Feng!

453
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,000
- Why does he keep using you as his spear?
- Indeed. Indeed so.

454
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,280
From now on,

455
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,500
- you shouldn't act before any solid evidence.
- Yes...

456
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,200
- A middle-aged man shouldn't be so impulsive.
- Right...

457
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,600
Yes... Go now...

458
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,900
The antidote—

459
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,200
I'm all right now...

460
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,800
Medicine Elder!

461
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,900
Medicine Elder, you're awake!

462
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,100
I initially wanted to sleep a little longer,
but the heat of the Companion Amethyst Source woke me up.

463
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,200
I just knew that item would be useful to you.
If I'd known earlier, I'd have eaten it long ago.

464
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,000
Medicine Elder, I was very worried about you.

465
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,600
Rascal, how are you?

466
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,900
Me? Lately, I almost died 800 times.

467
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,300
First, inside the Mirror Rock
of Magical Beast Mountain Range,

468
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,100
I was almost shredded into pieces by a magical beast.

469
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,100
Next, I was almost forced by your good disciple,
Han Feng, also my Master Uncle,

470
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,430
to burn myself.

471
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,300
And then, that Cloud Mist Sect visited earlier
and has only just left.

472
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,800
So what? Aren't you alive and well right here?

473
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,800
You keep coming in here and clinging to me
whenever you have a problem. I'm not your mother.

474
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,860
I don't have a mother, do I?

475
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,700
That's right, too.

476
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,600
Medicine Elder, I now have a bit of Beast Flame.

477
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,000
I'll open up the Companion Amethyst Source right away,
how about it?

478
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,900
Use the Flame Secrets.

479
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,800
Enter through the middle vital channel
and exit through the root chakra.

480
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,300
Yes.

481
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,200
Don't do it in here!

482
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,500
Was that entertaining?

483
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,600
You began the practice before I was done explaining.

484
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,600
Don't you know that entering through the middle vital channel
and exiting through the root chakra will cause an explosion?

485
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,700
The true method of absorbing the Beast Flame is to start
with your back vertebra passing through twelve levels

486
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,900
up to the back of your head, passing through Wen Xiang
acupuncture point, then through your left vital channel.

487
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,700
The Purple Flame of the Amethyst Winged Lion King
is already the most ferocious among the beast flames.

488
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,700
When the Companion Amethyst Source is added to it,

489
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,800
then it's imaginable how strong its strength will become.

490
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,000
You already have Bone Spirit Cold Flame inside your body.
You now have to store flames in different vital channels.

491
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,500
This way, you won't explode into pieces.

492
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,200
There are 84,000 vital channels (meridians) in my body.

493
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,600
Doesn't it mean that I can store
a different flame in each one of them?

494
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Too bad, there are only 23 Essence Flames in this world.

495
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,680
Even if you add other types of flames,
you won't reach 84,000 kinds.

496
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,000
84,000...

497
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,700
Medicine Elder,

498
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,000
- can you combine the different flames?
- Yes.

499
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,200
If I merge the Bone Spirit Cold Flame
with the Purple Flame together and then throw it out

500
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,000
to let it explode in the enemy's body,

501
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
is that possible?

502
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,700
Your idea is not bad.

503
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,500
Don't practice it here.
You want me to kick you again, is that it?

504
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,300
An alchemist competition

505
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,000
organized by the Royal Family of the Chu Yun Empire

506
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,900
will be held in Yin City, the capital of Chu Yun Empire.

507
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,800
They are especially inviting our school to
choose the top students to join their competition.

508
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,900
This is also in preparation for the selection into
the Alchemist Guild by the State Teacher, Fa Ma.

509
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:43,810
All along, an alchemist is the most
respected profession in the empire.

510
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,700
These clothes of mine

511
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,800
are the black robes of an alchemist.

512
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,200
The medal represents the rank.

513
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,390
♫ If you want change, battle it out with no fear of chaos ♫

514
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,150
♫ The sky is dark, there’s misery on earth,

515

519
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,140
♫ Being mesmerized for a moment

520
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:29,120
♫ Jumping in with a leap with

♫ Young but bothered by undiminishing worries ♫
