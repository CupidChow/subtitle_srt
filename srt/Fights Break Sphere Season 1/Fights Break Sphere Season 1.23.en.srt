Medicine Elder!

4
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,230
Medicine Elder!

5
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,440
Medicine Elder!

6
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,900
Medicine Elder!

7
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,210
Medicine Elder!

8
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,710
Medicine Elder...

9
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,580
You ruthlessly hit me last time.
I didn’t say a word either.

10
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,970
Can you not be angry?

11
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,400
I must prove it to you.

12
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,960
I, Xiao Yan, am not that kind of person.

13
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,360
It turned out to be all of you.

14
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,450
Since it’s meeting old friends,
why is it necessary to hide?

15
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:43,440
Young Warrior Xiao, there were too many people outside
just now. We had to chase after you up to here.

16
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,660
Last time, you gave me
a Sixth-Rank Cloud Snake Magical Crystal.

17
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,180
It happened to save my life.
I’m thanking you here.

18
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,150
You’re welcome.
We were also afraid that Young Warrior Xiao

19
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,860
would accidentally be injured by the Queen’s
extreme poison. So we gave you the Magical Crystal.

20
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,870
Queen?

21
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,750
I’m the Chief Palace General
of the Snake People Empire, Mo Basi.

22
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,770
You’re the General of the Snake People Empire?
Then all of you...

23
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,960
- Yu Busan.
- Yu Buwu.

24
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,100
I'm the Three-Step Snake
and he's the Five-Step Snake.

25
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,020
So that’s how it was.

26
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,720
Don't worry. Your Queen

27
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,030
is quite good in here with me.
You know...

28
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,149
Do you know who I am, brat?

29
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:34,370
Queen Medusa.

30
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,180
Hand over the item you stole!

31
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,230
If you’re not afraid to die,
you can take it back and try again.

32
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,190
Die?

33
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,010
That's not certain.

34
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,510
The last time you refined the Green Lotus Earth Core Flame.
You were burned back into your true appearance.

35
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,600
Your spirit form was almost completely exterminated.
This time,

36
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,240
- do you think you can do it?
- It’s not your turn to be in charge.

37
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,280
Medusa, I took the Essence Flame you can’t refine .

38
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,080
However, I also saved your life.
I don’t owe you.

39
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,500
Bring him back to the Snake People Empire
to make him into a decorative fire jar.

40
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,820
Wait for my skills to be restored.
I’ll then swallow the Essence Flame.

41
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,400
When the Essence Flame explodes,
no one within 10 li will live.

42
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:47,420
You might be able to bear it, but there’s no way
these three people will luckily escape.

43
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,830
Fine. Then I will preserve your dog life.
Three years from now,

44
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,980
wait for my primordial spirit to return to
its original state. I'll kill you at that time.

45
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,450
All right.

46
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,810
Then, I wish for you to recover quickly.

47
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,220
Didn’t we come to an agreement it will be three years?
Are the people of the Snake People Empire so untrustworthy?

48
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,050
Young Warrior Xiao. Young Warrior Xiao.

49
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,810
Don’t be angry. Don’t be angry.

50
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,860
Young Warrior, we… still want to ask you for something.

51
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,220
The Mo family colluded with Soul Hall.
They’re very anxious in pursuing us.

52
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,720
It’s unsafe for the Queen to follow us.

53
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,970
I hope Young Warrior Xiao will continue to protect our Queen.

54
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,920
Mo Basi!

55
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,030
Brother, didn’t you hear what your Queen just said?

56
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,160
She said she will kill me after three years.
Yet, you’re asking me to protect her?

57
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,930
Isn’t this to let her...
let her recover and then kill me right after?

58
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,620
This... As long as Young Warrior
can protect the Queen thoroughly,

59
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,880
her words about killing or not were just spoken out of anger.

60
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,490
Hope Young Warrior Xiao won't mind it.

61
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,430
Don’t tell me this. Anyway, it’s not like
you don’t know your Queen’s temperament.

62
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,410
What should be done if she reneges
on the three years later promise?

63
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,940
Then wouldn't my being a bodyguard for three years be
in vain? Also, I'd have to give up my life, too. Right?

64
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,870
I won’t do this thing.

65
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,050
Don't kill him. Please.

66
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,970
Fine. I won't kill you.

67
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,260
That’s not good either.
You telling me to carry such a huge burden.

68
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,490
Tomorrow, Soul Hall goes looking.
The next day, the Mo family comes searching.

69
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,080
Wh-Wh-Why should I?
My Fight Qi is weak enough as it is.

70
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,320
Wh-What if I can't defea--

71
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,410
I’ll protect... I'll protect.

72
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,790
I’m warning you.
Don’t ever put me inside that shoe again.

73
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,440
Young Warrior Xiao. Just now, the Queen used
the Jewel Blood to give you a mark.

74
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,840
For the next three years, you'll temporarily act
as the Snake King on her behalf.

75
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,030
As long as you protect the Queen thoroughly,

76
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:49,220
you can use the soldiers and wealth
of the Snake People Empire as much as you like.

77
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:52,379
Snake King?

78
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,440
This is our treasured contact item.
As long as you blow and make a sound on this short flute,

79
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,340
all the Snake People Clan members within 100 li
will come to completely obey your orders.

80
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,930
In case of an emergency, use fire to heat it.

81
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:19,190
It will summon the Queen to appear.
Keep it properly.

82
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,130
Your Snake People Empire indeed is really spontaneous.

83
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,960
I myself have a bunch of major troublesome matters.
I hope you didn’t find the wrong person.

84
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,240
Elder Hai.

85
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,510
- Little Medicine Fairy.
- Husband!

86
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,100
Son-in-law.

87
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,320
Son-in-law, you came.
Examine my Green Pine Medicine Cauldron.

88
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,170
It’s a treasure I just got.
I’m giving it to you. I’m giving it to you.

89
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,400
- Take it...
- Here...

90
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,190
Husband, why did you come here?

91
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,500
- Elder Hai.
- What?

92
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,590
Little Medicine Fairy.

93
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,950
I came this time to say farewell.

94
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,130
What? You… Are you saying you have to go?

95
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,590
Elder Tengshan’s situation is unclear.

96
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,960
We’ve reached a decision.
We’ve decided to take him back to the academy first.

97
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,590
This won't do. How can you leave this way?

98
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:52,720
Think about what you've been doing in Yin City
these past days. Always getting in trouble.

99
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,200
Have you slept well or eaten a good meal?

100
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,860
The world is finally peaceful now,
but you have to go.

101
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,280
This won't do. Yin City still
has many good places to eat and play in.

102
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,320
I’ll pay. I’ll let Little Medicine Fairy accompany you
to walk around everywhere. How's that?

103
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,920
Daughter, isn't that all right?

104
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:22,400
Fine. Think about it carefully on your own.
I'm leaving.

105
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,040
Enough.

106
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,490
You're already grown. Yet, you're crying.

107
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,810
I'm not crying.

108
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,930
Little Medicine Fairy.

109
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,350
Before, I always thought both of us meeting

110
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,480
was especially your good fortune.

111
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:02,450
Until now, I think

112
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,490
that you're my precious person.

113
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:22,030
Thank you for helping me to detoxify
at the Alchemist Contest.

114
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,970
Thank you also for taking me
to find the Green Lotus Earth Core Flame.

115
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,760
If it weren't for you,
I might've died already.

116
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,900
Also, these happy encounters wouldn't exist.

117
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,800
This is the pellet medicine to treat you.

118
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,760
I've refined it.

119
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,730
Eat it once a month.
You'll get better very quickly.

120
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,110
In the future, you won't need to bear the pain
from the poisonous insect's bites.

121
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,700
Also, you can have a long life.

122
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,660
Little Medicine Fairy, you must always remember

123
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,720
that in this world, you are never alone.

124
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:33,040
You have Elder Hai. You also have me,

125
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,040
Xun'er, Lin Xiuya, Hu Jia, Hao Tian, and Han Xian.

126
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,700
Everyone will always be with you.

127
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,980
If one day, you need me...

128
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,070
or you need my help,

129
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,990
just let me know.

130
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,360
I will surely appear by your side.

131
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,550
I don't want you to go.

132
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,960
Alright already.

133
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,630
I will return.

134
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,340
But I really have to go now.

135
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,050
Elder Hai.

136
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,400
You...

137
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,220
Thank you.

138
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,800
Husband, remember to think of me!

139
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,400
Take your medicine on time!

140
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,380
You must think of me.

141
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,090
Teacher Ruo Lin.

142
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,620
Where is Elder Tengshan?

143
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,190
We'll check your luggage first.

144
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,870
Once we're done,
you all can return to your dormitory.

145
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:03,400
If there are any illegal items,
you better throw them away now.

146
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,290
Search!

147
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,820
You, let me see that. Hand it over.

148
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,079
- What is an illegal item?
- What is that?

149
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,899
Hey, why don't you ask Teacher Ruo Lin yourself?

150
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,710
Search properly!

151
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:23,230
This concerns the Academy's survival,
and the safety of the Fight Qi Continent!

152
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,130
- You mustn't do it sloppily!
- You guys...

153
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,359
- Remove your clothes.
- I already told you that there's nothing.

154
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,339
What are these?

155
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,029
- Put it down. - You, come over here.
- You're removing my clothes?

156
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,310
Also you, come over here.
Why are you hiding?

157
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,940
- Hurry up.
- You will not find anything.

158
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,560
- Do you have any illegal items? Hand it over.
- Come over here!

159
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,400
Hand it over. Let me see.

160
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,000
Hand it over. What are you hiding?

161
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,550
- There really is nothing. - Who knows?
- What are you doing?

162
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,780
- Go stand on the side.
- Stop searching!

163
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,370
- What are you doing?
- Stop hiding. - Move aside.

164
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,470
- What are you doing?
- Hand it over.

165
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,620
What are you all doing?!

166
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,330
Hand it over. Give that to me.

167
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:01,740
I'm here to escort Elder Tengshan.
Don't worry.

168
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,950
Escort?

169
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:08,000
Teacher Ruo Lin, what has happened?
How come it became escorting?

170
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,420
You all move aside first. At this time,
it's better to not cause any trouble.

171
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,550
The carriage, follow me!

172
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:32,140
Respectfully welcoming Prime Minister Nalan.
You must be tired from your travels. Please go inside to rest.

173
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:38,000
Hey! We all came back from Yin City.
How come she isn't being searched?

174
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,310
Miss Nalan is the Clan Leader of the Nalan Clan

175
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,540
and the new prime minister of the Chu Yun Empire.
What are you then?

176
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,290
I am...

177
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,030
Please.

178
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,560
Bai Cheng.

179
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,330
Don't think of using your tricks that
scare the first years to scare me.

180
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,130
Return that item to me!

181
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,740
- Where did you get this?
- None of your business.

182
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,630
I bought that back from Yin City.
Picked it up along the way. Someone gave it to me.

183
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,000
Put that item back in here.

184
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,290
Let me tell you that this item has a lethal poison.

185
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,970
You brought it back... Do you want to poison someone?

186
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:32,140
That is Snake Saliva Fruit. It's a medicinal ingredient.

187
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,370
You bringing back an illegal item like that
is also bringing danger to the academy.

188
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,730
Brothers, wipe your eyes clean.
If you see any unsafe items,

189
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,340
confiscate them all!

190
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,140
If you're not sure
if it's an item of the Blood Sect,

191
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,330
record who owns it.

192
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,920
We'll interrogate them later on!

193
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,190
Bai Cheng, you remember this.

194
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,050
You dare taint my name?
I won't let you off!

195
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,640
Where is Sect Leader Xiao?
He needs to be heavily checked.

196
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,290
Here. Check it.

197
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,610
Where is he?

198
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,400
Still twenty miles from here.

199
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,330
What? You want to wait for him?

200
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,190
All right. I'll check his bags first.

201
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,260
Once he's back, I'll slowly check him.

202
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:42,450
Did you hide the illegal items
in your clothes beforehand?!

203
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,870
- Stupid.
- Come.

204
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,060
Check me.

205
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,160
Fine.

206
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,690
Seeing that you're a junior sister, I will preserve
your dignity. But if you don't say it now

207
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,770
and it gets discovered in the future,
don't blame me for being discourteous at that time.

208
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,540
Senior,

209
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,100
what do you mean by being discourteous?

210
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,280
Fine. Just you wait.

211
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,790
Wait! Search it!

212
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,460
Hey!

213
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,550
What is this?!

214
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,150
Cinnabar!

215
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,690
I know that it is cinnabar.
What's this carving?

216
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,280
Big Ah Fu!
[Ah Fu - a statue symbolizing good luck]

217
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,940
Isn't that a symbol of the Blood Sect?

218
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,130
Let me tell you that it's not too late to surrender!

219
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,060
The Blood Sect uses Big Ah Fu as a symbol?

220
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,140
How did you get into Jia Nan Academy?

221
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,700
Big Ah Fu.

222
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,070
Stupid.

223
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,430
- Move! You better behave!
- On what basis are you arresting me?! - Let go of me.

224
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,700
- I suspect you're a spy for Soul Hall.
- I am not! - Move!

225
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,610
Move! Quickly move!

226
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,900
Say, what's going on?
One moment, a spy for Soul Hall.

227
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,900
Another moment, lackeys of Soul Hall.
Could it be these seniors

228
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,770
are deliberately bullying us?

229
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:16,340
If you ask me, they are just over-exaggerating.
Can students really be that bold?

230
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:21,350
Look at Teacher Ruo Lin today.
She just let them run wild and didn't say a thing.

231
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,560
I don't know who is the influential person behind all this.

232
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,550
Say, where did Elder Tengshan go?

233
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,420
Anyway, he's not in his room.

234
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,130
Painful! I...!

235
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,270
Are you a thief?

236
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,780
Acting so sneaky.

237
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,840
Someone's keeping a watch out in the corridor.

238
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,740
They are treating everyone who came back from
Yin City like they're Soul Hall spies.

239
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,770
What's going on?

240
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:15,560
Big problem.

241
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,170
- What happened?
- You two don't know?

242
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,330
I also don't know.

243
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,830
And you say that there is a problem.

244
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,220
I heard that it was decided
by the Association of Elders.

245
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:36,160
They said that they are going to clear out
the Blood Sect and Soul Hall forces within the academy.

246
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,360
As for the details, I haven't found those out yet.

247
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,360
Oh, right. Do you know where Elder Tengshan went?

248
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,150
I heard that upon arrival, he is being
closely watched by the Association of Elders.

249
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,150
We were quite close to him.
Hurry up and think of what to say.

250
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,930
Like what?

251
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,170
Bai Cheng has a grudge against you two.

252
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,800
If he gets the chance, he'll surely bully you.
We must defend against it.

253
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:18,240
Look outside. There are seniors everywhere.
We can't really go out. We can only get captured by them.

254
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,470
Come, let's work out our story.

255
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,750
What work out our story?
I'm going to sleep.

256
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,720
You are so at ease.
With so many things happening in Yin City,

257
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,620
if they blame it all on us,
what should we do then?

258
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,200
We are not even of Fight Spirit Rank.
Who will believe it?

259
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,370
You can't be sure. Is Xiao Yan back yet?

260
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,120
Xiao Yan? He just came back,
but he said that he needs to do something.

261
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,990
He went to the training ground of the Yan Sect.

262
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,360
I don't understand.

263
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,610
Since Mi Tengshan had already ended up in your hands,
why did you send him back?

264
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,970
That old man is so cunning.

265
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,390
He kept pretending to be dumb.

266
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,660
He is looking for a chance.

267
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:41,130
It would have been easier
if he had just threw a fit at us,

268
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,460
but he didn't.

269
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,380
This is the decision of the Master of Soul Hall.

270
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,730
Controlling the whole Jia Nan Academy

271
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:55,270
is not achievable by just one Imperial decree.

272
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,920
Even if you two try to handle it,
your foundation is too shallow.

273
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,980
Those elders might not buy it.

274
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,210
With the debts of the Cloud Mist Sect
and the Star Fall Pavilion,

275
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:12,010
by using Mi Tengshan as a pawn,

276
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:16,440
we can observe who is really defending him

277
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,180
and then we can discover
who is on the same path as us.

278
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,610
This move is indeed a bit dangerous.
But after thinking about it,

279
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,200
there is no better way.

280
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,320
Hence, I still feel that he should be locked up.

281
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,130
What if he has a backup plan? We are then in danger.

282
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:48,330
Locking him up and killing him will have the
same result. People will become more suspicious.

283
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,890
Just letting him move around outside

284
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:56,260
will make us look less guilty.
You two said it right.

285
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,990
This old man is looking for a chance.

286
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,320
Presently, he dares not defend his innocence.

287
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,090
If he wants to look for a chance,
we must not give it to him.

288
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:11,760
But what if he gets pushed to desperation
and decides to go all out on us?

289
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,530
If he wanted to, he already would have done it.

290
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,180
You all are still young,
so you don't understand.

291
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,650
Only when a person grows old will he start to fear death

292
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:27,700
and start to cherish his life. I am like that.

293
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,040
Mi Tengshan is like that, too.

294
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:35,920
State Teacher, since it's like that.
We must hurry in handling this matter.

295
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,320
Now, in the whole Jia Nan Academy,

296
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,320
there are a lot of people who got promoted by Mi Tengshan.

297
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,650
There are also a lot of students who admire him.

298
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:51,190
Correct. Xiao Yan is number one.

299
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:00,950
Whenever I see that child, my head aches from anger.

300
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,190
We can't touch Xiao Yan now.
Lord Fan Lan gave instructions.

301
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:16,230
But... this child is the closest one to Mi Tengshan.

302
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:21,800
If we don't start with him,
how are we going to control the other students?

303
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,630
Am I right?

304
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,730
If I had known this would happen,
I wouldn't have spared him.

305
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,390
I should have killed him with one palm.

306
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,430
Who is there?!

307
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,490
What was that?

308
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,890
The Soul Separating Technique of Soul Hall.

309
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:07,230
Only people with high ranking
have the right to learn it.

310
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,520
From Soul Hall?

311
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:13,560
Could it be someone important from Soul Hall has come?
State Teacher, do you know about this?

312
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,410
Maybe... the Master of Soul Hall doesn't trust us.

313
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,810
How about this? I will first enter the palace
tomorrow to steady the Emperor.

314
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:30,800
And then, I'll come to the academy
with you two to handle the rest.

315
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,640
Respectfully welcoming State Teacher Fa Ma.

316
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,880
State Teacher Fa Ma,
welcome to our Jia Nan Academy.

317
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,190
State Teacher must be tired from your journey.
Quickly go in to rest.

318
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,550
The time when I was studying here

319
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,790
seems just like yesterday.

320
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:21,930
In the blink of an eye, it has been a hundred years.

321
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:27,340
The school currently is still conveying your deeds.

322
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,400
What deeds?

323
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,970
That you as the head, leading the Alchemist Guild

324
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:44,830
in protecting us and the whole Fight Qi Continent.

325
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:48,060
Just for that, our whole academy

326
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,770
should look up to you with great respect.

327
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,120
Where is Mi Tengshan?

328
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,000
Following your orders,
we've already taken him into custody.

329
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,460
Elder Tengshan is gravely ill.

330
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,210
We've transferred him to the Alchemy Room
to be taken care of.

331
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,710
It's "detaining."

332
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,650
What crime did he commit?

333
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:18,390
How can we use the word "detain?"

334
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,140
That's why we were waiting for you.

335
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,770
Right now, the mood in the academy is stable.

336
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,960
We are just not united in our understanding;

337
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,760
hence, all the more we need your guidance.

338
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,090
Elder Han and Elder Gu He,

339
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:42,870
you all are witnesses.
Tell them the situation.

340
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:47,790
Yes. I will say a few words.

341
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:53,060
This matter is really very upsetting.

342
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:57,290
Why? Elder Mi Tengshan

343
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,880
is actually a traitor!

344
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,080
This... How is that possible? Indeed.
How can there be such a thing?

345
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,250
I know. Everyone cannot easily accept it.

346
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:13,650
After all, he is an elder
with noble character and prestige.

347
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:17,960
He has been in the academy for so many years.
But that person

348
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,730
was a big traitor!

349
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,430
He has been hiding here in the academy
for so many years and no one noticed it!

350
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:27,960
That's right. He said it right.
Never thought that would be possible.

351
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,430
It is so upsetting.

352
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,010
Elder Han, in making accusations,
you have to have proof.

353
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:39,230
You're just casually saying things.
Show us your proof.

354
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:44,780
How is it just casual remarks? You think I would
dare say such things without any proof?

355
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,090
All right. Let us talk about something recent.

356
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:56,340
During the Alchemist Contest, Soul Hall sent
a Blood Sect assassin to join in the competition.

357
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,050
I, Gu He, and State Teacher Fa Ma were all against it.

358
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:03,200
Only Mi Tengshan agreed to it.

359
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,450
After the first day of competition,
Mi Tengshan disappeared. Afterward,

360
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:11,720
news from the palace came

361
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,490
that Mi Tengshan had tried to assassinate the Emperor.

362
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,900
This...

363
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,530
The Emperor wouldn't dare lie, right?

364
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,820
Everyone, think about it.
In the succeeding rounds,

365
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:28,220
that Blood Sect assassin kept scheming to harm

366
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,930
the lives of the youngsters from the Five Great Clans.

367
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:34,240
Good thing, State Teacher Fa Ma reacted quickly.

368
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,750
He sent people to stalk him.
And by following the clues, they discovered

369
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,830
that Mi Tengshan and that Blood Sect assassin

370
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:46,590
were actually accomplices. So scary.

371
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:49,570
We never knew that he was hiding among us.

372
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,530
That's true. Never expected this.

373
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:56,000
Elder Gu He, you are also a witness.
Say something.

374
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,680
This time, it was really threatening.

375
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,250
The Soul Hall and Blood Sect have evil hearts.

376
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,670
They have deployed their people in a very thorough manner.
If not for State Teacher Fa Ma

377
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,210
laying out a very careful plan this time,

378
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,930
Yin City might have been conquered.

379
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:15,990
There were also a lot of students
who went with us this time.

380
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:20,090
If some of you don't believe us,
you can go ask them.

381
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,730
I still have one thing I don't understand.

382
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:27,949
Elder Tengshan was gravely injured by someone.
Who did it?

383
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:30,869
Also, I heard from the students

384
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:34,880
that he was rescued by State Teacher Fa Ma.

385
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,920
What is the story behind that then?

386
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,790
Mi Tengshan has been my friend
for more than half of my life.

387
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:47,010
He walked the wrong path and worked for Soul Hall.

388
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:53,520
Not only did he fail, he also got abandoned by Soul Hall.

389
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,510
I couldn't bear to have him die away
from his hometown, so I rescued him.

390
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,290
I sent him back here to the academy
so I can follow the clues

391
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:08,420
and find his accomplices here.

392
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:17,230
Jia Nan Academy gathers the most elite
youngsters of the Fight Qi Continent.

393
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,940
They are our future hope.

394
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,440
If this place has also been
deeply infiltrated by Soul Hall,

395
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,460
we then are going to fail without fighting.

396
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,170
That's right...

397
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:34,540
This time, not only did I bring alchemists
from the Alchemist Guild to help everyone,

398
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,350
I also brought a decree from the new emperor.

399
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:44,980
He requests everyone to investigate the academy
thoroughly and find the spies.

400
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,220
Elder Tengshan, you're awake.

401
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,840
In front of all these elders,
let me ask you a question.

402
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,310
The Alchemist Guild firmly believes
that you are a spy for Soul Hall.

403
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:30,550
Are these words a false accusation?

404
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,740
No.

405
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,970
Since you admit it,

406
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:51,350
let us bring everything out in the open.

407
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,610
I was decreed by Emperor Ye Lan
to come here to your academy

408
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:00,730
to investigate the hidden forces of Blood Sect and Soul Hall.

409
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:04,820
The new emperor took into consideration,
that you have worked for this academy for so many years.

410
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,970
Even if you don't have any merits,
you have labored here.

411
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:10,110
As long as you tell us

412
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:15,780
the names of those you've recruited here
at the academy, we can spare your life.

413
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,780
I don't remember anymore.

414
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:28,560
Mi Tengshan! You are too--

415
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,790
You are disappointing me so much!
At this point, you're still not confessing?!

416
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:38,160
You're still not saying the truth.
I really want to kill you with one slap.

417
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,390
Let me tell you...
You all must not stop me! I... I--

418
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:47,860
It's fine if you don't remember.
Slowly think about it.

419
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:51,960
We will slowly investigate.
We will eventually find it all out.

420
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,880
Take him away.

421
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,630
State Teacher, you are too kind.
He said he doesn't remember,

422
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:08,550
so we're leaving it like that?
In my opinion—

423
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,950
Mi Tengshan has been teaching at this academy
for so many years. He holds strong power here.

424
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:20,750
Let's just mobilize the students and teachers
to report and expose any illegal activities to us.

425
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:23,010
Slowly investigate it.

426
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,490
As for Mi Tengshan, don't let him idle around.

427
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:32,620
Have him sweep some floors
and get seen around the academy.

428
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:37,140
When his accomplices see him,
they will eventually approach him.

429
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:44,300
The Darkness is coming.
We don't know when the forces

430
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:48,300
of Soul Hall will return.

431
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,020
Before they make a grand attack,

432
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:55,560
we must clean up our ranks and eliminate the outsiders.

433
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:00,910
This is also everyone's utmost duty.

434
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,630
I will return to Yin City tonight.

435
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:10,060
I'm the one who trained these alchemists.

436
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,900
Each one being very experienced.

437
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,760
They will stay behind. Hope that in the near future,

438
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,750
I can hear good news from everyone.

439
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,990
Exposing the real identity of
the spy of Soul Hall, Mi Tengshan.

440
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:43,360
This is another grand victory of the righteous force
of the Fight Qi Continent against Soul Hall.

441
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,520
Today, State Leader Fa Ma has led people
from the Alchemist Guild to settle in at our academy.

442
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,500
They exposed the disguise of Mi Tengshan.

443
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,350
So it seems that in the past decades that
while Mi Tengshan was in this academy,

444
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:56,550
he was a traitor that pretended to be loyal,
engaging in activities of recruiting corrupted individuals

445
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,730
and secretly expanding the power of Soul Hall.
Hard evidence has been found.

446
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,500
The wise State Teacher Fa Ma
saved our continent once again.

447
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,960
The teacher and students of our academy
are happily cheering and dancing.

448
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,160
To protect Jia Nan Academy,
to protect the whole Fight Qi Continent,

449
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:15,570
students and teachers, quickly raise your pens

450
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,180
and write down those evil names.

451
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,490
Report them! Expose them!

452
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:24,180
For a righteous undertaking.
For our splendid

453
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,520
tomorrow!

454
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,210
How can there be spies among us?

455
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,070
I don't know.

456
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:35,810
Classmates, do you want to
make your report sound more literary?

457
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:39,540
Do you want to make your disclosures more artistic?

458
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:43,030
Do you want to make your views more unique?
Quickly come buy

459
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:46,510
the collection of the best maxims of the Fight God.

460
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,630
There are two volumes of them.
It is being sold in the Student Council.

461
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,570
You only need to pay 60%.
There is only a limited number in stock.

00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:55,160
Quickly go purchase them. Quickly go purchase them.
Quickly go purchase them. Quickly go purchase them.

463
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,580
- Give it to me!
- Come get it.

464
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,750
- Give it to me!
- If you have guts, come take it.

465
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,810
Give it to me! Shameless brat, give it to me!

466
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:09,380
I'm not giving it.
It wasn't easy for me to borrow it.

467
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:12,950
How did it go?

468
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:17,600
Teacher Ruo Lin said that all sects
will be immediately disbanded.

469
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,500
Why? She must at least give us a reason.

470
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:23,040
What reason? The doorsill of Teacher Ruo Lin's room
is about to be flattened.

471
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,420
You think those Bai Sect people
won't be complaining more than us?

472
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,140
It's no use. All are still getting disbanded.

473
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,070
The flea market is gone, too.

474
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:34,060
They said that it's because of the fear
of letting Soul Hall traitors find an excuse to flee.

475
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,790
Junior, I'll copy it first.

476
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:42,220
You copy it after I'm done.
Remember to change your words.

477
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,450
Our Yan Sect is disbanding.
You don't care?

478
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,770
So what if I do?

479
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:51,160
The present situation

480
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,270
is called, "We can't win over the circumstances."

481
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:57,000
We have no choice but to bow down.
