=Episode 19=

3
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,600
I can help you dissolve these three kinds of poison,

4
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,800
but I can’t dissolve his medicine primer.

5
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,200
That’s the Blood Sect’s secret recipe
that has been passed down for generations.

6
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,500
That won’t do.
If this continues, I’ll die in here.

7
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,200
Then what’s your opinion?

8
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,800
A leader can submit or stand tall as required.
I’ll go out and talk to him.

9
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,000
To admit defeat?

10
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,500
Both sides will benefit.

11
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,120
You're really good at business.

12
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,000
Husband!

13
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,900
Husband!

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,600
- Xiao Yan! - Brother Xiao Yan!
- Husband!

15
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,300
What to do?

16
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,399
Brother. Brother.

17
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,000
What?

18
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,600
Is it fun for both of us to be this way?

19
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,200
My poison will not let you walk off the stage.
You’ll change into pus right away.

20
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,800
My poison... Within twelve hours,

21
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,600
you’ll be burnt to ashes.

22
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,600
I’m telling you. Both of us like this,

23
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,400
one person changing into ashes

24
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,600
and the other changing into pus.
It’s really boring.

25
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,600
As a matter of fact... As a matter of fact,
aren't we giving them a show of us being humiliated?

26
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,540
That's right.

27
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,000
Tell me. What should be done then?

28
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,000
How about...

29
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,400
After 1, 2, 3, we yell “surrender” together.

30
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,400
All right. If we want to lose, let’s yell together.

31
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,200
- Good.
- One... two... three...

32
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,100
- I surr...
- I…

33
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,600
Do you really want to die?

34
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,400
I knew the people
of the Fight Qi Continent were untrustworthy.

35
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,400
The people of Soul Hall are untrustworthy.

36
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,800
You...

37
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,600
What are you doing?

38
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,900
Your brother will die soon.

39
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Then tell me what should be done.

40
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,400
In a moment, both of us go on stage.
I’ll save Xiao Yan.

41
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,600
You use your force to knock out that Soul Clan person.

42
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,800
That would be cheating.

43
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,900
Then are you going to helplessly… watch him die?!

44
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,800
In a moment, the judge on the stage will ring the bell.
We’ll then go up right away and save them.

45
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,200
This is Alchemist Competition.
Don’t cause trouble.

46
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,800
Don’t you see that the judge on the stage
clearly doesn’t want to ring the bell?!

47
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,400
Elder Gu He, shouldn’t the bell be rung?

48
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
I see their Poison Qi
has already entered their blood vessels.

49
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,900
If they suddenly die here,

50
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,100
won’t our competition be the cause?

51
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,500
What about it?

52
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,900
A person of the Soul Clan will suddenly die.
Is that worthy of your sympathy, too?

53
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,000
What’s your position?

54
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Could it be you and Soul Hall
are colluding over something?

55
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,200
Absolutely not, Master Han.

56
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,200
It’s just that I see
the child of the Xiao family will, too.

57
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,000
Don’t forget that his mother was a traitor.

58
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,700
Friends, here's the scene. Student Xiao Yan

59
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,800
and the Soul Clan contestant, Fan Ling,
are in the middle of a stalemate inside right now.

60
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,200
Stalemate? Aren't they hurrying to detoxify?
What stalemate?

61
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,400
I’m predicting

62
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,800
that they must not have found a way to detoxify
and they’re unwilling to admit defeat.

63
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,000
The toxicity must be too much.

64
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,300
Also, since the contestants are unwilling to admit defeat,
according to the competition’s rules,

65
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,700
the judges aren’t allowed to help.

66
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,400
So friends,

67
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,700
all of you might see the harshest competition in history.

68
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,900
Absolutely.

69
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
What!

70
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,000
Both contestants aren’t even anxious to detoxify.
They’re even chatting?!

71
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,400
They’re being too kind, right? How late is it?
And they’re still chatting?

72
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,500
Maybe this… Maybe this... is saying some last words
to each other before they both die, right?

73
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,000
If the stalemate continues this way,
leaving any last words is also useless.

74
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,600
Both of them will be dead.
Who knows what those two are talking about.

75
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,400
I didn’t expect the Soul Clan contestant

76
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,200
who is participating for the first time
in our competition, would fall down so quickly.

77
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,000
But this... is also very good.

78
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,300
Why? Because in the future, he won’t dare
to rashly challenge our Fight Qi Continent.

79
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,300
Elder Fa Ma has entrusted the position
on today’s competition to the two of us.

80
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,800
You don’t trust Elder Fa Ma or the two of us?

81
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
I...

82
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,900
Look!

83
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,200
Look. The white flag is raised.

84
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,800
My Brother Xiao Yan is awesome!

85
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,200
Sect Leader Xiao, considered the best
in the world, is surprisingly admitting defeat?

86
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,500
Husband, you're awesome!

87
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,660
This brat is very cunning.

88
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,800
- Come. Brother. - Good!
- Dissolve the poison now.

89
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
You dissolve mine first.

90
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,000
Together then.

91
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,400
All right.

92
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,700
- Husband.
- Brother Xiao Yan, are you all right?

93
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,500
Check it.

94
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,460
There’s still a taste of poison
that hasn’t been dissolved.

95
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,900
My medicine used my heart's blood
to create the medicinal primer.

96
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,680
So you must use the same kind
of heart's blood to dissolve it.

97
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,800
The children of our Soul Clan

98
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,200
grew up taking numerous poisons.

99
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,600
It's always been exactly this way.

100
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,400
Only you grew up taking numerous poisons?
Isn't that too boastful?

101
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Could it be you are born distressed with poison?

102
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,400
Here, Husband, drink mine.

103
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,600
Little Medicine Fairy.

104
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,300
Go on, drink it.

105
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,100
Hurry up.

106
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Thank you.

107
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,600
Husband, you're really terrific.

108
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,600
It's fine.

109
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,730
Friends of Yin City...

110
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:31,320
This year’s Alchemist Competition
has ended perfectly!

111
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,900
Did Little Medicine Fairy leave already?

112
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,140
Yes. Elder Hai has already taken her away.

113
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,320
Before leaving, he even gave a huge speech
to tell us to quickly have children.

114
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,130
What is it?

115
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,910
You're not married to her?

116
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:15,930
Hey! How many times have I said it already?
My mouth is dry.

117
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:20,110
Didn’t both of you bow to Heaven and Earth?

118
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,190
Who told you that? Who told you so
that you even believe it?

119
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,100
Of course, I believe it.
It would be good if I was Little Medicine Fairy.

120
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,500
Why?

121
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,580
I can bow to Heaven and Earth with you

122
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,380
and cut myself for a bowl of blood for you to drink.

123
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,850
Forget about it. Just her alone
is enough to make me worry to death.

124
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,970
I think about all the girls who like you.

125
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,590
Little Medicine Fairy. Nalan Yanran...

126
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,060
Why are you bringing her up again?

127
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,940
I think she... probably likes you very much.

128
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,670
You probably like her very much, too. Right?
Otherwise, why would you hate her so much?

129
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,890
You’re just talking a bunch of nonsense.

130
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:04,350
Right. There’s also… there’s also Medusa.

131
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,600
You said her figure was especially good.

132
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,060
She’s just like thunder in my mind.
If she jumps out someday,

133
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,950
I might more or less say goodbye to this world.

134
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,090
How about you? Who do you like?

135
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,870
Tell me. I'll help to advise you carefully.

136
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,830
If he isn’t good to you,
I’ll help you beat him up.

137
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,090
I like...

138
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,170
He’s an unrivaled hero.

139
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,360
Unrivaled hero?

140
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,500
Unrivaled hero...

141
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,920
How is he an unrivaled hero?

142
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,620
Who is it?

143
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,430
Xiao Yan, someone is looking for you.

144
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,350
What's the matter?

145
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,370
The Crown Prince wants to see you tomorrow morning.

146
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,830
Crown Prince?

147
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,030
- Crown Prince.
- Crown Prince.

148
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,490
At the Alchemist Competition,
you consecutively won all three rounds. Congratulations.

149
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,090
A tie is considered a loss to me.

150
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,880
Did you know that I sent an assassin yesterday

151
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,110
disguised as a spectator hidden among
those inside for the competition round?

152
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,610
Why?

153
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,620
Because Fan Ling’s heart blood,
although it can detoxify,

154
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,890
you’d have become his slave once you drank it.

155
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:06,950
You’re so powerful. I certainly
couldn’t watch you become my enemy.

156
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,430
Apparently, my luck is pretty good to have gotten
my life back from the Crown Prince.

157
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:16,020
But, Crown Prince,
why do you know so much about Fan Ling

158
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,240
and the Blood Sect?

159
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,150
Crown Prince sent me to ask you to come.
It’s to ask you something.

160
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:27,010
The empire is in trouble now.
Are you willing to help by undertaking a task?

161
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,320
The empire is in trouble.

162
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,040
Crown Prince, I want to ask you about a matter.

163
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,130
Elder Tengshan entered the palace to kill.
Do you know about this matter?

164
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,610
It’s impossible that Mi Tengshan
tried to assassinate the Emperor.

165
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,780
Why?

166
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,780
Because the Chu Yun Empire
simply doesn’t have an emperor.

167
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,420
Why aren’t you stuttering when you speak? You...

168
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,720
Wh-Who are you?

169
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,770
I’m the true Crown Prince.

170
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,290
Apart from me being real,
the people inside the Imperial Palace...

171
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,930
I’m afraid they aren’t real.

172
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,750
I also don’t know whom to trust.
So I just pretend to stutter

173
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,860
and act like a clown. But it’s nothing
more than a temporary way of living.

174
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,110
The people in the Imperial Palace are all fake?

175
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,090
Then are your eunuchs and Imperial Bodyguards fake also?

176
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:30,080
Many years ago, the Emperor of the empire
was no longer my Imperial Father.

177
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,590
The eunuchs by his side, soldiers,
generals, and ministers,

178
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:38,060
although their appearance hasn’t changed,
their souls

179
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,660
seem to have left them long ago.
It seems more like...

180
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,490
they’re being controlled by someone.

181
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:50,360
Don’t you feel this method is very similar
to the tactics of the Blood Sect and Soul Hall?

182
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,650
Then tell me.

183
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,010
Why are you still normal?

184
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:01,010
I also don’t know.
I asked Mi Tengshan the same question.

185
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,700
He agreed to help me investigate,
but then he quickly disappeared.

186
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,680
So just now, I came to find you.

187
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,380
Elder Mi Tengshan. He disappeared
because he came to the Imperial Palace?

188
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,220
I’m afraid they have already begun their task.

189
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,860
But I can’t save him.

190
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,100
This is the secret map of the Imperial Palace.

191
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,470
Fan Ling entered the Palace last night.

192
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,300
He spoke to the false emperor,
but I only heard a few sentences.

193
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,400
I want to check it with you.

194
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,990
Please explain.

195
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:45,450
He said your body has the Essence Flame,
but also more than one type.

196
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,540
The false emperor told him that you are
probably working together with another person

197
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,850
and his body also has the Essence Flame.
It’s the nemesis of the Blood Sect.

198
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,940
They will get rid of you sooner or later.

199
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,390
Crown Prince, please return to the palace first.
I will also enter the Imperial Palace.

200
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,740
This way.

201
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,370
Rende Palace is just ahead.
It's the Emperor's study.

202
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,910
Over there is Qinde Palace.
That's the Crown Prince’s residence.

203
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,330
Jingfu Palace and Qianyuan Palace are here.

204
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,680
On both sides of the east and west wings, there is a side
palace hall and quarters for the Imperial Bodyguards.

205
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,700
You are very familiar with all this.

206
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,380
This tunnel is the (secret) emergency
passageway of the Imperial Palace.

207
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,510
During childhood, when I entered
the Emperor’s palace with my grandfather,

208
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,020
I often played down here.

209
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,730
The Nalan family is really famous.

210
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:17,750
I, Xiao Yan, haven’t even seen the main entrance
of the Imperial Palace, not once.

211
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,760
- Xiao Yan. - Since you’re familiar
with the Imperial Palace, lead the way.

212
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,930
Then let’s go to Rende Palace first,

213
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,800
to see the Emperor.
Before Grandfather died, he said

214
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,430
the Nalan family has an enormous secret
concerning the Emperor’s body.

215
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,990
I came to find Elder Tengshan.
Your Nalan family secrets

216
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,850
have nothing to do with me.

217
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,470
Let's go.

218
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,770
Retreat!

219
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,550
Didn’t you want to go find the Emperor?
Yet, you’re not hurrying to keep up.

220
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:50,640
Vowing loyalty and devotion to Soul Hall.

221
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,530
Vowing loyalty and devotion...

222
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,510
Good. Everything is right.

223
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,920
A blood alliance.

224
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,050
Bring those two people up here.

225
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,750
This way, we can end it.

226
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,460
That’s a blood allegiance.

227
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,480
They want the Ministers to become puppets of Soul Hall.

228
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,800
Vowing loyalty and devotion...

229
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,720
Catch them!

230
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,520
Run!

231
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,670
Don’t let them discover the secret passage.

232
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,310
Are you all right?

233
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,680
Come!

234
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,470
Fortunately, you were there today--

235
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,850
Xiao Yan, are you crazy?!

236
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,500
Nalan Yanran, you lied to me.

237
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,580
I didn’t!

238
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,470
I came to find Elder Tengshan,

239
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,010
not to help you find
some kind of Nalan family big secret!

240
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,510
You said when you were younger,
you played hide-and-seek inside there.

241
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,740
I don’t believe that up until now,
you can still remember it all so clearly.

242
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,830
You’ve absolutely walked around
that passageway many times.

243
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,210
Why did you lie to me?
What is actually inside that tunnel?

244
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,970
Tell me! Why did you lie to me?!

245
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,980
Xiao Yan, you jerk!

246
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,350
When did you join hands
with Soul Hall and Blood Sect?

247
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,700
Don’t force me to kill you!

248
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:44,170
I have come here several times.
But based on the fact that I was alone,

249
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,790
how can I investigate clearly
what is living inside that palace?

250
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,870
I also don’t know
what kind of monsters those eunuchs are.

251
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,780
Grandfather said the most important treasure
of the Nalan family is hidden on the emperor’s body.

252
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,660
Of course, I must get it back.
I admit that I took advantage of you.

253
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,970
But... But I swear

254
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:07,110
that I absolutely haven’t colluded
in the least bit with Soul Hall.

255
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,140
Go away.

256
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,810
What else do you know?

257
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,210
What else can I know?

258
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,070
Crown Prince Ye Lan has already explained it clearly.

259
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,540
Those inside the Imperial Palace are all monsters.

260
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:57,310
The Emperor is already being controlled by
the people of the Blood Sect and Soul Hall.

261
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,760
I also want to find Elder Tengshan.

262
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,290
But where is he?

263
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:47,690
Master Mi, your life is hard enough.

264
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,150
Even this kind of torture doesn’t kill you.

265
00:25:55,540 --> 00:26:00,670
My life may not be good, but my morals are strong.

266
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:06,320
I’ll soon be tormented to exhaustion by you.

267
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,550
Master Mi.

268
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:17,400
look and see who that is.

269
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,430
That is our old friend.

270
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,020
Nalan Jie.

271
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,200
Who do you listen to?

272
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,500
Master Fa Ma.

273
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,640
Whose person are you?

274
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,960
A person of Master Fa Ma.

275
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,950
Are you on my side...

276
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:53,610
or... Mi Tengshan’s side?

277
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,060
On Master Fa Ma’s side.

278
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,920
Go back.

279
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,960
This is your Soul Hall’s sorcery.

280
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,220
When Nalan Jie died,

281
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,890
I personally buried him.

282
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,990
He wasn’t alive. The extreme poison

283
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,370
burned his flesh completely.

284
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,940
That's right.

285
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,400
Have you heard of the puppet technique?

286
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,950
I dug up the corpse of Nalan Jie.

287
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:42,810
I succeeded in refining a puppet medicine for him.
Then it made him useful to me.

288
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,990
But back to our topic,

289
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:52,540
this old man has been obstinate for a lifetime!

290
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:57,430
He didn’t expect there would be a day
when he would become my slave here.

291
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,510
Entering into the fire, it doesn’t burn.
Entering into the water, it doesn’t invade.

292
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,100
A dead person can be resurrected.
Bones of the dead grow flesh.

293
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,650
True consciousness and the physical body are separated.

294
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,790
10,000 li in an instant.
It all can return again in an instant.

295
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:16,270
Could such a successful method be bad?

296
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:25,930
For all these years,
I finally came to understand something.

297
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,950
Righteousness is meaningless.

298
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,170
Only living is the right reason.

299
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,430
I’m giving you these words as a present.

300
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,750
Thank you.

301
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:45,220
I don’t have that much energy to persuade you.

302
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,210
Are you planning to stand on my side

303
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,970
or stand by my side?

304
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,170
Is there a difference?

305
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,900
Yes.

306
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,030
Either become like me

307
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,050
or become like Nalan Jie.

308
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,280
A dead slave.

309
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,420
An alive slave.

310
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,880
Yes.

311
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,550
To the subordinates of Soul Hall,

312
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,730
death is a very luxurious matter.

313
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,270
- What?
- What?

314
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,190
I have nothing to hide.

315
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,490
Last night, Crown Prince Ye Lan asked me
to scout the Imperial Palace

316
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,290
and I saw

317
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:57,030
a group of eunuchs performing
a blood alliance ceremony for the Ministers.

318
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:01,210
You're saying, that the power of Soul Hall has already
infiltrated the Imperial Family of the Chu Yun Empire.

319
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,290
You could say that.
But there’s one thing I don’t understand.

320
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:07,130
The Imperial Bodyguards, palace maids, and eunuchs

321
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,490
don’t look like the people of Blood Sect.

322
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:14,000
Instead, it looks like they’re being controlled by something.
They’re not even afraid of my Mysterious Heavy Ruler.

323
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,430
Isn’t that a monster?

324
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:20,820
This matter shouldn’t be delayed. I want to ask
everyone to come with me into the Imperial Palace.

325
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,820
Elder Tengshan disappeared
because he was investigating the Imperial Palace.

326
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,100
As long as this matter is clarified,
we should be able to find the Elder.

327
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,610
I’ll listen to you. When do we leave?

328
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:33,580
Fighting the Emperor.
This matter can be retold for a lifetime.

329
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:37,470
Hao Tian, you... It might be better
if you continue to stay at the inn.

330
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,540
Hu Jia, you stay to protect him.

331
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,880
Both of you staying here at the inn to
wait for Elder Tengshan is one good reason.

332
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,850
Another reason is,
that just in case we enter the Imperial Palace

333
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,740
and don’t return within four hours,

334
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,200
both of you can immediately
notify the Elders to come save us.

335
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,020
That won't do. Him being here alone is sufficient.

336
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,540
I have to go with all of you.

337
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,510
How can you be this kind of person--

338
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,460
I know that all of you don’t welcome me.

339
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:12,510
If once I’m done explaining the main matter and all
of you still won’t help, I won’t nag you anymore.

340
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,960
Say it. What's the matter?

341
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,730
I really didn’t expect there would come a day
when I'd be a partner with her.

342
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:38,210
Xun'er, in order to who controlled the Emperor,

343
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:42,030
and to find Elder Mi Tengshan,
we have no choice but to do it this way.

344
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:46,220
Then can’t we just go by ourselves to investigate?
Why must we bring her along?

345
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,780
It's already alerted them yesterday,

346
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,610
so today we must quickly find out the truth.

347
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,840
I hope you can think for the Chu Yun Empire

348
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,420
and temporarily set aside any grudges between us.

349
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,400
What do you mean?

350
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,680
You’re very kind and righteous.
I’m selfish.

351
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,800
- Brother Xiao Yan, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

352
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,350
I was injured internally yesterday.
I’m still not well.

353
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,480
I’m sandwiched in between you all,
just like an especially bright burning candle.

354
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,620
I don’t care what kind of
animosity there is among all of you.

355
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,360
I’m going ahead first.

356
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,890
I’m fine. I’m fine.
Let’s hurry and keep going.

357
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,730
Go...

358
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:43,120
Early every morning is when the complete
Imperial Palace Minister group gathers here.

359
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,410
We'll enter with them. Wait until dawn
and watch for my signal to take action.

360
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:50,630
Disrupting the morning Imperial Court is
a huge crime. You’re a Prime Minister.

361
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,690
Of course, I'll take responsibility.

362
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:55,470
Both of you have been here before?

363
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,580
Brother Xiao Yan.

364
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,060
Yes.

365
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,350
When?

366
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,990
Last night.

367
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,390
Weren’t you alone?

368
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:16,090
I was afraid you all would overthink it.
So I didn’t say it.

369
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,790
Really?

370
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:28,020
Acting. Keep on acting. Throw up again.

371
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,550
Continuously throwing up will harm the body.
You’re unwilling to make me do that, right?

372
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,100
I'm willing.

373
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:50,280
I only did it in order to save Elder Mi Tengshan.

374
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,040
Fine. Then I forgive you.

375
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,780
Your Majesty?

376
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,800
Xiao Yan.

377
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,530
Your Majesty.

378
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,340
Your Majesty...

379
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,560
You are finally here.

380
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:04,410
You are a bit later than I expected.

381
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,750
Xiao Family, Nalan Clan, Gu Tribe,

382
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,250
all of you are here.

383
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,620
Good. Very good.

384
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,470
After eliminating meddlesome people like you,

385
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:32,300
the whole Chu Yun Empire

386
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,820
will now come under our Soul Hall.

387
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,440
You are not the Emperor.

388
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:42,260
Who are you really?

389
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,340
It was you
who turned those high officials into puppets, right?

390
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,690
You are right.

391
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,980
Fan Lao?

392
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,150
Imperial Father!

393
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,550
Who are you?

394
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,300
Did I not tell you that in this palace,
other than me being real,

395
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,430
all the rest are fake?

396
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,610
Imperial Father!

397
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,340
Imperial Father...

398
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,390
Imperial Father...

399
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,160
Is he still your Imperial Father?

400
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,790
Before he got possessed... yes.

401
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,430
Were you able to get the item that you wanted?

402
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,980
Grandfather knew beforehand that the Emperor
was being controlled by Soul Hall.

403
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:18,070
He secretly embedded this inside the body of the Emperor,

404
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:20,190
so the evil energy of the Soul Hall would be suppressed

405
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:24,320
and not be fully activated.
He also instructed me

406
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,840
that once the Emperor was defeated,
I'd have to get our item back.

407
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,630
What is that?

408
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,200
Imperial Father.

409
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,720
Son...

410
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,550
Imperial Father...

411
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,010
You all are...

412
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,550
The 19th Clan Leader of the Nalan Clan,

413
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:17,330
Prime Minister of Chu Yun, Nalan Yanran,
greets Your Majesty.

414
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,380
Where is Nalan Jie?

415
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,790
Nalan Jie...

416
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,800
Spread my decree.

417
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,170
I was affected by the evil magic of Soul Hall

418
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,400
causing my blood and qi to be exhausted.

419
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,590
I do not have the strength to govern anymore.

420
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:47,600
Select an auspicious day to pass
on the throne to the Crown Prince.

421
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,440
The disciples who have joined
the Alchemist Contest

422
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,930
have done their best to fight off Soul Hall
and achieved merit in protecting me.

423
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:01,020
I will reward them.

424
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:06,370
Finally, the forces of Soul Hall within the palace
must be clearly investigated.

425
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:10,450
I will lock down the palace
and do a thorough investigation.

426
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:12,190
Yes.

427
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,780
When did it start?

428
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:33,810
When I was fighting that old emperor today,
his blood tainted the Mystical Heavy Ruler.

429
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,010
Afterwards, these new markings appeared.

430
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,740
That was not human blood, but the blood
of an envoy from Soul Hall itself.

431
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,450
This Mystical Heavy Ruler
is a magical weapon of Soul Hall.

432
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:51,420
Unless you use their blood,
you cannot open this seal.

433
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,980
Then these markings...
Medicine Elder, can you decipher them?
