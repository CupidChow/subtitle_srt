3
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,220
Sect Leader, that person is merely a side character.

4
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,050
Sect Leader, please not worry about it.

5
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,930
Side character.

6
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,340
One of the leaders of the five big clans still
is a small character?

7
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,780
What we are doing now is risking universal condemnation.

8
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:21,960
If this matter gets publicly known, we then will become
mad people that can be righteously killed by anyone.

9
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,180
Yet you say that this person is a side character?

10
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,750
Sect Leader, please don't worry. Currently,
the entire Xiao family has already been exterminated .

11
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,130
Even if someone were to head out and rescue him,

12
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,140
what good would he attain?

13
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,150
The Fight Qi Continent is very realistic,
Sect Leader.

14
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:50,060
Do you remember that Xiao Yan and Yanran

15
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,730
set a three year agreement?

16
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,590
I was present at the scene back then.

17
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,020
That brat, Xiao Yan, is a big talker.

18
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,420
They, father and son, were such a joke at that time.

19
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,540
Do you think that child will come?

20
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,170
Come?

21
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,850
Even if you let him,
he still may not necessarily come.

22
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,940
Recently, Nalan Yanran has also received training from you.

23
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,010
She learned both exceptional skills from the Nalan family
and the Cloud Mist Sect.

24
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,220
That child is not her match.

25
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,680
I'm afraid that he will not come.

26
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,160
We've destroyed the Xiao Clan.

27
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,370
We set up ambushes in

28
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,490
61 areas here in Fight Qi Continent

29
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,340
and took from them 150 lives.

30
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,920
But this kid still fell through the net.

31
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,280
Yes. It is I who is incapable.

32
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,800
I let one slip through.

33
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,370
If you pluck weeds without destroying the roots,

34
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,400
they will just grow again when the spring wind blows.

35
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,310
Sect Leader, please rest assured.
I have already thoroughly planned.

36
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,520
We will mobilize all the strength we can mobilize

37
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,140
and spare no efforts to find him.
If he doesn't come, it's good.

38
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,640
If he comes, he's bound to be captured and imprisoned

39
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,690
with that person.

40
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,790
Then, they father and son can reunite.

41
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,170
If this person is sent away one day earlier,

42
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,370
then I can be at ease one day earlier.

43
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,630
But what's strange is,

44
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,810
has the Xiao Clan's Fight Technique Pavilion
really been burned down?

45
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,600
You are out and about a lot. Have you heard any news?

46
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:59,950
Sect Leader, everything that I do is per your orders.

47
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,980
About investigating the Xiao Clan's Fight Technique Pavilion,
the Thirteen Elders were all there.

48
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,600
They all personally saw the Fight Technique
Pavilion being burned down.

49
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,360
All of the scrolls were burned to ashes.

50
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,850
I did not unauthorizedly take any scrolls.

51
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,750
All of my capabilities were taught
by you, Sect Leader.

52
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,720
I only care for some insignificant skills for refining pellets.

53
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,620
As for things about Fight Qi, I do not care.

54
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,160
So, Sect Leader, please investigate clearly.

55
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,190
Refining medicine is an insignificant skill?

56
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,450
I heard that among the books hidden in the Nalan Clan,

57
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,690
many are high-level alchemy books.

58
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,170
Yes.

59
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,680
When we swallow the Nalan Clan in the future,

60
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,470
those treasures will naturally be yours.

61
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,720
Thank you, Sect Leader.

62
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,970
Uncle Xiao!

63
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,160
Miss Nalan?

64
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,000
Uncle Xiao, was it my master who captured you?

65
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,920
It was the Thirteen Elders of the Cloud Mist Sect.

66
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,230
Thirteen Elders?

67
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,290
No way. They have already been cultivating
in solitude for a long time

68
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,030
and they are all very very good people.

69
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,020
They wouldn't do this.

70
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,550
They killed off all of my clan members

71
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,240
and also imprisoned me here.

72
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,530
Did you offend my master?

73
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:21,950
I have— I have offended the Soul Hall.

74
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,920
I have always felt that there has been
someone going against my Xiao Clan.

75
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:37,400
There were spies covering the whole area, entrenching
themselves in every step, testing us one after the other.

76
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:43,780
I just wasn't sure that it was the Cloud Mist Sect.

77
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,350
It can't be.

78
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,300
My master is against the Soul Hall.

79
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:55,160
He's a tower of strength, wise and resolute.
He's the leader of the five big clans.

80
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,190
He is the most venerable leader. He...

81
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,760
He couldn't have.

82
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,560
He couldn't have.

83
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,670
Does your master know that you came here?

84
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,560
Is it safe? This won't harm you, would it?

85
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,350
Do you remember when back then you and your grandfather
came to the Xiao Clan to reject the marriage?

86
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,400
I made a grand mistake.

87
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:45,790
Before, Gu He contacted me.

88
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:52,260
I knew too that in the Fight Qi Continent,
only the strong are respected.

89
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,820
Your grandfather did so because he had no choice.

90
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,540
I just wanted to vent my anger.

91
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:05,610
I wanted to personally hear him
ask to nullify the marriage.

92
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,170
But I did not expect the two families
to become enemies.

93
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,460
The century old good relation between Nalan Family
and Xiao Family got destroyed just because of this anger.

94
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,980
I regret it so much.

95
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,190
Before Grandfather died, he said...

96
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,500
...he also feels very regretful.

97
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:45,150
A child commits mistakes, so do adults.

98
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:49,100
The mistake of a person
with higher position and stronger power

99
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,800
can deal more harm.

100
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,490
Are you talking about Master?

101
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,060
Not only your Master.

102
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,820
Star Fall Pavilion also has a part in it.

103
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,540
Soul Hall will be winning soon.

104
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,780
Winning without fighting.

105
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,990
Such good methods.

106
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,320
We are not their competition.

107
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,330
I'll personally ask my Master.

108
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:26,300
- Uncle Xiao, I'll get you out of here.
- Don't move.

109
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,370
You don't have such an ability.

110
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,420
Do you want to die here in Cloud Mist Sect?

111
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,220
Uncle Xiao, don't you want to seek revenge?

112
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:02,400
Revenge? That is already not my duty.

113
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,960
Each generation has their mission.

114
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,890
I...have already...

115
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,550
...done my job.

116
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,360
I'm contented.

117
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,620
I don't have any more regrets.

118
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,450
For the future...

119
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,140
Let us just let the future people do the future things.

120
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,930
I just want to have a good sleep.

121
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:37,080
They will send me to Soul Hall very soon.

122
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,110
Xiao Yan will come...

123
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,510
...to fulfill the 3-years agreement.

124
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,680
Uncle Xiao, do you have any words
you want me to relay to him?

125
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,540
None.

126
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,620
None.

127
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,160
I've done what should be done.

128
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,040
Descendants have their own fortune.

129
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,630
Whatever your generation wants to do,

130
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,750
it's your choice.

131
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,200
I want to ask you,

132
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,400
Did your grandfather leave you the Di Tuo Ancient Jade

133
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,150
being passed down in your Nalan Family?

134
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,530
Keep it well.

135
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,440
While the Ancient Jade is in your hands,

136
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,380
you can live longer.

137
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,990
Remember this warning.

138
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,780
- Xun'er, you're here.
- Father.

139
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,810
Eat some snacks.

140
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:37,230
I'm not hungry. You eat.

141
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,320
When I was little,
you and mother wouldn't let me eat these.

142
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,870
Only when there was a guest in our house,

143
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,750
could I sneak into the kitchen at night
and secretly eat the cakes made by the cook.

144
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,520
The house is yours now.
You still steal food?

145
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,460
I thought that once I've become the Dragon Mother,
I don't need to be locked up.

146
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,360
Who knew that there will be more restrictions?

147
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,780
The water and wines placed on the table
are just for display.

148
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,710
I can't really drink them.

149
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,990
When eating, I can only eat a piece of those desserts.

150
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,730
They won't let me eat more.

151
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,230
Even when my neck is itchy,
they won't let me scratch it.

152
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,850
They said that I must look majestic.

153
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,730
You think you're still a child?

154
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:25,380
You are now the Dragon Mother.
Of course, you must follow these rules.

155
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,710
Today, when I was punishing
the Dragon Masters of the Three Islands,

156
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,150
I was shaking inside.

157
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,610
If not because I promised old Dragon Mother
that I would do it,

158
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,220
I might have gotten soft-hearted and would let them go.

159
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,450
Xun'er, you did great.

160
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,340
Father,

161
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:52,590
Old Dragon Mother said that the reason
the Gu Clan is like a pile of loose sand,

162
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,970
and can't be as prosperous as the other clans,

163
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,970
is because we are too lenient. This led to brothers
turning hostile against each other.

164
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:04,030
Starting today, the Gu Clan must reorganize
and implement the laws strictly.

165
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,540
Only by doing that can the Gu Clan get stronger,

166
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,300
can hold sway over Fight Qi Continent.

167
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,550
Father,

168
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,610
you think Old Dragon Mother is right?

169
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,040
Initially, I thought that if our Gu Clan
just hide here far in the ocean,

170
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,930
even if we can't dominate the whole continent,

171
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,610
remaining aloof but continuing existing
in this world is also a good thing.

172
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,700
But now, the claws of Soul Hall
has already infiltrated our clan.

173
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,700
I fear that we can't seek to have
even a small peaceful area anymore.

174
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:50,500
You are now the Dragon Mother, the future of the Gu Clan.
You should put much thought in this.

175
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:56,710
The future of Gu Clan...this goal is too huge.

176
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,660
I dare not think about it.

177
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,950
I only want to return to Ta Ge'er Desert.

178
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,640
Xun'er, I know that this is hard on you.

179
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,240
My heart also aches for you.

180
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,790
But you are from the Gu Clan.

181
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,000
This is your home.

182
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,990
You should put your heart in your home now.

183
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,530
You want to go back because of Xiao Yan, right?

184
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:43,350
Actually, I should go back with you.

185
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,980
Clan Leader Xiao raised you.

186
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,420
These past years, he has been your father.

187
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,820
I should at least go back and thank him.

188
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,100
And in passing, light an incense for your auntie.

189
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,290
When will we set out?

190
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,010
So impatient.

191
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,390
How come you're still like a kid?

192
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:09,450
If you leave now, the Gu Clan will lose its main backbone.

193
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,890
If the situation here that
just got pacified becomes chaotic again,

194
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,900
tell me, what then?

195
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,820
Moreover, their Xiao Clan is currently in danger.

196
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,290
I'm not at ease to let you go back.

197
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,680
Brother Xiao Yan said that he surely will protect me.

198
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,560
Silly child, think about it.

199
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,070
You almost died here in Dragon Island.

200
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,380
How come he didn't come to save you?

201
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,980
He...

202
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,350
He must have his predicaments.

203
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,150
You just don't want me to look for him!

204
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,670
I'm going back now.

205
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,560
Xun'er!

206
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,380
Brother Xiao Yan, where are you?

207
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,730
It will be good if you can be by my side now.

208
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:04,220
I'm not in the mood to
even eat such delicious snacks anymore.

209
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,550
Let's go.

210
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,730
Is what Uncle Xiao said true?

211
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:26,900
Whether it's true or not,
you need to figure that out yourself.

212
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,750
After all these years that I've been here,
I've learned one thing.

213
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,450
It's that you shouldn't believe anyone's words.

214
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,940
I do not believe you either.

215
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,410
Tonight, your Uncle Xiao will be taken away.

216
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,520
Xiao Clan Leader.

217
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:57,290
To walk to where you are at now,

218
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,280
I do not want to see it either.

219
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,930
I have hardships.

220
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,800
What did the Soul Hall give you?

221
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,070
What do you mean?

222
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,730
In terms of fame, you are the leader
of the Five Big Clans of the Fight Qi Continent.

223
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:21,280
Cloud Mist Sect Leader,
your name is already famous across the world.

224
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:28,340
Benefits? The Cloud Mist Sect has several
centuries of inheritance. The family property is plentiful.

225
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:32,750
What can Soul Hall give you?

226
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:39,560
As the ancient people say,
a summer bug cannot speak about winter.

227
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:46,920
For minuscule insects like mosquitoes and flies,

228
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,550
they can only live for one summer.

229
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:57,550
If you told them that the world has winter,
that there is snow in winter,

230
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:00,050
would they believe you?

231
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:04,950
Then, why don't you explain to a small insect like me?

232
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,680
I will believe you.

233
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:12,880
If you do something for me, I will tell you.

234
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,030
Not only will I tell you,

235
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,700
I can also release you.

236
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,700
What can I still do for you in my state?

237
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,640
Even if I wanted to spit on your face,

238
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,850
I don't have the strength for it.

239
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,890
Where is the Xiao Clan's Di Tuo Ancient Jade?

240
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,780
If you just have to take it to your grave,

241
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,220
I have no objections.

242
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,380
You tell me,

243
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,950
why do you want the Xiao Clan's Di Tuo Ancient Jade?

244
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:05,430
Right now, none of us can defeat Hun Miesheng.

245
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,730
Right now, our five clans are not united.

246
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:14,910
Then I can only become the bad person

247
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:18,420
and obtain those five Ancient Jades.

248
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,400
You should know.

249
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:27,640
Those five Ancient Jades are the key
to opening the Fight God's grave.

250
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,480
Inside the grave, it is filled with

251
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,730
martial arts techniques and fight techniques

252
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,480
that can make someone become a Fight God.

253
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:42,850
With them, one can become a Fight God.

254
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:50,480
Only then can we suppress Hun Miesheng.

255
00:25:53,420 --> 00:26:01,800
This will be a grand matter
of the Fight Qi Continent in the future.

256
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,820
During this time,
we shouldn't have another sectarian bias.

257
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,230
If you would be willing to donate for this matter,

258
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:15,000
after I succeed,
I will definitely take revenge for you.

259
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,810
I will even create a large golden statue of you

260
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:24,960
and let the people of the Fight Qi Continent
always remember you.

261
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,870
You say it pretty easily.

262
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:41,330
If you don't cooperate, when the Fight Qi Continent
falls under enemy occupation,

263
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,290
I want to see how you

264
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,360
will confront your ancestors.

265
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,020
Who would I confront?

266
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,620
My clan members have been wiped out by you.

267
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:57,160
Don't worry. I really have understood.

268
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,250
You understand?

269
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,290
I understand.

270
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,450
My knowledge is short.

271
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,490
So you had such wild ambition.

272
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,710
No wonder Hun Miesheng will win.

273
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,820
What do you mean?

274
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:20,720
Hun Miesheng did not really give you benefits.

275
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,790
He has pulled up the darkness in your hearts.

276
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:31,320
The will of the people is vicious.
Even a respected sage like you isn't immune.

277
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,230
I have no more words to say.

278
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,330
Okay.

279
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:43,330
Then you wait to be hung high inside the Soul Hall.

280
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:46,130
Enjoy the scenery.

281
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,290
The matter with the Xiao Clan
was not resolved cleanly.

282
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:15,380
That's right. That brat escaped too quickly,

283
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,260
making us unable to find him.

284
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:22,580
However, we do have some clues.

285
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:26,810
He made a three year agreement with Nalan Yanran.

286
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,250
The day is coming soon.

287
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,380
Is it your disciple?

288
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,960
Yes, yes. She is still a child.

289
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,630
Do not make any more mistakes.

290
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,350
Come out.

291
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:49,620
Master.

292
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,170
Don't mess around anymore.

293
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:55,180
If it weren't for me protecting you earlier,

294
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,290
Lord Fan would have taken you long ago.

295
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:03,560
You young lady, you really have some guts.

296
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,270
Go back.

297
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:31,060
What else do you want to tell me?

298
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:36,970
Master, are you going to kill me?

299
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:44,150
I taught you the highest sword technique in our clan.

300
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:48,550
After the wedding,
I plan to seclude myself and practice.

301
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,990
The leader is yours.

302
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,370
Why would I kill you?

303
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,390
I don't want to be the leader,
I want to go back to Yin City.

304
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:11,600
Back to Yin City? Back to Nalan Family?

305
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,010
Close the door and be carefree?

306
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,210
Then you are waiting for your own death.

307
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,810
You think your family has anyone left?

308
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,610
Your dad is not a good material
for Fight Practitioners.

309
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:39,960
Your two uncles were killed by you.

310
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,330
Your foundation is not stable,
who can help you?

311
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:47,790
Do you know that how many people
in your Nalan family

312
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:53,000
were actually working for the Soul Hall?

313
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:04,930
Actually, you always want to merge our family.

314
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,120
Grandfather failed to see this coming.

315
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,020
No.

316
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,500
Your grandfather saw this coming.

317
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,880
Your Nalan Family has a deep root.

318
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,320
He...why would he send you here?

319
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,200
To be my student?

320
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:40,860
Becaue he saw

321
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,130
after we took down the Soul Hall
at that time,

322
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,710
the good fighters in our sect...

323
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:52,680
Sacrificed so much...

324
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:57,360
And me, I m so old.

325
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,630
He sent you here.

326
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,810
To see me die.

327
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,880
When I m dead.

328
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:11,440
Then with your family's power.

329
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,390
He wanted to help you to be the leader of our sect.

330
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:25,780
But too bad, too bad he died before me.

331
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:33,560
You really think I m so easily fooled?

332
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,350
My grandfather is no friend with the Soul Hall.

333
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:41,540
If he is still alive,
he won't stand you working for them.

334
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:46,240
You are a kid after all.

335
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,600
You think black is black.

336
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,790
White is white.

337
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:02,040
A lot of people like me,
or your grandfather

338
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,870
are actually grey.

339
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,790
Grey.

340
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,680
No. You work for the Soul Hall.

341
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,290
Their stooge like you are bad people.

342
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:16,400
So you are good if you work for the Fight God?

343
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,300
And you are evil if you work
for Hun Miesheng?

344
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,990
Fight God is justice and kindness?

345
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:30,120
And Hun Miesheng is pure evil?

346
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:36,570
Who taught you that?
The history is written by the winner.

347
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:43,790
It has been a thousand years
since the Fight God has died.

348
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,800
You are still stupidly loyal to him.

349
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:50,030
Is that worth it?

350
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:59,320
Fight God and Hun Miesheng were brothers.

351
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:05,340
They grew up in a cold place up north.

352
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:12,090
The two brothers worked together
and conquered the whole continent.

353
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:17,690
They awarded heroes, and generals.

354
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,210
Just because of one silly problem.

355
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,990
Fight God

356
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,900
sealed Hun Miesheng

357
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,630
forever.

358
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,200
Now the seal is opened.

359
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,600
Hun Miesheng just wants to take his own stuff back.

360
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,830
Is that wrong?

361
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:46,470
My grandfather and you,
fought with the Soul Hall for years.

362
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,260
You fought with them. Didn't you?

363
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,770
My grandfather said as long as the people work together,
Soul Hall won't win.

364
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:56,150
But they did now. And we failed.

365
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,760
No.

366
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:02,080
Xiao Family is done.

367
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,180
Nalan family is almost done.

368
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:11,320
If our sect keeps fighting.

369
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,170
Then what's the outcome here?

370
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,770
Probably like the Xiao Family.

371
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:23,420
I always wondered.

372
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:34,620
If the continent is without our sect,
what point will there be?

373
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:43,350
Now Hun Miesheng is back.

374
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:49,490
He is the world's greatest fighter
and no one can beat him.

375
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:55,250
Why doesn't he want someone who is royal,

376
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:59,030
who adores him and who worships him?

377
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,020
Then I understand.

378
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,920
You are my favorite student.

379
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:34,150
I will make an exception for you.

380
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,620
If you want to not be in part of this

381
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,530
or not get married, it's fine.

382
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:46,290
You want to go back to Nalan family,
that's fine too.

383
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,520
You have my word.

384
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,090
There's no one who can hurt your family.

385
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,820
Really?

386
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,560
Yes.

387
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:01,020
But you have to give me one thing.

388
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,490
Have you ever heard your grandfather talked about

389
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:11,360
there's this family owned Ancient Jade?

390
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,030
No.

391
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,780
Since you like the dungeon so much.

392
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,120
Good.

393
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:38,600
That place can really make you think.

394
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,160
Spread my word, lock the gate and no one can get out.

395
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,000
Search all the suspicious people in city with weapons.

396
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,550
Yes.

397
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,840
Last night I was almost killed.

398
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,150
It means there are still some people
working for the Soul Hall in this city.

399
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:17,160
Dragon Mother, we are on it already.

400
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,860
Search the palace too.

401
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,890
You have to find the contact for the Soul Hall.

402
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:24,110
Soul Hall sees you as their biggest trouble.

403
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:27,820
It's normal they send people to cause trouble in here.

404
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,690
And they are in the shadow,
we are under the light.

405
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:33,320
If you want to find out about this,
we have to do it in discreet.

406
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,590
If we rush things,
maybe we are doing exactly what they wanted.

407
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,530
Where is fourth uncle?

408
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:50,980
To answer your question,
he called in sick today.

409
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,600
What kind of sick?
Did you send anyone to see it?

410
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:03,080
Dad, she is in now.

411
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,620
Dragon Mother, I m honored to see you.

412
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:24,940
Fourth uncle, are you sick?
I m Xun'er.

413
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,440
I m sick.

414
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,540
Did you ask for the doctor?

415
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,280
Yes.

416
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,190
It's just medicine for bone fracture and bruises.

417
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:45,420
Uncle, who did you fight with?

418
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,470
So careless.

419
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,290
Let me see.

420
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,410
What are you doing Xun'er?

421
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,690
I know it's you.

422
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:00,460
Xun'er, what are you doing?

423
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,230
The assassin last night,
the contact from the Soul Hall.

424
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,750
Arrest him right now!

425
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,510
Xun'er, you kid!

426
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,790
Why are you being so disrespectful?

427
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:13,000
Where is my dad? Ask him to come over.

428
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,560
Xun'er, he is your uncle!

429
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,390
Are you going to treat him
like the other dragon masters?

430
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,460
You just not gonna arrest him?

431
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:23,350
Then I won't be your Dragon Mother anymore.

432
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,010
Listen to her.

433
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,140
You come in, and take him away.

434
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,950
I...Dad!

435
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,770
Stay out of this.

436
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,490
-You guys be careful!
-Be Careful!

437
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:41,980
Dad!

438
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,630
Second uncle.
-What happened?-

439
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:50,390
Third Uncle, Dragon Mother arrested my dad,
saying he is the contact for the Soul Hall.

440
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:53,090
Dad, dad!
