3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,700
We don't want to rent it. Not renting it anymore!
Although your shop is big,

4
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,000
the location isn't good.
It's also too expensive.

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
- We don't want to rent it. Not renting it anymore. Let's go...
- Indeed so...

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,600
Yeah, I know someone at the Department of Alchemy

7
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,900
who can rent us a shop front
at a much cheaper rate.

8
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,000
Why didn't you say it earlier?
How much is it?

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,700
It's only several hundred energy talismans per day.
Let's go...

10
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,200
Let's go. That's much cheaper.

11
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,900
Let's go. We're not renting.
Not renting anymore.

12
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,000
Senior,

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
whether we'll rent or not, we'll figure it out. But even if
we can't make a deal, we should maintain friendly relations.

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,600
This is the High Level Gather Qi Powder medicine
that was refined by my Brother Xiao Yan.

15
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,500
Eat it and you will elevate your Fight Qi
to another stage right away.

16
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,700
It can also last for two hours.

17
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,800
Why didn't you bring out such a good item earlier?

18
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,000
Elevate to another stage of Fight Qi?

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,300
This can't be real, right?

20
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,200
Originally, I didn't want to waste even one pill.

21
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,000
Brother Xiao Yan worked very hard to refine these.
I was planning on selling all of them.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,300
Are you saying it's a waste for me to eat it?

23
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,600
No. Senior, just try it.

24
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,800
It works great.

25
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,600
It's not going to kill anyone, right?

26
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Shouldn't be too dangerous, I think.

27
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,500
Two-Star Fight Master. Impressive.

28
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,800
It's quite interesting.

29
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,400
Previously, I'd bought some from the Medicine Sect.

30
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,600
They also told me it could elevate
my Fight Qi to the next stage.

31
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,400
But it was not factually true.
Yours here is authentic and the price is fair.

32
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,800
How much does one cost?

33
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,600
Three hundred! We are planning on
selling one pellet for 300 energy talismans.

34
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,100
It's cheaper by half the price
than the Medicine Sect.

35
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,400
Let's do this.

36
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,800
Give me twenty pellets of medicine each time
and I won't collect any rent.

37
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,500
As for the shop front,
all of you can occupy half of it.

38
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,700
- That's great...
- Thank you, Senior. Thank you...

39
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,200
That's great.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,300
Hao Tian, go back and help Brother Xiao Yan
to refine the medicine.

41
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,900
Hu Jia and Lin Xiuya, stay here and tidy up the store.
Sell the medicine first.

42
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,600
Next, we can rotate our work shifts in the afternoon.

43
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,100
- Agreed.
- Leave this to me.

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
After learning alchemy for so many years,

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,900
I would be better off learning Fight Qi instead.

46
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,000
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,800
Come... Be careful.

48
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,100
Today, I'm too tired. Let's stop here.

49
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,800
Thank you for the hard work.

50
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,290
You are back.

51
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,600
Already refined so much medicine?

52
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,400
Don't you want to live?

53
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,200
Why do you look like a corpse?

54
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,400
Have a pill.

55
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,200
I won't eat it.
I will just meditate later and I'll be fine.

56
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,400
How is it today? Made much money?

57
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,300
We made more than ninety thousand!

58
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,900
We can use the money to change
the floor and the wood on the wall!

59
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,200
Right, and the winding hallway that Xun'er wanted.

60
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,000
If it's not enough, we can sell these.

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,200
And if it's still not enough,
I will refine some more.

62
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,800
I... I don't want the winding hallway.
You will die if you work like this.

63
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,770
He uses his Fight Qi to light the fire.
Who could endure that kind of firing?

64
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,200
Xiao Yan, you didn't go to the market today.

65
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,200
There's a huge crowd of seniors
who jostle each other to buy our medicine.

66
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,800
Across from us, there's the Medicine Sect's medicine store.

67
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Guess how they did?
They couldn't even sell any of their medicine.

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,350
Sect Leader, we have a guest.

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,900
Guest?

70
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,300
Good morning, juniors.

71
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,850
I am Han Xian from the Medicine Sect.
I'm here to meet and pay my respect officially.

72
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,800
Who is Sect Leader Xiao?

73
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,600
I am.

74
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,500
About this matter, I'm the one at fault.

75
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,000
I didn't know you were also
in the business of selling pellet medicine.

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If I had known about the medicinal ingredients
and the need for a shop front earlier,

77
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,900
I would have taken care of those matters for you.

78
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,300
There's no need for you all
to go through so much trouble.

79
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,200
Now that we have acquainted ourselves,
we will be a family from now on.

80
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,600
If you encounter any difficulty,
come and look for the Medicine Sect.

81
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,670
In that case, many thanks to Sect Leader Han.

82
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,520
I have a few words
that are unpleasant to listen to,

83
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,400
that I'd like to discuss with you.

84
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,300
Please go ahead.

85
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,900
The Medicine Sect had over eighty leaders before me.

86
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,700
We have been providing all kinds of pellet medicines
for the students of Jia Nan Academy.

87
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:18,000
Our Medicine Sect disciples are all directly
taught by the Pellet King, Elder Gu He.

88
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,950
So, everyone trusts and accepts us.

89
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,700
But I realized only today

90
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:28,200
that there are some juniors here
who are also working on the same product.

91
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,500
The price is surprisingly cheaper than mine by half.

92
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,800
Are you all here trying to purposely
trample all over our Medicine Sect's store?

93
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,000
Or that you have a criticism of our Medicine Sect?

94
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,800
This is our fault. We just started to sell medicine.

95
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,700
We still don't have enough confidence
in the medicines we refine.

96
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,200
That's why we're selling it at such a low price.

97
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,600
We won't do that in the future.
Please forgive us, Sect Leader Han.

98
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,400
Also, where did you get your medicines?

99
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
Did you refine them yourself?

100
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,500
Are you a student from the Department of Alchemy?

101
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,600
Is your name on Elder Gu He's list of direct disciples?

102
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,000
A bunch of newly enrolled students
out here selling medicine?

103
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,500
And you are also not from the Medicine Sect.

104
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,100
If anyone really ends up being sick or suffers
any side effects due to their consumption of your medicine,

105
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,550
is the fault on you

106
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,000
or on me?

107
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Of course, the fault is on me.

108
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,670
If anyone has any problems
after taking Yan Sect's medicine,

109
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,500
it will all be my personal responsibility.

110
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,600
Yan Sect? It's just a name.

111
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,200
Why not have the Yan Sect just directly
become part of our Medicine Sect?

112
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,900
Just hang our Medicine Sect's banner in your store
and that will take care of the problem.

113
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,799
From then on, 40% of your profits
from the sale of your medicine will be mine.

114
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,799
That way, everyone will be in solidarity
and we can all get rich together.

115
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,200
40% share for you? Are you trying to rob us?

116
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,430
Is a banner from the Medicine Sect
worth that much?

117
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,800
Although our Yan Sect is small,

118
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,800
we have never thought of merging with any other sect.

119
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,300
You can walk on the paths of the world and so can I.

120
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,200
Sect Leader Han, thanks again for your good intentions.

121
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,900
If you merge with us,

122
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,360
I will let you
be the Second Leader of the Medicine Sect.

123
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,200
That should be fine, right?

124
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,200
Why don't you come over to us instead?
Come and be Yan Sect's Second Leader.

125
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,200
Right. Yes.

126
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,000
Xiao Yan! Don't be disrespectful
when respect is given!

127
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,200
You just got into the academy and you want to
trample all over our Medicine Sect's store?

128
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,300
Let me tell you, you are too young!

129
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,000
Don't think that a few of you, first years,
can gain any result from it.

130
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,400
It's no big deal to have fought in the water room.

131
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,500
Those were just worthless seniors.

132
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,100
What the real side of Jia Nan academy looks like,

133
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,700
you haven't seen it yet.

134
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,400
This is the Medicine Sect's "fight challenge" letter.

135
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,460
To defend the reputation of the Medicine Sect,

136
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,100
I will see you in the ring.

137
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,200
If you don't dare to take up the challenge,

138
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,600
don't ever step foot in the marketplace again.

139
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,800
Let's go.

140
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,000
What is Han Xian's rank?

141
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,700
He is just a Three-Star Fight Master.

142
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,000
Th-Three-Star Fight Master?

143
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,500
We are in trouble, again.

144
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,580
What's going on?

145
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,420
Students, our weekly Feibo show will start very soon.

146
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,620
Next, let's give a round of applause to welcome

147
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,070
the academy's gold host, Feibobo, to the stage!

148
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,140
Good...

149
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,380
All right. Enough. Hello, my fellow students!

150
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,880
I am your Bobo!

151
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,970
- Good. Good.
- Good

152
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,980
Bobo!

153
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,980
Wow.

154
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,830
Our weekly Feibo show is sponsored by the Medicine Sect.

155
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,970
The Medicine Sect's Gather Qi Powder can
gather Fight Qi and not let you lose your handsomeness.

156
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,960
- Wow.
- Good.

157
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,620
Thank you for the warm welcome, everyone.

158
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,530
What good news do I have for you today?

159
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,680
Let's welcome...

160
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,520
Honorable Elders, teachers,
and our dear fellow students.

161
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,100
For a very long time, our Medicine Sect has been following
the strict standards and traditions of refining medicine.

162
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,090
Making good, stable, and safe pellet medicines
is the foundation of the sect.

163
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:35,180
Along with a forward-looking initiative by taking
the responsibility to supervise the medicine market.

164
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,120
Thus, receiving great recognition and approval
by the Elders and students in the academy.

165
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,790
Recently, there was a formation
of a new interest group, the Yan Sect.

166
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:48,550
By not abiding by the traditions in refining medicine and
using old improper methods, their products are inferior.

167
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,560
They are selling their inferior products in the marketplace.

168
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,750
A lot of the students and teachers
used their hard earned energy talismans

169
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,290
to buy such home produced pellet medicine
and ended up being fooled and defrauded.

170
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,320
Sect Leader Han Xian of the Medicine Sect tried
to communicate with them in a friendly manner,

171
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,110
but the Yan Sect responded in a disrespectful way
and were not repentant.

172
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,360
They insisted on continuing to refine medicine
with the old methods.

173
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,070
In this situation, in order to create a pure field

174
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,380
in which to work on refining medicines
for the students and teachers of the academy,

175
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,340
we have to show our sword of justice

176
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:22,880
to make them realize their mistakes. Let's have a round
of applause for all the members of the Medicine Sect.

177
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,170
The response from the Yan Sect...

178
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,450
- Here.
- So big?

179
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,840
The response from the Yan Sect is
the Medicine Sect needs a good beating.

180
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,910
All members from the Yan Sect

181
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,010
accept the challenge from the Medicine Sect.

182
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:21,050
- Sect Leader, impressive ability.
- Sect Leader, impressive ability.

183
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,700
You all tell me. How many stars am I at now?

184
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,690
Looks like it's three-star.

185
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,350
No, it looks like four-star.

186
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,430
Can't you tell the difference
between three-star and four-star?

187
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,730
This is clearly four-star.

188
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,780
Back then, who was it that told me

189
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,780
that their medicine wasn't useful?

190
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,330
- It was you, right?
- No, it wasn't.

191
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,610
Who was it? I remember it was you.

192
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,120
I was afraid you'd be unhappy if I told you
that their medicine was useful.

193
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,020
Then you all tell me.

194
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,420
Is their medicine useful

195
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,240
or our medicine useful?

196
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:22,940
You say it.

197
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:25,940
To be honest.

198
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,270
It seems like their medicine

199
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,320
works a little better after consumption.

200
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:46,620
Sect Leader, as the strategist for this sect,
I have a few ideas.

201
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,650
Before I crush your stupid head,

202
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,210
speak now!

203
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:54,460
Number one: We'll all consume their medicine.

204
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,040
You are looking for a beating, aren't you?

205
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,450
Sect Leader, hear me out. Second...?

206
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,990
I won't listen.

207
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,880
I thought you'd have some good ideas.

208
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,610
Sect Leader. In this contest, the limit stated
by both sides is five people from each sect.

209
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,160
There's no difficulty in finding five
Three-Star Fight Masters from within our sect, right?

210
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,730
Then, we consume their medicine to clearly
make sure we are all four-star.

211
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,300
Then, these new students,
no matter how hard they practice,

212
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,110
they will have to listen to our fists.

213
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,060
Once we win, we will confiscate
all their pellet medicine.

214
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,070
How are they going to live from then on?
They will have to come over to beg us.

215
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,320
Then in the future, we will have them produce
the High-Level Gather Qi Powder market products for us.

216
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,060
Not only do we keep the business
in the Medicine Sect,

217
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,820
but we can also earn lots of energy talismans!

218
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,840
Surprisingly, that stupid brain of yours
is actually quite smart. Isn't it?

219
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,190
Let's get on with this matter.

220
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,700
Let's select the people needed and start training.

221
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,180
This Five Spiritual Pythons Formation
was our mercenary army's

222
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,190
most important formation when we were in the
Magical Beast Mountain Range hunting for magical beasts.

223
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,820
Tomorrow, when we are at the challenge,

224
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,550
Han Xian will surely be in the center
and will be protected by his men.

225
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:18,349
So, our triangle formation move could
tear up their defensive formation.

226
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,549
Just like tearing a hole opening

227
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,650
to stab right into their core;

228
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,130
thus, separating Han Xian from his men.

229
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,040
Remember, this formation needs everyone's support.

230
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,390
We must not lose our positions.

231
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,810
As long as we make them lose their leader
and become troubled and confused,

232
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,720
we can greatly destroy their morale.

233
00:17:37,569 --> 00:17:39,920
Brother Xiao Yan, I'm fast.

234
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,510
I can attract the enemies at the front.

235
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,100
And you can use the Mystical Heavy Ruler
to break them down one-by-one.

236
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,910
Good.

237
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,210
Being fast is useless.

238
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,400
The key is to have more Qi and apply more pressure.

239
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,610
These few are not doing this for the first time, like us.

240
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:58,580
Don't know how many times they have fought.
Once the Fight Qi energy is blocked, no one can get through.

241
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,070
I think it's better if I am in front,
breaking down their defense with my spear.

242
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,970
"The leader has to be caught first."
I will attack Han Xian first.

243
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,320
Xun'er and Lin Xiuya will attack simultaneously.

244
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,750
Hu Jia, you will cover us from behind

245
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,610
and protect Hao Tian as well.

246
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,230
I won't have the time to protect him.

247
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,970
Xiao Yan, can't you find a few capable ones
to go to the challenge?

248
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,900
Listen to yourself. During the contest,

249
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,750
you are allowed to consume pellet medicine.

250
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,210
In our Yan Sect, the best and the fastest
pellet medicine seeker

251
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,330
is Hao Tian.

252
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,670
We can't find anyone better than him.

253
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,260
Of course! I can help all of you
to supplement your lives.

254
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,210
I will definitely not get into any trouble!

255
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,070
It's settled then.

256
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:43,570
I will attack Han Xian first.
Xun'er and Lin Xiuya will attack simultaneously.

257
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,230
Lin Xiuya, you can use the most aggressive
Fight Qi skills to guard the frontline.

258
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,580
Xun'er, you are fast,
so you will attack these two quickly.

259
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,320
Hu Jia, you will reinforce
Xun'er and me in the front, and

260
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,070
also protect Hao Tian in the back.

261
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,140
This way, we will always have a backup support,
and be able to attack or retreat freely.

262
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,480
- Good...!
- Good...!

263
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,780
But Xun'er and I are Nine-Star Fight Practitioners,

264
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,900
Hu Jia is an Eight-Star. But Hao Tian...

265
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,120
has only just progressed to the Fight Practitioner stage.

266
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,750
Our five opponents are all Three-Star Fight Masters.

267
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,760
It will be a hard bone to gnaw on.

268
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,400
Right, it is not easy to gnaw on that.

269
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,120
Since it's difficult to gnaw on it,
we'll just swallow it.

270
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,630
Hehe.

271
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,980
If I eat two High-Level Gather Qi Powder medicine at once,

272
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,870
will I directly progress two levels?

273
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:41,230
Then, if you ate eighty at once,
wouldn't you directly become a Fight Sage?

274
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,680
Is that even possible?

275
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,770
A human body can only contain a limited level of Fight Qi.

276
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:52,460
Each pill of our Yan Sect's High-Level Gather Qi Powder
can improve your Fight Qi by one stage for two hours.

277
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,290
But if you have three or four at once,

278
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,430
that would be suicide. Your vital channels and your body

279
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,010
will go "boom!" and explode straight away.

280
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,520
Then your insides will spew out all over us.

281
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,880
No one could even bury you.

282
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,270
So disgusting.

283
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:29,060
This is the core secret of Flame-Splitting
Wave-Devouring Ruler's third pattern. Memorize it.

284
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:35,140
I can memorize it. But with such a heavy thing in hand
and having to use it above water is too difficult.

285
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,300
As long as you free up your heart and make it
become a void, you can lift anything.

286
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,990
Let me ask you. What do plants need to survive?

287
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,420
Sunlight and water.

288
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,680
Then, why are there plants that can survive

289
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,330
in dark, dry places?

290
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,760
Why can rainstorms flood and destroy a city,

291
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,800
and lightning split a rocky mountain?

292
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,160
That's because there is a natural form
of energy all around us.

293
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,990
It's bigger than anything you can imagine.

294
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:13,540
You need to erase the bias in your heart
in order to feel it.

295
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,590
To harness Fight Qi energy

296
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,310
is to harness the natural energy in the universe.

297
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,840
Understand?

298
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,790
Understood.

299
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,990
Can you see that waterfall?

300
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,530
All right. Go stop it.

301
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,020
What?

302
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,240
Go ahead. You can do it.

303
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:49,640
As long as you believe it can be stopped,
it will stop.

304
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:36,060
Hold in your Fight Qi and stop fighting against it.

305
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,450
Imagine yourself as a rock.

306
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,950
A rock that has been underground

307
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,890
in a deep slumber for a millennium.

308
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,850
This rock needs a bath now.

309
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,990
Wake up! Wake up!

310
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:05,540
Lin Xiuya! Hu Jia! Xun'er!

311
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,530
Lin Xiuya! Lin Xiuya! Lin Xiuya!

312
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,590
He is not usually a heavy sleeper.
What happened to him?

313
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,170
- Lin Xiuya?
- Lin Xiuya?

314
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,310
Why is his body so warm?

315
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,250
He has a fever.

316
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,820
Everyone has been overly exhausted
these past few days.

317
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,380
I am fine. Don't leave me behind.

318
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,790
Where is Xiao Yan?

319
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,790
I will go look.

320
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:43,370
Brother Xiao Yan! Brother Xiao Yan!

321
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:47,740
Brother Xiao Yan! The fight will start in two hours.

322
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,440
Brother Xiao Yan's not opening his door.

323
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,390
What should we do?

324
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,760
- Brother Xiao Yan?
- Brother Xiao Yan?

325
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,550
- His breathing feels even.
- Why can't he wake up?

326
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:19,230
We are done for.
All of our good ones are "paralyzed."

327
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,730
What is he working on?

328
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,340
Lin Xiuya is probably no good, either.

329
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,990
I've got an idea.
Let's carry Brother Xiao Yan over there.

330
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,150
Why?

331
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:37,610
He said he would participate. Then,
he will definitely be able to participate.

332
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,300
Wait. Let me think.

333
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,870
Without Lin Xiuya, four against five
is still manageable for a win.

334
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,990
What if Xiao Yan can't participate in
the fight and I'm useless trash?

335
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,330
We should just quit.

336
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,900
What are you talking about?

337
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,550
Let's carry him!

338
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:16,700
Han Xian...!

339
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:49,700
-Han Xian!
-The Medicine Sect!

340
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,550
This person looks good.
What a special entrance!

341
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:00,140
He probably has big moves to get Han Xian
to pass out with one fist.

342
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,380
Look! What an entrance!

343
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,600
Look, it's such fun.

344
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,510
Xiao Yan! Why are you still not awake.

345
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,830
We should probably get him out of here.

346
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,990
The whole audience will jeer at us.

347
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:42,270
What if he wakes up? He can't fight
if he is not in the ring.

348
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,860
But even if we carried him here,
we still can't let him go and fight first.

349
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,240
Then we will change our plan.

350
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,090
Put him in Hao Tian's position.

351
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:54,630
I will fight first, you second, Hao Tian last.

352
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,320
If he wakes up, he can still help us.

353
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,680
- If he can't, it still won't hurt
if he's placed in the rear. - Okay.

354
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,730
Brothers, good morning.

355
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,080
Sect Leader Xiao.

356
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,050
Sect Leader Xiao?

357
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,990
What happened to him?

358
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,610
Did he faint due to fear?

359
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,760
- Yes!
- Yeah!

360
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,180
Yes, he did.

361
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,390
He is practicing his martial arts skills.

362
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:34,230
Practicing his martial arts skills now?
Isn't it too late?

363
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,420
I saw them carrying this "Buddha" from afar.

364
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,600
Sect Leader Xiao, you made quite an entrance!

365
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,840
You!

366
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,560
Xiao Yan!

367
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,800
How can you fight like this?

368
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,500
Go home!

369
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,430
Why are there just the four of you?

370
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,690
What happened to him? Is the fight on or not?

371
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,350
He will wake up.

372
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,870
If he doesn't wake up after a while,

373
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:30,210
it will be you three against five.

374
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:35,000
Are you sure you will not employ another person?

375
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,180
Let me reiterate the principles.

376
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,600
Weapons have no eyes, fists and kicks are heartless.

377
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,890
During the fight,
if anyone is seriously injured or dying,

378
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,590
I will intervene to help save the person.

379
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,810
Other than that, the judge will not intervene.

380
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:13,330
All right, now I need to examine your weapons.

381
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,630
Where is your weapon, Hao Tian?

382
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,940
This is it.

383
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,950
I can fight and defend myself with it.

384
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:10,050
Good!

385
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,620
Attack!

386
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,200
Xun'er! Hu Jia! Catch!

387
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,820
Xiao Yan! Xiao Yan! Xiao Yan!

388
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,840
Hurry. Wake up!

389
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:49,320
Xiao Yan! Wake Up! Quick!

390
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,660
- Sect Leader. That was a good move!
- That was a good move, Sect Leader!

391
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:21,200
Xiao Yan! Hurry. Wake up!

392
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,560
I'll give it all I have now!

393
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,200
Go!

394
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,700
I will help you fight back.

395
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,400
Xiao Yan.

396
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:32,000
Flame-Splitting Wave-Devouring Ruler!

397
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,100
You are seeking death.

398
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,900
Don't you know?

399
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,100
Flame-Splitting Wave-Devouring Ruler!

400
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,600
- Xiao Yan!
- Xiao Yan!

401
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,600
Yan Sect wins.

402
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,660
- Xiao Yan!
- Let's go.

403
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:14,030
- Xiao Yan!
- Xiao Yan!

404
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,800
Classmates, the result of the challenge is out.

405
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,400
We officially believe that the Medicine Sect
under Han Xian's leadership

406
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,800
has been using their power to take advantage
of other weaker and smaller sects.

407
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,200
Any attempt to dominate on campus is wrong.
With this fight,

408
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,900
we see that victory belongs to the just.
A round of applause.

409
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,600
Good.

410
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,400
So whose medicine is more useful?

411
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,400
- That...
- That's right. Yes.

412
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,700
So whose medicine is more useful?

413
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,400
Let me explain. Let me explain.

414
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,600
Now, the Student's Council has officially signed a sale
and purchase contract with the Yan Sect.

415
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:56,300
It's a 20% discount to buy it through the Student's Council.
A round of applause, please.
