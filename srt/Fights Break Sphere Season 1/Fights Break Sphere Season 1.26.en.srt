3
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,910
Thinking about these grudges...

4
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,780
It's as if there is limitless energy,

5
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,100
and limitless Fight Qi.

6
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,810
Very good.

7
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,470
Set off these hatreds

8
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,060
and your Fight Qi will increase several times faster.

9
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,080
This is a big secret.

10
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,480
Compared to a pretentious kindness,

11
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,340
hatred is more realistic.

12
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,660
It can make you feel that you are still alive.

13
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,620
Brother Xiao Yan.

14
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,390
Brother Xiao Yan...

15
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,680
You're awake.

16
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,280
I brought some food here.
You haven't eaten for several days.

17
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,820
Eat something.

18
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,020
Where is Elder Tengshan? How is he?

19
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,300
He's better.

20
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,240
What's wrong, Xun'er?

21
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,890
Why are you looking at me like that?

22
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,760
I am not some evil god.

23
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,230
Don't describe yourself like that.

24
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,010
Eat something.

25
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,810
I'm going now.

26
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,250
Don't go!

27
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,700
For whom am I cultivating hard every day
and dueling with others?

28
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,360
How come when you see me, it's as if you've seen
a ghost?! Do you hate to stay with me that much?!

29
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,950
Everyone is grateful to you,

30
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,630
but what really are you doing?

31
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,350
You don't pay attention when people talk to you.
When I call you, it's as if you don't hear me.

32
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:01,470
After so many days,
I've finally heard you say something,

33
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,430
yet you're losing your temper.

34
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,500
Haven't you noticed
that everyone doesn't want to approach you?

35
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,960
Why? Why?

36
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,500
Have I been like this for several days?

37
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,070
These past few days,
it's as if you're someone else.

38
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,710
You totally were not acting like a human.

39
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:29,200
Not eating. Not sleeping.
Not minding everyone.

40
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,040
I was... busy cultivating.

41
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,460
It's very hard.
You also know that to defeat so many people,

42
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,630
it isn't easy.

43
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,460
I know. I want to help you,

44
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,890
but I don't know how.

45
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:56,780
When I come to your room,
I must wear so many clothes.

46
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,510
The other rooms are very comfortable,
but yours is very cold like it's an ice storage.

47
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,170
Look in the mirror.

48
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,200
Do you still look like a human?

49
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,450
Elder Mi Tengshan has already
asked Lin Yizhi to examine you.

50
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,770
He said that you have taken the the evil path

51
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,650
and won't be able to live long.

52
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,150
Fine.

53
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,650
I will walk my own path. Don't worry.

54
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,650
Since I brought you all here to this ghostly place,

55
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,640
I then will take you all out.

56
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,600
Come, hold on to this.

57
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,300
I don't want to.

58
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,590
Xun'er, this ring has a big secret.
Let me tell you—

59
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,740
You want to say that a great master
is living inside it, right?

60
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,380
You lied to me while we were still at home.

61
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,680
You still are going to lie to me now?
You think I'm a child?

62
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,790
How can I lie to you?

63
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,270
This ring is very important.
If I I die—

64
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,370
I don't want to hear you say such nonsense!

65
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,070
Elder Tengshan.

66
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,890
All that is your blood?

67
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,670
After bleeding that much, can you still fight?

68
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,580
I only cut my wrist.

69
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,140
Extend your hand.

70
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,840
What about the one on your arm?

71
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,270
What have you been doing these past few days?

72
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,480
Of course, I was cultivating hard
in order to take you all out of here.

73
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,050
I'm worried that you'll become a demon.

74
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,030
This is the Villain Valley.

75
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,650
This was a demonic domain to begin with.

76
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:24,910
If I don't become a demon, who will?
We can't stay in this place.

77
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,420
Even if I lose my life,
I am going to take everyone out of here.

78
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,049
You feel that you will surely die?

79
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,529
Xun'er already told me.

80
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,760
Lin Yizhi kept finding it strange.

81
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,080
Logically speaking, you should be having
a mental collapse and will die insane.

82
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,810
But you are actually still living right now.

83
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,290
Which great master has sucked out
the noxious air inside your heart?

84
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,300
Elder Tengshan, were the Fight God
and the Hun Miesheng really brothers?

85
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,620
You also know about this?

86
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,680
- It's true?
- For cultivating people in this world,

87
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,920
you, me, the Fight God, and the Hun Miesheng,

88
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,330
we each will experience our own demonic realm.

89
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,160
The more dangerous a demonic realm is,
the higher your achievement will be

90
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,480
after surviving it. Lin Yizhi also said

91
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,110
that he is unable to predict your fate.

92
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:43,100
In my opinion, only you can fully see what your fate is.

93
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,030
Elder Tengshan, I want to know the answer.

94
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,370
This answer...

95
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:11,050
can only be found by you.
The demon is in your heart.

96
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:16,570
Only by defeating it can you climb up to a higher level.
Or else,

97
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,370
you can only die from the predicament
created by your heart's demon.

98
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,610
Inside it, purity and impurity are clearly differentiated.
There is no room for luck.

99
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,550
I once warned you against it, but you still chose
to follow this cultivation path.

100
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,690
Since you've chosen it,
then continue until the end.

101
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:39,980
This fate is yours and only you can control it.

102
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:45,310
Others can't help you.
Just pray for more blessings.

103
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,190
But I'm unable to defeat him.

104
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,750
Who?

105
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,460
Defeating others isn't true ability.

106
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,130
The one you must defeat is yourself.

107
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,450
The greed in your heart. The hatred in your heart.

108
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:14,600
Also, that little bit of luck you have
when you face temptations.

109
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:20,340
Ask yourself, will you be able to defeat all these?

110
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,760
Wear that often,

111
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,370
it will be beneficial for you.

112
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,940
Really?

113
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,910
There is an air of righteousness in Heaven and Earth.

114
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,510
Defilement endows it to become manifold.

115
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,600
Below are the mountains, above are the stars.

116
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,960
This ring is filled with righteous air.

117
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,860
Maybe, it can save your life.

118
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,130
Xun'er.

119
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,790
I don't want to see you.

120
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,980
My temper earlier was bad.

121
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,370
I'm here to apologize. Please forgive me.

122
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,230
I can forgive you. No matter what you do,

123
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:06,740
I'll forgive you. I just don't know...

124
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,910
You don't know what?

125
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,980
I don't know how you're going to forgive yourself.

126
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,070
When we were in the Jia Nan Academy,
whenever you won,

127
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,970
I could happily shout until my throat hurt.

128
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,930
But now, every time I see you fight,

129
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,720
I only feel suffocated.

130
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,110
You have become the same color as this place.

131
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,880
I know that you are fighting hard for all of us.

132
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,540
But what you're doing is really wrong.

133
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,060
I'm afraid... that even when you eventually win,

134
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,520
you won't leave with us.

135
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,510
If I indeed became like that, what would you do?

136
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,750
I won't let you stay here.

137
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,020
I will kill you with my own sword.

138
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,200
Xun'er.

139
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,000
I have never thought of staying here.

140
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,990
That's what you think,
but will you be able to do it?

141
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,850
Xun'er,

142
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,930
can you stop pressuring me?

143
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,720
Just a while ago,

144
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,030
I suddenly felt so much hatred toward my mother.

145
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,980
I also hated my father.

146
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,200
I even hated you.

147
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,030
I felt as if the whole world was going against me.

148
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,410
I felt I was full of hatred.

149
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:26,560
Lin Yizhi said that he doesn't want to
hear others call him Saint Hands.

150
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,760
I also have the same feeling now.

151
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,580
But I know...

152
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:44,380
this is wrong.
I definitely won't become like that.

153
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,480
But... if that day really comes,

154
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,550
you must indeed kill me.

155
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,190
Brother Xiao Yan, tell me.
What is really going on?

156
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,370
Is the Soul Hall Technique turning you into this?

157
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,350
Tell me. Let's think of a way together.

158
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,210
I've thought about it.

159
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,010
I won't come again.

160
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,190
I won't join your evil path.

161
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,920
All right then. Defeat me and you can leave.

162
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,540
If you can't, then you'll stay.

163
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,350
Quite interesting.

164
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,350
Look very well.
This a new technique of the Mystical Heavy Ruler:

165
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,120
Fleeting Snowfield.

166
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,140
Did you see it clearly?

167
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,570
I can't.

168
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:18,410
The Mystical Heavy Ruler wins through strength.
It is huge, therefore it is heavy.

169
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:21,550
But that is just its crude and superficial realm.

170
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,350
For this move, you have to invest all your Fight Qi into it,

171
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,920
so that you can manipulate the ruler with your qi.
Carry it as if it were just very light.

172
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,230
This form includes fourteen kinds of stances.

173
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:41,730
By pairing your Fight Qi and Essence Flame,
you must move quickly to the front and the back.

174
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:47,360
Everything is being done by your mind.
Your opponents will all just become nothingness, a void.

175
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,200
Everything becomes just a void.

176
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,600
I couldn't see you become void.

177
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,590
Do you know why?

178
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,120
Because I have the intention to kill.
Once I have this intention,

179
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,610
the opponent is just a piece of live jumping meat.

180
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,560
Is it that hard to wield your sword
and chop off a piece of meat?

181
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,230
All those people in the arena are just meat.

182
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,670
If you think of them in that way,
what is there to be afraid of?

183
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,660
Intention to kill.

184
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,330
I can kill them.

185
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,280
I can kill them.

186
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,250
But I'm unable to formulate this intention to kill.

187
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,810
Why? Why can't I initiate it?

188
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,070
Never expected that I would end up
teaching a benevolent student.

189
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,560
It's your choice if you're going to learn it or not.
But if you lose,

190
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:08,550
it will be hard for you all to ever see the sun again.

191
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,830
This ruler technique I passed on to you

192
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:17,260
has a fundamental cultivation chant. Listen well.

193
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:21,610
If you don't want to die,
then someone else must first die.

194
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,390
What do you mean?

195
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:27,360
If you don't kill anyone,
your level will not improve.

196
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,760
Only by having a lot of experiences
will you learn the angle and strength needed

197
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,400
to kill a person in the quickest manner.

198
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,200
Kill him. Kill him. Kill him.

199
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,800
Elder. Elder.

200
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,600
We're powerless to do anything.

201
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:50,500
Kill him. Kill him. Kill him.

202
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,700
Xiao Yan.

203
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,000
Kill him. Kill him. Kill him.

204
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Xiao Yan.

205
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,400
Kill him. Kill him. Kill him.

206
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,200
Xiao Yan.

207
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,700
Xiao Yan.

208
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,500
Xiao Yan.

209
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,600
Xiao Yan.

210
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,700
Young one, you even dare to sleep.

211
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,200
Tomorrow's the last fight.

212
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,800
Today, I will pass on the last maneuver to you.

213
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,800
You will now have both the high-level Fight Techniques
of the Star Fall Pavilion and Soul Hall.

214
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:50,200
Even within a hundred years, it’s hard to
come across a youngster as lucky as you.

215
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,600
Tomorrow, do we also have to
fight a round against one another?

216
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,200
Of course. If you lose,

217
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,000
your spirit will belong to me.

218
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Your friends will leave the Villain Valley.

219
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,600
You will stay here to keep me company.

220
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,600
What do you think of staying here
and being a wandering spirit that cannot die?

221
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,400
I don't want to keep you company.

222
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,500
I only want to kill you.

223
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,700
Why is that?

224
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,100
I heard my mother calling me today.

225
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,800
She followed justice throughout her entire life
and stood against Soul Hall.

226
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,200
So if I, in the end, become a follower of Soul Hall,

227
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,600
I won't be able to face my mother.

228
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,200
Far more than your mother,

229
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,500
the Five Clans are all idiots.

230
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,100
Can you name anyone in the world,

231
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,800
who can match my way of doing things?

232
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,400
There's no one.

233
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,000
Of course, you'll have the ability
to stay here and keep me company,

234
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,100
then you will have that supreme honor and glory.

235
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,800
Once I finish fighting tomorrow's match,

236
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,800
I won't be coming back.

237
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,730
As a man of character, I came to clear up something.

238
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,800
I will first explain something to you.

239
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,600
What do you want to say?

240
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,700
Anyone who stays here for a long time,

241
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,700
will become like you sooner or later.

242
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,100
Even if I can't kill you,

243
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,200
then the least I can do is to influence my own life.

244
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,700
I would rather commit suicide than sell my soul to you.

245
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,200
Why do you hate me that much?

246
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,200
Is it because your mother died?

247
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,000
Then what if I give you a great gift?

248
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,600
Would you be able to reconcile with me?

249
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,400
Let my mother live again?

250
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,200
How is that difficult?

251
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:04,300
If it's not so, then I cannot demonstrate my power.

252
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,500
Mother, don't leave.

253
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,700
Come.

254
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,400
At home, listen to your father.

255
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,400
Practice hard. Mother will return home very soon.

256
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,600
No, don't go! You can't go!

257
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,400
As a man,

258
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,800
how can you cry over every little thing?
You're like a mucus worm.

259
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,000
Mother... Mother... Don't go...

260
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,400
Fine. Mother won't go.

261
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,300
Really?

262
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,200
I just thought about it. Our child is still young.

263
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,600
Those that are going this time are all masters.

264
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,000
I would rather let them mock me than leave.

265
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
That's great. Are you really not going?

266
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,200
I really won't go.

267
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,400
Mother has to watch you grow up.
I can't miss even a single day.

268
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,800
How wonderful! Mother isn't going.

269
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,000
Let's head back then.

270
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,850
I...

271
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,400
Who are you?

272
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,400
How annoying.

273
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,600
Nalan. Nalan Yanran?

274
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,400
Turn your eyes forward.
Watch the road, not me.

275
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,800
No, we're about to get married.

276
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,100
So? Are you feeling regret?

277
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,600
This can't be. Your grandfather hates me so much.
He wouldn't allow this.

278
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,600
You're speaking nonsense.
My grandfather loves you dearly.

279
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,700
Be careful. Speak poorly of him
and I'll report it back to him.

280
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,300
First, bow to pay respect to Heaven and Earth.

281
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,500
Second, bow to pay respect to your parents.

282
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,200
Xiao Yan, from now on, you are an adult.

283
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,100
So I will rely on you to manage our Xiao family business.

284
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,400
Isn't that all right?

285
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,800
Snap out of your daze.

286
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,000
Silly boy, kowtow to Lord Taishan,
kowtow to grandfather.

287
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,700
That's right.

288
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:57,420
Don't be nervous.
It's not like I will eat you.

289
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,000
Although I am marrying off my granddaughter,
it's still difficult to bear.

290
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,800
But the Nalan and the Xiao families
have had a friendship for a hundred years.

291
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,440
The Nalan family is the same as the Xiao family.

292
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,800
The Xiao family is the same as the Nalan family.

293
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,400
This way, it's like I'm not sending her out of the family.

294
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,600
Wouldn't you all agree?

295
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

296
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,120
Xiao Yan, I don't have any grandsons.

297
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,400
But having you as a grandson-in-law,

298
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,600
my old heart is relieved.

299
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,300
Grandfather doesn't have anything special to give to you.

300
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,300
How about this? Among the Fight Techniques
in our Hidden Scriptures Pavilion,

301
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,600
I'll give you free rein to choose.

302
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,400
In the future, after my lifetime,

303
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,600
Yanran will inherit the position
of Prime Minister of the Empire.

304
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,500
You will be the Leader of the Five Great Clans.

305
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,400
(Third bow...) Husband and wife,
bow to pay respect to one another.

306
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,920
[Wedding]

307
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,200
Everyone, please take good care of my son.

308
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,100
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

309
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,400
Let's go over there to chat for a bit.

310
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,600
Come.

311
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,500
Son, come meet the Medicine Elder.

312
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Medicine Elder. Medicine Elder, you've forgiven me?

313
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,400
I don't believe we've met before.

314
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,600
Son, why are you playing dumb?

315
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,400
It's the first time that
the honored Medicine Elder has come to our house.

316
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,300
Where would you have met him before?

317
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,800
Medicine Elder.

318
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:58,000
Didn't you die a long time ago
while fighting the Soul Hall?

319
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,600
Me... die?

320
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,400
No such thing.
Not only were we able to capture Hun Miesheng,

321
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,100
he even mended his past ways
and has become a good person.

322
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:13,200
Thanks to that,
there are no more evil forces in this world.

323
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
No evil forces?

324
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
Nephew! Nephew!

325
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,800
Han Feng? Medicine Elder!

326
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,000
Come, nephew. Let me have a drink with you.

327
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,800
Senior Sister and I may be from the same sect,

328
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,200
but we seem to be meeting today for the first time.

329
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Right, Senior?

330
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,700
Indeed. Xiao Yan, your Master Uncle
has been with Medicine Elder the longest.

331
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,000
If you have any questions about Fight Techniques,
you can ask him.

332
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You must not. If my skills are half as good as Master's,

333
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
that would be great.

334
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,800
Oh, right. This is our family heirloom jade.

335
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,800
I'll give it to you as a gift today.

336
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,900
How can we accept that? It's too valuable.

337
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,600
You must not refuse it.

338
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,200
You probably don't know this. When I entered our sect,

339
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,800
I was very young. It's all thanks to
Senior Sister for taking care of me.

340
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,000
We are like real siblings.
This is a token of my intentions.

341
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,400
You must accept it. Right, Senior?

342
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,800
Nephew, here.

343
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,199
If you don't accept it, I'll get angry.

344
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:17,499
Here... I wish you marital bliss for hundreds of years.

345
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,980
This is a 7th grade ranked pellet.

346
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,670
I just refined it. When you are in a crisis,

347
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,020
you can use it once.

348
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,870
Aiyo.

349
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:36,730
This... This pellet given by Pellet King Gu He is priceless.

350
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:40,680
Then I will a-accept it on behalf of this young pup.

351
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,889
Don't act like you're being nice. I am Xiao Yan.

352
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:49,669
What's wrong? What are you saying?

353
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,639
This young man is amusing.

354
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,139
Father, didn't I go to Jia Nan Academy?

355
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,750
Your learning is profound. It originates from both of the
authentic Fight Qi techniques of the Xiao and Nalan families.

356
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,390
What teacher in the Jia Nan Academy could teach you?

357
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,200
That's right.

358
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,500
I...

359
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:15,560
Father, the Soul Hall...
Was the Soul Hall really wiped out?

360
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,550
What is wrong with you today?

361
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,230
Didn't Medicine Elder already say that?

362
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:23,480
Soul Hall has been wiped out, the world is at peace.

363
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,090
In the future, be careful when you are walking.

364
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,550
You only need to worry about tripping and falling.

365
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,930
Thank you. Thank you.

366
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:37,930
Xun'er...

367
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:42,230
Mother, where is Xun'er? Why didn't she come?

368
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,050
Xun'er is already married!

369
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:47,390
You haven't even seen her before now.
Why do you keep thinking about her?

370
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,180
It's really you.

371
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:20,760
You fool. Ah... I'm starving.

372
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:51,550
What are you doing?
Why are you being so silly?

373
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,780
This is not what I remembered.

374
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,720
Then what do you remember?

375
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,770
I remember the two of us breaking up.

376
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,190
Your grandfather wouldn't allow you to marry me.

377
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:10,190
Our families even had a big fight.

378
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,950
In the end, you beat me hard.

379
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,620
Are you regretting?

380
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,590
If you are regretting this, tell me early.

381
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,690
No. I...

382
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,920
I don't know.

383
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,140
We are childhood sweethearts.

384
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,410
We are also married now.
You can't run away from me in this life.

385
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,100
Don't even think of it.

386
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,500
You! You only care about sleeping.
Our oldest and our third children were fighting.

387
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,760
Our third child is bleeding from his nose
and you don't even care.

388
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,500
Our third child?

389
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:22,680
Mother.

390
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,150
Why are you not calling your father?

391
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,010
- Father!
- Father!

392
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,400
Master.

393
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,200
Father.

394
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,730
You can clear the account now.

395
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,130
Master.

396
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:57,110
Son, don't work too hard.

397
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:59,850
Father, you should drink less.

398
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:05,180
You better not tell your mother about my drinking.

399
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:10,020
If I drink, she will nag at me... endlessly.

400
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,930
My dear father.
Last year you drank so much,

401
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:19,140
you almost died.
This is for Shop Manager Wan.

402
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,750
Mother is actually--

403
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,770
Father!

404
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:48,350
Mother, don't be sad.

405
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,550
Father left happily.

406
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,890
Aunt.

407
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,170
Cousin Xiao Yan.

408
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:14,850
I came to offer my condolences on behalf of my father.
Aunt, Xiao Yan,

409
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:18,970
sister-in-law Yanran,
you must take care of your health.

410
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:27,970
Xun'er...

411
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,460
You don't remember me?

412
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,750
I remember you!
You're Cousin Xiao Yan.

413
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,650
Did I ever go to Jia Nan Academy with you?

414
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,780
No, you didn't.

415
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,980
What?

416
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,640
Why do I have such a deep impression of it?

417
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,450
You must be too exhausted.
My condolences.

418
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,350
This isn't right.

419
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:10,990
We definitely have seen each other more than once.

420
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,710
Definitely.

421
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:19,930
When we were young, Aunt brought you to Dragon Island.
We met there once.

422
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,740
It was many years ago.

423
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,950
Xun'er,

424
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,210
are you married?
