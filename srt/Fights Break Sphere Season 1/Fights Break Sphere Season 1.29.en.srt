3
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,010
I feel so relieved now that you're back.

4
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:44,850
I'm telling you when you went off to school,

5
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,440
as soon as I heard you were both safe at school,
I was so happy.

6
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,960
Every time I visit your mother's grave,
I tell her that.

7
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,610
After dinner,

8
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,390
let's go visit your aunt

9
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,840
and your mom?

10
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,140
Yes. We'll all go together.

11
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,290
Mother, your son is back.

12
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,350
[Xiao Manor]

13
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:37,330
The business of medicine requires some actual skills.

14
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,400
The way the Xiao family looks now...

15
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,730
They can't even protect their own escort.
They obviously aren't qualified.

16
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,970
What are you talking about?
Everyone gets robbed by bandits.

17
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,740
Let him speak.

18
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,320
My Jialie family hasn't been robbed in ten years.

19
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,920
We hired these three great fighters
from the Cloud Mist Sect.

20
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,700
We made so many great friends.

21
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:11,550
The merchant escort fleet of the Jialie family
is known to be very safe.

22
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,899
That's true. There haven't been any issues
in recent years with your fleet escort.

23
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,670
That's right. Listen to my advice.

24
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:27,780
Why go through all the trouble of staying in
that line of business? You have a large family business.

25
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,670
I can take over your medicine shop's business.

26
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,780
You can sell or rent your shops.

27
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,530
The Jialie family will treat you well.

28
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,770
In my opinion, the Jialie family should...

29
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,570
just sell their medicine shops
to our Xiao Family.

30
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,660
The Xiao family can't even protect
their own fleet escort.

31
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:57,060
Now they want to buy other people's shops?
Talk about lack of knowing oneself?

32
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,530
Why do these bandits rob only the Xiao family?

33
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,560
We should look into it more clearly.

34
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,830
Jialie Bi, don't be so cocky.

35
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,350
You know it very well.

36
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,740
Wait until we have found out the truth!

37
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,790
All right, all right, enough.

38
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,820
The medicine business is the Xiao's family business.

39
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,160
Even though I, Xiao Zhan, may no longer be capable,
I can't just let go of the family business.

40
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,400
No matter what,
it's because we didn't defend ourselves properly.

41
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:37,020
Those shop owners and assistants,
we will visit and compensate them.

42
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,690
We will help them raise their kids,

43
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,490
and pay respect to their parents.

44
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,700
The Xiao family will keep our promises.

45
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,680
As for the bandits,
we will find a way to solve it.

46
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,930
But our Alchemist Guild
won't be able to supply the Xiao family.

47
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,780
Why not?

48
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,380
Who is this?

49
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,670
My name is Yan Xiao.

50
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:12,510
Who is Yan Xiao?

51
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,790
I thought this was a meeting between the Xiao family
and the Jialie family. Why bring in an outsider?

52
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,150
I asked Mister Yan Xiao to come here...

53
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,570
to solve the crisis.

54
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,630
What? While the Jialie family is allowed
to hire people from the Cloud Mist Sect,

55
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,340
the Xiao family is not allowed to hire people?
So full of crap.

56
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,210
Master Gu Ni, keep talking.

57
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,280
Why will you stop supplying the Xiao family?

58
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:46,210
This is not my own opinion. It's the opinion
of the Jia Ma Empire's Medicine Merchant Association.

59
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,980
If you can't prove that
you're capable of safely transporting your medicine,

60
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,070
the Association will disqualify you as a merchant.

61
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,010
I am announcing this decision
on behalf of the Association.

62
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:02,560
Also, some of our Jialie medicine
were also in that stolen delivery.

63
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,730
We paid the delivery fee.
Shouldn't your family compensate us?

64
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,350
I have the money ready.
I will send it to your manor.

65
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,680
All right, Uncle Xiao.
Enough bragging about your money.

66
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,700
We don't need your money.

67
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,130
It's just that we invited the Medicine Merchant
Association people to our place tomorrow.

68
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,960
They make pills.
They need the ingredients.

69
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,070
How much do you need? Make a list.

70
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,530
The Xiao family will deliver them.

71
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,510
This is the list.
We need them by tomorrow morning.

72
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,500
Fine. You have my word.

73
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,830
Mister Yan Xiao, we always keep our promises.

74
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,880
If we don't get our medicine by then,
what do we do?

75
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,320
In Wu Tan City,

76
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,490
the Xiao family has thirty medicine shops.
They're all yours.

77
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,930
Really?

78
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,880
That's a deal.
Mister Gu Ni, please be the witness.

79
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,890
We are leaving.

80
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,380
You don't know the business.
Why did you promise him?

81
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,830
Can we make it on time?

82
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,270
Young people are so impulsive.
It feels good to say it.

83
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,930
Tomorrow, if they ask for the shops,
will you give the shops to them?

84
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,930
I will check my labor force.

85
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,590
If it doesn't work, I will use my fists.

86
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,010
I just don't know how good they are at fighting.

87
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,710
There will be a fight. Just not now.

88
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:47,430
Relax. I will gather the medicine ingredients myself.

89
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,430
Father, what are you doing?

90
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,810
What's going on?

91
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,630
Slow down.

92
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,500
Why aren't you talking?
What's wrong. Such a hurry.

93
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,100
Look for yourself. Xiao family's medicine carts.

94
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,610
Medicine carts?

95
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,640
Here, move out of the way.
Be careful!

96
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,830
Go, go, go!

97
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,420
Move!

98
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,960
It has only been four hours.
Their medicine has already arrived.

99
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,490
Did they fly here?

100
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,960
How come I had no idea?

101
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,600
Impressive. They found good help.

102
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,400
Yan Xiao. I haven't heard of him.

103
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,260
Here, here.

104
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,160
Be careful!

105
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,230
Give me a hand!

106
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,170
Master, someone from the Medicine Merchant Association
is knocking on the door.

107
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,130
Who?

108
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,830
I don't know him.
He was wearing a robe of a third-grade officer.

109
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,300
Third-grade officer's robe?

110
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,300
Hurry. Gather everyone.
Open the main door and greet him.

111
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,830
Yes.

112
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,200
Please accept my humble greetings.

113
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:39,010
I have lived in Wu Tan City for a long time
but haven't heard of your name.

114
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,000
My name is Yan Xiao.

115
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,010
May I ask, Mister Yan Xiao,

116
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:12,400
who was your teacher and what you're doing here?

117
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,660
You don't need to know about my teacher.

118
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,560
I'm here...

119
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,600
to solve the problem for the Xiao family.

120
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,920
I understand it now.

121
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,670
You are the warrior Xiao Zhan
spent a lot of money on.

122
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,780
We are all alchemists.
Let me be honest with you.

123
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:41,570
You should stay away from the Xiao family's problem.
You can't help us.

124
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,080
Why not?

125
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,080
The Xiao family has come to an end.

126
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,890
The family became an ordinary merchant
after Xiao Zhan abolished his Fight Qi.

127
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,110
Xiao Zhan thinks so highly of himself.

128
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,920
He doesn't want to build a relationship with big
families like Star Fall Pavillion and Cloud Mist Sect.

129
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,980
How can that work?

130
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,960
I heard he bungled up things with the Nalan family, too.

131
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,430
Without this background,
the other families will gang up on him.

132
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:12,170
If you get involved,
you will become an enemy of the Cloud Mist Sect.

133
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,570
Become an enemy to the Cloud Mist Sect.

134
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,290
What are they?

135
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,520
Mister Yan Xiao, you're about my age,

136
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,590
and you're wearing a third-grade officer's robe.
Can you show us some skills?

137
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:42,510
Don't be rude. In our alchemist business,
we respect the grades.

138
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,310
A third-grade alchemist is superior to us.

139
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,770
How could you talk to him like that?

140
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:03,380
Just now, I saw you were making
the Soul Termination Grass.

141
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,300
This is an extremely poisonous kind of herb.
But if you use it right,

142
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,730
it can be a great medicine.

143
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:14,080
It will get rid of bad luck and bugs.

144
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,150
It's just that you used the wrong methods to purify it.

145
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:22,290
You've burned the grass into useless ashes.

146
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,880
The Soul Termination Grass is very delicate.

147
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,550
If you don't have the Beast Flame, you can use
your Fight Qi to boil it in the vacuum.

148
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:52,280
But the medicine cannot touch the fire.

149
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,050
If so, the effectiveness of the medicine
will be greatly compromised.

150
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,960
It will be only 10% as effective as the original herb.

151
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,150
Check it out.

152
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,790
When it becomes clear,

153
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,470
you can use it.

154
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,970
This liquid...

155
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:16,280
can cure any wound, including snake bites.

156
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,340
We are like frogs living on the bottom of the well.

157
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,500
I have only seen this made
by the great Masters in Yin City.

158
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,060
I didn't recognize you. Sorry.

159
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:34,330
This method of purifying is very simple.

160
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,970
If you want to learn, I can teach you.

161
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,970
We are all alchemists after all.
Don't be so polite.

162
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,140
Thank you so much.

163
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,830
One more thing that I want to ask for your help with.

164
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,970
We will obey your order.
Please do not mention "help."

165
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,530
Tomorrow, the Xiao family
will import a batch of medicine.

166
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:11,890
I want to ask everyone to go to the Xiao family
and help them make medicine.

167
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,770
The Xiao family has had bad luck for many years.

168
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:19,350
I want to ask everyone to
rid the Xiao family of their bad luck.

169
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:27,050
Mister Yan Xiao, do you have to stand
on the Xiao family's side?

170
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,850
Of course.

171
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:36,350
Then, the whole of Wu Tan City
Medicine Merchant Association...

172
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,220
will obey your order.

173
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,520
The Xiao family will have our full support.

174
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,550
Where did you go?

175
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,900
I went to the Medicine Merchant Association.

176
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,370
They are coming here and will make medicine for us,
for the whole day.

177
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,020
Really?

178
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,830
All the profits we make from this batch of medicine
will be donated to the families of the dead.

179
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,310
Good. That's a big relief.

180
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,980
Where did you get your medicine?

181
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,390
To be honest, I have no idea.

182
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,460
My friends wouldn't tell me that.

183
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,870
Where did you get all these well-connected friends?

184
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,810
Relax, father.
They are all decent people.

185
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,020
All these years,
I haven't contributed anything to the family.

186
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,560
Let me do this so I feel less guilty.

187
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,780
I need to get used to this.

188
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,850
Now there's a tricky thing.

189
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,820
What do you think we should do?

190
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,950
What thing?

191
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:01,250
Look, we need to stock up.
We need someone to guard the carriages.

192
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,200
I am trying to find a young man
who knows Fight Techniques...

193
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,760
in the family book. See who is a good fit.

194
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:14,319
Father, I think there's something strange about the robbery.

195
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,289
Bandits could've just taken the goods.
Why kill all those people?

196
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,609
I think someone is targeting our family.

197
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,820
No need for anyone else. Xun'er and I can do it.

198
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,860
We'll guard the same carriage.
See who is trying to harm us.

199
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,900
I have checked those fellows' wounds.

200
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,370
The attackers know how to use swords.

201
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,980
Those men from the Cloud Mist Sect use swords, too.

202
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:57,250
Quiet. Now is not the time to fight against Cloud Mist Sect.
Pretend you don't know this.

203
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:02,710
How are they a decent clan?
Killing people like this.

204
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,850
It's because the Xiao family is not as powerful now.

205
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,050
We can't even protect our own fleet escort.

206
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:18,470
Father, I will keep it in mind.
Pretend that you don't know this.

207
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,190
Yan Xiao doesn't have to.

208
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,120
Have you learned the Angry Lions?

209
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,570
I practiced according to the books.
Couldn't seem to get the hang of it.

210
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,660
Is there any trick to it?

211
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,690
There's something special about all Xiao family skills.

212
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,620
You need someone to show you.

213
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,010
Go find the oldest Master in the family.

214
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,030
He's the best at Angry Lions.

215
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,810
Learn this one before you leave.

216
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:51,130
You will use it at the most crucial moment.

217
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,870
Yes.

218
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,720
Angry Lions is the most masculine of all the skills.

219
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,340
When you launch the attack,
you can't have any other thoughts on your mind.

220
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,910
You need to gather all your Fight Qi in your chest,

221
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:13,780
reserve all your energy, and launch one attack.

222
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,960
Try it.

223
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,980
Angry Lions!

224
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:41,850
Is that the first time a lion head appeared?

225
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:46,370
Yes. You didn't teach me in person
so I didn't get the trick.

226
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,150
This is also the first time I tried this and succeeded.

227
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,650
You were able to make a complete lion head appear.

228
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,210
That shows how smart you are.

229
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,480
You have surpassed the ordinary
Fight Practitioners by a lot.

230
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,160
As you level up as a Fight Practitioner,

231
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,880
this trick will become more powerful.

232
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,330
Try it from inside your gut.

233
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:16,670
Gather your Fight Qi into your arms very quickly.

234
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,000
Angry Lions!

235
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,460
Thank you for the tips.

236
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:48,830
I didn't expect you to learn so fast.

237
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,420
The Xiao family has hope for the future.

238
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,720
That's only because of your teaching.

239
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,420
Keep practicing. I will take my leave now.

240
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,430
Bring the force out of your gut.

241
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:12,010
Gather Fight Qi into your arms.

242
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,310
Angry Lions!

243
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,710
Brother Xiao Yan, it feels like
people are following us these days.

244
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,720
Where do we stop and rest for today?

245
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,360
There's a market when we get past this valley.

246
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,340
Master Yan, it is so hot.

247
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:57,210
How about we rest near the market
and leave tomorrow morning?

248
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,860
Lodge in a hotel right after noonday?

249
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,980
There are some mercenary groups of soldiers
for hire in that market.

250
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,790
We could hire some as our bodyguards.

251
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,070
Hold up!

252
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,570
Xun'er, keep an eye on them.

253
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,150
Kill the ones without Fight Qi.

254
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:49,080
We'll leave after we kill them.
You have but one chance.

255
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,310
If you want the goods, just take them.

256
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,100
Why kill people who have no Fight Qi?

257
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,440
You... Where did you come from?

258
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,620
From now on,
I will protect the Xiao family's merchants.

259
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,010
Don't get any ideas.

260
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,580
One person wants to take us all?
Do you want to die?

261
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,780
Look at you.
You don't look like any cheap bandits.

262
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,700
Are you mercenary soldiers?

263
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,020
Tell me which group you are from.

264
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,700
Who hired you to target the Xiao family?

265
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,230
Do it.

266
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,330
My legs!

267
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,870
Ouch.

268
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,410
One more step forward
and I'll throw him off the cliff.

269
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,850
You all have Fight Qi.

270
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:05,430
Why kill those who don't?

271
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,450
Tell me now... who hired you.

272
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,910
Or I'll take you to them now.

273
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,850
You can kill me if you have the ballocks.

274
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:16,150
Don't! Don't! We surrender!

275
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,090
As long as you let go of our boss,
we will leave immediately!

276
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,860
You can't go. Speak now.

277
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,990
I don't have much patience.

278
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,000
We are the Wolf Head mercenary soldiers
from Big Stone Town.

279
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,810
Big Brother!

280
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:41,060
Go back and tell your chief boss,

281
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,110
I will visit him soon.

282
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,660
Big Brother, are you all right?

283
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:54,150
- Where is Big Stone Town?
- Just ahead. Not far from here.

284
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,690
Brother Xiao Yan, who are they?

285
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,980
They're mercenary soldiers.
A bunch of jackasses.

286
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,200
They pick those who don't know how to fight to kill.

287
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,990
They are from the Big Stone Town.
I want them to pay back with their own blood.

288
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,460
I will come with you.

289
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,530
Xun'er, you stay here and protect the fleet escort.

290
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,680
Father said I need to stay with you.

291
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,260
All right. Listen to me.
The merchant fleet needs escort protection, too.

292
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,950
Wait for me.

293
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,960
Come and see. Fresh radishes.

294
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,400
Fresh radishes.

295
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,150
Take a look.

296
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,580
Sure.

297
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,720
Come again.

298
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:11,490
I'm telling you.
Last time I scared the hell out of them.

299
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,560
Who is it? Who is this?

300
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:25,680
Ask your Master to come out
or I'll destroy your town.

301
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,400
My name is Mu Snake.

302
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,580
Why are you here?

303
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,850
You're the boss of the Wolf Head pack?

304
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,920
You should discipline your dogs.

305
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,740
I came here to help discipline them for you.

306
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,630
If you're looking for trouble,

307
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,840
you need to call out your name.

308
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,250
You don't deserve to know my name.

309
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:15,810
My name is Mu Snake.
I don't know how I offended you.

310
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,730
Let's talk inside. If it's really my fault,

311
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:21,290
I will kowtow and apologize.

312
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,590
Big Brother, kill him! He was the one
who was protecting the Xiao family's medicine fleet escort!

313
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:31,730
Your subordinates are ambushing
the fleet escorts in the valley.

314
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,190
They only pick people with no Fight Qi to kill.

315
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,930
They've committed a lot of crimes.

316
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:42,400
You're their boss and should be held accountable.

317
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:48,480
My Wolf Head group is well-known in Big Stone Town.

318
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,790
It's not your place to lecture me.

319
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:57,120
Do you believe if I move my finger,

320
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,300
you will not get out alive?

321
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,590
Nice! Nice! Nice!

322
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:27,310
Nice! Big Brother!

323
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,970
Big Brother! Nice!

324
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,720
Bring the knife!

325
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:46,730
Nice!

326
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,640
I don't need a knife to kill you.

327
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,030
For you,

328
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,660
it's enough to use my fists.

329
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,890
Big Brother have some water!

330
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,960
Little man,

331
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,050
when my fist lands on you,

332
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,680
you will most certainly die.

333
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,390
Big Brother!

334
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,890
Second Brother!

335
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:14,190
Your Wolf Head dogs only kill the Xiao family members
who don't have Fight Qi. That's a heinous crime.

336
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,870
I will abolish the Fight Qi of you both,

337
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:21,550
so you won't cause trouble in the future.

338
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,910
Have a taste of what it feels like to
not have Fight Qi.

339
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:39,040
In three days, I want you to go visit
the families of the people you killed and apologize.

340
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:45,350
Give people back the money you stole.
If you don't do it,

341
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,010
I will come again and completely destroy you.

342
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,980
Second Brother!

343
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,720
Second Brother!

344
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,730
Are they asleep?

345
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:20,280
Relax. They won't wake up anytime soon.

346
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,230
You didn't ask them who hired them?

347
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:34,050
Whoever hired them will jump out soon.

348
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:39,990
Those mercenary soldiers didn't seem very impressive.

349
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:43,230
How could they injure so many of us?

350
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,800
They are here.

351
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,260
Medicine Elder, it's urgent.
Teach me a set of skills.

352
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,840
Why don't you just use your ruler?

353
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,900
They would recognize me if I use my ruler.

354
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,270
What is this you are wearing?

355
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,719
I can't use my ruler. They will...

356
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:12,009
Fine. Right now, I am Yan Xiao, not Xiao Yan.

357
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,330
Stop messing around!

358
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:18,200
Teach me any set of skills now. Hurry.

359
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,800
Prepare something at the last minute? Fine.

360
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,090
Impressive. Really impressive.

361
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,970
Remember it?

362
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,050
No.

363
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,190
Remember the spirit. Not the moves. Go.

364
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,780
I will.

365
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,990
Protect them well.

366
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,020
Those are the sword skills of the Star Fall Pavilion.
"Sun and the Moon Shine Together."

367
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,930
Brother Yan Xiao, are you from Star Fall Pavilion?

368
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:03,750
Our Grand Master is good friends
with the Master of Star Fall Pavilion.

369
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,500
If we have any misunderstanding,

370
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,800
we should explain first so we don't harm our relationship.

371
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,180
Angry Lions!

372
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,140
As a disciple of the Cloud Mist Sect,

373
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,060
it wasn't enough to be a bodyguard,

374
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,630
you had to kill the innocent.

375
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:56,780
Grand Master Yun Shan, that old turtle.
He isn't behaving himself.

376
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,730
His disciples are evil, too.

377
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:05,190
How dare you insult our master?
This is the day you die!

378
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,640
One Jialie Bi...

379
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,680
probably couldn't hire Cloud Mist Sect people.

380
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,510
Say it. Who's order are you carrying out

381
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,880
to make trouble for the Xiao family?

382
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,320
Why attack Xiao family's fleet escort?

383
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,100
The thing I hate the most is bullying the weak.

384
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:35,140
People like you who kill the innocent...

385
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,140
deserve to die!

386
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,690
I won't kill you
but I will abolish your Fight Qi,

387
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:55,510
so that you know what it's like to be an ordinary person.

388
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,530
If you abolish my Fight Qi,

389
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:00,760
I will tell my master and cut you to pieces!

390
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,590
If that turtle dares to come,
I will--

391
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,600
Who's here insulting me?

392
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,590
- It's the Grand Master!
- Don't come over!

393
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,990
Who are you?

394
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:29,290
I am Yan Xiao.

395
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:33,360
A disciple from Star Fall Pavilion.
It's an honor to greet you.

396
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,990
Did Han Feng teach you those sword skills?

397
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,450
He did.

398
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:43,290
The skill called,
"Sun and the Moon Shine Together."

399
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:47,430
Your crappy skills...
are called "Sun and Moon Shine Together?"

400
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:50,110
What about the Angry Lions?

401
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,360
How could you know the Xiao family's technique?

402
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,910
Are you from Star Fall Pavilion

403
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,710
or the Xiao family?

404
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,530
The Xiao family hired me to protect their fleet escort.

405
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:07,770
In exchange, they taught me the skill.

406
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:17,430
Xiao Zhan used his own family's skill to do business?

407
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,020
He has really hit the rocky bottom of the well.

408
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,060
His half arse skills...

409
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,460
managed to abolish your Fight Qi?

410
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:36,960
We didn't know he knew Angry Lions.
He attacked us by surprise.

411
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,350
You don't have enough Qi and you snuck off?

412
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,900
Go away. Kill all those merchant fleet people.

413
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,640
Don't let others say we don't keep our promises.

414
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,690
Yes.

415
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,650
Wait up!

416
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:04,230
You can't kill them.

417
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,410
You have ballocks.

418
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:16,360
Since I am good friends with your Master Han Feng,

419
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:21,140
I will give you a chance to run.

420
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:26,200
Those merchants are not Fight Practitioners.

421
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,390
You bully the weak.
How can you call yourself a decent clan?

422
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,500
Aren't you afraid to die?

423
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,260
Of course, I am. But even though I'll die,

424
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,150
I can't sit back and watch this happen.

425
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,800
Good. Yan Xiao, right?

426
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:49,790
I don't need to kill ants myself.

427
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:55,300
If you can take three attacks from me,

428
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,820
I will pardon you today.

429
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,450
Yes.

430
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,790
Three attacks.

431
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,800
Three attacks.

432
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,030
Angry Lions!

433
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:45,750
Yan Xiao isn't dead.
I will take another attack.
