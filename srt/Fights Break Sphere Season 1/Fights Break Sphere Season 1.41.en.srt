3
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,800
Speaking about the matters
of Xiao Yan being a traitor

4
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,700
and of him burning down
the Xiao family Fight Technique Pavilion,

5
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,800
they're all simply hearsay
and we didn't personally hear them.

6
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,400
We shouldn't be reckless in our conclusions.

7
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,600
The Xiao family is one of the five great clans.

8
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,800
If Xiao Yan stays at the academy,

9
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,000
it's very beneficial to the unity of the future.

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Whether he has loyalty or not,
I don't know.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,700
I can only say that he burned down
the Fight Technique Pavilion.

12
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,700
He has already been expelled from the Xiao family.
Is that true or not?

13
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,400
His father made the announcement to the world.

14
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,800
You still can't reach a conclusion?

15
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
He's no longer a member of the Xiao family.

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,200
He's already not the blood of the Xiao family.
What are you thinking?

17
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,800
You're being soft-hearted.

18
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,200
Aren't you being too soft-hearted?

19
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,100
There's simply no principles.

20
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,000
I think Elder Han

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,800
isn't only targeting Xiao Yan,
but you're also targeting me. Right?

22
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,000
Elder Han is right.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,900
Burning down the Fight Technique Pavilion
and being expelled from the Xiao family,

24
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,000
it's right that Clan Leader Xiao Zhan
made the announcement to the world.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But at that time,

26
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,200
we weren't present at the scene.

27
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,800
We don't know at all what really happened.

28
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,800
I believe his biological father.

29
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,000
Let's think about it.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,200
A person of the clan who can betray his own family,

31
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,200
how good can that person be? Isn't that right?

32
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,400
That's right.

33
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,200
We, the Jia Nan Academy,
shouldn't provide shelter to such a person.

34
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,000
We should drive him out.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,600
So that he won't ruin everything for us.

36
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,300
I think we can't drive him out.

37
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,400
He's very suspicious now.

38
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,000
Just in case, the Soul Hall corrupted him.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,400
What is that called? That's called, "indulging in one's enemy
nurturing a tiger invites calamity".

40
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,300
In my opinion, he should be arrested now

41
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,200
and seriously be investigated.

42
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,000
If we don't object,

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,200
I'll immediately lock him up now.

44
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,400
Do you believe in the rumors of the Soul Hall?

45
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,800
Last time,

46
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,200
we were in a hurry to arrest...

47
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,000
Elder Tengshan, Xiao Yan and his fellow kids.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,200
Don't you remember it?

49
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,970
It hasn't been that long.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,100
You're pulling this again.

51
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,800
Elder Ge,

52
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,500
you have had a problem
with Xiao Yan for a long time.

53
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Yes! I have a problem with him.
So what?

54
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,400
Now that Xiao Yan returned, he is already
at the level of Fight King.

55
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,600
I don't think it will take that long...

56
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,800
for his Fight Techniques and Fight Qi...

57
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,400
to reach above all of you.

58
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,500
Him?

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,600
I don't think he will live to see that day!

60
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,000
Let's go.

61
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,600
Elder Tengshan.

62
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,000
Han Feng and Gu He are so rebellious.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,400
They are obviously working with Soul Hall.

64
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,200
Why aren't we arresting them?

65
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,800
They both hold high positions...

66
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,800
at Star Fall Pavillion and Cloud Mist Sect.

67
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,400
If we want to expose them,
we have to have solid evidence.

68
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,200
We are under attack from all sides.

69
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,800
If we expose them now,

70
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,200
before we defeat Soul Hall,

71
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,800
these two clans...

72
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,500
will be in a war with our academy.

73
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
What do you want me for?

74
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,640
You just took it out like that?

75
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,800
With your help,

76
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,700
what do I have to be afraid of?

77
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,790
You fought last night?

78
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,400
Three attacks.

79
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,000
Qin Mountain Clouds, Blue Mountain Snow,

80
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,200
One Grass Crossing River.

81
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,200
The Sect Leader was very careful.
He tried to test me with the first two attacks.

82
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,600
By the third one, I had already escaped.

83
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,600
You're playing with fire.
Do you know that?

84
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
What is this?

85
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,200
If I tell you, it would scare you.

86
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,900
Try me then.

87
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,900
This is the gift from Fan Lao of Blood Sect
to the Sect Leader.

88
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,800
It's a magic weapon made by the Soul Hall.

89
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,000
It has a name, Black Luosha.

90
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,800
It was converted from the evil dragon
at the bottom of the sea.

91
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,200
So it's also called Black Dragon Blade.

92
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,200
Such a badass name.

93
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,000
Of course.

94
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,200
This Black Dragon Blade knows its master.

95
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,000
Whoever uses it must nurture it...

96
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,100
with their own blood, to build a connection.

97
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,000
It will hear the master's call
even from thousands of miles away.

98
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,000
Is that so? How do you know so much?

99
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,200
Back then, at the far north,

100
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,000
I was caught by Fan Lao for stealing this weapon.

101
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,400
Then he saw the Sect Leader.

102
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,800
He gave the Sect Leader this weapon.

103
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Just like that.

104
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,000
Let go of it right now!

105
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,600
- Let go!
- No!

106
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,000
This doesn't belong to you.
I suggest you let go right now.

107
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,600
If you're not being careful,
it will bite back.

108
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,000
It's useless!

109
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,400
Our Sect Leader has already fed it with his blood.
It doesn't belong to you.

110
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,800
No! I've said it! We need to take him down!

111
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,200
We need to expose the truth...

112
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,200
about Yun Shan and Soul Hall's ties!

113
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,800
This is the evidence!

114
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,100
Otherwise, why would we risk everything?

115
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,400
You're crazy! Are you really doing this?

116
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,500
You said this blade needs to be fed with blood.

117
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,400
I can do this! I can do this!

118
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,600
It's pointless!

119
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
You need the Soul Hall's magic words
to feed it with blood.

120
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,700
Without the magic words,
it's useless if you only use blood!

121
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,400
This blade is responding to Yun Shan's call.

122
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,800
It must be Yun Shan who's reciting those magic words!

123
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,200
As long as this blade can hear Yun Shan's call,

124
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,400
plus my blood, it will work!

125
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,200
Let go right now!

126
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,800
Let go!

127
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,400
You crazy girl.

128
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,900
You did it.

129
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,600
This guy Xiao Yan ran away on his own again.

130
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,800
Since he got back, I think he's changed.

131
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,000
Here's something you don't know.

132
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,600
He has a three year pact with Nalan Yanran.

133
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,000
The time is almost up.

134
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,600
Three year pact?

135
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,800
What pact?

136
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,500
Lin Xiuya!

137
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,900
Wait for me.

138
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,400
What's wrong?

139
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
We're going out this afternoon.
Are you coming?

140
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,000
Where to?

141
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,800
We had agreed to go find the Blood Lord.

142
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
- Really?
- Yes.

143
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Bring me with you.

144
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,800
- Really?
- Really.

145
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,400
Ok. Wait for me.

146
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,000
Ok. I'll go.

147
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,800
Ok. We'll leave now then.

148
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,000
You must wait for me!

149
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
How is it going?

150
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Do you want to join them this afternoon?

151
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,400
Where are we going?

152
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,200
Where to?

153
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,600
It's this group of students.

154
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Their families have been hurt by Soul Hall.

155
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,200
They are not hiding anymore.

156
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,000
They want to go out to avenge their families.

157
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,400
How does that sound?
Are you coming along?

158
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,600
Wait up.
I thought we can't step out of the school.

159
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Teachers are patroling at the gates.

160
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,400
They must have a way.

161
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,600
How does it sound?
Are you guys going?

162
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,300
You really want to go out?

163
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,800
Are you sure?

164
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,700
My parents were killed by Soul Hall people.

165
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
This is my turn.

166
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,800
Lin Xiuya.

167
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,600
We understand how you must feel.

168
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,000
But it's not easy to fight against Soul Hall.

169
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,200
We should discuss it with Xiao Yan and Xun'er.

170
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,999
Ok.

171
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,200
Elder Tengshan.

172
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,000
You want me?

173
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,200
I heard you and Nalan Yanran
have a three year pact.

174
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,800
Yes.

175
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,600
Time is almost up.

176
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,200
She's not in this school anymore.

177
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,200
Leader of Cloud Mist Sect picked her up.

178
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,200
He wants to teach her the Cloud Mist Sect
treasure - 13 swords.

179
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,000
Do you know that?

180
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,990
13 swords.

181
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,600
13 swords are impressive indeed.

182
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,400
But with what I have...
I won't be defeated by her.

183
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,400
Yun Shan also posted recruitment ads.

184
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,600
He said he's retiring.

185
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,000
He wants to give her the position...

186
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,800
of the Leader of the Cloud Mist Sect.

187
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,200
If so, Nalan Yanran will be the leader
of two great clans.

188
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,700
She will be extremely powerful.

189
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,200
Yes yes yes. Nalan Yanran.

190
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,200
The owner of Nalan family
and the leader of the Cloud Mist Sect.

191
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,600
Gu He's fiancee, the empire's minister.

192
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,600
So what? I'm still going.

193
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,600
I know I can't convince you.
I'll go with you.

194
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Yun Shan is petty,
but he has to cut some slack...

195
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,400
for Jia Nan Academy.

196
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,000
Thank you.

197
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
This is my personal stuff.

198
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,300
I don't want to trouble you.

199
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Fine.

200
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,400
Since you've made up your mind,
I won't bother you.

201
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,400
But you have to promise me,
if you need anything at all,

202
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,000
you have to turn to me.

203
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,600
I remember that.

204
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,010
Thank you elder.

205
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,200
Elder Han.

206
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,200
What's wrong?

207
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,800
What's happening?

208
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,600
What's going on?

209
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,400
Why is it shaking?

210
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,200
Do you know what's going on?

211
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't know.

212
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,400
Quick.

213
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,200
Let's go!

214
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,200
Let's go!

215
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,200
Elder Gu He, everything at the border is normal.

216
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,000
Please be assured.

217
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,200
You must make sure nothing goes wrong,

218
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,400
so that we can make sure the students are safe.

219
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,100
Yes.

220
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Where's Lin Xiuya?

221
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,400
Lin Xiuya.

222
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,700
Where are you going all panicked?

223
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,800
Elder Gu He, Elder Ruo Lin.

224
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
A large group of students just ran out.

225
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,400
I'm afraid they will be in danger,
so I came here to ask for help.

226
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Students ran out?

227
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,200
Yes.

228
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,400
Nonsense!

229
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,600
Not to mention
there are borders around the school,

230
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,000
we have been patrolling around here all the time.

231
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
We didn't even see a fly,
not to mention students running out.

232
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,600
You, on the other hand,

233
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,400
Lin Xiuya, running out on your own.

234
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,800
Tell me, do you have any connections
with people outside?

235
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,400
Elder Gu He, you misunderstood me.

236
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,600
Around noon today, a large group of students...

237
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
came to find me and asked me to join them
in escaping the school.

238
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,000
They said they will go fight
the Blood Sect and Soul Hall.

239
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,400
They wanted to avenge their families.

240
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,600
I think this kind of stuff...

241
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,800
needs to be discussed with everyone.
So I didn't go with them.

242
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,400
They didn't wait for me
and ran out by themselves.

243
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,400
Nonsense!

244
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,600
Such a big problem.

245
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,600
You didn't discuss it with the elders?

246
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,800
I...

247
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,400
Is that real?

248
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,500
Absolutely real.

249
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,660
Ok. You can't go anywhere.
Stay where you are.

250
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,400
You hear me?

251
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,040
Ruo Lin. I will return to the Elder Compound
and discuss with them.

252
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,400
Remember, keep a good eye on them.

253
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,820
- Rest assured.
- Go.

254
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,000
Teacher Ruo Lin!

255
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,890
Whatever he said is true!

256
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,920
You know about this too?

257
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,090
Teacher Ruo Lin.

258
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,310
Actually, I didn't finish my story.

259
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:47,980
Xiao Yan and Xiao Xun'er went out too.

260
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,700
He was afraid that we won't be enough,
so he asked us to call more people.

261
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,900
Yes.

262
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,470
Xiao Yan said on his way back
to the academy with Elder Tengshan,

263
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,480
they passed the Black Point Forest...

264
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,080
and were ambushed by the Fu clan.

265
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,250
Xiao Yan was worried that the rest of the Fu clan
are still waiting in the Black Point Forest.

266
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,700
Those students who ran out are in danger.

267
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,570
Teacher Ruo Lin. Time is tight.

268
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:14,940
We are wasting our time here.
There might be a battle going on out there.

269
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,260
But, I feel...

270
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,640
Those are all new students.
They don't have Fight Techniques.

271
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,410
If they really are in danger, they would die.
Teacher Ruo Lin, we have to go save them!

272
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,150
You guys wait here. I will go check it out.

273
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,030
Let's go together! More people will help.

274
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,630
We won't give up on any student.

275
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:35,020
Ok. We have a deal. After we go out,
you are not allowed to act on your own.

276
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,260
Everyone has to follow my order.

277
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:42,040
If you act alone and anything happens...

278
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,400
You...Lin Xiuya!

279
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,040
Why do you stop walking?

280
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,550
This is where we were attacked by Fu clan.

281
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:16,410
This forest doesn't have any other large area to hide.

282
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:20,200
They shouldn't be too far away.

283
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,780
Wait for me here. I'll check it out.

284
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:41,590
I just checked out. Not a single person in more than 10 miles.

285
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:48,170
More than 10 people came out
and not a single person now? How is that possible?

286
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,580
Look over there. Is that fog?

287
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,410
That should be vapor.

288
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:12,380
Not vapor. The sky turned dark
right before we were attacked.

289
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,900
They should be able to seal a large area right away.

290
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,110
But we don't know that skill.

291
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,970
Who cares? We go in first.

292
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,520
You guys are getting really bold.

293
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,860
Do you still have respect for your teachers?

294
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,360
You don't know
that you're not allowed to come out?

295
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,300
Xiao Yan said the Fu clan trap is over there.

296
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,230
They have already got all the students.

297
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,910
We can't break the trap.
You guys go back.

298
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:00,820
I will go ask the elders
who know this skill.

299
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:06,990
There's no time. We fought with them before.
It might work.

300
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,450
Everyone get ready.
When we enter the trap, save the students first.

301
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,040
When the elders come,
they will break the trap.

302
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,360
Hang on a little while longer.

303
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,020
Hao Tian. Get them out of the trap.

304
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,740
Ok.

305
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,080
Lin Xiuya, Han Xian.
You two guard the two sides.

306
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,810
Hu Jia, Ruo Lin,

307
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,790
we will fight the enemies from the front.

308
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,320
Let's go! Follow up!

309
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,090
Be careful!

310
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:46,190
Let's go!

311
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,800
Why can't we kill these men in black?

312
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,730
They're not people.
They're Fu Clan's puppets.

313
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:34,140
Fu clan is doing business here today.

314
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,950
These guys who barge in should leave.

315
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,900
I will let you live.

316
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,120
The elders of our academy will be here soon.

317
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,760
You should be the one who leaves.

318
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:51,730
Leave soon evil creatures,
and we shall let you live.

319
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:56,410
Since so, don't blame me for being harsh.

320
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,850
That old lady before was shattered.

321
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,420
If you insist on being our enemy today,

322
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,950
I'm afraid Fu Clan will come to an end.

323
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,600
Great, great.

324
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,860
You're the ones who killed my wife?

325
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:18,130
I will risk the death of my clan to kill you all!

326
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,880
Hey! Which elder is here?

327
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,660
Some students ran away from the school border!

328
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,560
Let's go take a look.

329
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:30,019
Elder Gu, do we keep looking for help?

330
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,110
Go back to the square
and don't let any other student run away.

331
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,490
- Yes.
- Go.

332
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:51,749
Shoot. How did we mess up with these people?

333
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:55,240
These are all Fu clan people.
We ran into them on our way back before.

334
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,410
Elder Ge, I will cut the trap.

335
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:02,770
You will fight against that old man.
The rest of you go save the students.

336
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,400
Yes.

337
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,950
Let's go!

338
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,510
Are you ok?

339
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,290
Yes.

340
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:50,630
Crap. Elder Ge Ye was poisoned.

341
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,170
Elder Ge!

342
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,530
What is that?

343
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:12,870
That's the poisonous bug by Fu Clan.

344
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:16,680
Bury them into the soil when they're fully grown
and use them to support the men in black.

345
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,690
Evil bug?

346
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,440
How do we fix that?

347
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,650
It's easy, but we can't do it.

348
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,160
Why?

349
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:33,000
We can use the medicine
to force the female bug into the mouth.

350
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,320
But, his throat is numb.
He can't throw it up.

351
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,940
So, you know...

352
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,790
How would I know?
I am not an alchemist.

353
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:52,480
It's like killing leeches. You need to...

354
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,210
I...

355
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,760
Hey, be careful!

356
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,990
Don't go!

357
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:14,570
Elder Ge has a bad temper.
We don't have the guts to slap him.

358
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:21,260
Elder Ge Ye, in order to save you from poison,
you have to put up with this.

359
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,660
That's helpful.

360
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,190
Helpful!

361
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:32,460
Hey Teacher Ruo Lin. Take a rest.

362
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,060
We'll take it from here.

363
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,000
This...

364
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,700
Let's go.

365
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,030
What are you doing?

366
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,670
Elder Ge...

367
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,920
Sorry Elder Ge...

368
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:08,370
Ok fine. The bug is out.

369
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,120
He's been bullying us the whole year.

370
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,130
We finally got our revenge.

371
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:26,970
It hurts so much... I will lock you all up...

372
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:31,880
I will lock you all up!

373
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,590
This is the place.
We have been hearing all kinds of weird noises.

374
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,630
That's so strange.

375
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,540
When did you find out?

376
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,860
These past few days.

377
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,600
There's a big snake under here.

378
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:25,530
- The earth core python.
- I don't care what it is.

379
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:28,900
Do you know why it's been so naughty lately?
