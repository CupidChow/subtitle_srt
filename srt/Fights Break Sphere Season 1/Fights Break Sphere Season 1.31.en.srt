3
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,210
I owe Master so much.
Does Master want my eyes?

4
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,210
Of course.
Your three-color pupils are a rare treasure.

5
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,330
You have to be grateful to your mother.

6
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,820
If it weren't for your mother giving you those eyes,

7
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,860
you would be dead in the mud of the Snake People Empire.

8
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,970
I'm forever in your debt, Master!
I'm forever in your debt, Master!

9
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,730
Tomorrow when I practice,
I'll need your eyes for medicine.

10
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,690
Be a good girl. Rest assured,

11
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,800
I will make sure
you stay alive and live a long life.

12
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,260
Don't worry now. Huh?

13
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,170
Yes.

14
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,910
[Mo]

15
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,740
Open the gate!

16
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,800
Hold it against your eye socket.

17
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,080
Push it in a little,
then your eye will pop out.

18
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,950
Good girl, don't be afraid.

19
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:27,010
You may lose your eyes,
but you've still got a life.

20
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,150
Kowtowing to my Queen!

21
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,460
You wished for your own death,
that's not on me.

22
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,150
Your are not strong enough to kill me.

23
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:31,010
The Green Lotus Earth Core Flame has melted into my veins.

24
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,910
Do you want a taste?

25
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,260
All right.

26
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,980
Not possible.

27
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,120
What happened?

28
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,620
No! How is this possible?

29
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,880
Impossible!

30
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,890
This is the gift from the Fight God
to the Snake People Empire.

31
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:35,110
Green Lotus Earth Core Flame.
Only I used a little trick,

32
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,030
so it wouldn't be absorbed into your central vein.

33
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,000
What happened?

34
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,930
You were too greedy, ignoring the fact
that everything has their owner.

35
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,990
You took and took, so that led you to here.

36
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,960
Break apart!

37
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,610
Give this back to him.

38
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,450
Yes.

39
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,170
It's so complicated to open this lock.

40
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,180
I have followed Mo Cheng for so many years,
I learned it by watching him.

41
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,400
Does your Queen want anything else?

42
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,800
She said, "Go tell that boy..."

43
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:00,400
No. "Tell the Snake King,
that our empire owes him a favor."

44
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,100
My King.

45
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,400
Humbly meet my Snake King.

46
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,400
We are grateful that Your Majesty used
such an amazing trick and killed our enemy.

47
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,200
We could not have gotten revenge without you.

48
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,600
What are you talking about, come.

49
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,900
You all remember to handle the bodies.

50
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,100
When you go back, tell people that

51
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,400
the Snake Tribe has been working with the Mo Family.

52
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,100
But the Mo Family is our sworn enemy.

53
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,000
The Mo Family still has some people left.

54
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,900
Leave those people in the hands of Soul Hall.

55
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,400
When you killed their leader,
their plan will fall apart.

56
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,200
I'm sure, it will happen in a few days.

57
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,200
I'm leaving, let's just say farewell here.

58
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,900
This way, my King.

59
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,000
- We send the Snake King off humbly.
- We send the Snake King off humbly.

60
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,300
Quickly.

61
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,100
I've returned.

62
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,400
- Oh, my. Young Master, you are back.
- Isn't it worth celebrating?

63
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,100
The Master is out of town
to welcome your brother-in-law.

64
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,040
Brother-in-law?

65
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,400
The betrothed of Young Miss Xun'er.

66
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,800
Betrothed...

67
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
You see, he is back, too.

68
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,000
Come, come.

69
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,100
Han Xian?

70
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,400
Why are you here?

71
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,500
Why do you only call my name?

72
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,400
You brats have a lot of time to catch up.

73
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,600
Let's rest in the room first.

74
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Uncle, you treat me with high courtesy,
I don't deserve it.

75
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,000
Why are you being so courteous?

76
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
We are a family now; make yourself comfortable.

77
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,600
Come, come. Go inside with me.

78
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Go, go, go.

79
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,000
Father!

80
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,900
Hey!

81
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,440
What should I do? What should I do?

82
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,600
I...!

83
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,700
Don't you know you should knock before coming in?

84
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,200
This is a man's room.
How can you just walk in like this?

85
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,400
You left for so many days without me. Tell me.
Where were you?

86
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,300
I went to see the Mo family.

87
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,300
Do you know that Han Xian is here?

88
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,800
I was about to ask you that.

89
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,800
Why did you only invite him
and not the rest of our schoolmates?

90
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,500
I-I... I didn't know either.

91
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,600
Father invited him!

92
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,800
Father called me back in such a hurry.

93
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,400
Everyone smiled at me all along the way.

94
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,600
And they told me to bathe and change!
Just for Han Xian?

95
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,200
To meet your schoolmate.

96
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,000
You should know the importance of personal cleanliness!

97
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,600
Master wants to see Young Miss in the study.

98
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,400
Quick, off you go.

99
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,500
You are being really weird.

100
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,800
- Young Master, the Master said if you are rested,
you should go and accompany the guest. - Tell me.

101
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,100
When did you invite him here?
How come I don't know about this?

102
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,000
I didn't know either, it was the Master's idea.

103
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,200
What did he say?

104
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,100
He said that Young Master Han
is the future husband of Young Miss Xun'er

105
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,900
and we should treat him well.

106
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,200
We are treating him so well.

107
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Explain this.

108
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,800
What on earth is going on?

109
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,000
This... This... What is this situation?

110
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,400
I don't know either.

111
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,900
Xiao Yan, be my witness! I never said it.

112
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,400
I really... I never said it.

113
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,000
Xun'er, Xun'er...

114
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,300
Let him go first.

115
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,400
He is a guest.
You can't beat him up when he just got here.

116
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
This is bad.

117
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,100
Let me tell you, Xun'er. I will remember this.

118
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,200
You beat me up when I'd just arrived.
I didn't even get to have something to eat!

119
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,400
- You are full of crap!
- What did I do?

120
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,000
I just found out,
my father even welcomed you at the city gate.

121
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Even the scrub maid knows you are my future husband.

122
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,800
But how come I don't know?

123
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,200
It's not my fault, really not my fault!

124
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,800
Xiao Yan, help me explain this!

125
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
Help me explain this! It's not me!

126
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,100
Stop talking.

127
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,900
That... Xun'er.

128
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,600
The truth is... I said it.

129
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,900
- You said it?
- No, no, Father said it.

130
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,600
What? Me? Was it you?

131
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,400
Stop talking, please.

132
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,200
The thing is, earlier, Father said that
he wanted us to get married.

133
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,200
It was so out of blue. I didn't see it coming at all.

134
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,200
You are my brother, I'm your sister...
No, wait... Anyway!

135
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,400
I was panicking. Then I don't know why,

136
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,000
but Father started asking
who your closest friends at school were.

137
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,600
A-And then I said it was Han Xian and...
now he is here.

138
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,599
Xun'er.

139
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,499
It's nice to see him anyway, isn't it?

140
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,000
Who is your sister?

141
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Why do you care who I like?

142
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,400
Xun'er--

143
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,200
This...

144
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,900
Look me in the eye, is it bruised?

145
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,350
Rub it with some eggs.

146
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,400
Go boil two eggs.

147
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,600
- Yes, Young Master.
- You go, too.

148
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,400
This is all on you.

149
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,600
- Quickly. Quickly.
- I will remember this.

150
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,200
Now I will never come play at your house again.

151
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,000
Xun'er, don't be so mad.

152
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,300
Are you still mad?
You can keep beating them till you feel better.

153
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,400
This was me being so foolish.

154
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,000
It's my fault. What do you want to do?

155
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,240
Tell me. I will make it happen.

156
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,420
Brother Xiao Yan,

157
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,500
do you think no one will ever marry me?

158
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,800
Or you just don't want me to follow you anymore?
Otherwise, why do you want me to get married so soon?

159
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,400
How is that possible? Xun'er, I'm sorry.

160
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,600
I just panicked,
then I started blabbering nonsense.

161
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,100
- Don't be mad.
- Wait! What? What?

162
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,400
How can you talk nonsense about this kind of thing?
Especially when you don't know anything?

163
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,600
You-- It's all right if you don't like Xun'er!

164
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,800
That's all right! But...

165
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,600
But you can't just replace your position
with just any schoolmate.

166
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Uncle-Uncle, you are so, so right.

167
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,800
Who are you looking at? Look at me!

168
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,700
Answer me!

169
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,600
You were pushing me so hard
and I just wasn't prepared.

170
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,100
Besides, when you asked Han Xian to come here,
why didn't you ask me? That's so reckless.

171
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,300
What? I'm reckless?

172
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,200
This is not reckless? I think I did ask you before.

173
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,300
But I wasn't prepared.

174
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,500
- You! Then... I...
- Father.

175
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,600
Stop asking him.

176
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,800
Brother Xiao Yan doesn't like me.

177
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,600
I have other things to do.

178
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,800
The Medicine Shop. The Fight Technique Pavillion.
I can take care of both.

179
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,200
I'm not that pathetic.

180
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,500
It's all my fault in the end.

181
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,100
Just be mad at... No, don't be mad at me.

182
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,700
Oh, just kill me with a bolt of lightning!

183
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,300
That... Young Master Han.

184
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,400
You are laughing quite loudly.

185
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,800
That... I m sorry.

186
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,200
To let you see...

187
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,600
Such a big mistake in our Xiao family.

188
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,200
It's embarrassing to let you see this.

189
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,000
Uncle, just call me Han Xian.

190
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,600
I'm all right, it's just a fight.

191
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm just hungry, that's all.

192
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,200
Look. I was busy talking with you all,
I forgot to tell the servants to prepare food.

193
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,800
I'll go do it now.

194
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,600
And you...!

195
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,000
Apologize to your schoolmate.

196
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,500
Be sure to apologize well!

197
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,300
If you don't apologize well...

198
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,000
I will deal with you, I mean it. I mean it!

199
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,580
You are such an idiot!

200
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,000
Xun'er is a beautiful girl and that's a fact.

201
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,800
And she is so nice.

202
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,800
If you don't say yes, I'm going to.

203
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,790
This has nothing to do with you.

204
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:54,200
As long as I'm alive, it's not going to happen.

205
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,200
Xun'er, you know.

206
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,600
It's me... It's me being thoughtless.

207
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,800
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

208
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,600
My Young Miss, please smile.

209
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,200
I'm sorry...

210
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,300
By the way, you are the husband of Little Medicine Fairy.

211
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,000
Naturally, Xun'er can't marry you.

212
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,610
I m going to kill you, believe that!

213
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,890
Oh!

214
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,370
You keep talking... Keep talking.

215
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,290
Xun'er.

216
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,110
Brother Xiao Yan,

217
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:13,040
if you don't like me, say it;

218
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,950
but doing this is an insult.

219
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,430
How can I insult you? I m just being stupid.

220
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,600
I just said something stupid!

221
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:32,750
I didn't want to be married anyway,
I'm telling Father that right now.

222
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,670
Don't... Don't do that, Xun'er.

223
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,380
Young Master, here are your eggs.

224
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,970
Does your engagement with Nalan still count?

225
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:02,350
You... why are you dodging away from me?
I'm just helping your blood circulation.

226
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,100
Come. Otherwise, when we eat later,
people will laugh at you.

227
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,680
I'm sorry.

228
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,400
That just happened...

229
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,450
Can you forgive me?

230
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,130
It's nothing!

231
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:26,160
Let me tell you, Xun'er,
I'm always on your side.

232
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,290
I support you as always.

233
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:36,750
How do you support me, Brother Han Xian?

234
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,770
Rest assured. If anyone insults you,

235
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,090
I will fight him with my life!

236
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:56,480
I won't forgive him
even if he was just talking nonsense.

237
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:03,670
Then what if one day, no one wants to marry me?

238
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:09,300
Leave that to me.

239
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,660
I will definitely make you--

240
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,240
Then it's a deal.

241
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,000
When we eat later, sit right beside me.

242
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,410
Come.

243
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,510
Then what about your brother?

244
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,770
He can sit wherever he likes.

245
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,410
You come here.

246
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,800
Come, Young Master Han.

247
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,220
Uncle.

248
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,610
Come.

249
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,750
Drink.

250
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,300
Drink slowly.

251
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:25,170
One more drink.

252
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,110
In a time like this,

253
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:37,580
my daughter's marriage
is the biggest matter of my life.

254
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,820
I wasn't talking about you.

255
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,680
I was just saying that
daughters are a father's sweethearts.

256
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,690
Clan Leader,

257
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,920
Young Miss has such astonishing beauty.

258
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,680
Any young hero will kneel before her beauty.

259
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,840
Don't worry.

260
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,150
Let's drink, drink.

261
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,930
I'm at this age, all my Qi is wasted
and my son is so disobedient.

262
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:08,100
I've failed my ancestors.

263
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,390
I'm thinking, that later,

264
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:16,150
we can all have a discussion. In the future,
we should quit the medicine business

265
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:21,310
and focus on educating
the younger generation of the Xiao family.

266
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,060
Come...

267
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:30,190
Clan Leader, you are being too humble.
Take Xiao Yan...

268
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,720
Ask any of the Five Clans.

269
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,850
Can any Young Master compete with our Xiao Yan?

270
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:42,240
The Xiao family has a very promising future.

271
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,970
Clan Leader, you can't quit while we are doing well.

272
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,140
Come, Leader, this is to you.

273
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,400
Come, come, come.

274
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,160
We are speaking from the bottom of our hearts,
our family is on the rise.

275
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,890
Don't you think so, Xiao Yan?

276
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,240
- Is it tasty?
- Yes, yes.

277
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,120
Father, you drank too much.

278
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,370
You didn't drink less than me.

279
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,160
Watch out for the step.

280
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:28,020
- We are here.
- I'll sit on this side.

281
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:35,690
Father... it's time for us to talk.

282
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,840
What do you want to talk about?

283
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:44,130
I... I didn't lie to you on purpose, don't be angry.

284
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,540
Have some tea.

285
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:49,060
You, boy.

286
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,190
Is Xun'er still mad?

287
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,150
I think she needs a couple of days.

288
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:08,590
Tell me. What is the situation in the Mo family?

289
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,840
The Mo family has always worked for Soul Hall.

290
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,410
I've known it since the last time,
when I was there to take the Green Lotus Earth Core Flame.

291
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,380
This time I worked with the Snake Tribe and we set a trap.

292
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:32,660
We infiltrated their family and killed Mo Cheng.

293
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,520
Also, we killed some members of Soul Hall.

294
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,180
Lastly, we made Soul Hall believe that

295
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:47,860
the Mo family was only pretending to work for them.

296
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,110
So the Mo family...

297
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,110
is no longer our problem.
Soul Hall will deal with it themselves.

298
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,990
They targeted our family again and again.

299
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,690
What is their goal here?

300
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,640
It's not just our family.

301
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,180
The darkness is coming.
Soul Hall will seek revenge.

302
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,600
The Blood Sect is their frontier force.

303
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,620
The Nalan family was already infiltrated by them.

304
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:26,930
And Han Feng, the leader of the Star Fall Pavillion,
has been a traitor all along.

305
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:34,140
Except for the Cloud Mist Sect and the Gu Clan,
we have the most pressure on our shoulders.

306
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:41,080
Cloud Mist Sect... it is no longer at peace.

307
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,860
Yes.

308
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,840
By the way, Father, you don't know this yet.

309
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,670
What?

310
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,710
Nalan Yanran is engaged.

311
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,050
Guess with whom?

312
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,610
Who?

313
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,730
Gu He, the Pellet King.

314
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,860
Han Xian told me.

315
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:18,550
And I asked when it had occurred, it's about
the time when we made the three-year deal.

316
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:26,940
You are really going to keep that promise?

317
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,510
Of course.

318
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,660
Nalan Yanran is a different person now.

319
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:39,410
She is the leader of the Nalan Clan and
an honorable apprentice of the Cloud Mist Sect;

320
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:42,900
and also, the Prime Minister of our empire.

321
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,800
And recently she became the betrothed of Gu He,
the Pellet King.

322
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,900
If you're going to keep that promise,
whether you win or lose,

323
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,820
hostility will be planted.

324
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:59,150
Then let it be planted,
it won't be the first time.

325
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:04,610
You are only the son of a medicine dealer,
why are you doing this?

326
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,950
I'm your son.

327
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,810
So?

328
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,570
I'm the son of the Xiao family.

329
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,500
The Nalan family publicly broke the engagement back then.

330
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,650
They beat us and insulted our family.

331
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,960
No one ever...

332
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,260
No one ever put out a foot.

333
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,820
No one was there to help us.

334
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:59,340
I made the three-year deal,

335
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,480
so I will do it.

336
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:06,570
I won't allow anyone to insult our family anymore.

337
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,350
Then what?

338
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,140
Then...

339
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:17,510
Then the people who killed my mother...

340
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,330
Yun Shan,

341
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,800
Han Feng,

342
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,660
Yan Luotian,

343
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,910
and all their ineffective followers...

344
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,030
I will make them pay dearly

345
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,280
for what they did to us back then.

346
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,720
They better not die soon

347
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,760
and just wait for me.

348
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,080
You are going to make the whole world your enemy?

349
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,930
So what?

350
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,010
Our Xiao family.

351
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,800
Are we worth all that effort?

352
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,800
Father,

353
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,810
I really think you are being strange.

354
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,850
I'm strange?

355
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,030
Back then when my mother was killed,

356
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,490
you didn't let me study Fight Qi,

357
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,680
because you didn't want me to get revenge for her.

358
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,500
I really thought

359
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,680
you were being such a coward.

360
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,190
But I know now.

361
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:58,390
You were doing it for me.
You were afraid that I was too weak

362
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,400
and people would kill me.

363
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,880
But now it's different.

364
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:11,100
What's so different?

365
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:15,350
You really think your Fight Qi
is number one in the world?

366
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,870
Don't bite off more than you can chew.

367
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,340
Of course, I'm not number one.

368
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,360
But I won't pretend that those things never happened.

369
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,110
Maybe...

370
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,230
When you get old,

371
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,290
you too will become a coward.

372
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,870
You weren't old.

373
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,730
You were hiding from me.

374
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,630
Since I got back...

375
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,380
I feel like you've been acting very strange.

376
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,240
You want me to save the Xiao family business,

377
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:18,050
but you also want the medicine shops closed.

378
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,580
For so many years, the one who wants revenge
for mother the most, is you. Right?

379
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,030
Why are you doing this?

380
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,450
Why don't you tell me?

381
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,890
Father.

382
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:39,730
There are too many things you can only
understand after you've experienced them.

383
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:46,150
I've always thought that when you grew up
we could have a real conversation.

384
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:52,020
But I didn't expect it to be so soon.

385
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,470
Who?

386
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:59,620
Who? What do you mean?

387
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:04,420
I'm tired and I'm drunk.

388
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,340
I'm going to bed now.

389
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,690
Xun'er... Xun'er!

390
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,210
Xun'er!

391
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,130
What do you want?

392
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,300
Let's talk.

393
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,560
I'm tired; I want to rest.

394
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,740
Don't... You see, you already beat me...

395
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:06,300
and you have scorned me.
Can't you just forgive me?

396
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,200
I forgive you, go now.

397
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,920
You... You don't look like you've forgiven me.

398
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:20,050
Brother Xiao Yan, rest assured,
I won't let your good will go to waste.

399
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,840
I will go find Han Xian later.

400
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,760
Maybe when we become betrothed in the future,
I will need to thank you for this.

401
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:41,460
Why do you look so unhappy?

402
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,990
Like it's my fault if I don't forgive you.

403
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:52,310
Xun'er, you have me.

404
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,100
Compared to Yun Shan,
you are much more difficult.

405
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:03,070
If you keep talking nonsense,
I will never forgive you.

406
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,200
That, I swear...

407
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,950
I will never talk nonsense. I promise.

408
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,760
Good, I'm hungry.

409
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,030
Let's go get Han Xian to go out and eat.

410
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,350
Great, the meal is on me.

411
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:21,930
A meal is no big deal,
you can eat me if you want to.

412
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:24,390
Let's go.

413
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:30,090
My father only invited you,
how do the others feel about that?

414
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:33,420
How can they feel about this?
Hao Tian and Hu Jia both wanted to come.

415
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:39,190
But Teacher Ruo Lin said since you didn't invite them,
they couldn't leave school.

416
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:41,830
Then don't tell them when you get back.

417
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,920
Tell them what, that I got beat? Not doing it.

418
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,790
Han Xian,

419
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,830
Nalan Yanran is going to marry Gu He.

420
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:59,580
Are you sure about this?
Gu He is that old.

421
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,630
He is the Pellet King.

422
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:06,080
The Chief Alchemist of the Cloud Mist Sect
and a teacher in the academy.

423
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,310
Arrogant people like the Nalan family,
of course, they would be overjoyed with it.

424
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:12,730
To be honest, we think it's mysterious, too.

425
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:16,620
But this isn't gossip, he said it himself.

426
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:22,150
It's their Old Master, Yun Shan,
who allowed this marriage.

427
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,380
That old turd.

428
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,900
Yeah, that old turd.

429
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,300
Gu He even wants us to go to the wedding.

430
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,440
Will you go?

431
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:40,210
Him? The only thing he will do
at the marriage ceremony is fight.

432
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,390
Three-year deal.

433
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,310
Don't be mad if I say this,
but I'm worried that you won't win.

434
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:55,660
I heard this time the reason
that the old turd took her back

435
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,680
was to give her a throne.

436
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,270
Think about it. Nalan Yanran became the leader
of the Cloud Mist Sect and the Nalan Clan.

437
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,480
How good is she?

438
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:10,170
You trying to scare me?
Even if she is the Golden God herself,

439
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,190
I will fight with her.

440
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,960
Then how could Gu He agree with this?
What about Yun Shan?

441
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,460
I'm going to fight even if they disagree.

442
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:23,650
Yun Shan killed my mother,
I was going to fight him anyway.

443
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:31,030
We will be there anyway.
You can fight Nalan Yanran.

444
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:36,650
We won't help you.
But if Gu He bullies you because we are young,

445
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:41,450
then we, the Yan Sect, won't tolerate it!
