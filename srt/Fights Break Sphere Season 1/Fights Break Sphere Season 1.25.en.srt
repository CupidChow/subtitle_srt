Kill! Kill! Kill!

00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,000
The second round will be Big Blade Qin'er...

6
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,200
versus the Imperial outlaws, Han Xian.

7
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,200
Good luck!

8
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,000
Be careful.

9
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,000
This is great.

10
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,500
Han Xian!

11
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Let's go check out that way.

12
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,700
Look over there! Look over there!

13
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Look, beautiful!

14
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,600
All you think about is beautiful women.

15
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,800
Let's go!

16
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,000
Here. The Black Contest Field.
Two contests a day.

17
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,600
This room? It's too shabby.

18
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,200
If it weren't for the fact that two brothers
were beaten to death a few days ago,

19
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,400
you wouldn't even have this room.

20
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,600
Xiao Yan, we escaped to here.

21
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,600
I think this room is fine.
Let's stay here.

22
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,400
Thank you, Manager.

23
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,400
Wait up.

24
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,800
Do you have any good doctors here in the Villain Valley?

25
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,000
Of course, we do.

26
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I want the best.

27
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,400
Sure, wait here.

28
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,000
Why are you doing that?

29
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,400
I know my own body. I just need to rest.

30
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,290
I just felt your pulse.

31
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,400
Your nerves around the heart
and lungs are all shattered.

32
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,600
Even though I am an alchemist,

33
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,400
I can't think of a cure for you.

34
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,240
In this Villain Valley,

35
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,600
there should be good enough doctors.

36
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,000
So what if I fight a few more rounds?

37
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,600
Who wants to be treated?

38
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,800
Oh, it is me.

39
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,800
Here, let me check your pulse.

40
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,600
You have been injured by a method used by Soul Hall.

41
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,400
Your nerves around your heart
and right lung were shattered.

42
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,000
This is not hard.
I once saved an abandoned disciple from Soul Hall.

43
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,600
He told me of a cure for Soul Hall injuries.

44
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,900
I will give you a medicinal recipe for a pill
which should begin working in five days.

45
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,800
You should take it for a month.
Even if you can't get all your energy back,

46
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,700
you can at least get 80%.

47
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,000
You...

48
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,400
Are you called Saint Hands?

49
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,800
Mister Lin Yizhi?

50
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,070
You have met me before?

51
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,200
When I had just joined the Alchemist Guild,

52
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,000
I heard there was a genius.

53
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,800
That he had his own special methods
that could cure everything.

54
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,200
But... I heard more than a decade ago, he...

55
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,500
He's dead, right?

56
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,000
If you hadn't mentioned it,

57
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,400
I would have almost forgotten about it.

58
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,600
I was young and arrogant back then.

59
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,600
I was quite famous so I did something arrogant.

60
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,400
I would have some animal behaviors...

61
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,200
after getting drunk.

62
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,000
That was more than thirty years ago.

63
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,500
The "Lin Yizhi" you were talking about...

64
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,900
died a long time ago.

65
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,800
Even so, please, Mister Lin.

66
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,700
As long as you can cure our elder,

67
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,200
I will do anything for you.

68
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,400
The prescription I gave you
will take three days to make.

69
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,800
Before that is ready,
let him take this first.

70
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,000
One pill in the morning and one at night.
The Fight Qi would help him breathe.

71
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,300
That will help alleviate his symptoms.

72
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,300
[Heaven]

73
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,400
Two contests in the Heaven Contest Field.

74
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
The fee for this medicine...

75
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,500
is truly something else.

76
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,800
What? If you think this is too expensive...

77
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:49,199
I will pay this price.

78
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,200
I was being too bold. Please forgive me.

79
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,800
I appreciate the help.

80
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,600
Good. You are are so young but your're willing
to sacrifice your life for someone else.

81
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,200
I will give you a piece of advice for free.

82
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,000
Your evil Qi has invaded your lungs and stomach.

83
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,200
If you don't put a stop to it,

84
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
there's no cure.

85
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,300
What are you saying?

86
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,600
You should know better than anyone...

87
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,200
what kind of evil you did.

88
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,200
Elder.

89
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,500
His medicine is really magical.

90
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,200
I have always felt out of breath.

91
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,300
Just this single pill...

92
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,050
made me feel much better.

93
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,590
Lin Yizhi said your evil Qi...

94
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
has invaded your insides.

95
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,900
I saw it a long time ago.
I just didn't have a chance to ask you about it.

96
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,600
Even the Earth Core Giant Python listened to you.

97
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,000
Why was that?

98
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
We escaped to here.

99
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,800
We have nowhere else to go.

100
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,200
This is Villain Valley.

101
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,900
Do you want to be a villain
for the rest of your life?

102
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,600
Elder Tengshan,

103
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,800
is it that important to be a good person?

104
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Everywhere I go...

105
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,600
the bad people always get their way.

106
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,600
The good people are always on the run.

107
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:39,610
Lin Yizhi was afraid
that people would call him Saint Hands,

108
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,610
because he was afraid of remembering the past.

109
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,270
Who can really forget the past?

110
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:50,220
It's only a matter of choice to be kind or evil.

111
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,080
Like the fact that we are living in this room.

112
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,470
It's the same as when we were back in the wooden shack.

113
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,190
Since you made a choice, you have to accept it.

114
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,630
You just need to make peace with it.

115
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,260
Elder,

116
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:14,600
it was just a trading deal made
between me and the Snake People Clan.

117
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,010
I have no regrets. Please be reassured.

118
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:25,890
It's hard to tell if they are evil or not.
You should be careful.

119
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:32,520
But now you have so much evil Qi.

120
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,110
The way you look... you should've been sick.

121
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,550
Why aren't you sick?

122
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:50,770
It's almost like someone blocked the evilness for you.

123
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,280
Think about it.

124
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,260
How?

125
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,280
Medicine Elder?

126
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:59,880
Medicine Elder! Medicine Elder!

127
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,890
The Spatial Ring...

128
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,680
Medicine Elder!

129
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,750
Medicine Elder!

130
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,430
Medicine Elder! Medicine Elder!

131
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,860
Medicine Elder!

132
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,900
Medicine Elder!

133
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,530
Medicine Elder!

134
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,690
Medicine Elder! Medicine Elder! Medicine Elder!

135
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,230
Medicine Elder!

136
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,800
Medicine Elder!

137
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,970
Medicine Elder!

138
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:23,340
[Heaven]

139
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,640
[Heaven]

140
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,089
The first round of the Heaven Marked Contest...

141
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:40,050
The Imperial outlaws, Xiao Yan...

142
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,940
versus Lone Sail.

143
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,080
The two sides will place their bets.

144
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,480
Xiao Yan will bet on his magical weapon.

145
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,760
Lone Sail's bet...

146
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,950
will be a Multicolor Sword of the Cloud Mist Sect.

147
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:26,900
Good! Good! Good!

148
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,190
It's him.

149
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,440
Who?

150
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,900
The traitor of the Cloud Mist Sect
from twenty years ago.

151
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,840
He joined the evil side to get better Fight Techniques and
killed three elders of his clan. Some people said he was dead.

152
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,570
I can't believe he's here.

153
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,930
Xun'er, what are you grabbing me for?

154
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,720
Xiao Yan!

155
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,080
Brother Xiao Yan, you're amazing!

156
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:27,450
If you kill him, you can get the Multicolor Sword!

157
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,050
Kill!

158
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,210
I don't know how to use that sword.

159
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,890
Kill him! Kill him!

160
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,940
Mister Xiao, Lord is waiting for you.

161
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,370
Sit.

162
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,660
We traveled past here.

163
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:31,350
We should be thanking you
now that we have food and accommodations.

164
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,480
I didn't mean to cause you so much trouble.

165
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,940
I am really ashamed.

166
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,670
You're too polite.

167
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,660
I just saw your fighting skills on the battlefield.

168
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,330
You're really a young hero.

169
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:47,320
You deserve better than the place you're staying in.

170
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,860
How about you move in here tomorrow?

171
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,060
If you like quietness,
I have a few other properties.

172
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,330
If you don't like the food here,

173
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,150
you can tell me.
I can pick other food for you.

174
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:03,090
I do have one request,
but it's not about food or a place to stay.

175
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,440
Please tell me.

176
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,320
How do I get out of here?

177
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,360
To go where?

178
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,120
Above ground.

179
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,190
Do you not know...

180
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:16,180
that people only come in the Villain Valley.

181
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,330
There's no way out.

182
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,510
If this valley is so isolated,

183
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,540
may I ask where you get your food?

184
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,450
You have been here for a while.

185
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,190
You should have seen rain in this valley.

186
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,730
Above this valley, there's a giant lake.

187
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:43,050
Thanking the gods, whenever it rains,

188
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,330
the water that the lake can't contain

189
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,870
will flow into this valley through the rocks.

190
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,530
The magical view of rain in the valley will then appear.

191
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:57,000
As long as there's water, there will be grains
to feed the villains living here for generations.

192
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:03,370
Instead of saying there's no way out,

193
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,220
you might as well say you are not letting us out.

194
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,540
So you want to leave?

195
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,220
You think my treatment of you is not good enough?

196
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,150
I will go make some arrangements myself.

197
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:20,410
My Lord, we escaped to here...

198
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:23,300
so we really don't want to stay long.

199
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,960
Jia Nan Academy has wanted notices everywhere
on the continent to catch Mi Tengshan,

200
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,730
Xiao Yan, Xiao Xun'er,
Han Xian, Hu Jia, Hao Tian.

201
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,730
There will be a giant web up there.
Even though your fighting skills are good,

202
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,950
you can't take on the best ones
from the Guild and the Five Clans.

203
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:42,380
You will die for nothing.

204
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,080
You're so well-informed.

205
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,870
May I ask...

206
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,310
where you get your sources?

207
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,970
If there's no way out of this valley,

208
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,400
does the information flow
in the same way as the rain?

209
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,780
Just falling from the sky?

210
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,930
Lord, all the accusations
that say we belong to the Soul Hall...

211
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:14,730
are slanderous.
We didn't commit any crimes.

212
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,810
So we don't need to confess.

213
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,470
In this place, I don't need this mask either.

214
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:31,970
So what if you're wrongly accused.
You only live once.

215
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:37,430
Is it really worth it to die
just because you want to be right?

216
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:41,220
Just be happy when you're wined and dined.

217
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,060
Why ask for those impractical things?

218
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,590
You're right.
But I still need to get out of here.

219
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,930
The Villain Valley has the strongest alcohol
and the most beautiful women.

220
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:28,970
As long as you're good at fighting,
you can get anything.

221
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,990
But up there, bad people get their way
and good people are wrongly accused.

222
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:39,180
Even if you had mouths all over your body,
you can't explain yourself. That's exhausting.

223
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:44,310
If you stay here a few more days,
you will know what I'm talking about.

224
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:49,580
People in this valley seem to live a normal life.

225
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:54,810
But through their masks, I don't hear any confessions.

226
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,330
I see cowardness. The fear of enemies.

227
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,060
They say they're enjoying life.

228
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:07,320
But they're just avoiding the blame.

229
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,550
Mister Xiao, you are really smart.

230
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:19,190
They can fight but they choose not to escape.

231
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:24,090
That's not the way of men.
I haven't successfully avenged myself.

232
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:28,110
So please tell me a way to get out.

233
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,130
So what if you avenge yourself?

234
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,830
So what if you can't?

235
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,650
Why are you so obsessed with it?

236
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,280
After this battle, you have become famous already.

237
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,980
I guarantee you will have the most pleasure
for the rest of your life.

238
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:52,050
But that is not what I want.

239
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:58,480
Lord, I have one more request...

240
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,900
All right. Enough said.
Today is all about celebrating. Here, drink.

241
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,870
I'll ask you one more time.

242
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:17,150
How on earth can I get out of here?

243
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,000
You really want to get out?

244
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,550
Yes.

245
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,510
That is very difficult.

246
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,640
I will die for it.

247
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,810
There are regulations for people to get out.

248
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,880
But you're the first one who wants to get out.

249
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,110
Fine, as long as you become one of the top ten fighters
in the Valley, you're free to go.

250
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,480
Is that true?

251
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,390
Do you really think you can get into the top ten?

252
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,970
Why won't you kill anyone?

253
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:53,170
I was raised that way.
I don't have the courage to kill anyone.

254
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:58,150
Here is called Villain Valley
because all the people who live here are villains.

255
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:01,230
If you kill a villain, you get his treasure.

256
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:05,430
The Valley villagers like that.
Where's the harm?

257
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,070
No joy. I don't enjoy it.

258
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:15,150
I don't know if that Lone Sail fellow today
was a villain or not.

259
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,080
At least, he hadn't hurt me before.

260
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:25,230
All I know is, in this place people earn
their living with their knives and swords.

261
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:29,370
No families. No clans.

262
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,670
I like that.

263
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:36,210
It's easier than up there.

264
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:40,260
Well said. If you really get into the top ten,

265
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,950
I will let it all go and let you all leave.

266
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,100
You have a deal.

267
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,980
Medicine Elder!

268
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,580
Medicine Elder!

269
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,970
Medicine Elder!

270
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,740
Medicine Elder!

271
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,460
Medicine Elder!

272
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,490
Medicine Elder!

273
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,990
Medicine Elder!

274
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,900
Medicine Elder!

275
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,750
Medicine Elder!

276
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,490
Medicine Elder!

277
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,310
Medicine Elder!

278
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,740
Medicine Elder!

279
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,130
I can't get past this! Medicine Elder!

280
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,820
I really can't do it!

281
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:51,160
May I ask where this is?

282
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,640
Are you talking to me?

283
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,930
That's right! Who are you?

284
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,940
Where is this?

285
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,050
You used a blood sacrificial ritual
to pay your respect to the Mystical Heavy Ruler.

286
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:10,390
You summoned me but don't know who I am?

287
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,860
I am Hun Miesheng.

288
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,130
No need to worry.
I don't need to deal with you myself.

289
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:28,050
This form is only a body double.

290
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:31,250
I am the spiritual energy I placed inside
when I made the Mystical Heavy Ruler.

291
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:48,040
As long as you're in my clan,
blood is your path and the white knife is your banner.

292
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,040
Tell me what you want to learn.

293
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,480
I am not here to learn your Soul Hall skills.
Let me go back.

294
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,020
You have to be a thief then!

295
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,000
Who are you calling a thief?

296
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,560
You learned the skill to separate your soul
from your body. You think I didn't know?

297
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,610
It's a shame. This set of skills requires...

298
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:10,730
a set of codes
then you can take it to the next level.

299
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:16,360
You just made yourself like a lonely ghost
who flies around and you're happy?

300
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,550
This is our most advanced skill.

301
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,950
Do you know why I am named Hun Miesheng?

302
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,670
Why?

303
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:31,290
Because I've died so many times.

304
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,570
I can make duplicates of myself.

305
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:37,550
I can also approach my enemy
without making a sound.

306
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,940
I can kill them in one attack.

307
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:49,649
Every set of skills from our Soul Hall

308
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:53,260
can shock the world.

309
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,810
Tell me what you want to learn.

310
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,840
I'm not learning.

311
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,880
I don't want to use these evil practices.

312
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,590
Is that so?

313
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:07,810
How will you fight your way
out of the Villain Valley then?

314
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:12,390
I will just die here.

315
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:15,260
If I joined Soul Hall,

316
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,260
I would be a disgrace to my ancestors, my mother,

317
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,180
and everyone who believes in me.

318
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,410
Fool!

319
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,920
There's no good or evil
when it comes to martial practices!

320
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,880
Many years ago, I had a brother

321
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,680
who said equally foolish things.

322
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,270
It's a shame he died earlier than I did.

323
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:42,790
You call him the Fight God,
but was he really that remarkable?

324
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,640
Fight God?

325
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,040
You lie!

326
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,470
You have a special bond with the Mystical Heavy Ruler.

327
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:53,430
I am the only one who can help you get through this.

328
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,090
Let's make a wager.

329
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,320
What's the bet?

330
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,220
I will teach you skills

331
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:12,440
and if one day you can defeat and eliminate me,

332
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,670
I will admit you're right.
But if you can't defeat me,

333
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,730
you'll stay here forever.

334
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,950
What if I die on a Villain Valley battlefield?

335
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:28,200
How could you not defeat those mere mortals
with the skills I will teach you?

336
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,760
Are you laughing at me?

337
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,890
Observe this.

338
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,920
The authentic Mystical Heavy Ruler technique.

339
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,420
I...

340
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,280
That is just a soft twig.

341
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,080
Imbecile. You have the Essence Flame

342
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,990
that can be attached to the Mystical Heavy Ruler.

343
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:10,270
It can become soft or hard as you wish.

344
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:10,460
The way you look...
I don't think you have a chance of getting out.

345
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:14,800
Your Fight Qi is so much higher than mine. Of course,
you'll know which direction I'm attacking you from.

346
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:26,780
When you're facing the enemy, you need to
reserve some Fight Qi to protect yourself.

347
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,900
When you have enough Fight Qi,

348
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:33,410
any attack will be interrupted with your Qi protection.

349
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:40,140
You don't need your eyes, ears, or body.

350
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:44,790
It all depends on your heart.

351
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,640
Let me ask you,

352
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,040
what were you thinking of
during the recent fights?

353
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,080
I don't know.

354
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:02,550
I just felt like I had
so much more hate in me than before.

355
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:06,190
Who are you hating?

356
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,490
I hate my mother.

357
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,410
She shouldn't have abandoned me.

358
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:19,780
She shouldn't have joined the attack on your Soul Hall.

359
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,340
There were so many people.
Her not being there wouldn't have changed anything.

360
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:28,530
She lost her life for nothing
and she didn't think about me.

361
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,380
I hate my father.

362
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,370
I didn't have enough Fight Qi when I was a kid,

363
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:38,130
so I was beaten by a crowd.

364
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:41,300
He didn't help me.

365
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,590
He only gave me his sarcasm.

366
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,170
I hate Yao Chen.

367
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,990
He knew I learned the soul body
separation skills to save lives.

368
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,990
He wanted to kill me
without even hearing my explanation.

369
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,500
I even...

370
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,110
hate Xun'er.

371
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,140
I think about her when I do everything.

372
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,920
I have to think about her before I do anything.

373
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,300
When I think about these people I hate,

374
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,100
it's like I have endless energy

375
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:27,580
and endless Fight Qi.

376
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,340
That's good.

377
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:35,020
Bring out your hatred.

378
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:39,530
The speed of improving your Qi will be much faster.

379
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,500
That is a big secret.

380
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,980
Compared to the kindness
those hypocrites pretend to show,

381
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,890
hatred is more real.

382
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:56,690
It makes you feel like you're still alive.

383
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,570
♫ If you want change, battle it out with no fear of chaos ♫
