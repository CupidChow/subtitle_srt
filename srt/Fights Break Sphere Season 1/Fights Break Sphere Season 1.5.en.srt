Medicine Elder! Medicine Elder!

4
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,160
Medicine Elder!

5
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,000
Medicine Elder! Medicine Elder!

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,180
What's the matter?

7
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,900
There's someone outside that I can't defeat.
Do you have any other way?

8
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,690
Be a bit more mature, all right?

9
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,870
That person is one rank higher than me.
There's no way I can fight him.

10
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,710
Your skills are lousy.
There are many that you can't defeat.

11
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,930
Leave me alone. Let me sleep for a while more.

12
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,550
If I don't defeat him,
then I can't even get into the academy.

13
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,710
Can you please stop bothering me? Just because
you can't defeat him, you come inside to ask me?

14
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,200
If one could learn from someone instantly,
that person would be a god!

15
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,100
It won't do, Medicine Elder!
If we don't defeat him, we're done!

16
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,720
His Fight Qi is higher than yours by many ranks and stages.

17
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,620
Have you seen an adult beat a child?
How can you win?

18
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,810
You being the world's number one alchemist is
of no use either. At critical times, you are helpless, too!

19
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,180
No use relying on the prodding method!
I can't help you with this.

20
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,450
Can you please let me go?

21
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,120
If you don't teach me, I won't let go.

22
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,780
Fine. I'll teach you. That should do, right?

23
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,380
Use your Fight Qi to block your six channels
and cut off your three vital vessels.

24
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,300
When your opponent looks at you, he'll go, "Oh, no, he's dead!"
Think about it. Who can win against a dead person?

25
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,990
If he can't still defeat you,
you will be unrivaled in the world.

26
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,380
Three Thousand Thunder Movement!

00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,960
Bang...! Bang...! Boom...!

28
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,230
Senior, I only know one move in this Fight Technique.

29
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,890
I still haven't learned the others.

30
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,130
Little rascal.

31
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,950
Brother Xiao Yan!

32
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,220
Xiao Yan!

33
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,570
- Brother Xiao Yan.
- Xiao Yan.

34
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,300
Xiao Yan!

35
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,490
- Brother Xiao Yan.
- Xiao Yan.

36
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,960
Did my martial arts energy increase again?

37
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,090
Xiao Yan. Xiao Yan!

38
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,590
Brother Xiao Yan.

39
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,190
Xiao Yan.

40
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,420
You beat Xiao Yan to death.

41
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,950
Just you wait! The Xiao family
and the Gu Clan will all come to find you.

42
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,120
If one is willing to fight, he must be able
to accept defeat. Whether he's dead or not,

43
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,360
you can't blame me.

44
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,990
Brother Xiao Yan.

45
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,190
Brother Xiao Yan...

46
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,520
Xiao Yan.

47
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,320
Fine. Let me take a look at him.

48
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,280
Move aside.

49
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,870
Despicable. Shameless!

50
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,860
You stole our stuff
and you still dare to say we are shameless.

51
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,310
If you have the ability, get me out.

52
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,480
Let's fight using real abilities!

53
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,450
I can't beat you with my ability now.

54
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,760
Why don't you just stay here for two years.
I'll come back to find you when I have mastered the skills.

55
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,430
You.

56
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,390
But if he waits two or three years,
won't he starve to death?

57
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,060
Then I'll never be able to win.

58
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,180
Why is that?

59
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,600
Because no matter how powerful a person is

60
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,580
he still can't beat a dead person.

61
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,230
Senior Bai Shan is legendary in the academy
for being unbeatable.

62
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,000
Get me out of here!

63
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:21,090
Senior Bai Shan, for your delivery
of so many energy talismans today,

64
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,080
we won't torment you anymore.

65
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,000
Once we get to the academy, we will tell
your friends to come and dig you out.

66
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:38,380
Great, since we are full now, let's get going.
We should be able to reach the academy before it gets dark.

67
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,810
This is wrong. What's the point of burying me here?

68
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,910
You all have taken away the energy talismans.

69
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,430
Let me out already!

70
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,660
Just you wait. Once we're back at the academy,

71
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,010
I'll kill you all!

72
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,240
The fire hasn't been extinguished yet!

73
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,170
This is the forest! Be careful of the tinder!

74
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,100
Before entering the academy, I thought
that I was the strongest among all the first years.

75
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,460
Never thought that there existed a scenario of
"In the world, everyone is better than oneself.."

76
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,720
How did you train? Your Fight Qi is so strong.

77
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,110
That's right. Quick, tell us.

78
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,010
My Fight Qi is increasing very slowly.
Can you teach me how to train my qi?

79
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,430
I know. Brother Xiao Yan's skills

80
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,280
are certainly products of god-given talent and hard work.

81
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,780
His god-given talent is that he had already attained Stage 9
Fight Qi Skills when he was just nine years old.

82
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,490
For hard work, he diligently trains from morning to night.

83
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,760
If all of you want to catch up with him,
you would have to put in a lot of hard work.

84
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,110
Enough, Xun'er. It's not that exaggerated.

85
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,780
I also have had a long period of low Fight Qi.

86
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:51,220
Fortunately, I didn't give up
and was able to get past it.

87
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,820
Stage 9 Fight Qi Skills at nine years old?

88
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,080
Then, doesn't that mean I'll never become a Fight
Practitioner in this lifetime?

89
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,910
How is that possible? Jia Nan Academy

90
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,890
has trained countless Fight Practitioners.
As long as you enter the academy,

91
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,110
you'll surely walk the path of a Fight Practitioner in the future.

92
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,020
During our Smelting Trial, we wouldn't have been
able to survive if any one of us was missing.

93
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,430
From now on, we can be considered as sworn brothers
who will live and die for each other.

94
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,140
- From now on, if you have questions on training, just ask me.
- Sure!

95
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,200
- I can teach you, too.
- And me.

96
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,930
Thank you to all of you!

97
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,450
You better teach us properly then.

98
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,350
No problem.

99
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,340
♫ From sprouting one leaf ♫

100
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,700
♫ To covering the whole blue sky ♫

101
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,150
After the cruel training in Black Point Region,

102
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,020
our group finally arrived at the Jia Nan Academy.

103
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,380
Thousands of years ago, the Fight God
preserved his lifetime of attainments there.

104
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,980
He also left behind seeds of righteous spirit

105
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,240
that would guide the youth of the Fight Qi Continent

106
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,530
to resist the darkness and triumph over evil.

107
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,159
We'll soon learn Fight Qi at the Jia Nan Academy,

108
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,970
along with alchemy
and other martial arts fight techniques.

109
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,300
So from now on, we bear the duty to fight the Soul Hall

110
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,540
and accept the mission to protect the light of life.

111
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,690
[Jia Nan]

112
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,010
How about it? What can you say about my clothes?

113
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,350
- Your clothes are quite nice. - Really?
- I feel that they are better than ours.

114
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,430
- That's right. A white robe looks better than this.
- I think that your clothes look good, too.

115
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,750
Old friends and new students, hello.

116
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,600
I'm Mi Tengshan.

117
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,120
Today, the Association of Elders chose me

118
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,920
to address the first years.

119
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,570
I'm not good at giving speeches at all.

120
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,200
Especially when I'm seeing first years
who have traveled through the Black Point Region Forest

121
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,390
for three days and three nights
and are very hungry and tired.

122
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,010
The canteen of the academy is now filled with food,

123
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,100
yet all you still have to stand here to hear me talk.

124
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,770
I really feel sorry for that.

125
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,950
But... I do have to talk about the important matters.

126
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,030
Regarding the importance and meaning of this academy,

127
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,760
there will be teachers who will tell you in detail.

128
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,630
I will only talk about
two important rules and regulations.

129
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,070
First:

130
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,240
There is only one principal at Jia Nan Academy,

131
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,350
and that is the Fight God.

132
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,390
Even though he is no longer with us now,

133
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,210
the academy is jointly managed by the elders.

134
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:35,610
In other words, it means that upon entering this academy,
all of you are the Fight God's students.

135
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,700
You then must forever be prepared to fight against

136
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,430
the Blood Sect, Soul Hall,
and the evil sects in the extremely cold North.

137
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,610
If you are against doing this,

138
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,540
you can now leave
so that we don't harm others or ourselves.

139
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,010
Second:

140
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,790
The academy is strictly against private fights.

141
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:00,300
Any students that participate in any private fights
will be severely punished.

142
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,010
Suspension. Confinement.

143
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,090
Even up to expulsion.

144
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,190
If any of you want to fight,

145
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:14,860
you can post a public announcement in the
Fight Techniques Public Arena, and compete in public.

146
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,660
Everyone, remember these two rules.

147
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,930
I'm also done with my speech.
I wish all students

148
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,310
improvement in your learning and a happy life.

149
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,990
Now, you can all enter the academy as quickly as you can.

150
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,330
- Let's go.
- I'm very hungry.

151
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,530
- Wait a while. - Wait for me.
- Hurry.

152
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,360
Hurry.

153
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,430
Are you all right? You seemed to
be distracted ever since it started.

154
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,220
I keep feeling that

155
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,350
there are a lot of malicious gazes staring at me.

156
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,200
Didn't you hear it earlier?

157
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,790
Private fights will be punished.
I don't think they have the guts to do that.

158
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,820
Let's go eat.

159
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,170
Let's go.

160
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,060
This is your room.

161
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,650
When you leave the dormitory area,
there are several good shops on its eastern side.

162
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,130
Buy your martial arts techniques (manuals)
and lesson books there.

163
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,900
Whatever you want to buy, just go there to buy it.

164
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,730
If you want something that's rare and strange,

165
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,300
go to the students' flea market during public holidays.

166
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,850
- Thank you, Senior.
- There's no need for formality.

167
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,540
No... You... Aren't you here
to look for trouble with us?

168
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,220
I'm not the same as that Black White Evil Duo.

169
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,660
Once you are their seniors next year, you will also go to
the Black Point Region to steal from the first years, too.

170
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,550
This is jungle education. Everyone
entering the academy must pass this stage.

171
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,850
Do you think I really need
your small quantity of energy talismans?

172
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,120
- Senior, may I ask you something?
- Ask away.

173
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,500
Why was there no attention paid to us
when we were on our way here a while ago?

174
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,220
All of you created quite a sensation when you robbed
the seniors in the Black Point Region.

175
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,200
First years are usually all afraid
of being avenged by the seniors.

176
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,400
Who would dare to get close to any of you?

177
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,730
So the four of us living together

178
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,430
is to wait for the seniors to cook us in one pot.

179
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,450
When will they come?

180
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,210
Junior, don't be so hot-headed.

181
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,650
This isn't the Black Point Region.
Who would dare to engage in private fights?

182
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,890
Just guard against the Black White Evil Duo
and you'll be just fine.

183
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,960
Those two are very petty.

184
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,940
They won't let anyone pursue the female juniors that they like.
They also won't share the energy talismans that they stole.

185
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,690
A lot of people don't like them.
After you defeated them,

186
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,210
there were a lot of people celebrating.

187
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,970
Let's go. I'll take you all on a tour.

188
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,600
Sure.

189
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,170
You can all go ahead first.
I'll clean the room.

190
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,340
Let's go.

191
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,100
Greetings, Sect Leader Bai.

192
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,410
- You are even a sect leader?
- Yes.

193
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,670
The academy allows students to form sects.

194
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,990
Everyone helps each other.

195
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,540
Not the type of sects for fighting though.

196
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,430
- Greetings, Sect Leader Bai.
- Greetings, Sect Leader Bai.

197
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,260
My younger brother Bai Shan and I created a Bai Sect.

198
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,060
We mainly train in martial arts and fight techniques.

199
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,460
After several years, when all of you know more people,

200
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,650
create your own sect.
You can earn energy talismans from it.

201
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,060
Right?

202
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:08,500
I didn't hear wrongly, did I?
Bai Shan is your younger brother?

203
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,770
Indeed. We are biological brothers.

204
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,840
- Why? Do we not look alike? - Alike.
- His Fight Qi is higher than yours.

205
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,150
And he's older than you. How are you two alike?

206
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:22,300
This is called growing up before one's time.
What do you know?

207
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,360
I'll take you to the Fen Tian Qi Training Pagoda now.

208
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,670
All high ranked martial arts must be trained in there.

209
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,080
Under that place is a big snake that spits fire.

210
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,870
If your Fight Qi stage is low, stay far away from it.

211
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,460
Let's go. Come with me.

212
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,120
Greetings, Sect Leader Bai.

213
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,080
Sect Leader?

214
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,040
Sect Leader Bai, wait for me!

215
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,870
Every rest day per week and during holidays,

216
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,750
the academy will open up for a flea market.

217
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,530
People exchange their treasures here.

218
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,100
You mainly have to depend on this to earn energy talismans.

219
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,720
Those who come here are not poor kids.
As long as your item is interesting enough,

220
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,290
you will surely earn some profit.

221
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,950
Come and look, classmates. A low-level little beast.

222
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,360
This pair of Flying Dragon Wings isn't quite stable.

223
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,550
You need to use it for some time first
for it to gain stability.

224
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,370
Let me give you a special offer.

225
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,050
I'll maintain it for you for free every year.

226
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,090
- Are you all right?
- Let's take a look.

227
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,070
You are really too heavy.
This pair of wings is unable to carry you.

228
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,980
Let's go. I'll help you
look for a pair of Griffin Wings.

229
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,620
It's all my fault for having low Fight Qi.

230
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,910
My dream, when I was a child, was to be able to
create a pair of wings and fly up into the sky.

231
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,710
Never thought that humans could really put on wings.

232
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,200
Senior, how much is that pair of wings?

233
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,910
- Having wings like that can make things convenient, right?
- Of course.

234
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,360
Senior, help me find me a pair of wings
that won't need Fight Qi.

235
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,470
I've been a Sect Leader for two years
and still can't afford to buy a pair.

236
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,320
You all should stop thinking about it.

237
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,480
- The pair of wings that fell to the ground cost over 10 million.
- What?

238
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,670
In the future, you three can rent a stall, too.
Just sell whatever you can.

239
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,890
When you earn some money, you'll be able to improve
your equipment and rent a training place. Right?

240
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:20,050
- That's logical.
- This area is the household area.

241
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,310
The items in these shops are all exquisite ones. You can
go in and buy. There is a post office to the side.

242
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,980
If you're going to write letters to your family
or send some packages, you go there.

243
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,640
And there are some small restaurants.

244
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,920
If you're unwilling to eat the food from the canteen,
you can come here to eat.

245
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,710
If you go straight from here, it's the classroom area already.

246
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,650
Fine. Thank you, Senior.

247
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:38,160
- It's nothing.
- We'll just wander around by ourselves from here on.

248
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,650
- Good. I'll get going then.
- Senior, take care.

249
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,260
Senior, take care.

250
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,760
You two just stroll around first.
I'll just go check on Xun'er.

251
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,850
Let's go take a look over there.

252
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,990
Vote for who you like.

253
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,660
- I bet on Bai Shan! - Those betting on Bai Shan, put
your bets here. The chances of Bai Shan winning is very high.

254
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,950
Those betting on Gu Ka, put your bets here.
Gu Ka is a dark horse.

255
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,070
Student, do you want to bet?

256
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,400
You can cheer on the player that you like.

257
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,970
Those students who haven't voted yet,
quickly vote now! Vote now.

258
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,560
Who will win this round?

259
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,220
Let's all wait and see!

260
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,860
Begin.

261
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,550
Good! Good! Good!

262
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,220
Good! Good!

263
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:32,250
We were really lucky to be able to pass through that
Smelting Trial with this Bai Shan guarding us.

264
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,190
Yes, those two are not on the same level.

265
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,410
This won't last to the second round.

266
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,620
Good!

267
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,000
Bai Shan, you're really great! Good!

268
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,920
Bai Shan wins!

269
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,860
Brother Xiao Yan!

270
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,860
You're all here?

271
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,990
- How is it? Are you getting used to living in the dormitory?
- It's quite good.

272
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,000
If you need anything, just write a letter home
and let Father send it here.

273
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,360
I'm already attending school.
How can I still ask Father for stuff?

274
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,570
That's true.

275
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,340
How about this. If you want anything,
I'll buy it for you.

276
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,540
Little Sister Xun'er, just say what you want.

277
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,610
I'll also buy it for you.

278
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,590
Xun'er, in your dormitory,

279
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:50,380
did you make any female junior friends in there?
Introduce one to Hao Tian.

280
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,710
What a coincidence? I just made a new friend.

281
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,830
She's really nice and she also likes Hao Tian.

282
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,810
That's what I said. There are many female juniors
who have good taste.

283
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,450
Quick, tell us. In what way is she good?

284
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,890
She... is eight feet tall, waist size is eight feet, too.

285
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,970
She's even from a family of generals.

286
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:14,530
Before her, there are even six
Fight Grand Master older brothers.

287
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,840
That doesn't suit me, right?

288
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,200
She already said that she fell in love with you
at first sight during the opening ceremony.

289
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,510
She just loves people from your Department of Alchemy.

290
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:28,230
A handsome man can indeed invite trouble.

291
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,070
There she is now!

292
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,710
♫ From sprouting one leaf ♫

293
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,780
♫ To covering the whole blue sky ♫

294
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,060
♫ One region of the world is in my heart ♫

295
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,680
♫ Even as things change with the passage of time ♫

296
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,560
♫ From dreaming of growing wings ♫

297
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,390
♫ To flying high and having difficulty in hiding my talent ♫

298
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,550
Mother!

299
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,410
Move aside!

300
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,720
♫ I want, I want to experience trials and tribulations ♫

301
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,580
♫ I want, I want to forge ahead courageously ♫

302
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,340
♫ I want, I want the mountain in my sight ♫

303
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:17,180
♫ I want, I want never to have any higher plains to climb ♫

304
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,980
Everyone, you've all seen it.

305
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,260
In Fight Technique, there are "three don'ts."

306
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,960
And Student Hu Jia committed all of them.

307
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,170
The "first don't" is speed.

308
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,800
Throwing a punch when you haven't firmly congealed
your Fight Qi Whirl will make you float and become powerless.

309
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,550
This is like a drummer.

310
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:40,260
Although he is able to keep up the rhythm,
the drum beats are inconsistent.

311
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,970
The "second don't" is stiffness.

312
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:47,230
When it's time to fight, the other party
will surely have the ability to attack.

313
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,190
If you're unable to make the appropriate adjustment
during the change in attacks

314
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,810
and continue just like you train alone at home,

315
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,630
you all will surely suffer a great disadvantage
when you are outside.

316
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,550
Understood.

317
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,940
One more time.

318
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,530
I'm not fighting anymore.

319
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,640
The "third don't" of Fight Technique

320
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,530
is to fight timidly. You must know the power of
all kinds of Fight Techniques and the fighter's drive

321
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:29,220
are closely connected. And Student Hu Jia's Fight Qi,

322
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,180
compared to when we started,
has decreased to more than a half.

323
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,960
Hu Jia, you can go back down now.

324
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,350
Who's next?

325
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,970
You go...

326
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,970
Xiao Yan, come on up.

327
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,800
Teacher Ruo Lin,

328
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,000
I can only do the Five Movement Fist.

329
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,100
Then show me the best movement you've got.

330
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,600
Yes.

331
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,200
Eight Extreme Collapse!

332
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,300
Weird.

333
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,000
Why is it weird?

334
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,500
It felt like the power was hitting
but absorbed in cotton.

335
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,600
This Eight Extreme Collapse technique you've shown
can be considered to be passed on from an authentic source.

336
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Every form of the Five Movement Fist reportedly
has this kind of power.

337
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,700
It's just that you were too ferocious, like someone
who has excessive Yang but deficient Yin.

338
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,600
You tend to only use ferocious force against
your opponent, so your flexibility is too weak.

339
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,000
I used a gentle Fight Qi to surround you.

340
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,800
Hence, your power could not be fully exerted.

341
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,200
During the next training session, you must remember
to adjust and turn to achieve a realm of perfection.

342
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,200
You mustn't keep attacking fiercely.

343
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,000
If you see someone stronger than you

344
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,600
and you counter force with force,
you'll then be horribly defeated.

345
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,700
Thank you for your guidance, Teacher.

346
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,100
Next!

347
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,000
Student Hu Jia, don't sleep during class.

348
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,000
Everyone, today we'll study

349
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
the Basic Techniques of Alchemy.

350
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,800
On your tables, there are herbs like this one.

351
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,200
This is the legendary Gather Spirit Herb.

352
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,800
This herb is very delicate.

353
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,700
Remember. Alchemy is refining with fire.

354
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,430
If you can control the fire

355
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:27,400
to any intensity you want,

356
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,650
then you're already halfway done
with refining your medicine.

357
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,100
When refining with fire,
the fire is in your heart.

358
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,800
The movement of the fire must
merge with your heartbeat.

359
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,340
At the most suitable time,

360
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,600
extract the essence of the medicine.

361
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,600
This, by the way, is the essence
of the Gather Spirit Herb.

362
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,000
This thing placed on your table

363
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,300
is called Dragon Tree Tassel.

364
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,900
A tree like this must be at least thirty years old
before it can be used for medicine-making.

365
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,800
At this time, you need to fiercely
attack it with a strong fire.

366
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,700
Pay attention to the fire's angle and temperature.

367
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,400
Bull's Eye Stone, Elderberry, and Fire Lotus Fruit.

368
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,500
The Gather Spirit Herb is the king.

369
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,200
The Dragon Tree Tassel is the subject.

370
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,000
The other medicines are the assistants.

371
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,500
The fire is the mother. The medicine is the son.

372
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,500
This is the medicine pellet we've produced
by refining with fire.

373
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,200
This is a medicine for injuries.

374
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,420
You can use it for both internal and external injuries.

375
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,900
In the future, students from the Department of Alchemy
will learn more things.

376
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,000
As for those from the Department of Fight Techniques,

377
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,700
it's enough for you to learn some medicines
to treat fighting injuries.

378
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,000
Next, you all try doing it by yourself.

379
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,860
♫ From sprouting one leaf ♫

380
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,800

386

♫ The youth I once had was not in vain ♫

387
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:04,960
During the refining, the amount
of Gather Spirit Herb Essence must be high

388
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,400
or else when you put in the Dragon Tree Tassel,

389
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,700
it will explode easily.

390

♫ The youth I once had was not in vain ♫

400
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,800
Why didn't Brother Xiao Yan come to learn alchemy?

401
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,200
Xiao Yan found himself another teacher.

402
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,500
He looks down on Teacher Gu He.

403
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,000
You... Why didn't your face get blackened?

404
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,600
Your face is so dark.

405
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,000
♫ I want, I want never to have
any higher plains to climb ♫

406
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,400
One!

407
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,000
Two!

408
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,200
Three!

409
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,800
Four!

410
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,700
Five!

411
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,500
Six!

412
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,290
Seven!

413
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,300
Stop! Stop!

414
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,300
It's Five Movement Fist.

415
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,200
It's a fist method that you all have been
training in since you were little.

416
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,200
Why does it look like you haven't eaten?

417
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
Do you all feel that upon arriving here
at Jia Nan Academy,

418
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,500
you will be learning some outstanding
fight technique or martial arts?

419
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,900
If you all can't even master the Five Movement Fist,

420
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,300
what else can I teach you?

421
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,900
Teach you what!

422
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,000
Listen well! Next, Elder Han will give you a lecture.

423
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,600
Here, gather!

424
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,400
What Elder Ge said earlier is very accurate.

425
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,000
In your first semester here at Jia Nan Academy,

426
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
you must master the Five Movement Fist.

427
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,200
I know none of you want to learn this

428
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,100
because it's too easy.

429
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,400
But I need to remind you

430
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,000
to never forget this fist technique.

431
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,400
In terms of fight techniques,

432
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,400
all forms of any fight technique in this world

433
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,400
originated from this fist technique.

434
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,700
This was especially devised by the Fight God

435
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:38,800
to begin the training of the youths
from the Five Great Clans.

436
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,400
Even though there are only five punches in it,

437
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,800
it includes all

438
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,900
the essence of all the fight techniques in this world.

439
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,400
If you're able to do it well,
it can provide endless power.

440
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:56,600
I remember that during the recruitment in Wu Tan City,

441
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,700
our student Xiao Yan

442
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,600
used a Fight Technique created from the Collapse Fist

443
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,400
and fought a Cloud Mist Sect disciple
till he flew into the air.

444
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,400
You all probably don't believe me, right?

445
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
It's fine.

446
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,400
Let's call him out. We'll demonstrate it here

447
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
to show it to you all right now.
How about it?

448
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Classmate Xiao Yan, come.

449
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,600
Come, everyone. Move aside...

450
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,800
Don't be shy. Come.

451
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,600
If my guess is right,

452
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,900
it should be...

453
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,960
Eight Extreme Collapse!

454
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,600
Are you all right, child?

455
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,400
Why does the Fight Technique you have learned
originate from our Star Fall Pavilion?

456
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,700
Where did you learn it?

457
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,200
I think...

458
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,800
we should add one more crime
of "privately passing down a Fight Technique"

459
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,800
to your mother's crime of treason.

460
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,100
This is called the crime of stealing a technique.

461
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,900
My mother isn't a traitor.

462
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,800
Your mother isn't a traitor?

463
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,500
Why then did she have to take her own life
for fear of persecution?

464
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,200
Also, if she didn't steal it,

465
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,300
where did you learn
this Star Fall Pavilion Fight Technique?

466
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,000
Nonsense!

467
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,800
How dare you talk to an elder like that?

468
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,300
My mother isn't a traitor.

469
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,300
She's not a thief!

470
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,600
I believe Brother Xiao Yan's words.

471
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,030
It surely wasn't like all what you said.

472
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,400
Enough... Let him go.

473
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,000
He was still a child back then.

474
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,700
But I... I forgot about proper decorum.

475
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,000
Everyone, intensify your training.

476
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,400
After training today, I'm punishing you

477
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,400
with cleaning up the whole training studio!

478
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,800
Let me tell you that
if you dare talk to an elder like that again,

479
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,600
I'll beat you to the point
that you will regret it!

480
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,300
What are you looking at?!

481
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,400
Listen to my command. Continue the training!

482
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,300
One!

483
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,990
Two!

484
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,470
What is this?

485
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:15,510
This is my gift to you.

486
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:20,580
Keep it with you and no matter what happens,

487
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,950
you must properly protect this Spatial Ring.

488
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,020
Mother, then don't leave me.

489
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,190
I won't leave you. Not even for one day.

490
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:37,360
I want to see you grow up.

491
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,130
Not even missing one day.

492
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,300
Hey!

493
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:01,400
- Hey, what are you doing?!
- Move...!

494
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,550
Gu Wenxin colluded with Soul Hall to kill Master.
Quickly bring her out for me!

495
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,120
Gu Wenxin is a monster!

496
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:19,350
She charged into our Star Fall Pavilion and
robbed us of our Fight Techniques and Martial Arts.

497
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,240
She took the relic of Spiritual Cauldron
from our Venerable Medicine Supreme.

498
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,190
Everyone, look.

499
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,950
This was caused by that Gu Wenxin monster.
Also, the brothers behind me,

500
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,350
the wounds on their bodies were caused by her!

501
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:32,990
I want to ask

502
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:36,510
who has personally seen my wife
murder Venerable Medicine Supreme?

503
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:41,560
Clan Leader Xiao, the student of Venerable Medicine Supreme

504
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,410
who saw with his own eyes was your wife's junior, Han Feng.

505
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:52,120
Quickly hand over Gu Wenxin.

506
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:58,400
Otherwise, you all will not see tomorrow's daylight.

507
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,360
What? The Xiao family also wants the treasures?

508
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,420
You...

509
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,060
Elder Nalan, Sect Leader Yun.

510
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,270
You all returned alive.

511
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,600
Why don't you tell everyone

512
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,310
what you saw?

513
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,560
You murdered the Supreme,

514
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,560
robbed Star Fall Pavilion,

515
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,520
betrayed the alliance of the five clans.

516
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,700
Since you say
I betrayed the alliance of the five clans,

517
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,860
and became a slave to Hun Miesheng,

518
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,960
why would I have the treasures?

519
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,700
Where are the treasures then?

520
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:50,200
Tell me. I want you to resolve it yourself.

521
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,610
- Xiao Yan.
- Mother!

522
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,320
- Mother!
- Xiao Yan.

523
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,950
- Xiao Yan.
- Mother!

524
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:57,030
I escaped and returned to the House of Xiao

525
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:00,030
only because I wanted to see my son.

526
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:04,390
If you all want the treasures,
go and get them from Hun Miesheng.

527
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:10,560
Sect Leader Yun, Hun Miesheng asked me
to convey a message to the five clans.

528
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,150
"Darkness is coming."

529
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,000
You're afraid, too?

530
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,410
Mother! Mother!

531
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,030
Xun'er, go kowtow to your aunt.

532
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,430
This house wine, I originally
wanted to drink it with you.

533
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:01,150
[The memorial tablet of Gu Wenxin]

534
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,200
I'm leaving it all for you.

535
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,730
I'm leaving Xun'er here.

536
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,980
In the future, let her surname be Xiao.

537
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,420
Why is that?

538
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,550
Leaving a member of the Gu tribe here will make it
easier for us to keep in touch in the future.

539
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,260
Xun'er, at Aunt's house, you must be obedient.

540
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,730
Father! Take me home.

541
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,960
I don't want to stay here, Father.

542
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,580
