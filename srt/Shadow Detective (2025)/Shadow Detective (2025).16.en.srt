00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:39,870
Here.

5
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,590
Wipe your hands.

6
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,690
You must be thirsty.

7
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,240
Here, have some water.

8
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,610
This cup is unused.

9
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,510
Are you in cahoots with Zhuo Chaoxiong?

10
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,640
I didn't kill anyone.

11
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,330
I really didn't kill anyone.

12
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,400
I'm a doctor.

13
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,240
All I do is treat patients.

14
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,410
They're all crazy.

15
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,710
Years ago, a girl escaped,

16
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,480
and you people caught her
and took her back.

17
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,540
Is she still alive?

18

I didn't kill anyone.

19
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,390
I really didn't kill anyone!

20
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,560
They're crazy!

21
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,430
It has nothing to do with me!

22
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,190
I don't know anything!

23

There are three paths.

You and I will each take one.

35

Dong, Cat, you two take one path together.

36
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,720
We'll set out simultaneously.

No one outside the building.

39

The number of people inside is unknown,

40
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,000

and other weapons.

Don't think you can get away
with your crime

53

Dr. Gu, this way, please.

57

Dr. Gu, you're here.

58
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,950
I'm really sorry

59
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,920
for making you
come all the way here so late.

60
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,270
It's fine. Inspector Guan asked for
my help,

61
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,390
so I have to help.

62
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,800
It's him, right?

63
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,870
Inspector Guan

64
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,630
already told me about
his condition on the phone.

65
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,510
How is he now?

66
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,830
He keeps repeating the same thing
over and over

67
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,310
and shows aggressive behavior.

68
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,720
He only calmed down

69
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,680
when I bandaged him.

70
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,610

Is there any food left in the patrol room?

Where can I buy some food then?

Could you check around
the neighborhood for me

99
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,360
and see if there's a place to buy food?

00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,010
Could he be the one
who kidnapped you back then?

193
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,150
It seems the man is connected to
the old case.

194
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,510
These people are far too brazen.

195
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,970
They actually dared to
come all the way here.

196
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,460
This kind of reckless behavior
does seem familiar.

197
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,480
But didn't the Hongkou Patrol Room
only notify us?

198
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,010
How did he find his way here?

199
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,800
Inspector Guan!

200
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,080
We've sent the person to the hospital.

201
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,610
Alright.

202
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,870
What happened?

203
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,150
Who was taken to the hospital?

204
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,550
We just rescued a survivor.

205
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,610
She's been taken to the hospital now.

206
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,690
Come on, let's go check on her.

207
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,180
Can't you get some rest?

208
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,740
Whatever happens,
the two of us can handle it.

209
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,570
I said you should rest...

210
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,420
I... you should rest...

211
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,630
From now on, no matter what happens,

212
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,030
I'm staying by your side.

213
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,960
Alright, I know.

214
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,550
You...

215
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,480
Slow down, Guan Cen.

216
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,200
The nurse just cleaned her up a bit.

217
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,270
She looks to be
only around 16 to 18 years old.

218
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,320
Physically, she's not in bad shape,

219
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,900
but she is a bit malnourished.

220
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,470
And due to multiple childbirths,
there has been...

221
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,800
Multiple childbirths?

222
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,320
How is that possible?
She's barely even 18.

223
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,150
Anyway,

224
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,720
some of her organ functions
show signs of deterioration.

225
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,750
We need to keep her under observation
for a while.

226
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,480
The thing is,

227
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,080
she refuses to speak,

228
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,720
so we don't dare
administer medication carelessly.

229
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,580
One more thing:

230
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,240
be careful when you visit her.

231
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,440
In her current condition,

232
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,480
she shouldn't meet too many strangers.

233
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,500
We don't know what might trigger her,

234
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,440
which could be harmful to her health.

235
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,480
Alright, doctor.

236
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,460
Let her rest quietly then.

237
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:07,900
Thank you for your help.

238
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,920
Should we get Dr. Gu?

239
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,930
No, we can't.

240
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,109
What's wrong?

241
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,040
Dr. Gu was also seriously injured.

242
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,750
You should let him rest.

243
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,490
This matter can wait a bit.

244
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,310
If I can find that survivor,

245
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,020
then I might find more survivors.

246
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,760
Maybe Jingning is still alive.

247
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,510
Thank you.

248
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,240
Where's Du Linfeng?

249
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,470
He said he's going to the hospital
to get more information.

250
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,160
You know what?

251
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,330
I always see Jingning in my dreams.

252
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,940
She's still so little.

253
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,070
Running around carefree
at the temple fair.

254
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,580
She holds candied haws in one hand

255
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,750
and points at

256
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,240
the dancing dragon with the other.

257
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,120
She shouts happily at me,

258
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,680
"Brother.

259
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,450
Brother."

260
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,400
When I first started having these dreams,

261
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,080
I was actually quite happy.

262
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,590
I'd immerse myself in the dreams...

263
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,120
and even that happiness

264
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,110
would continue after I woke up.

265
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,530
It was like a form of self-numbing.

266
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,780
But as the dreams became more frequent,

267
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,710
I became more aware

268
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,710
and more devastated.

269
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,970
In the dreams, I'd scream.

270
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,280
I'd just keep screaming.

271
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,680
I refused to sleep.

272
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,750
I felt like this was heaven's

273
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,920
punishment for me.

274
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,590
I'm a detective.

275
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,730
Every day, I uncover the truth for others.

276
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,680
Yet I can't even find my own sister.

277
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,940
You know,

278
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,720
when I was little,

279
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,570
there was a time
I was terrified of the dark—

280
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,130
so scared I couldn't sleep.

281
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,960
Then my dad would sit at my bedside

282
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,830
and tell me

283
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,590
how beautiful

284
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,930
and how luminous the night was.

285
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,020
Darkness doesn't only exist at night.

286
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,240
It's the backdrop of all beautiful things.

287
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:22,960
Guan Cen.

288
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,520
It's just dark now.

289
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,480
There will be

290
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,480
strong winds and heavy rain at night,

291
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,090
but the sun will always rise again.

292
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,200
I'll wait with you...

293
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,440
for daybreak.

294
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,250
None of you can leave tonight!

295
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,440
Let's drink till we drop!

296
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,270
Let's keep drinking!

297
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,350
-Let's drink.
-Let's drink.

298
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,610
Bartender, drinks, drinks for all of us.

299
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,500
Pour me a drink.

300
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:24,870
Excuse me,

301
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,600
this bottle of whisky
belongs to this gentleman.

302
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:31,160
The whisky I pour is my whisky.

303
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,510
He should be honored
I'm drinking his whisky.

304
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,830
Come on, let's drink.

305
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,060
Bartender, fill me up, hurry.

306
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,520
Do you have a problem
with me drinking your whisky?

307
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,090
My boss is talking to you.

308
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,480
Got a problem with that?

309
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,760
I'm asking you—
do you have a problem with that?

310
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,720
Thanks for today.

311
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,540
It's nothing. The owner is my friend.

312
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,700
Director Du, you're quite good at
fighting.

313
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,030
How come you couldn't handle a few drunks?

314
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,510
I had too much to drink today.

315
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,590
Had too much to drink?

316
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,590
I don't think so.

317
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,200
The bartender told me everything.

318
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,270
After throwing one punch,

319
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,870
you didn't fight back at all.

320
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,960
What's wrong?

321
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,770
Something on your mind?

322
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,400
Don't listen to their nonsense.

323
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,640
I just had too much to drink.

324
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,500
Work has been exhausting lately.

325
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,350
Work?

326
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,050
I don't think that's it.

327
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,920
Du Linfeng,

328
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,680
do you know

329
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,800
why I became a forensic doctor?

330
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,440
Isn't it because you like the job?

331
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,570
That's ridiculous.

332
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,720
How many people actually enjoy
working with corpses?

333
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,300
The reason I like being a forensic doctor
is that...

334
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,480
the dead never lie.

335
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,510
No matter if the body

336
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,040
has been dismembered

337
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,590
or is rotting with a terrible stench,

338
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,280
it always gives me
the most honest answers.

339
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,560
But the living don't necessarily
tell the truth.

340
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,330
Dr. Ding, why are you telling me all this?

341
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,240
Because...

342
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,690
deep down, I believe you don't lie either.

343
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,440
I'm the director
of the Intelligence Department.

344
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,160
Director?

345
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,310
In Lu's eyes,

346
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,170
you're just a foot soldier.

347
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
Actually, I know.

348
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,830
Although you seem carefree every day,

349
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,090
living it up in luxury,

350
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,440
deep down,
you feel very insecure, don't you?

351
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,560
From beginning to end...

352
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,240
the only one who's ever truly reached
your heart

353
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,400
is Lu Yizhen.

354
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,880
Am I right?

355
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,520
It seems you're not only good at
reading the dead.

356
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,270
Anyway,

357
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,250
you still have my blessing.

358
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,160
After all,

359
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,590
being in love with someone

360
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,390
is still quite a happy thing,

361
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,270
isn't it?

362
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,710
You're not that good at reading people.

363
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,900
I'm giving up on Lu Yizhen.

364
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:26,960
What?

365
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,680
I used to think

366
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,480
that the only result that mattered
was getting what you want.

367
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,510
But now I've realized

368
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,040
that the journey can also be
the destination.

369
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,200
Loving someone

370
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,070
is about wanting them
to be happy, isn't it?

371
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,200
If my love becomes a burden to her,

372
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,220
then what meaning does it even have?

373
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,680
Thank you for tonight, Dr. Ding.

374
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,540
Sorry for taking up your whole evening.

375
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,170
But...

376
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,790
I'm fine.

377
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,290
I'm Du Linfeng, after all.

378
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,610
You just got injured.

379
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,270
You shouldn't drink any more.

380
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,570
Alright, alright.

381
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,510
Lu Yizhen, you're really...

382
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,480
Okay, okay, I know I was wrong.

383
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,240
I was wrong, Dr. Si.

384
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,790
I'm sorry.

385
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,120
I'll take better care of myself next time.

386
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,190
Fine, I won't lecture you.

387
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,310
You've been up all night.

388
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,310
Get some rest now.

389
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,290
I only took a short leave.

390
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,400
I need to get back to the hospital soon.

391
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,070
Well,

392
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,270
I'll take a sedative and go to sleep.

393
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,530
Otherwise, I keep having nightmares.

394
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,970
You're going through
those pills that quickly?

395
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,620
Is this the sedative
Dr. Gu prescribed for you?

396
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,680
That's not right.

397
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,240
This doesn't look like a regular sedative.

398
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,000
I went through

399
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,160
all the files
from the kidnapping case back then

400
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,110
and found a man named Tang Jiahao.

401
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,640
According to the records,

402
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,750
this person only played a minor role

403
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,750
in the kidnapping case,

404
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,350
responsible for some cleanup work.

405
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,750
So the person
who hunted down Huang Kaiyuan

406
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,720
could be him.

407
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
If it's him,

408
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,400
why would he kill Huang Kaiyuan?

409
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,060
Weren't they on the same side?

410
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,240
I don't know.

411
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,750
But one thing's clear:

412
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,790
Huang Kaiyuan went to the Zhuo Residence
after he escaped.

413
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,110
After he left,

414
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,550
the entire Zhuo family was massacred.

415
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,550
Huang Kaiyuan was also hunted down.

416
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,220
If that's the case,

417
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,550
what grudge is there

418
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,500
between Zhuo Chaoxiong and Tang Jiahao?

419
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,630
Too many things have happened lately.

420
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,480
First, during the prison riot,

421
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,540
we found Ghost, who was already dead,

422
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,110
along with those three people
from Zhuo Chaoxiong's group.

423
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,030
Then, immediately after,

424
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,110
Wu Xiaoxiao was killed

425
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,480
in our place by the Zhuo family.

426
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,880
Before we even figured out a reason
to investigate the Zhuo family,

427
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,270
they were brutally massacred.

428
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,930
Now Huang Kaiyuan is dead too.

429
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,160
There are too many events and clues.

430
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,110
They seem connected,

431
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,590
but we can't find the link.

432
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,880
We must have missed

433
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,410
some crucial information.

434
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,350
And Yang Xiaolin hasn't been seen

435
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,310
since then.

436
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,550
Well...

437
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,210
How am I supposed to report this
to Director Huo?

438
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,840
I'll go talk to Director Huo.

439
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,200
There's too much involved in this case.

440
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,930
It can't be sorted out quickly.

441
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,640
I've put your clothes in the closet.

442
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,960
And your medicine. It's in the drawer.

443
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,490
Remember to take it on time.

444
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,140
Take your medicine! Take your medicine!

445
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,400
Now there are only the two of us left,

446
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,800
depending on each other.

447
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,830
Why are you taking care of me?

448
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,520
What business did your father run?

449
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,920
Why do you want to know these things?

450
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,960
We're in the same boat now.

451
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,790
What exactly do you want to know?

452
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,660
Do you think I'm just someone
who's after money?

453
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,240
I want more than you think.

454
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,900
I thought I could become the boss's wife.

455
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,920
Who would have thought I'd end up with

456
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,580
a good-for-nothing like you?

457
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,480
I've bet everything on you.

458
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,830
You have no way out.

459
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:58,790
And neither do I.

460
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,460
I can only make you the boss again.

461
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,240
You need to tell me everything.
