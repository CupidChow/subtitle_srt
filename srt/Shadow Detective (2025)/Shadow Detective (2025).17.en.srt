1
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,570
I'm afraid I can't take it anymore.

2
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,790
Lu Jialei should have been dead long ago.

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,190
Every minute she's still alive

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,230
is a reminder of my past mistakes

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,090
and a stain on my record.

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,470
It isn't our goal to kill her.

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,650
She's still useful to us.

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,000
[Shadow Detective]

9
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,970
[Episode 17]

10
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,030
This is the right bottle,

11
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,710
but the pills inside are wrong.

12
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,750
I've seen this kind of pill before.

13
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,190
It shouldn't be like this.

14
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,910
This...

15
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,430
This looks more like

16
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,190
a psychotropic drug.

17
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,380
If I remember correctly,

18
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,160
the first time I saw such pills

19
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,090
was during a visit
to a psychiatric hospital.

20
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,630
Seriously?

21
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,630
This medicine

22
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,560
has a sedative effect on patients,

23
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,240
but can cause headaches
and frequent dreaming

24
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,800
in healthy individuals with long-term use,

25
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,800
or even more serious consequences.

26
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,280
I'll take this bottle of pills back
for some tests.

27
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,800
I might be mistaken.

28
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,650
Or perhaps this medicine
has other effects.

29
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,800
Anyway,

30
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,630
before I reach a conclusion,

31
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,280
you must not take it anymore.

32
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,950
You're awake, Dr. Gu.

33
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,590
Lu,

34
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,480
what brings you here?

35
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,100
Let me help you.

36
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,440
Thank you.

37
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,630
I must have fallen asleep.

38
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,770
How come you have time to visit me?

39
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,400
I've been wanting to come visit you

40
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,130
and see how you're recovering.

41
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,710
I know you're always busy working.

42
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm fine, really.

43
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,870
The nurse said

44
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,870
I'd get well after some rest.

45
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,310
I'm sorry to have

46
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,090
caused you trouble this time.

47
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,290
Actually, I didn't help with much.

48
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,960
You've given me a lot of help.

49
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,910
The sleeping pills you prescribed for me

50
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,240
have helped me sleep much better at night.

51
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,910
Really?

52
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,590
Glad to hear that.

53
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,030
Only when you're well rested

54
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,310
can you have the energy
to investigate cases.

55
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,560
However...

56
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,290
I often have nightmares.

57
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,840
Nightmares?

58
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,400
I'm wondering

59
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,730
if there's a side effect of this medicine.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,560
The ingredients are mostly plant-based,

61
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,290
such as spiny jujube seeds
and arborvitae seeds.

62
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,910
This medicine is quite mild.

63
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,000
Could someone have changed your pills?

64
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,070
Changed my pills?

65
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,580
Could that have happened?

66
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,790
It's a real possibility.

67
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,000
Nowadays, bad people

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,190
can come up with all sorts of evil plans.

69
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,720
If that has truly happened,

70
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,630
it means you're in danger now.

71
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,960
Have you told Inspector Guan about it yet?

72
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,240
No.

73
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,210
Look into it.

74
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,120
You must look into it.

75
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,190
I fear that someone may harm you.

76
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,040
Don't worry about me.

77
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,190
I'll stay alert.

78
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,790
Just focus on your recovery.

79
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,560
You have to be extra cautious.

80
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,190
Dr. Gu, it's time to change your dressing.

81
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,230
Have a good rest.

82
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,530
I'll visit you again in a few days.

83
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,600
You're busy all the time.

84
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,270
Just focus on your work.

85
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,390
I'll be fine here.

86
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,310
I'll get going then.

87
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,430
Okay. Take care.

88
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,630
Lu Yizhen,

89
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,520
why do you pretend not to hear me

90
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,880
every time I talk to you?

91
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,550
I'm talking to you now.

92
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,750
When will you be back?

93
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,860
Who are you talking to?

94
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,750
You're back.

95
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,560
I looked into that medicine for you.

96
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,830
What did you find?

97
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,510
Just as I said,

98
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,640
it's not a sedative.

99
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,040
A doctor I'm acquainted with,

100
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,100
after hearing about your condition,

101
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:43,900
told me

102
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,330
that it was fine to take sedatives,

103
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,950
but long-term dependence on medication
was not advisable,

104
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,680
and that you needed to relax

105
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,300
and find relief from stress.

106
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,870
I'm talking to you. Are you listening?

107
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,240
I am.

108
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,610
I am listening.

109
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,630
So?

110
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,160
Did you tell Dr. Gu about it?

111
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,950
Yes, I did.

112
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,570
But not in so many words.

113
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,150
He seemed to have no idea about it at all.

114
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,270
And it was he who suggested
that someone might have

115
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,360
changed my pills.

116
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,110
Actually,
I've also thought of that possibility.

117
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,870
After all, he and his colleagues

118
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,990
are surely able
to tell different pills apart.

119
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,990
They couldn't have mistaken yours.

120
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,480
But I really can't think of anyone

121
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,940
who could change my pills.

122
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,690
Alright. Just drop it.

123
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,720
Look at that deep frown on your face.

124
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,460
For your own safety,

125
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,040
from now on, don't take any medicine

126
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,630
that hasn't been checked by me.

127
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,380
Do you hear me?

128
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:40,909
Yes, I do,

129
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,440
Dr. Si.

130
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,310
So this is where we stand now.

131
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,270
Split up and get to work, guys.

132
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:46,930
-Yes.
-Yes.

133
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,920
Dong, brief her.

134
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,600
Okay.

135
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,159
An antique shop on Guangdong Road
was robbed.

136
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,950
Two shop assistants were severely slashed.

137
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,410
All the antiques in the shop
were taken away.

138
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,480
Have you discussed

139
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,000
the Zhuo family's case with Director Huo?

140
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,090
That case is not to be rushed.

141
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,040
We'll deal with this robbery first.

142
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,170
Let's go take a look.

143
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,850
[Fu Yuan Xing]

144
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,850
How unfortunate.

145
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,020
The shop got robbed
at this particular time.

146
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,560
What do you mean?

147
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,920
I had just got a new shipment
of precious items in,

148
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,680
including imperial porcelain
from the Qianlong Period

149
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,610
and some calligraphy and painting works
of Tang Yin.

150
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,470
How much is the overall loss?

151
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,640
Well...

152
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,320
The exact figure is yet to be determined.

153
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,850
I've taken out a bank loan.

154
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
How am I supposed to survive this?

155
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,950
How many robbers were there?

156
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,720
Four.

157
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,550
Four robbers.

158
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,560
Did you catch a look at their faces?

159
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,040
Guan Cen.

160
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:07,920
The interview's done.

161
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
What did you find?

162
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,360
The shop owner is named Wu Chang.

163
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,870
During my conversation with him,

164
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,830
he complained about being robbed
at this particular time.

165
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,560
It seems this robbery
has really struck him hard.

166
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:20,850
Inspector.

167
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,950
The witness stated

168
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,540
that there were four robbers,

169
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,740
who showed up with their faces covered.

170
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,920
During the robbery,

171
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,190
one person waited in the car,

172
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,680
while the others ransacked the shop.

173
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,809
One of them had a gun.

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
They had well-defined roles.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,789
These should be habitual offenders.

176
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,000
Check the list
of newly released ex-convicts.

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,240
See if anyone matches the profile.

178
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,640
Got it.

179
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,549
Two shop assistants were injured.

180
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,630
One sank into a coma,
and the other was slashed.

181
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,150
The robbery lasted for a very short time.

182
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,550
The robber holding the gun didn't fire it.

183
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,480
No firing at all?

184
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,440
They were probably
avoiding drawing attention.

185
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
After all, the robbery

186
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,810
ended in just a few minutes.

187
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,120
They chose to rob in the morning

188
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,440
and managed to escape.

189
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,330
It was a premeditated robbery.

190
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,240
Tell our men to preserve the crime scene.

191
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,670
Got it.

192
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,240
In addition,

193
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,630
a passerby said one of the suspects

194
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,910
dropped something when their car

195
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,600
was taking a turn.

196
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,080
When he tried to pick it up,

197
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,180
his leg got injured.

198
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,980
That suspect is of medium build.

199
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,510
It's been quite a while.

200
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,060
There's a slim chance
of tracing their escape route.

201
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,200
Have our men set up a checkpoint
at each intersection.

202
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,320
All suspicious vehicles

203
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,600
must be detained immediately.

204
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,000
Got it.

205
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,280
Come with me.

206
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,350
Where are we heading?

207
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,840
Miss, sir,

208
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,300
come on, have a try.

209
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,980
Fresh Longjing tea.

210
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,870
How did he figure out our genders?

211
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,240
I don't drink Longjing tea.

212
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,640
I only enjoy Maojian tea.

213
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,220
I have Guzhang Maojian tea leaves.

214
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,100
And Baima Maojian tea leaves.

215
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,400
Which do you prefer, sir?

216
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,360
You're a real expert, sir.

217
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,400
I must provide you
with the finest tea leaves.

218
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,910
Do you know the incident this morning?

219
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,750
Yes, I do.

220
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,240
Word about it had already got out,

221
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,840
about half a month ago.

222
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,440
Who did it?

223
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,440
Brute Zhang.

224
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,240
Isn't he in prison?

225
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,050
Not any more.

226
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,150
He was released not long ago.

227
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,150
Who else was involved?

228
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,510
Liao Yongjie and Ali.

229
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,040
They used to work for him.

230
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,870
To track down the stolen goods,

231
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,440
go talk to Mr. Hong.

232
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,670
He's the go-to guy
for fencing stolen property now.

233
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,390
Mr. Hong?

234
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,910
Are you saying if they are to
dispose of the stolen goods,

235
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,710
they'll have to turn to Mr. Hong?

236
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,910
If you want, I can help schedule a meeting

237
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,040
for you and Mr. Hong.

238
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,630
However...

239
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,320
No need.

240
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,280
We'll work it out on our own.

241
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,480
Let's go.

242
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,160
Who is that man we just talked to?

243
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,390
He has ties
to both the legal and criminal worlds,

244
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,200
with access to much information.

245
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,320
He used to make quite a lot of money

246
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,700
by selling information.

247
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,240
As a result, he made many enemies,

248
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,700
some of which blinded him.

249
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,440
After that,

250
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,500
he disappeared from the underworld.

251
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,900
But in fact, he's still secretly doing

252
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,760
this business in a different way.

253
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,350
All his information
comes from reliable sources,

254
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,810
so he charges high prices.

255
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,400
What about Brute Zhang?

256
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,990
I guess he is the leader
of this gang of robbers

257
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,640
and likely the one who stayed in the car.

258
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,670
He's a habitual offender

259
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,720
specialized in robbery.

260
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,180
I heard about him long ago.

261
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,910
He was put in jail last time
exactly for robbery.

262
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,000
Unexpectedly, he treaded the same old path
right after he was released.

263
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,600
Those who used to work for him

264
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,920
must've assisted him in this robbery.

265
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,860
But I hadn't heard of their names
until just now.

266
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,440
What about Mr. Hong?

267
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,320
Mr. Hong...

268
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,080
It's fair to say he's the most powerful
man in the black market.

269
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,630
He's a smuggler, trafficking

270
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,080
things as trivial as daily necessities

271
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,200
and as valuable as gold.

272
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,150
He engages himself in any kind

273
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,550
of profitable business.

274
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,860
The thing is...

275
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:46,810
What?

276
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,150
Given Mr. Hong's complicated background,

277
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,750
we'd better not alert him now.

278
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,550
Let's go find Brute Zhang first.

279
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,550
Hold on.

280
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:10,830
Any findings?

281
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,590
No.

282
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,320
Keep searching.

283
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,750
Yes.

284
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,780
The current leads

285
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,020
have pointed to four suspects.

286
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,810
[Maintain Law and Discipline]

287
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,500
They are Brute Zhang, Liao Yongjie,
Lin Weihao

288
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,120
and Ali.

289
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,960
Brute Zhang, aged 32,

290
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,360
committed several famous robberies
in Shanghai.

291
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,630
He was released from prison
just last month.

292
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,960
He's very good at casing target locations

293
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
and devising plans.

294
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,720
Since he treats his men
with great generosity,

295
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,850
many people would gladly work for him.

296
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,750
Liao Yongjie, aged 26,

297
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,750
used to be a devoted follower
of Brute Zhang.

298
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,480
After the latter was put in jail,
he never had a proper job.

299
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,720
Last year, he got married.

300
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,320
It's said that he's running
a small business now.

301
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,850
Lin Weihao
has excellent martial arts skills.

302
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,660
He grew up with Brute Zhang

303
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,030
and waited for the latter's release
from prison

304
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,510
instead of finding another boss.

305
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,110
As for Ali,

306
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,270
he has worked for other people
than Brute Zhang.

307
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,280
This is a ruthless man

308
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,300
who craves nothing but money.

309
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,160
He was probably just helping out
with this robbery.

310
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,320
Their car broke down,

311
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,870
and one of them got injured.

312
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,480
Checkpoints have been set up
at all the docks.

313
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,840
They couldn't have vanished into thin air.

314
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,570
They must still be in Shanghai.

315
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,150
The shop owner said

316
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,600
all the new antiques had been taken away.

317
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,030
With so many items on them,

318
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,330
these robbers won't choose the main docks.

319
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,020
So, we need to focus on canvassing

320
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,630
the smaller ones and the illegal ones.

321
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,840
Our people are on it now,

322
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,320
but there won't be results until later,

323
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,840
given the large number of docks.

324
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,600
Have the stolen antiques

325
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,870
appeared on the black market?

326
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,510
No.

327
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,240
But everyone in the antique business

328
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,870
is having their eyes on these items.

329
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,910
Any word from our informants?

330
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,510
No.

331
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,980
I've spread the information,

332
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,580
but...

333
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,380
Inspector!

334
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,020
Inspector.

335
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,770
A suspect just showed up alone
on the Northern Street.

336
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,300
Let's go!

337
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,120
Yes!

338
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,760
You go there with them.

339
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,240
Got it.

340
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,360
And you go there with them.

341
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,750
Okay.

342
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:10,800
Let's go.

343
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,650
You go that way.

344
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,320
How did it go with your search?

345
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,150
Did you find him?

346
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,720
No.

347
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,750
Me neither.

348
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,350
Let's keep looking.

349
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,480
I'll go that way.

350
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,620
You two, head over there.

351
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,450
-Okay.
-Okay.

352
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,270
Sir.

353
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,360
Hello. What medicine do you need?

354
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,330
I'm Lu Yizhen from the Police Station.

355
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,630
Officer,

356
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,720
this business I'm running
is legitimate and clean.

357
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,600
I've done nothing wrong.

358
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,080
Did a man with an injured leg

359
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,240
come in for medicine?

360
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,000
Yes, yes.

361
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,840
That man's leg was severely injured,

362
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,030
and he lost a lot of blood.

363
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,120
It looked horrific.

364
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,840
I told him at that time

365
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
that he couldn't receive

366
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,440
proper treatment in my shop.

367
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,360
I suggested him go to the hospital.

368
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,200
But he refused.

369
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,240
Then he just bought some

370
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,510
gauze and hemostatic medicine,

371
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,550
bandaged himself, and left.

372
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,120
Do you know where he was off to?

373
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,150
When did he leave?

374
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,080
Just a few minutes ago.

375
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,790
See, I'm still cleaning up his blood.

376
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,150
But I didn't notice where he went,

377
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,080
since I was busy handling the mess.

378
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,150
I just recalled something.

379
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,550
He said he was going to take the tram.

380
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,350
Yes, the tram.

381
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,030
-That's right.
-Where's the tram station?

382
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,550
Go out and turn right.

383
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,150
Thank you!

384
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,240
Lu Yizhen!

385
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,270
The tram!

386
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,150
Hold on!

387
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,250
Back off!

388
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,480
Stop there, Liao Yongjie.

389
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,349
Let go of me!

390
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,060
Put your guns down!

391
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,349
You put your knife down.

392
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,440
Calm down now.

393
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,240
Calm down?

394
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,240
Heck no!

395
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,220
Put your guns down!

396
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,020
Otherwise...

397
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,110
Stay there!

398
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,240
Step back!

399
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,280
Liao Yongjie.

400
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,240
Liao Yongjie!

401
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,750
Move!

402
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,730
Keep moving!

403
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,640
Freeze!

404
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,410
Back off, all of you!

405
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,540
Or I'll kill her!

406
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,310
Back off!

407
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,920
Brute Zhang
isn't worthy of your protection.

408
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,770
Put your knife down!

409
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,050
I won't betray my boss!

410
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,440
Stay away! Back off!

411
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,530
Back off!

412
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,780
So you'll betray your family instead?

413
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,960
Your wife is waiting for you at home.

414
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,200
What would she think
if she saw you like this?

415
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,290
Leave my wife out of this!

416
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,370
She's innocent!

417
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,070
Fine.

418
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,430
I won't talk about your wife.

419
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,680
But how about your unborn child?

420
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,110
These are the names
you've come up with for your baby, right?

421
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,890
"Liao Baokang."

422
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,810
"Liao Xiangjiao."

423
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,790
You've put a lot of thought
into naming your baby.

424
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,920
Don't you want to see it come to the world

425
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,450
and watch him or her grow up?

426
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,400
Brute Zhang won't be with you forever,

427
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,710
but your family will.

428
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,270
Now, you're deserting them

429
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,730
for what you call loyalty.

430
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,720
How are your wife and children

431
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,450
supposed to live in this world?

432
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,030
But...

433
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,750
B-But I've hit the point of no return.

434
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,740
-Move!
-Let's go.

435
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,060
Check on that area.

436
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,480
Are you okay?

437
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,160
I'm fine.

438
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,800
Thank you.

439
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,660
No problem.

440
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,250
Go home now.

441
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,120
Confess.

442
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,310
I can't.

443
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,310
If I tell the truth,

444
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,590
my boss will kill me.

445
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,960
You have to come clean

446
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,960
in exchange for a reduced sentence.

447
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,550
Be cooperative, and I guarantee

448
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,210
you'll see your family again.

449
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:24,840
You promise?

450
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,810
I'll come clean.

451
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,310
I was planning to quit
this line of business

452
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,390
after that one last robbery.

453
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,030
For your wife and your unborn child?

454
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,440
Yes.

455
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,680
Now, for their sake,

456
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,520
tell me everything you know.

457
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,310
My boss said

458
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,310
we could

459
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,240
make a big fortune this time.

460
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,070
So...

461
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,110
I got onboard.

462
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,110
Little did I know

463
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,880
the car would break down halfway,

464
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,310
and even less did I imagine

465
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,070
my leg would be injured so badly.

466
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,530
I told them to go without me.

467
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,880
Later on,

468
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,400
we're supposed to meet up

469
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,500
at a wasteland near Jiuxing Village.

470
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,440
Will you fence the goods yourselves?

471
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:10,880
No.

472
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,440
There's already a buyer for them.

473
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,720
Soon,

474
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,440
we'll head for a place

475
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,440
where someone will be waiting for us.

476
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,370
What place is it?

477
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,210
I don't know.

478
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,000
Only the boss knows the location.

479
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,750
How many guns do you guys have?

480
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,200
Only one, in Ali's hands.

481
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,440
I don't know how he got hold of it.

482
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,280
Take him away.

483
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,110
Move!

484
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,350
The robbers will make a transaction
at a wasteland

485
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,480
near Jiuxing Village.

486
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,010
Let's go.

487
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,820
-Yes.
-Yes.

488
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:57,590
Dong.

489
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,900
Inspector,

490
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,980
their trails end here.

491
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,250
It's going to rain heavily.

492
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,350
We must track the gang down

493
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,610
before the storm hits.

494
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,520
Lead a team to search over there.

495
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:14,880
Okay.

496
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,370
Guys, follow me!

497
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,510
You go back to the Police Station

498
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,710
and ask Du Linfeng for reinforcements.

499
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Hold on.

500
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,830
This is an order. Don't you understand?

501
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,350
We're not sure
how many people we're against.

502
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,480
Even if you find them,

503
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
you won't be able to do much,

504
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,810
since you're all alone.

505
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,240
But if the two of us go together,

506
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,880
there might be a chance of arresting them.

507
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,340
Besides, I've left a message
for Du Linfeng.

508
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,470
What am I supposed to tell

509
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,310
your parents if you get injured?

510
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,980
I'm here to investigate a case,

511
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,780
not to seek protection from you.

512
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,590
Be seated and wait a moment.

513
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,590
I'll be right back.

514
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,720
Where are you going?

515
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,590
It's pouring rain now.

516
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,750
Do you think they can meet their contact?

517
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,480
To avoid compromising the antiques' value,

518
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,480
they'll probably take shelter too.

519
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,950
That means
we still stand a chance of catching them.

520
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,610
We'll go look for them again
when the rain stops.

521
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,890
I won't let you take risks with me.

522
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,480
Aren't you happy to have me,

523
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,810
a helpful aide, around?

524
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,400
I hate to see you get hurt,

525
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:57,470
and I hate it even more
if you get hurt because of me.

526
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,950
After Ge Yunchen's case,

527
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,600
I did much serious thinking.

528
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,720
I'm sorry.

529
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,920
I'm not that fragile.

530
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,720
Just think about it—
back in the police academy,

531
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,580
I was always one of the top cadets.

532
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,090
Maybe I'll become your superior one day.

533
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,750
You?

534
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,120
What? Don't you believe it?

535
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,550
I do.

536
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,920
Let the bygones be bygones, Guan Cen.

537
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,100
You're different
from what you were like back then.

538
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,120
I don't want you to be
overly worried about

539
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,030
and protective of me like my parents are,

540
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,690
just because of what happened

541
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,510
years ago.

542
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,070
We should live a normal life.

543
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:00,830
So should you.

544
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,260
I'm protecting you...

545
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,990
not just because of my past mistakes.

546
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,880
Now, you are

547
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,770
a very special person to me.

548
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,090
We are two of a kind.

549
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,290
That's why
I've chosen to stand by your side.

550
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,880
Lu Yizhen.

551
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,070
The rain has stopped.

552
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,900
Dong must be looking for us out there.

553
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,560
Let's go out to look for clues.

554
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,440
What should we do now?

555
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,790
We took all these items

556
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,440
directly from the antique shop.

557
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,510
Who would believe it if we said

558
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,840
we didn't replace them?

559
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,160
Who would've known
Wu Chang would be so bold

560
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,690
as to give us counterfeits?

561
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,510
There's no way out.

562
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,400
Why not take these fake antiques with us

563
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,070
and run?

564
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,440
Maybe we can still make some money
out of them.

565
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,000
No.

566
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,510
You know
what those Japanese are capable of.

567
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,770
You think we can escape from their grasp?

568
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,350
Mr. Zhuo is dead now.

569
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,810
Sasaki Jiro has lost his main backer.

570
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,790
Can he still be as arrogant as before?

571
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,040
Let's run.

572
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,750
We must flee if we are to survive.

573
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,470
No, we must confess if we are to survive.

574
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,770
Don't even think about running away
with these things.

575
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:59,300
Do you really take yourself
as a watchdog now?

576
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,680
What's that nonsense?

577
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,070
If Boss hadn't taken you in,

578
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,730
you wouldn't have fared
better than a stray dog!

579
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,640
You...

580
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,700
We're police officers. Freeze!
