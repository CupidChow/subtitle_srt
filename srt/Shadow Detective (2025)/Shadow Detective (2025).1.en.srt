Thank you for your kindness, Professor,

189
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,960
but I'd prefer
to leave this honor to Xiang Man.

190
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,510
I know there have been rumors—
and worse—

191
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,170
circulating because
of your past competition.

192
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,270
But I don't want that

193
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,550
to affect your judgment.

194
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,120
After all, receiving this scholarship

195
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,490
would also be a recognition
of your own merits.

196
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,690
There was never any competition
between Xiang Man and me.

197
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,320
Very well.

198
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,670
The department will respect your decision.

199
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,320
Still,

200
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,780
I hope you'll take some time

201
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,010
to reconsider.

202
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,080
Perhaps think it over
and let me know later.

203
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,400
Alright.

204
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,840
Lu Yizhen,

205
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,720
you really have quite the charm,
don't you?

206
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,780
Even the professor has fallen for it.

207
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,240
It seems even a murder accusation

208
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,000
can't dim your allure.

209
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,900
I am not a murderer.

210
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,960
What murderer would ever admit

211
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,240
to being one?

212
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,790
Oh,

213
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,210
and just so you know—

214
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,840
Professor Fan's wife

215
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,640
also teaches at our university.

216
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,300
You might want to watch your step.

217
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,880
Let's start the meeting.

218
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,080
Do we have the autopsy report yet?

219
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,790
The deceased did have a history
of chronic heart disease.

220
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,380
The cause of death
was a sudden cardiac arrest.

221
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,020
However,

222
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,250
whether her external injuries
were a contributing factor

223
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,150
still needs further examination.

224
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,080
Understood. Good work—please expedite
the results as much as possible.

225
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,910
Understood.

226
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,440
Dong,

227
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,550
brief us on the deceased's activities
the night of the incident

228
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,030
and her social connections.

229
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,690
Sure thing.

230
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,880
The deceased, Xiang Man,

231
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,440
came from a well-off family—her father

232
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,080
owned a restaurant in the concession.

233
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,550
But he had a gambling problem,

234
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,870
lost everything,

235
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,330
and racked up heavy debts.

236
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,720
To escape his creditors,
he abandoned his wife and daughter

237
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,650
and left Shanghai without a trace.

238
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,660
After that,

239
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,930
she and her mother
only had each other to rely on.

240
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,790
But when we visited their home,

241
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,120
her mother was gone.

242
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,370
Neighbors said

243
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,790
her mother had also gone into hiding
from debt collectors.

244
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,320
What was she like at school?

245
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,290
Xiang Man was a decent person.

246
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,080
She used to be close

247
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,700
with Lu Yizhen,

248
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,530
but after they fell out,

249
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,130
she started spending time
with Wu Xiaoxiao.

250
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,910
Oh,

251
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,860
and she had a boyfriend

252
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,430
named

253
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,010
Zhang Zhiqiang,

254
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,500
a foreman at Da Hua Dye Workshop.

255
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,270
A foreman?

256
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,080
Yes.

257
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,660
It appears

258
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,800
they met at the dye workshop.

259
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,370
Alright.

260
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,870
For now, our main focus is investigating

261
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,800
Zhang Zhiqiang.

262
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,200
Yes, sir.

263
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,140
What are you doing?

264
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,320
Didn't you say she was
no longer a suspect?

265
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,720
Who said she was cleared?

266
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,540
While we look into Zhang Zhiqiang...

267
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,600
keep a close watch on Lu Yizhen as well.

268
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,330
Understood.

269
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,030
Is this Xiang Man's?

270
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,970
[Claim Slip, Henry Timepieces]

272
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,000
Miss,

273
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,380
please have a look.

274
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,200
Your watch engraving

275
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
is all done—

276
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,560
it's right over here.

277
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,670
[Zhang Zhiqiang]

278
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,070
And please check
the greeting card as well.

279
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,760
It's been written up too.

280
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,870
It's written on dyed fabric?

281
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,570
Both good, yeah?

282
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,490
Yeah.

283
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,850
One moment, I'll wrap this up for you.

284
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm sure your husband

285
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,750
will be very pleased

286
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,120
when he sees this watch.

287
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,640
Miss, we've arrived.

288
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,320
We've been to all the well-known

289
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,630
dye workshops in Shanghai.

290
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,150
If what you're looking for isn't here,

291
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,880
it'll be hard to find it
anywhere else in the city.

292
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:48,560
Thank you.

293
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,530
Please mind your step.

[Da Hua Dye Workshop]

295
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,630
I just got back last night.

296
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,470
Miss, are you here to place an order?

297
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,230
No, I'm looking for them.

298
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,890
We just had a small disagreement.

299
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,090
I came back this time
to make up with her.

300
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,200
Are you Zhang Zhiqiang?

301
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,530
What are you doing here?

302
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,870
Why shouldn't I be?

303
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,170
I'm here to return something
to its owner.

304
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,000
You're Zhang Zhiqiang, right?

305
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,550
Yes.

306
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,340
This is from Xiang Man.

307
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,480
I'm her roommate,

308
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,480
Lu Yizhen.

309
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,200
This...

310
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,250
This is what she wanted to give you.

311
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,850
What are you doing?

312
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,360
That's for him.

313
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,770
This watch may

314
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,940
be relevant to the case as evidence.

315
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,940
I'm taking it in for investigation.

316
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,290
It's quite expensive.

317
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,550
It is—

318
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,720
the watch dealer said
there are only a few

319
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,180
like it in all of Shanghai.

320
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:08,400
I don't know

321
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,859
why she would give me
such an expensive gift.

322
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,339
Xiang Man

323
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,880
had several external injuries
on her body.

324
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,940
Were you aware of that?

325
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,740
Injuries?

326
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,960
No, I wasn't.

327
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:20,869
Wait—

328
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,550
I-I never hit her!

329
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,480
Wait, what exactly happened?

330
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,310
How could she just die like that?

331
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,160
How did she die?

332
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,110
The cause of death
is still under investigation.

333
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,240
We'll notify you when we have updates.

334
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:35,880
Fine.

335
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,830
Where did she get the money

336
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,270
for that watch, especially

337
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,930
while supporting her family?

338
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,170
Even skipping rent for months

339
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,040
wouldn't cover a watch like that,
would it?

340
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,440
Lu Yizhen,

341
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,790
from now on, do not approach anyone

342
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,510
involved in this case
without authorization.

343
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,200
Otherwise, I have the right

344
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,640
to arrest you

345
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,680
for obstructing police work.

346
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
I'm not your prisoner—

347
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,680
what gives you the right
to restrict my freedom?

348
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,830
By that logic,

349
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,200
everyone I meet on campus

350
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,070
or at the apartment

351
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,670
could be related to the case.

352
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,830
There's not much I can do for her now—

353
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,830
you can't take this away from me too.

354
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,000
Was your relationship with her

355
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,160
really worth all this effort
to find her killer?

356
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,510
I just want to understand

357
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,920
what happened during the time

358
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,000
we grew apart.

359
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
How did things end up like this?

360
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,230
Maybe not knowing the truth is
for the best.

361
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,810
What do you mean?

362
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,500
We found this badge

363
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,370
among Xiang Man's belongings.

364
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:40,870

to a high-class courtesan house.

366
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,760
A high-class courtesan house?

367
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,790
So Xiang Man was...

368
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,050
You're coming with me.

369
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,640
You...

370
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,860
you're letting me join the investigation?

371
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,320
If I don't bring you along,

372
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,830
you won't let this go.

373
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,310
Better to have you within my sight

374
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,570
than have you running around on your own.

375
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,050
Just this once—don't expect it
to happen again. Now get in.

376
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,100
Welcome.

377
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,110
My apologies,

378
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:18,960
but this is a private club—

379
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,560
we're not open to the public.

380
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,350
Without an introduction from a member,

381
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,340
we cannot admit you.

382
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,210
Please leave.

383
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,590
They're here on my introduction.

384
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,270
Ah, friends of Mr. Du!

385
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,670
In that case, I won't disturb you further.

386
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,240
There, order whatever you like—

387
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,280
it's on my tab.

388
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,500
Aren't you going to introduce us?

389
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,500
Not necessary.

390
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,960
Go on, then.
What are you here to investigate?

391
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,830
Someone like you

392
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,590
wouldn't come to a place like this
without a reason.

393
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,510
A girl named Xiang Man took her own life.

394
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,040
We suspect she worked here.

395
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,310
Only our premier courtesans who have
private engagements outside the house

396
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,350
have this exclusive badge.

397
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,680
Guests of Joy Pavilion also receive them.

398
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,140
Mr. Du,

399
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,750
with all these ladies around,

400
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,820
are you still not enjoying yourself?

401
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,150
I'm perfectly content,

402
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,030
but he isn't.

403
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,670
This gentleman is quite interesting—

404
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,730
bringing a lady to our Joy Pavilion
for entertainment.

405
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,970
Auntie San, see to him properly.

406
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,450
Tell him whatever he wants to know.

407
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,440
What can I do

408
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,270
for you both?

409
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,790
A friend of mine

410
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,480
had a cheongsam made
from the exact same fabric as yours.

411
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,200
Oh, this is fabric custom-dyed
for our Joy Pavilion.

412
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,130
It's exclusive.

413
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,790
Do you remember a courtesan named Xiang

414
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,070
who worked here?

415
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,640
That college student?

416
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,630
She hasn't been here for a while—

417
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,400
who knows,
maybe she climbed the social ladder

418
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,260
and became someone's concubine.

419
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,870
Climbed the social ladder? As a concubine?

420
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,930
That courtesan

421
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,960
had exceptionally high standards.

422
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,350
She wouldn't just settle for anyone.

423
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,940
[Joy Pavilion]

424
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,750
Bringing her along on an investigation—
isn't that against protocol?

425
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,550
So what?

426
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,270
You really live up
to your reputation, Inspector Guan.

427
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,720
But getting her to cooperate with you

428
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,070
won't be easy.

429
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,160
Of course it's not easy.

430
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,930
That's why you wait until she is

431
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,590
at her most vulnerable and desperate,
then take advantage of her.

432
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,170
By throwing her a little kindness,

433
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,890
she'll offer herself up completely.

434
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,710
How did you become like this?

435
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,840
You could help me, you know.

436
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,050
Do you really believe

437
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,350
your methods

438
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,790
can achieve your goals?

439
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,720
I need to give myself closure.

440
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,520
What closure?

441
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,440
It's been so many years.

442
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,120
Let yourself move on.

443
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:47,880
You can stand there

444
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,070
and say that so lightly

445
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,560
because you've never been through
what I have.

446
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,000
She's not a fool.

447
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,360
She must have seen right through you
by now.

448
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,740
[Chongde University]

449
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,030
Good morning, Professor.

450
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:25,550
Hello, everyone.

451
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,310
Lu.

452
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,540
Professor Fan.

453
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,130
What a coincidence.

454
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,360
I was just looking for you.

455
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,690
You were looking for me?

456
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,080
Come to my office.

457
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,350
Have you given it some more thought?

458
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,270
I haven't changed my mind, Professor.

459
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,400
That's understandable.

460
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,330
It's also a way of showing respect.

461
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,080
It seems your relationship

462
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,890
was better than the rumors suggested.

463
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,270
We...

464
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,200
used to be close.

465
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,160
I see.

466
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,320
She had

467
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,640
a regular client.

468
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,320
He seemed refined and scholarly,

469
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,510
but didn't carry himself
like a typical man of old wealth.

470
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,480
Still,

471
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,240
he was very generous

472
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:44,230
and often requested
private engagements with her.

473
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,510
Such a shame.

474
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,460
Xiang Man was so young.

475
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,510
She was such a bright student.

476
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,350
A real pity.

477
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,510
What was your relationship with Xiang Man?

478
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,880
The same as yours—

479
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,640
teacher and student.

480
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,790
I saw the badge.

481
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,590
You were her client at Joy Pavilion.

482
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,270
You were her professor!

483
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,800
How could you do this to her!

484
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,680
Lu Yizhen.

485
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,790
Lu Yizhen,

486
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,110
calm down.

487
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,000
I—

488
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,540
I only went there for entertainment.

489
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,510
I never expected

490
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,040
to run into Xiang Man there.

491
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,480
W-We kept things completely separate.

492
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,310
What happened at Joy Pavilion

493
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,700
never affected our interactions
at the university.

494
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,480
Did you cause the injuries on her body?

495
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,370
Injuries? What injuries?

496
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,310
I-I never…

497
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,200
No, I never laid a hand on her.

498
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,310
Please, don't spread this.

499
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,960
The university would expel me,

500
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,610
and my wife would never forgive me.

501
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:53,540
What do you want?

502
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,350
I'll give you anything.

503
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,240
I'll make sure you get the scholarship.

504
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,040
I'll have them

00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,150
name you the department's
outstanding student,

506
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,940
make you rank first—will that do?

507
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,410
I'm begging you, alright?

508
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,640
Professor Fan and Lu Yizhen are inside.

509
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,950

510
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,760
