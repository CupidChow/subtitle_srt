Let Mom help you change
your clothes, okay?

3
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,870
We'll go to sleep after changing.

4
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,030
Come on, Mom helps you change.

5
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,540
Go away! Don't touch me!

6
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,850
It's Mom, Jialei!

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,560
Go away!

8
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,080
Let go of me!

[Shadow Detective]

00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,630
[Episode 4]

12
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,280
Lu,

13
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,630
I'm talking to you.

14
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,980
I'm listening.

15
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:27,710
Well,

16
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,630
what kind of place is
the International Settlement?

17
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,520
It's a place where you're constantly...

18
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,150
Mr. Wang, be careful with fire!

19
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,150
Dealing with murderers.

20
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,590
You think the patrol room there
is that easy to join?

21
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,310
Besides, you're a girl.

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,200
They definitely won't want you.

23
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,590
If you ask me,

24
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,570
you'd better just stay here.

25
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,960
Maybe someday you'll meet
a rich young master

26
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,620
and then get married in style,

27
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,020
wouldn't that be nice?

28
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
That's not for me.

29
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,990
I'm hoping to become an inspector someday.

30
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,079
Inspector?

31
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,150
Inspector Lu?

32
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,680
You seem like a practical person—

33
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,810
how can you indulge in such fantasies?

34
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,590
Let's put everything else aside.

35
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,420
Even if you get into a patrol room,

36
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,480
you'll have to start from the bottom.

37
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,630
Serving tea, pouring water,
buying breakfast—

38
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,890
that's just the start.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,430
Then the inspector will throw
a pile of files

40
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,360
at you to review,

41
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,360
and you can't leave
until you've finished reading them.

42
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,470
And here's the thing—
reading them is pointless.

43
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,930
Would you still want that?

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,950
If you ask me,

45
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,190
it's better to just stay here.

46
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,600
There you are.

47
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,170
An elderly person has gone missing

48
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,240
from the Guangqi Nursing Home.

49
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,520
Perfect, you should go check it out.

50
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,190
Get lost!

51
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,800
It's mealtime.

52
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,460
You're hungry, but we're not?

53
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,240
I despise people like you the most!

54
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,370
-Alright. Let's go.
-Go! I'll treat you to dinner later!

55
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,710
Yizhen,

56
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:43,760
you go first.

57
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,760
My stomach hurts.

58
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,200
Maybe I've got the runs.

59
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:48,910
Really? What timing—

60
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,970
getting diarrhea right at mealtime?

61
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,750
I'll come look for you later.

62
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,630
It really is diarrhea,

63
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,240
I swear.

64
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,120
Who reported the case?

65
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:19,010
I did.

66
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,720
One of our elderly residents is missing.

67
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,980
We've searched the entire nursing home.

68
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,480
What's the elderly person's name?

69
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,880
When did they go missing?

70
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,480
The elderly lady is named Gao Wenxiu.

71
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,580
She's quite advanced in age.

72
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,930
She usually walks with a wooden cane.

73
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,390
She didn't show up for lunch,

74
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,659
and then we realized she was missing.

75
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,480
Mrs. Gao gets confused sometimes.

76
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,080
She likes to talk to herself.

77
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,159
Apart from staying in the facility,

78
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,630
does she go anywhere else?

79
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,630
We usually take the residents

80
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,230
to the nearby park for walks.

81
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,840
But we don't let them go out
by themselves.

82
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,100
Officer, I need to go.
I have something to attend to.

83
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,510
Hello.

84
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,970
-Hello.
-Hello.

85
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,000
Excuse me, have you seen

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,750
an elderly woman

87
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,680
with a walking stick and gray hair?

88
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,560
No.

89
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,800
Are all these paths connected?

90
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,170
Yes, this path leads to the intersection.

91
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,920
If you continue on this path,
there will be more people.

92
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,520
You can ask around there.

93
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,560
Okay, thank you.

94
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,620
-You're welcome.
-You're welcome.

95
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,120
I was just looking for an elderly woman

96
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,650
from Guangqi Nursing Home.

97
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,750
For heaven's sake,

98
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,920
how many times have I told you

99
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,170
not to meddle in other people's business?

100
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:15,950
Do you have any idea

101
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,950
how much trouble
you've gotten yourself into?

102
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,280
How is this meddling...

103
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,370
Where did you get that police uniform?

104
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,390
It's mine, of course.

105
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,720
I'm a trainee police officer in this area.

106
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,800
What are you doing here?

107
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,190
This is their jurisdiction.

108
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,950
It's none of our business.

109
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,350
This park is open to the public,

110
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,630
but it belongs to the British.

111
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,150
Director Huo happens to know them.

112
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,650
So if anything happens in this area,

113
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,560
we handle it.

114
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Let's get to work.

115
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,360
Let's go. Let's go.

116
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,070
Sorry.

117
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,620
The Shanghai Police Station is
handling a case.

118
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,380
No unauthorized entry.

119
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,650
That person...

120
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,500
Lu!

121
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,190
I just received a call

122
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,120
saying they found the elderly lady.

123
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,870
Let's go quickly and find out
what happened.

124
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,000
The elderly lady...

125
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,960
Go check on her quickly.

126
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,180
After all,

127
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,440
that case is

128
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,070
what you should be handling.

129
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,160
Let's go. Let's go.

130
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
You're really...

131
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,870
Gosh.

132
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,390
Inspector.

133
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
I never thought

134
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,330
the suspect from back then

135
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,060
would become a police officer.

136
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,890
You knew about this all along, didn't you?

137
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,430
What?

138
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,310
Nothing.

139
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,790
Nothing.

00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,420
Evidence bag.

141
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,630
Brief me on the victim.

142
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,460
The deceased was Liu Jialiang,
45 years old,

143
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,800
the director
of the nearby Guangqi Nursing Home.

144
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,060
Did he have any family?

145
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:09,800
Yes.

146
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,920
His mother, 80 years old now.

147
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,050
This is his address.

148
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,510
Take someone with you
to check on his mother.

149
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,360
Okay.

150
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,430
Luo, let's go.

151
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,040
The victim has no fatal wounds
on his body.

152
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,800
The cause of death is... asphyxiation.

153
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,980
Asphyxiation?

154
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,510
Based on the body's condition,

155
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,150
the time of death was likely
3 to 5 days ago.

156
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,780
The killer hung him upside down
from the tree

157
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,030
and laid out food beneath him.

158
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,669
He likely wanted the victim
to see the food,

159
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,510
suffer,

160
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,710
and eventually starve to death.

161
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,240
So, based on your conclusion...

162
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,720
the killer drew a cross on his forehead...

163
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,510
suggesting this was a punitive killing?

164
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,040
Unfortunately,

165
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,090
the killer doesn't have
much medical knowledge.

166
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,120
Without water, a person

167
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,470
will die within 3 days.

168
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,320
But if hung upside down,

169
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,630
the situation is completely different.

170
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,750
The liver and intestines

171
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,310
press against the lungs,

172
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,350
causing oxygen deprivation

173
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,790
and resulting in death by asphyxiation.

174
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,590
So, how long can someone survive

175
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,800
if hung upside down?

176
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,200
When I was studying abroad,

177
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
my professor told me about

178
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,510
a similar case.

179
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,960
An American was hung upside down
in a cave.

180
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,670
He only survived for about 28 hours.

181
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,210
But in any case, it's less than 3 days.

182

[Guangqi Nursing Home]

183
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,670

Mrs. Gao is fine. We can go now.

189
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,250
I'm Fang Ruhai,

190
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,400
from the China International Famine Relief
Commission.

191
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,000
Hello.

192
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,190
Please cooperate with our investigation.

193
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,280
How did you find her?

194
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Granny Gao and my mother have been friends
for many years.

195
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,660
Our families often visit each other.

196
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,870
Granny Gao has had a hard life.

197
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,290
Her family members died one after another
on the battlefield.

198
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,630
That's why she stays in the nursing home.

199
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,000
Now, her memory has severely deteriorated,

200
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,650
and she gets confused frequently.

201
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,670
My home is very close
to this nursing home.

202
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,240
Just now,

203
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,380
she came to my house
looking for my mother again.

204
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,670
So I brought her back here.

205
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,600
Meijuan.

206
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,440
Meijuan, you came.

207
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,550
You got the letter?

208
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,670
Letter?

209
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,880
What letter?

210
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,170
Mrs. Gao is confused.

211
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,740
She asks about it several times every day.

212
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,120
Okay.

213
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,550
Now that she's returned safely,

214
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,920
there's nothing to worry about.

215
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,850
That settles it.

216
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,950
See? Mrs. Gao is fine.

217
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,410
Please take good care of her from now on.

218
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
Where is your director?

219
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,210
I haven't seen him since the incident.

220
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,430
The director is quite busy.

221
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,740
Our nursing home is funded by the church.

222
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,940
Every month, he has to discuss with
the bishop

223
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,750
how donations and supplies are used.

224
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,410
so the director is often away
from the facility.

225
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,400
Let's go now.

226
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,560
I really have diarrhea this time.

227
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Thank you for your help.

228
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,150
Goodbye.

229
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,420
Take care.

230
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,550
Yizhen!

231
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,670
There's a big sale at Sincere today.

232
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,440
I bought a lot of good stuff.

233
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,490
See if there's anything you need.

234
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,080
What are you smiling about?

235
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,940
Are you in love?

236
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,960
What's that?

237
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,760
I'm reporting for duty tomorrow!

238
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,480
Really?

239
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,390
That's great!

240
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,720
Your dream of becoming an inspector
is within reach!

241
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,650
Inspector? That's so far away.

242
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,510
I'm just starting as
a third-class police officer.

243
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,480
What's wrong with being
a third-class police officer?

244
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,100
That's pretty good, isn't it?

245
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
At least you're on the right track now.

246
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,900
You've sacrificed so much
to join the patrol room.

247
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,120
Now you've finally got what you wanted.

248
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,250
I'm so happy for you.

249
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,320
Do you know who I ran into
during my interview

250
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,580
at the police academy?

251
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,480
Who?

252
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,770
Guan Cen.

253
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,380
Guan Cen?

254
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,120
[Laozha Patrol Room]

255
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,750
Excuse me,

256
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,030
could you please

257
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,300
slow down and repeat your orders?

258
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,200
Salty soy milk.

259
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,550
-Soup dumplings!
-Crispy chicken feet and tofu pudding!

260
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,950
Wontons! I want wontons.

261
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,320
Inspector Guan.

262
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,480
What brings you here?

263
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,610
Inspector Zhu,

264
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,080
I told Director Huo the other day
that I'm short-handed.

265
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,910
He has agreed

266
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,350
to let me borrow someone from your team.

267
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,920
As you can see,

268
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,310
we're also stretched thin here.

269
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,550
Inspector Zhu,

270
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,240
just for a few days,
then I'll return them to you.

271
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,380
Well, since you've made the request,

272
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,350
I'll find someone for you.

273
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,340
Inspector Zhu.

274
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,300
She will do.

275
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,870
She's participated in the case
we're investigating,

276
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,670
so she's quite familiar with it.

277
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,940
Inspector Zhu,

278
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,690
I haven't finished the task
you assigned me.

279
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,330
I can't go.

280
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,280
Inspector Guan.

281
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,120
You're here to poach my officer?

282
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,180
Inspector Zhu,

283
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,940
please, don't say that.

284
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,000
I just want to solve the case quickly.

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,240
If Director Huo blames us,

286
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,240
neither of us will have an easy time.

287
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,390
-I won't let you use me anymore!
-I'm just following orders.

288
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,500
I'll leave as soon as the case is over.

289
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,000
As you wish.

290
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,790
I have only one requirement:

291
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,870
follow my orders.

292
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,280
I only follow reasonable orders.

293
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,700
Organizing old case files
is a reasonable order?

294
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,370
If we can get useful information
from them, then it's reasonable.

295
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,770
The case files you want to find
aren't here.

296
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,600
We have a new colleague.

297
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,410
You know her.

298
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,910
A new colleague? Who?

299
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,550
Any new information

300
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,150
from Liu Jialiang's mother?

301
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,400
I went to Liu's mother's house,

302
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,930
but no one was living there.

303
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,630
According to the neighbors,

304
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,790
they haven't seen anyone there
for at least 6 months.

305
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,720
Can I jump in here?

306
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,910
What case is this?

307
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,700
The body you found
on the back hill yesterday

308
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,790
is Liu Jialiang,

309
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,870
the director of Guangqi Nursing Home.

310
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,840
It's him?

311
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,720
That elderly lady
I was looking for yesterday

312
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,960
is also from their nursing home.

313
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,870
What else?

314
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,910
Other than that,

315
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,440
the conditions at their nursing home
are very poor.

316
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,080
I'm asking

317
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,680
if there are any new leads
on Liu Jialiang.

318
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,030
He rarely interacted with people
before his death.

319
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,960
I only heard that he borrowed
a lot of money recently,

320
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,890
but no one knows what he used it for.

321
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,350
Get in the car.

322
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,660
Where are we going?

323
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,230
Yongning Street Landfill.

324
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,230
There's been another murder there.

325
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,560
Thank you.

326
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,340
Hello, where can I find Dr. Ding?

327
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,510
In all of Shanghai, only Dr. Ding

328
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,970
has such a strong stomach.

329
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:09,790
Thanks.

330
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,520
A new face.

331
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,950
Hello, Dr. Ding.

332
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,320
I'm the new police officer.

333
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,450
My name is Lu Yizhen.

334
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,320
Lu Yizhen?

335
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,160
What's the situation with the victim?

336
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,670
This victim has

337
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,400
the same mark

338
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,280
on his forehead as Liu Jialiang.

339
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,910
However, Liu Jialiang was
starved to death,

340
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,200
while this victim

341
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,440
is covered in wounds.

342
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,300
Preliminary assessment suggests

343
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,090
he was repeatedly beaten

344
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,920
with a blunt object, like a club.

345
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,250
Additionally, his left hand is fractured.

346
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,200
Look, just a body dumped here.

347
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,620
What's the preliminary cause of death?

348
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,000
Likely internal organ damage
from the beating,

349
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,079
combined with excessive blood loss.

350
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,950
The estimated time of death

351
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,160
was about a day ago.

352
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,150
What do you think?

353
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,240
Lu Yizhen.

354
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,079
What's your opinion?

355
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,310
Me?

356
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,589
Just based on the same markings...

357
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,609
I think it could be the same killer.

358
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:28,920
But the MO is different,

359
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
so these two cases might not have been

360
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,440
committed by the same person.

361
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,160
It could also be

362
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
a copycat who saw the news reports.

363
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,750
I think our primary task now is...

364
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,330
to determine the relationship...

365
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,110
between the two victims.

366
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,570
Only then can we establish

367
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,050
a link to the killer.

368
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,920
If you were in charge,

369
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,460
where would you start?

370
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,750
I would...

371
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,440
Inspector...

372
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,240
Thank you.

373
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,750
Dr. Ding, thank you.

374
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,880
It's okay.

375
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,050
At a scene like this,

376
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,440
you're already doing remarkably well.

377
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,550
Crime scenes like this

378
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,210
have always been men's territory.

379
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,300
I'm happy to see a female officer.

380
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,790
With you around, I'm not alone anymore.

381
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,440
If you have any problems,
come to me anytime.

382
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,100
I'll definitely help you out.

383
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,730
Especially with ways to deal with him.

384
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,530
If you can't handle it,

385
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,310
I can apply to Director Huo

386
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,970
to have you transferred back.

387
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,680
After all, investigating cases
in the field

388
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,310
means facing situations like this
all the time.

389
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,550
It's not like reviewing old case files
in the office.

390
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,240
Why do you always talk like...

391
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,770
No need.

392
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:11,660
I'm fine.

393
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,310
Inspector Guan.

394
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,820
The victim, Zhou Yongjie, 26 years old,
was unemployed.

395
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,280
Based on his home address,

396
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,990
he should have lived around here.

397
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,190
This area is near Guangqi Nursing Home.

398
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,410
Liu Jialiang died around here.

399
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,180
Dong,

400
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,690
take some people and look into

401
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,920
all of Zhou Yongjie's movements
before his death.

402
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,320
Got it.

403
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,720
Lu Yizhen.

404
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,070
You,

405
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,280
come with me to find
Zhou Yongjie's father.

406
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,640
I... I request to team up with Dong.

407
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,380
I have experience
investigating whereabouts.

408
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,210
I... I want to go with him.

409
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,610
Request denied.

410
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,450
Alright.

411
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,130
If there's nothing else, let's move out.

412
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:00,590
Okay.

413
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,190
Tell me,

414
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,390
why do you insist on keeping me with you?

415
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,380
Haven't I told you before?

416
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,460
You just need to follow my orders

417
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,720
and document the case details properly.

418
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,120
You have no authority here.

419
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,300
I never thought...

420
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,110
this would be...

421
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,010
the last photo...

422
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,680
-of our Yongjie and me.
-My condolences.

423
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,750
Mr. Zhou.

424
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,460
This set of keys...

425
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,260
is certainly not for our home.

426
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,980
[Guangqi Nursing Home Back Door;
Storage Room]

427
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,070
These should be all the keys

428
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,470
to Guangqi Nursing Home.

429
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,730
Why would Yongjie have these?

430
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,490
Are you sure this is the place?

431
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,240
Not sure.

432
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,110
I've never been here either.

433
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,640
Don't move!

434
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,000
Don't move!

435
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,100
Who are you?

436
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,560
Don't move!

437
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,960
Officers, how did you get in here?

438
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,830
Who is she?

439
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:48,890
I don't know.

440
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,400
This concerns a serious case.

441
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,030
If you conceal information,
I have the authority to arrest you!

442
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,760
This is Director Liu's mother.

443
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,080
Let me take care of her.

444
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,300
It's okay.

445
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,180
It's okay now.

446
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,470
It's alright.

447
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,270
The director locked her up here
6 months ago.

448
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,130
Sometimes, I'd steal the director's keys

449
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,390
to bring her some food.

450
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,720
When you came that day,

451
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,180
I didn't have time to lock the door back,

452
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,140
so she ran out.

453
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,110
The director forbade anyone
from asking about her.

454
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,240
Your nursing home's

455
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,400
living conditions and hygiene
are terrible.

456
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,180
You call this elder care?

457
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,310
This is elder abuse!

458
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,240
The director embezzled all the donations

459
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,200
for himself.

460
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,020
I couldn't do anything about it.

461
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,170
It's okay now. Don't be afraid.

462
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,000
Take them to the hospital first.

463
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,060
Yizhen!

464
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,060
What happened?

465
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,050
How did you end up like this?

466
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,780
It's nothing. Isn't this normal?

467
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,110
Put this on.

468
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:56,640
What?

469
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,590
Why should I wear your white coat?

470
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,520
Then take it off.

471
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,640
Dr. Si, I'm really fine.

472
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,160
I'll wash it
and bring it back to you later.

473
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,220
You're fussing over me like a mother.

474
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,270
Alright.

475
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,510
Don't worry about things here.

476
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,010
I'll arrange for them to get examined.

477
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,740
And take care of yourself as well.

478
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,030
Don't get tricked!

479
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,250
Inspector.

480
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,380
Inspector.

481
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,050
Dr. Ding found something.

482
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:29,720
Ding Eryi.

483
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,170
I've found

484
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,480
that Liu Jialiang and Zhou Yongjie had

485
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,400
large amounts of barbiturates
in their bodies.

486
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,480
This is a prescription sedative.

487
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,850
Its effects are somewhat similar
to alcohol.

488
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,910
It can make people go from mild drowsiness

489
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,460
to loss of pain sensation

490
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:45,900
and finally unconsciousness.

491
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,780
So you mean

492
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,330
both victims

493
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,770
were given large doses of sedatives
before death?

494
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:51,570
That's right.

495
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,790
Such a high dosage

496
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,230
would cause dizziness, vomiting,
unconsciousness,

497
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,880
and even death.

498
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,770
Also, take a look at these.

499
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,580
The marks on both victims' foreheads

500
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,690
are completely identical in size,

501
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:07,950
angle, and depth.

502
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,100
Inspector!

503
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,020
Inspector.

504
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,170
Someone spotted Zhou Yongjie

505
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,780
being taken away by people
from the Xingbei Society.

506
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,710
Here's the information
on the Xingbei Society.

507
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,160
This society was established
by some well-dressed hoodlums.

508
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,070
To put it bluntly, they're all just

509
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,870
a bunch of troublemaking thugs.

510
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,560
Their leader is called Long,

511
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,440
and he uses gambling dens
to rake in money.

512
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,000
The donations Director Liu pocketed
from the nursing home—

513
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,330
could Long have something to do with that?

514
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,440
Show me the case details you've compiled.

515
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,650
My friend just took my jacket,

516
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,010
and my notebook is in it.

517
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,930
Is this how you act as a detective?

518
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,410
Inspector,

519
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,290
the case files you want to see
are all here.

520
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,060
Why don't you come take a look?

521
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,750
Besides,

522
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,320
I believe Yizhen

523
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,350
is quite familiar with these cases.

524
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,800
If you don't believe me,
ask her about any detail.

525
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,130
She'll know it for sure.

526
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,700
Right?

527
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:12,880
Dong.

528
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,200
Go track down Long.

529
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,400
Okay, I'm on it.

530
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,550
Let's go to the hospital.

531
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:20,960
Okay.

532
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,900
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

533
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,520
Lu Yizhen.

534
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
Where are they?

535
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,170
The nurse said they're upstairs.

536
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,220
Lu Yizhen!

537
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,590
Mom?

538
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,640
When... When did you come to Shanghai?

539
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,200
If I hadn't come sooner,

540
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,220
you'd have been hurt by this man again!

541
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,020
Mom, what are you talking about?

542
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,030
He's my superior now. Don't talk nonsense.

543
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,830
Superior?

544
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,790
Since when did he become your superior?

545
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,350
Yizhen,

546
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,150
as soon as you get involved with this man,

547
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,280
you'll be in danger!

548
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,800
Don't you know that?

549
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,640
I'm still working on a case. I'm busy.

550
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,590
Mom, please go home first.

551
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,640
What case?

552
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,790
What kind of case could you two
possibly investigate together?

553
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,200
You...

554
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,400
I'm telling you, I forbid you to go!

555
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,660
Inspector, I'm sorry.

556
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,880
I need to handle this first.

557
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,070
Could you please go ahead without me?

558
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,070
I'll be back soon.

559
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,510
Ma'am, I'll be going now.

560
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,640
Let's talk at home.
Don't make a scene here.

561
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,110
So you do know it's embarrassing!

562
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,110
Then listen to me!

563
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,160
Pack your things right now

564
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,640
and go back to Nanyang with me!

565
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,270
I won't allow you to
spend another second with him!

566
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:38,920
Yizhen?

567
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,480
Mrs. Lu,

568
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,210
when did you come to Shanghai?

569
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,030
Si Min,

570
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,510
you've come at the right time.

571
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,920
Please help me convince Yizhen

572
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,480
to go back to Nanyang with me

573
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,680
Mom.

574
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,470
I have a job in Shanghai.

575
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,800
I need to investigate cases.

576
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,890
I'm busy every day.

577
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,440
Why must you drag me back to Nanyang?

578
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,160
Are you done making a scene?

579
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,880
If you want to go back to Nanyang,
please go by yourself.

580
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,240
You... Come back here!

581
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,270
Mrs. Lu!

582
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,790
Mrs. Lu!

583
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,790
What's wrong?

584
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,590
-Are you all right?
-Are you all right?

585
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,300
Yizhen.

586
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,030
Let's go to my office
so she can rest for a while.

587
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,560
Let's go.

588
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,180
It's nothing serious, Mrs. Lu.

589
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,040
But you should still rest a lot
for the next few days.

590
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:20,910
Okay.

591
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,960
That's good to hear.

592
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,820
Take my mom home for me later.

593
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,920
I need to get back to work.

594
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,450
Go ahead.

595
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:29,920
I'm off, Mom.

596
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,510
Stop right there!

597
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,540
Are you still going to find him?

598
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,380
Why... Why won't you just listen?

599
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,160
I'm just investigating a case
under his supervision, that's all.

600
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,400
Nothing else.

601
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,240
Investigating a case?

602
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,640
What case could you two
possibly be investigating together?

603
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,400
Lu Yizhen,

604
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,830
don't think I don't know

605
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,490
what you're really thinking!

606
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,550
I just want to investigate that case.

607
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,090
I just want to know the truth.

608
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,420
What's wrong with that?

609
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,100
We didn't do anything wrong, Mom.

610
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,640
We shouldn't be the ones suffering.

611
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,070
I want to know the truth.

612
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,240
I want to know about my past.

613
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,750
Why won't you allow it?

614
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,440
I...

615
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,110
I don't want you

616
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,680
to get hurt again.

617
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,920
Am I wrong for that?

618
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,310
Mom...

619
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,110
Alright, alright, Mrs. Lu.

620
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,070
These days, Yizhen

621
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,790
has brought many elderly people
from a nursing home

622
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,520
to our hospital for check-ups.

623
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,440
She needs to check on
those elderly people, right?

624
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,480
I promise

625
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,570
she'll be completely safe this time.

626
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,680
Si Min,

627
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,160
y-you're not lying to me, are you?

628
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,110
Of course not.

629
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,480
Don't you trust me?

630
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,300
How about this?

631
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,160
Let's go home first.

632
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,240
We'll prepare something delicious
and wait for her to come back.

633
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,210
Go on, hurry.

634
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,640
I'll go check on those elderly people.

635
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,350
Go on.

636
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,190
I'll be home late, Mom.

637
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:15,530
[Keep Quiet]

638
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,510
Stop right there!

639
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,110
Move aside! Move aside!

640
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,110
Long...

641
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,070
Long...

642
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:27,760
Out of my way!

643
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,840
Move!

644
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,880
Let go of me!

645
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,710
Do you know who I am?
How dare you arrest me!

646
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,470
Let go of me!

647
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,880
It's exactly because I know who you are

648
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,920
that I'm arresting you!

649
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,480
Tell me,

650
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,160
were you involved in the deaths

651
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,330
of Zhou Yongjie and Liu Jialiang?

652
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,110
Nonsense! I don't even know them!

653
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:50,960
Let go of me!

654
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,720
Let go of me now!

655
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,580
If you don't talk now,
you won't get another chance.

656
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,480
Inspector Guan?

657
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,160
I'll talk.

658
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,020
I'll talk.

659
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,030
Those two guys

660
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,310
were cheating at my gambling den,

661
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,310
and I caught them.

662
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,100
They owed me a lot of money.

663
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:08,880
Yes,

664
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,510
I did go after them for the money,

665
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,800
but I never laid a finger on them!

666
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,290
Now that they're dead,

667
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,680
I don't even know
who to collect from anymore.

668
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,200
I...

669
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,040
Take him away.

670
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,270
Yes, sir.
