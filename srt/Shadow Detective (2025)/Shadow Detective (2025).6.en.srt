1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,240
What's missing is a top-secret file
from the Chamber.

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,080
I trust you understand its significance.

3
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,610
Very few people have access to this room.

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,260
Whoever did this

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,280
won't be spared by the Chamber,

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,050
and I, Zhuo Chaoxiong,
certainly won't let it slide.

7
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,670
Only Ghost had the opportunity.

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,780
He's in prison—

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,190
I've arranged everything.

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,550
Go there and find him.

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:43,800
Understood.

12
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,450
[Shadow Detective]

13
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,430
[Episode 6]

14
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,520
We've checked every alleyway in the area.

15
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,520
Nobody knows the name "Ghost."

16
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,450
After he changed his identity,

17
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,050
all trails went cold.

18
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,370
Do you have any other leads?

19
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,079
Not at the moment.

20
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,390
What's wrong?

21
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,710
Did we just waste a trip coming here?

22
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,630
Isn't this just a normal part
of an investigation?

23
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,700
As a police officer,

24
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,329
you can't afford to think that way.

25
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:55,120
I know,

26
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,570
it's just...

27
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,880
after all these years on the job,

28
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
haven't you ever felt discouraged?

29
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,840
I have.

30
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,210
But I never once considered giving up.

31
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,610
The patrol room

32
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,430
isn't a place

33
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,829
where you're allowed
to wallow in disappointment.

34
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:21,360
Let's go.

35
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,570
We still have plenty of work to do.

36
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,579
Twice-cooked pork.

37
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:39,240
Ever had it?

38
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:39,870
No.

39
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,870
Braised fish? Ever had it?

40
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,680
Whenever I go out,

41
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,980
I have at least dozens of my men with me.

42
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,250
I don't even ride in rickshaws.

43
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,630
How could you tell?

44
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,010
Right here.

45
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,120
You're dismissed.

46
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,080
-Yes.
-Yes.

47
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:27,370
[Dear Juggernaut, I'm your biggest fan.]

48
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,430
What are you doing at my desk?

49
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,510
Everyone's left.

50
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,580
Why are you still here?

51
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,159
I'm organizing
the household registry files.

52
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,020
What's that? What are you hiding?

53
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:40,580
Nothing.

54
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,070
With so many files to organize,

55
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,200
do you have time
to care about anything else?

56
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,510
It doesn't slow me down.

57
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,720
Didn't Dong show you how we organize them?

58
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,450
I didn't ask.

59
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,920
The patrol room
already has its own system.

60
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,050
All you need to do is follow procedure—

61
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,390
no need to get creative.

62
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,720
I just want to make things

63
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,800
more organized.

64
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,240
Still, there's no point in wasting time

65
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,900
on something so unimportant.

66
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,000
Since when is unimportant work
not considered work?

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,660
Asking for help is important.

68
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,070
What's most important here

69
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,560
in the patrol room is teamwork.

70
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,800
And teamwork is built on trust.

71
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,240
Did you bring me
into the Central Patrol Room

72
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,170
just to target me every single day?

73
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,750
Lu Yizhen,

74
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,680
you don't need to

75
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,700
turn everything
into a personal issue between us.

76
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,680
I'm just explaining

77
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,810
how things work in the patrol room—
something every officer understands.

78
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,450
Let me take you home.

79
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,310
Not necessary.

80
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,270
It's late.

81
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,020
I said it's not necessary.

82
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,640
I was only trying to reason with you.

83
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,680
Yizhen!

84
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,570
Mom? Dad? What are you both doing here?

85
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,800
What is wrong with you?

86
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,560
Do my words

87
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,140
just go in one ear and out the other?

88
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,120
Why are you still so close to him?

89
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,070
Alright, alright—
let's talk about this at home.

90
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,370
We can discuss it there.

91
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,050
What home?

92
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,120
If you want to go home,
then go back to Nanyang with us!

93
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,560
Dad.

94
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,190
Mom.

95
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,830
Why are you doing this?

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,640
Yizhen,

97
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,430
the purpose of this trip is
to take you back.

98
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,480
We will not

99
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,159
let you get hurt again—

100
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,530
especially not by him.

101
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,190
Why are you butting in?

102
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,150
Go back inside.

103
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,650
Mr. Lu, Mrs. Lu,

104
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,190
I want to apologize

105
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,590
for what I did in the past.

106
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,659
I don't expect your forgiveness,

107
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,240
but you can't

108
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,180
let your feelings toward me

109
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,270
ruin Lu Yizhen's chance
to pursue her dream.

110
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,500
To get into the patrol room,

111
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,950
she has worked incredibly hard

112
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,680
and has a real talent for it—

113
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,120
everyone sees that.

114
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,070
Mr. Lu, Mrs. Lu, I understand

115
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,600
that you want to protect Lu Yizhen
from getting hurt.

116
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,830
But now that she's part
of the Central Patrol Room—

117
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,030
and under my command—

118
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,480
I am responsible for her.

119
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,160
I don't abandon

120
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,600
capable officers,

121
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,050
and I won't let them
give up on themselves.

122
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,320
Inspector Guan,

123
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,040
I hope you understand—

124
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,650
I will do whatever it takes

125
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,560
to make anyone
who harms my daughter pay.

126
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,920
And I will protect every officer

127
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,000
under my command with my life.

128
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,720
What kind of world is this,

129
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,270
where wrongdoers
dare to act so brazenly?

130
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:10,680
Mom.

131
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,120
Yizhen,

132
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,410
we've said all there is to say.

133
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,920
I hope you can try to understand

134
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,510
how a parent feels.

135
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,270
I love you and Dad so much,

136
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,040
but I'm exhausted.

137
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,220
I feel like I'm suffocating.

138
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,179
Can't I just be allowed
to live a normal life?

139
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:33,960
You...

140
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,360
How can you say that?

141
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,840
E-Everything we do is for your own good!

142
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,960
Why can't you understand that?

143
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,360
Fine—

144
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,170
you've grown up, haven't you?

145
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,850
You don't listen to your mom anymore,
do you?

146
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,030
Alright, that's enough.

147
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,230
Let's just drop it.

148
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,630
I'm done.

149
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
I'm done trying to control you.

150
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,690
Mrs. Lu...

151
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,440
Yizhen,

152
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,930
we've made ourselves clear.

153
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,670
If you insist on staying,

154
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,130
you leave me no choice but

155
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,290
to cut off all financial support

156
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,900
until you're ready to return to Nanyang.

157
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,060
You're an adult now—

158
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,130
it's time you learned
to take responsibility for your choices.

159
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,510
We'll go back
after our meeting with Mr. Ke

160
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,480
about the Chamber's business.

161
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,080
Take care of yourself.

162
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,190
So now what?

163
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,270
They cut you off.

164
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,030
How are you supposed
to maintain this lifestyle

165
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,720
on a police officer's salary?

166
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,450
I'll take it one step at a time.

167
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,030
You were way too harsh

168
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,720
with your mom, you know.

169
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,680
Why don't you move in

170
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,630
with Du Linfeng

171
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,000
when your lease is up?

172
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,420
You could save on rent.

173
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,480
Why would I stay with him?

174
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,710
That'd be so awkward.

175
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,570
How's your brother, by the way?

176
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,320
He's practically vanished—
no word from him at all.

177
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,510
No idea,

178
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,760
he's being all secretive.

179
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,200
But if you want to know,

180
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,240
you could write to him.

181
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,360
I'm sure he'd reply.

182
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,600
I'm not writing to him.

183
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,800
I'm not that curious.

184
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,560
Are you really planning
to never speak again?

185
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,890
No wonder he's always pumping me
for information about you.

186
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,110
I swear I haven't told him anything!

187
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:50,750
I…

188
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,630
I haven't given him

189
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,910
any updates about you

190
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,170
since you left school.

191
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,960
You'd better not have.

193
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,190
You're still here?

194
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,460
Who are you?

195
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,170
And...

196
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,000
isn't this my house?

197
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,510
Well, where else would I go?

198
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,240
Miss Lu, your lease
has already been terminated.

199
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,080
Here's the Lease Termination Agreement—

200
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,840
keep it safe.

201
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:18,750
I suggest you move out sooner
rather than later,

202
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,340
[Lease Termination Agreement]

203
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,000
to avoid any unpleasantness.

204
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,150
W-What's going on?

205
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,520
I never signed this.

206
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,460
Well...

207
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,480
My mom did it. I'm sure of it.

208
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,800
She forged my signature.

209
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,660
So... what are you going to do now?

210
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,240
What?

211
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,480
What's going on?

212
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,960
Let me explain.

213
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,870
I didn't sign this contract—

214
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,270
my mom made a mistake.

215
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,620
So we won't be moving out.

216
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,600
Miss Lu,

217
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,550
the contract

218
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,480
is clear as day, in black and white.

219
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,050
If you refuse to leave,

220
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,260
fine—I'll have someone help you move.

221
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,240
You can't just force me out.

222
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,500
What's wrong with you?

223
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,840
Mr. Du, you're here.

224
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,940
Mr. Du, the house
has been cleared for you.

225
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,890
Long time no see.

226
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:27,720
What's going on?

227
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,750
When did you come back?

228
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,070
You didn't even tell me.

229
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,130
You know each other?

230
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,260
Don't embarrass me in front of others.

231
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,120
Well, this makes things easier.

232
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,030
This young lady's lease
was terminated today,

233
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,840
and I was just advising her
to move out promptly.

234
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,690
I didn't terminate it, and I'm not moving.

235
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,180
But the contract is right here
in your hands.

236
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,790
What, are you trying to back out now?

237
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,480
Alright,

238
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,660
you're dismissed.

239
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,530
Sure thing.

240
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,270
Since you're the tenant,

241
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,390
you can stay.

242
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,120
What's mine

243
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,020
is yours, isn't it?

244
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,050
Du Linfeng,

245
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,520
you just got back
and you're already taking my place?

246
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,400
Me? Taking your place?

247
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,670
You bought this house specifically
to mess with me, didn't you?

248
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,390
I simply saw
a good investment opportunity

249
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,320
in this house.

250
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,560
Why would you call that
"messing with you"?

251
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,960
Out of all the properties in Shanghai,

252
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,910
you just had to invest in this one?

253
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,570
You're clearly targeting me.

254
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,790
I looked at many places in Shanghai,

255
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,550
but only liked this one.

256
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,810
Doesn't that mean we're fated?

257
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,200
Linfeng, it's been years,

258
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,750
but you're still

259
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,730
as full of yourself as ever.

260
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,630
Du Linfeng,
now that you've bought this place,

261
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,290
where are we supposed to live?

262
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,580
Like I just said—

263
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,200
just pay the rent on time.

264
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,360
That's it?

265
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,550
No discussion about the rent?

266
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,410
Not necessary.

267
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,870
Once the market goes up,

268
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,870
I'll flip it.

269
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,120
So,

270
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,100
after all these years,

271
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,180
haven't I become even more charming?

272
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,320
How about catching up somewhere?

273
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,600
I'm on the early shift tomorrow.

274
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,720
Don't stay out too late.

275
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,320
Si Min, you're really…

276
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,270

Never thought

285
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,620
I'd see the day—the great Mr. Du

286
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,430
eating at a street stall with me.

287
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,240
Why not?

288
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,930
With your status,

289
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,120
shouldn't you be dining

290
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
at Shanghai's finest restaurants?

291
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,690
Status is just a pass to get in places.

292
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,120
Besides,

293
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,320
there are even places

294
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,040
someone like me can't reach.

295
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,650
There's a place in Shanghai
you can't reach?

296
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,410
For example…

297
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,200
into your heart.

298
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,550
Alright, I'll stop.

299
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,480
Congratulations

300
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,790
on finally joining the patrol room.

301
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,060
Did Si Min tell you that?

302
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,730
She wouldn't say a word.

303
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,220
Whenever I ask about you,

304
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,280
she clams up tight.

305
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,330
I'm serious now—

306
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,550
a sincere toast, with tea.

307
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,850
Thank you for not leaving me
out on the street.

308
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,360
I keep my word—

309
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,440
I'll pay the rent on time every month.

310
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,690
In that case…

311
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,090
can I request to collect it in person?

312
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,880
No, you can't.

313
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,840
Let me treat you to this meal,

314
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,920
as a way to welcome you back.

315
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,380
Though all I can afford
is this street stall.

316
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,120
Then let me walk you home.

317
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,220
A single woman out late

318
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,760
makes an easy target.

319
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,250
Must you always assume the worst?

320
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,600
Shanghai is perfectly safe.

321
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,080
And have you forgotten
what I do for a living?

322
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,260
I'm heading off.

323
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:23,160
Inspector, there's something off
about this case.

324
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,210
The killer was exceptionally brutal.

325
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,890
Show me a killer who isn't.

326
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,680
Fair point.

327
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,610
But it's not just the brutality—

328
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,250
there's something strange going on.

329
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,200
After all these years working with me,

330
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,000
you're still so easily shocked?

331
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,490
It's not just Dong who thinks it's odd—

332
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,770
I find it unusual too.

333
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,410
The victim's entire scalp is missing.

334
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,680
Her entire scalp?

335
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,830
See? I told you.

336
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,550
Can you two give her some space

337
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,750
to examine the scene?

338
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,850
Try to conduct yourselves
like gentlemen, will you?

339
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,350
Who was she?

340
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,010
The victim was Chen Fangfang,

341
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,340
a waitress at Taihua Restaurant.

342
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,740
A neighbor noticed blood

343
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,350
on the floor this morning.

344
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,530
The door was unlocked,

345
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,680
with the key still in it.

346
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,960
When they pushed it open,
they found the victim partially undressed,

347
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,160
and her entire scalp and hair

348
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,020
were gone.

349
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,100
If she worked at a restaurant,

350
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,310
how could she afford

351
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,370
a jade bracelet of such good quality?

352
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,070
The apprentice has outdone the master.

353
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,480
Inspector, you're lucky

354
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,790
to have such a sharp officer.

355
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,120
Better appreciate her.

356
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,550
Time of death?

357
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,510
About seven or eight hours ago—

358
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,110
around midnight last night.

359
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:54,880
Look here.

360
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,430
There are a needle mark

361
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,110
in her neck

362
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,410
and signs of assault before death.

363
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,330
Another suspicious detail—

364
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,880
I believe she was strangled
while still alive,

365
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,540
and then her scalp was removed
with a sharp tool.

366
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,200
We've confirmed with Taihua Restaurant—

367
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,330
she worked late yesterday,

368
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,680
clocking out around 11 pm,

369
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,010
then took the tram home.

370
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,030
The trip would've taken
about half an hour.

371
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,680
Did you check with the neighbors?

372
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,230
We did.

373
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,610
No one heard anything.

374
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,880
Take notes.

375
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:23,850
On it.

376
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,920
What have you found?

377
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,200
The attacker likely ambushed her

378
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,660
from the stairwell corner

379
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,720
near her door,

380
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,070
right as she

381
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,180
was unlocking it.

382
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,590
He injected a sedative

383
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,550
into her neck from behind,

384
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,720
subdued her,

385
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,200
then pushed her inside

386
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,330
to commit the crime.

387
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,420
I suspect the attacker

388
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,160
had been observing the victim

389
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,880
for some time,

390
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,470
learning her work schedule

391
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,340
and address—

392
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,720
and had lain in wait around the time

393
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,980
she usually returned.

394
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,920
This was premeditated.

395
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,260
Well reasoned.

396
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,830
The key was still in the lock,

397
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,350
meaning she was attacked

398
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,860
while entering.

399
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,110
No signs of struggle at the doorway,

400
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,200
and none of the neighbors

401
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,660
reported unusual sounds—

402
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,790
suggesting the drug prevented her

403
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,720
from resisting or crying out.

404
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,640
And look here:

405
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,930
this light bulb
was clearly broken recently.

406
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,870
Considering she worked at the restaurant

407
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,500
and often returned late,

408
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:43,890
think about it—

409
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,500
if you lived alone

410
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,260
and came home late every night,

411
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,780
wouldn't you stay alert?

412
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,700
If she were being randomly followed,

413
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,590
she might

414
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,240
have noticed it.

415
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,720
Moreover, a random stalker

416
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,350
would also take a huge risk—

417
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,670
not knowing if someone else
was at home, for instance.

418
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,310
Dong,

419
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,200
look into Chen Fangfang's connections.

420
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,600
Find out who she recently met,

421
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,060
or if she offended anyone.

422
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,590
On it.

423
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,330
The rest of you,
check with the other households.

424
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,070
See if anyone noticed

425
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,750
suspicious individuals lately.

426
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,310
Yes, sir.

427
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,160
There's one more thing.

428
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,200
The weapon was small and extremely sharp,

429
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,350
and the killer's MO was precise.

430
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,330
That's the only way they could
have removed the entire scalp so cleanly,

431
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,280
leaving such a perfect wound.

432
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,160
But why

433
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,090
would they take the scalp and hair?

434
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,030
Dr. Gu.

435
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,830
You're here.

436
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,530
My apologies. I'm late.

437
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,550
No need to apologize.

438
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,830
I've worked

439
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,670
with the patrol room long enough

440
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,270
to know how things go.

441
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,400
Have a seat.

442
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,680
Okay.

443
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,240
Here,

444
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,240
have some water.

445
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,840
Thank you.

446
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,310
Actually, I came to thank you.

447
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,920
If you hadn't put in a good word for me,

448
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,120
Inspector Guan
probably wouldn't have let me

449
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,920
join the investigation so soon.

450
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,600
I only stated the facts.

451
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,860
Inspector Guan suggested

452
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,420
I talk with you more often.

453
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,110
So I'm afraid I'll be bothering you
quite a bit from now on.

454
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,270
Not at all.

455
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
Inspector Guan only wants
what's best for you.

456
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,500
And it's nice to have someone
to chat with—

457
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,230
especially since things
have been quiet lately.

458
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,030
To be honest,

459
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,510
I do have another reason
for coming to see you.

460
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,440
Tell me about it.

461
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,110
You know about my past.

462
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,840
Whenever anything slightly unsettling
happens around me,

463
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,260
my parents panic—

464
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,880
they want to wrap me in cotton wool
and shut me off from the world.

465
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,880
It's really starting to weigh on me.

466
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,400
After what you went through,

467
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,110
it's natural for parents

468
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,620
to be overly protective.

469
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,380
I know, and I understand that.

470
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,040
But I can't live like this forever.

471
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,200
They can't protect me my whole life,

472
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,730
can they?

473
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,670
I want to help them let go of their fears.

474
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,550
That's why I thought…

475
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,720
maybe if I could remember what happened,

476
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,550
everything would get better.

477
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,720
You want me

478
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
to help you recover those memories?

479
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,070
It won't be easy.

480
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,160
You have to understand—

481
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,560
your amnesia is

482
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,030
a self-protective response
to severe trauma.

483
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,640
Recalling the past

484
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,830
could mean

485
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,720
reliving that pain.

486
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,650
I'm willing to try.

487
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:23,960
It seems

488
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,870
this has become something
of an obsession for you.

489
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,310
Maybe.

490
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,750
I don't know.

491
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,210
Perhaps...

492
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,900
Perhaps it's precisely
this obsession of yours

493
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,110
that makes your parents so uneasy?

494
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,830
Some things are better left in the past.

495
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,440
What happened to Lu Jialei

496
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,310
shouldn't have

497
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,900
to be relived by Lu Yizhen.

498
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,010
Another case so soon?

499
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:03,920
Dong.

500
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,750
Thanks.

501
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,260
Brief us on the victim.

502
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,410
Yes, sir.

503
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,350
The victim, Wu Yushan, 27 years old,

504
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,400
worked as a hostess
at the West Taihua Restaurant.

505
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,200
The West Taihua and the Taihua Restaurant

506
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,400
share the same owner,

507
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,400
meaning Wu Yushan and Chen Fangfang

508
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,240
were technically colleagues—

509
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,860
though they might not
have known each other.

510
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,800
The entire scalp is missing?

511
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,720
Yes.

512
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,480
According to her coworkers
at West Taihua Restaurant,

513
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,240
she clocked out around 11 pm

514
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,160
and was estimated
to have returned home around midnight.

515
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,710
A neighbor found her this morning

516
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,200
when they knocked on her door.

517
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,090
Time of death was around midnight.

518
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,090
The victim had
a hypodermic puncture wound

519
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,810
in her neck,

520
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,330
indicating she was likely drugged.

521
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,130
She was also sexually assaulted

522
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,880
and ultimately died
from asphyxiation during the attack.

523
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,680
The manner of death
was particularly brutal.

524
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,750
Also, please note

525
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:12,160
the multiple lividity marks,

526
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,750
especially here on the neck.

527
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,680
This suggests

528
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,350
the killer

529
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,200
choked her from behind

530
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,460
until she suffocated,

531
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,110
then removed the scalp with a sharp tool.

532
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,940
The MO closely matches the previous case.

533
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,830
The light outside her door
was also tampered with.

534
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,630
No clear signs of struggle
at the entrance either,

535
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,550
and none of the neighbors

536
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,010
reported unusual sounds.

537
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,110
The MO

538
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,270
is too similar—

539
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,290
it has to be the same perpetrator.

540
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,240
And here's something
even more interesting.

541
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,300
Take a look at this.

542
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,970
Another jade bracelet?

543
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
This is too much.

544
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,230
He's taunting us.

545
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,790
The precision of the scalp removal

546
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,360
suggests someone
with relevant professional skill.

547
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,790
Footprints indicate
the killer was not tall,

548
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,120
but physically strong—

549
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,920
making it hard for the victims
to break free.

550
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,110
The fact that both victims

551
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:20,000
worked for restaurants
under the same owner

552
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,330
can't be a coincidence.

553
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,270
Our primary suspects

554
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,930
should be drawn
from the restaurants' frequent customers

555
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:26,970
and personnel.
