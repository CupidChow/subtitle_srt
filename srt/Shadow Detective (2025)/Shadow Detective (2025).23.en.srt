1
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,190
Come on!

2
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:27,670
Sister!

3
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,230
-Sister.
-Sister.

4
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,350
Sister.

5
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,350
Are you okay?

6
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,110
Are you alright, Sister?

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,670
Let's go.

8
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,450
I have a younger sister,

9
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,850
who's the same age as you.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,520
But I

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,000
don't know where she is.

12
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,900
I miss her very much.

13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,240
-Sister.
-Sister.

14
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,629
If you can escape,

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,120
go check on her for me.

16
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,820
And tell her...

17
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,910
-Sister!
-Sister!

18
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,789
Sister! Are you okay, Sister?

19
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,890
[Shadow Detective]

20
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,870
[Episode 23]

21
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,390
You want to investigate Mr. Jin?

22
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,880
Why investigate him?

23
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,280
We suspect

24
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,140
he's connected to the past cases.

25
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,710
Impossible.

26
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,590
He's not involved

27
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,310
in human trafficking or smuggling.

28
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,370
Then why did you arrest him back then?

29
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,190
I arrested him back then

30
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,960
because he stole materials
from the Police Department

31
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,560
and sold them to other gangs.

32
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,150
We caught him red-handed.

33
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,040
Then

34
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,530
the British took him away.

35
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,800
The next day, they told me

36
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,100
they would investigate.

37
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,020
They would handle it.

38
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,070
But what did they do?

39
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,860
They released him the very next day.

40
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,000
I heard that since then,

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,600
he disappeared in Shanghai.

42
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,250
Do you know what he did?

43
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,890
What else could he do?

44
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,180
He continued his shady dealings,

45
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,390
But he kept a much lower profile.

46
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,230
Director Huo,

47
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,560
don't you...

48
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,200
want to arrest him again?

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,600
What's the point of wanting?

50
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,240
I can't even

51
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,640
keep my own position now.

52
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,320
You can't fight against those in power.

53
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Do you know any other news about him?

54
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,200
He's still in Shanghai,

55
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,950
working for the British.

56
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,400
Wait, why are you asking about him?

57
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,120
How about...

58
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,680
we catch him for you?

59
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,540
Listen, you young folks,

60
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,589
please stop causing trouble for me.

61
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,690
I already have a British guy

62
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,630
and Inspector Zhu.

63
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,120
They've given me more than enough trouble.

64
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,560
If you want me to live a few more years,

65
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,040
stop stirring up more trouble for me.

66
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:41,440
This is what you asked for.

67
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,660
Mr. Peter,

68
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,350
this was custom-made for you.

69
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,950
Not bad, not bad.

70
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,090
Mr. Peter,
pleasure doing business with you.

71
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:18,950
Peter!

72
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,670
You guys talk. You guys talk.

73
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,990
Peter.

74
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,520
Let me tell you.

75
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,980
After I lost him,

76
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,630
I immediately returned
to the Intelligence Department

77
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,360
and had my men search all the alleys

78
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,510
in that area.

79
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,560
Guess what?

80
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,550
As expected, we didn't find him.

81
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,010
But this trip wasn't completely fruitless.

82
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,550
Do you still remember that clock tower?

83
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,810
I think there's something wrong with it.

84
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,880
Can you please pay some attention to me?

85
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,800
Whether I pay attention to you or not,

86
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,650
you'll still say it.

87
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,780
Why waste my breath?

88
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:40,900
Anyway,

89
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,120
I'm going to investigate that clock tower.

90
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,720
No need.

91
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,930
I'll handle this matter personally.

92
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,659
Did you find it?

93
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,180
After all this time,
you still don't trust me?

94
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,240
Where's the money?

95
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,010
What you're looking for

96
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,480
is at the Forensic Institute.

97
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,450
They're working on it

98
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,600
day and night.

99
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,130
I know what you're looking for.

100
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,280
You killed Zhuo Chaoxiong.

101
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,830
The people from Skylark Company

102
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,490
won't let you get away with it.

103
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,000
It contains

104
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,480
the evidence

105
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,600
of Skylark Company's crimes
from all these years.

106
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,270
If that list is exposed,

107
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,290
many people will be brought down.

108
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,990
Shanghai

109
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,800
will definitely see a major shake-up.

110
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:39,320
That's none of your business.

111
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,870
It can be my business.

112
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,630
How so?

113
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,560
That list

114
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,070
contains something I'm interested in.

115
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,720
That's also why I'm helping you this time.

116
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,580
Go on.

117
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,510
Back then,

118
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,850
Ghost and Butcher

119
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,220
wanted to steal the list
of all foreign clients

120
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,370
from Skylark Company,

121
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,430
right?

122
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,560
And then?

123
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,890
Whoever has that list

124
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,410
can start their own business.

125
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,560
Since Ghost is dead,

126
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,400
why not let Butcher and I
start our own venture?

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,600
With my connections to the British,

128
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,130
we can definitely carve out

129
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,970
a place for ourselves in Shanghai.

130
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,150
I'll relay your words

131
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,600
to Butcher.

132
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,510
Then...

133
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,330
I await your good news.

134
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,200
By the way,

135
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,750
any news

136
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,030
about her?

137
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,270
It's been so many years.

138
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,470
Why are you still looking for that girl?

139
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,909
Because this girl

140
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,530
is a disgrace to me.

141
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,740
She already fell.

142
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,960
She couldn't possibly survive.

143
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,510
But you didn't find her body either,

144
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,670
did you?

145
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,550
I must see her alive or dead.

146
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,470
No matter what.

147
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,560
Who's there?

148
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,200
Let's go!

149
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,150
Don't move!

150
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,790
Who is that girl?

151
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,120
What do you know?

152
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,580
Who is that woman? Tell me!

153
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,210
Speak!

154
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,030
Speak. Don't die.

155
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,240
Who is that woman?

156
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,630
Who is that woman? Speak! Don't die!

157
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,770
I never expected this.

158
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,550
Mr. Jin, once in all his glory,

159
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,000
would come to such an end.

160
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,750
It's a good thing though.

161
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,210
At least one of my wishes
has been fulfilled.

162
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,720
Look.

163
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,610
After all these years,

164
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,340
he's still doing these things.

165
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,960
Such important documents— how dare he...

166
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,740
It's not so bad though.

167
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,930
At least my position

168
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,280
is secure now.

169
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,320
Director Huo.

170
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,000
Inspector Zhu!

171
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,310
Yizhen, you're here too.

172
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,410
Inspector Zhu.

173
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,320
Why are you in such a good mood

174
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,150
to visit me?

175
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,730
I just got some fruits,

176
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,000
so I thought of bringing them to you.

177
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,600
You see,

178
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:35,830
the weather is so dry.

179
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,080
Eating more fruits is good
for your health.

180
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,570
That's thoughtful of you, Inspector Zhu.

181
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,200
Don't mention it.
It's the least I could do, Director Huo.

182
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,510
We've known each other for so many years.

183
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,570
We're like family.

184
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,400
Yizhen, you try one too.

185
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,480
Thank you.

186
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,210
I'll let you talk. I'm leaving first.

187
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:57,970
You two talk.

188
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,480
Why did he suddenly change his attitude?
Trying to flatter you?

189
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,440
The British are about to fall.

190
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,400
He's lost his backer.

191
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,080
So that means there's no threat
to your position now?

192
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,550
It's still too early to say that now.

193
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,880
No one can
predict the fate of the British.

194
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,020
So if you want to investigate something,
do it quickly.

195
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,490
What happened? Why the rush to see me?

196
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,630
Mr. Jin is dead.

197
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,390
How did he die?

198
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,530
We were in the middle of our conversation.

199
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,780
The police officers somehow found us.

200
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,570
Mr. Jin, in a panic,

201
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,030
fell from the clock tower.

202
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,490
It's better that he's dead.

203
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,140
If he had been arrested,

204
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,530
no one would have protected him.

205
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,670
And he might have even betrayed us.

206
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,630
Did you find the thing's whereabouts?

207
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,480
Yes.

208
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,750
Mr. Jin said

209
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,960
it's at the Forensic Institute.

210
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,240
The Forensic Institute?

211
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,430
I know you're upset.

212
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,720
But look.

213
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,810
I haven't given up.

214
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,420
Jingning wouldn't give up either.

215
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,070
How can you give up?

216
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,010
I admire your courage.

217
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,840
Aren't you worried I've set a trap here

218
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,900
and lured you here?

219
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,750
If you were a dog,
I'd be worried you might bite.

220
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,610
But in front of your father,
you weren't even a dog.

221
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,150
Why should I be afraid of you?

222
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,480
Don't be so arrogant!

223
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,840
Since I called you here,

224
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,370
I have ways to deal with you!

225
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,800
But I'm not here to settle scores today.

226
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,290
I'm here to discuss a deal with you.

227
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,370
Young Master Zhuo, you want
to discuss a deal with me?

228
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,280
Fine.

229
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,040
Discuss what?

230
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,450
Discuss my father's position.

231
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,770
Do you think
you're qualified to discuss that with me?

232
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,610
Of course.

233
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,600
Because I'm your only potential partner.

234
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,320
After my father died,

235
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,200
neither you nor Captain
gained the upper hand.

236
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,360
Because the organization
hasn't given either of you

237
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,480
any instructions.

238
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,560
Even now that Captain is dead,

239
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,170
has anyone from the organization
contacted you?

240
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,260
You seem to know a lot
about how the organization operates.

241
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,080
That's my bargaining chip.

242
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,910
Then tell me

243
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,470
how to get in touch with the organization.

244
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,490
I think you've misunderstood me.

245
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,970
I mean...

246
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,090
a collaboration.

247
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,550
Fine.

248
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,520
Tell me how we'll collaborate.

249
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,550
I know

250
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,470
you've always wanted
to take over Captain's business.

251
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,870
Now that Captain is dead,

252
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,310
I won't compete with you.

253
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,870
From now on, you'll be in charge

254
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,930
of both smuggled goods

255
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,020
and human cargo.

256
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,360
And I

257
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,140
will be responsible
for contacting the organization.

258
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,900
We...

259
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,640
will be equals.

260
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,700
You sound like a janitor

261
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,150
rushing into an operating room

262
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,200
and telling the surgeon

263
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,200
that he can help perform the surgery.

264
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,230
Are you out of your mind?

265
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,000
My concession
isn't because I'm afraid of you!

266
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,860
It doesn't mean
I don't know how to do your business!

267
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,690
I just don't want to compete with you.

268
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,080
You know?

269
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,000
Do you know what human cargo is?

270
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,200
Do you know how to receive the goods

271
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,400
and how to dispose of the useless goods?

272
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,600
Finally, you're here.

273
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,510
I was so scared.

274
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,870
This secret room

275
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,810
has been locked by us.

276
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,960
Your Tang Jiahao

277
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,000
won't come to save you.

278
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,080
You're using such dirty tricks.

279
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,750
Are you trying to force me
to collaborate with you?

280
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,880
Or do you just want to kill me directly?

281
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,079
He's an old fox.

282
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,900
He won't collaborate with us.

283
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,230
Just kill him directly.

284
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,020
What are you doing?

285
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,920
Kill him!

286
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,460
Looks like you set this trap.

287
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,079
Your purpose

288
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,010
isn't to collaborate with me.

289
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,560
Xiaolin,

290
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,030
what... what did he say?

291
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,750
Tell me,

292
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,480
where is the human cargo?

293
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,730
So that's your purpose.

294
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,320
My hatred for you

295
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,160
is enough to tear you to pieces

296
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,280
and chop you into mincemeat.

297
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,000
But today, I just want to know

298
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,110
where the human cargo is.

299
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,100
Where are those girls?

300
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,680
Girls?

301
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,990
What girls?

302
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,240
What exactly are you doing?

303
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,030
You deliberately lured him here?

304
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,030
Who are you trying to save?

305
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,160
That's none of your business! Tell me!

306
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,830
I don't know.

307
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,720
Tang Jiahao knows.

308
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,590
I don't know either.

309
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,200
Don't come any closer!

310
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,510
Don't kill me!

311
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:41,690
Don't kill...

312
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,560
What are you going to do?

313
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,390
What are you laughing at?
Are you that free too?

314
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,190
Is it cold?

315
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,110
No.

316
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,490
What are you looking at?

317
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,670
Checking if you're frowning
or looking bitter.

318
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,910
Didn't you say we don't have time
to be disappointed?

319
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,570
Now I'm fully devoted to work.

320
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,480
Inspector!

321
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,250
Inspector,

322
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,740
there's a homicide case
at Zhuo Chaoxiong's residence.

323
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,150
We have a case. Let's go.

324
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:51,900
-Yes!
-Yes!

325
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,860
What's the situation at the scene?

326
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,070
After Zhuo Chaoxiong died,

327
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,470
this residence was sold.

328
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,500
It was discovered
during cleaning this morning.

329
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,580
The blood on the ground
isn't completely dry yet.

330
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,980
That means
the crime happened not long ago.

331
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,880
What's the situation with the victim?

332
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,590
The victim's posture in death
is a bit strange.

333
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,550
And look at this.

334
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,000
she has a dagger wound in her abdomen,

335
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,720
and the dagger is still in the body.

336
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,190
There's so much blood on the ground.

337
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,780
If the blood is all hers,

338
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,070
she clearly died
from excessive blood loss.

339
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,110
Who would endure the severe pain

340
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,040
and leave the dagger in their body?

341
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,820
Unless there's a clue on the dagger
she wanted to preserve.

342
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,620
I'll focus on examining the dagger
after I go back.

343
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,510
Looks like she was not the only victim.

344
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,710
There was another person dragged away.

345
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,470
It's Yang Xiaolin.

346
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,620
She was always with Zhuo Feng.

347
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Could the other person be Zhuo Feng?

348
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,510
There's someone over there!

349
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,470
Sir.

350
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,960
His tongue was cut out.

351
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,000
His throat and esophagus
were corroded by strong acid.

352
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,240
The bones in his fingers
were completely shattered.

353
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,040
And his wounds have already been infected.

354
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,760
So

355
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,660
his condition is very critical.

356
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,350
And he can barely communicate.

357
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,210
He may not be able to help you much.

358
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:50,830
Thank you, doctor.

359
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,680
Zhuo Feng.

360
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,720
Zhuo Feng.

361
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,070
Was it Butcher who did this to you?

362
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,630
Is Butcher Gu Sinian?

363
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:07,750
Is...

364
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,000
Is that right?

365
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,110
Lu Yizhen.

366
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,820
I know you hate him very much.

367
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,350
But there's nothing you can do right now.

368
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,280
But we can.

369
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,200
If we can get information about him,

370
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,460
maybe we can catch him.

371
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,920
Don't you think so?

372
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,030
Take.

373
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,240
Back.

374
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,240
Me?

375
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,440

00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,640
Take back Lu Yizhen things?

379
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,180
Take back Lu Yizhen's things.

380
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,830
My things?

381
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,640
The Forensic Institute might be in danger.

382
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,370
We need to go check it out quickly.

383
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,850
This is just our speculation.

384
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:18,850
We don't know when they'll come

385
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,110
or what kind of action

386
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,000
they'll take.

387
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,730
But judging by Butcher's character,

388
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,790
once he knows, he'll stop at nothing.

389
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,310
We'd better go check it out.

390
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,840
Let's go.

392
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,780
Don't come out!

00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:01,910

00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,610
Go surround them.

396
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,160
Okay.

397
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,030
Follow me!

398
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,750
Yes!

399
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,520
He's gone!

400
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,340
No one here!

401
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,080
No one here either!

402
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,840
Tang Jiahao
wouldn't have come here rashly.

Okay.

Who are you?

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,270
Put it down!

410
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,630
Put it down!

411
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,960
What's wrong? What happened?

412
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,620
Someone...

00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,510

Ding Eryi!

418
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,070
What happened?

419
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,000
Did you find her?

No.

I bought your favorite oranges for...

422
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,160
Master.

423
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,200
Master!

424
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,830
Master!

425
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,440
What just happened?

426
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,550
Master.

427
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,030
What a disgrace!

428
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,490
This is the first time I, Huo Zhongji,

429
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,440
have been so utterly humiliated!

430
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,960
Director Huo.

431
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,600
We didn't expect it either.

432
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,750
Didn't expect it?

433
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,590
Then what's the point
of keeping you police officers?

434
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,310
All of you,

435
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,730
go out on the street and listen!

436
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,270
See what people on the street

437
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,470
and the newspapers are saying about us!

438
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,960
Useless trash! Good for nothing!

439
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,040
Worthless! A waste of tax money!

440
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,470
And you didn't expect it?

441
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,520
That guy, what's his name?

442
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,680
Tang Jiahao,

443
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,310
just a petty ruffian,

444
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,180
almost blew up the Police Station

445
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,790
and took care of all of you!

The Forensic Institute—

447
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,440
entering it was like
walking through a city gate for him!

448
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,400
He easily went in there,

449
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,070
killed, and robbed!

450
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,370
And he left easily!

451
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,570
You said you didn't expect it!

452
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,900
What did you all expect?

453
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,240
Guan Cen,

454
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,290
I usually think highly of you, don't I?

455
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,550

456
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,350
And you, Lu Yizhen!

457
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,480
Haven't I treated you

458
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,680
well enough? Haven't I been fair to you?

459
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,270
Whenever you needed something,

460
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,600
I gave you whatever you wanted!

461
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,830
I let you investigate whatever you wanted!

462
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,760
And I always took the blame for you!

463
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,640
Look at yourselves.

464
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,540
You're dressed

465
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,750
in suits and leather shoes,

466
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,880
looking all proper!

467
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,680
You told me

468
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,880
the wolf has a winning game
when the shepherds quarrel!

469
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,510
But you've never realized
you're the shepherds?

470
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,470
Whenever I ask you something,
you always say you don't know.

471
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,490
When I ask again,
you just shake your heads!

472
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,420
I'm telling you!

473
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,550
I've had enough of being scolded today!

474
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,960
If you can do the job, do it!

475
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,490

478
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,310
I messed up

479
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,720
this matter.

480
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,480
The higher-ups have ordered us

481
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,550
to stop investigating this case
immediately.

482
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,420
I, Lu Yizhen,

483
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,960
and Director Du
from the Intelligence Department

484
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,920
will be punished

485
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,840
and suspended pending investigation.

486
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,740
There are many other cases to handle.

487
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,590
You carry on.

488
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,680
Dr. Ding.

489
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,260
I brought some food.

490
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,240
Have some.

491
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,910
That's right.

492
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,670
You need to eat
to have the strength to work.

493
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,250
You came at the right time.

494
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,840
I just made a new discovery.

495
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,110
What is it?

496
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,800
On the dagger
found in Yang Xiaolin's body,

497
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,830
I discovered someone else's fingerprints.

498
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,430
This person's fingerprints

499
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,280
also appeared on the weapon
that killed my master.

500
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,780
So you're saying

501
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,890
the person who killed Yang Xiaolin
and Director Wang

502
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,290
might be the same person?

503
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,600
Give me the fingerprint information.

504
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,600
I'll have my informant check it out.

505
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,750
Are you okay?

506
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,400
I'm fine. I just stood up a bit too fast.

507
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,910
About what happened,

508
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,380
we're all very sad.

509
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,760
But I know

510
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,180
you must feel much sadder than we do.

511
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,610
Talking about it

512
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,280
might help you feel better.

513
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,370
Sometimes I feel like

514
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,890
he never really left.

515
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,280
Everything on this desk:

516
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,800
the tweezers,

517
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:45,750
the clamps,

518
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,480
the pen,

519
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,680
the cup,

520
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,040
and this notebook.

521
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:58,070
It contains everything he learned
in his lifetime.

522
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,160
He always said

523
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,640
after he gloriously returned
to his hometown,

524
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,970
he would give this to me.

525
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,240
But who will I learn from now?

526
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,720
What's wrong?

527
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,030
I think my master had drawn this thing.

528
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,420
This looks like a ticket.

529
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,310
It looks...

530
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:31,930
like a shop name.

531
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,650
Notify Guan Cen immediately.
