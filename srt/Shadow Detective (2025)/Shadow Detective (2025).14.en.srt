1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,160
Keep this safe.

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,250
I will tolerate no errors.

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,520
Everything can be arranged,
as long as the money's right.

4
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,470
Hold on to this receipt.

5
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,000
When you come to collect your item,
this slip is all we'll honor.

6
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,480
[Shadow Detective]

7
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,460
[Episode 14]

8
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,560
Yizhen,

9
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,640
their clothing style suits you so well.

10
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,920
This piece looks lovely on you.

11
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,860
Well, I'll pick another one, then.

12
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,540
This one's beautiful too.

13
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,990
And this one?

14
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,300
Go on, just try it!

15
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,650
Come on, let's go—

16
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,670
give it a shot.

17
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,150
Here, have some water.

18
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,750
Thank you.

19
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,620
Now that's more like the Miss Lu we know!

20
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,250
Here, take a look in the mirror.

21
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,360
Honestly, this is more exhausting
than investigating cases.

22
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:41,950
Si Min.

23
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,840
You look beautiful.

24
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,660
What's so tiring about it?

25
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,030
All you do

26
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,190
is work;

27
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,550
you should put some effort
into your appearance once in a while.

28
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,610
Remember how polished you used to be?

29
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,240
Speaking of the alumni gathering,

30
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,360
whose house did you say it was at again?

31
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,420
Zhuo Chaoxiong's.

32
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,570
Don't tell me

33
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,150
you only agreed to go
because of work?

34
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:05,800
No,

35
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,310
didn't I tell you before?

36
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,840
Let's go with this one, then.

37
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,040
You'd better mean it.

38
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,880
Please wrap this dress for me.

39
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,540
Are there any others you like?

40
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,079
Wrap this one up as well.

41
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,839
So these are all part of a set, right?

42
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,640
Yes, they are.

43
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,290
Trying to butter me up won't work.

44
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,600
If I find out

45
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,070
you're only going for a case,

46
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,000
I will drag you out of there myself.

47
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,930
Understood.

48
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:34,870
Thank you.

49
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,760
And please include my clothes
inside there.

50
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,360
Of course.

51
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,720
Yizhen,

52
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:46,750
how do I look?

53
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,670
You're the most stunning person
here tonight.

54
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,110
Look over there—

55
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,120
that's Attorney Chen.

56
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,390
I heard he earns a high salary

57
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,520
and comes from a well-off family.

58
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,890
And that one—

59
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,070
that's Dr. Gu, our senior
from university.

60
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,060
He was one of the best
in our college back then.

61
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,310
Hello, everyone,

62
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,160
thank you for gracing my humble home.

63
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,270
You honor me

64
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,920
-with your presence.
-Is that Zhuo Chaoxiong?

65
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,070
-Yeah, that's him.
-Please, enjoy the food, drinks,

66
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,400
and festivities to your heart's content.

67
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,630
And the one next to him—his son?

68
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,240
Yes,

69
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,570
that's Zhuo Feng,

70
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,650
the only son in the family.

71
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,240
Don't tell me you're interested in him?

72
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,270
Just asking.

73
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,040
Phew,

74
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,110
glad you're not.

75
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,909
Rumor has it he's quite the playboy—

76
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,060
you really don't want to get involved.

77
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,870
Plus, I've heard
he's heavily into medication.

78
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,510
Si Min,

79
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,830
our old classmates are all over there.

80
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,890
Let's go say hello—

81
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,870
come on!

82
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,560
Alright, I'll head over then.

83
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,090
Go ahead.

84
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,040
Are you alright?

85
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,950
It's fine, it's fine.

86
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,680
My apologies.

87
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,120
I...

88
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,380
Y-You're here too?

89
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,390
I meant to reach out,

90
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,920
but haven't had the chance.

91
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,980
Do you have any idea

92
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,330
how much trouble
that last report of yours caused me?

93
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,070
How could that be?

94
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,800
It was just a standard article.

95
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,360
Well, if it isn't Xiaoxiao.

96
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,840
Surprised to see you here.

97
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,300
Xiaoxiao has been in the press
for years now, hasn't she?

98
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,980
Guess we should call her

99
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,210
Editor Wu these days.

100
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,080
Which paper was it again?

101
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,830
Wasn't she fired
from The Republican Daily News?

102
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,000
She's probably working
for some tabloid now—

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,200
the kind that chases celebrity gossip.

104
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,470
What's it called...?

105
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,480
And she still dares show up
at an alumni gathering like this?

106
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,830
Trying to be

107
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,070
a social climber, is she?

108
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,630
Enough.

109
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,720
With so many people here today,

110
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,830
your loud, snide remarks

111
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,160
are just embarrassing.

112
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,600
Let's go.

113
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,000
Thank you.

114
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,830
I've been treated like that before too—

115
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,480
I know how it feels.

116
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,220
But you don't need to thank me.

117
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,560
I'd have done the same

118
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
for anyone today.

119
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,860
It wasn't about you.

120
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,750
Still, thank you.

121
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,380
Why are you here?

122
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,750
For the same reason

123
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,830
you are.

124
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,470
I came to dance.

125
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,590
So did I.

126
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,700
Where's Guan Cen?

127
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,679
How much do you already know?

128
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,260
I don't know what you're investigating,

129
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,900
but it must be connected

130
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,450
to what happened back then.

131
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,840
Otherwise, you wouldn't have left me out.

132
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,480
I know

133
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,790
you both are just trying to protect me—

134
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,660
to keep me from getting hurt again.

135
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,970
But I was the one
who went through it all,

136
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,960
the one who suffered.

137
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,690
How could you cut me out of this?

138
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,200
Ghost died in prison.

139
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,570
The case is complicated—

140
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,300
we can't track down the killer.

141
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
The only lead we have

142
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,150
points to Zhuo Chaoxiong.

143
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,510
We found out

144
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,870
there's a secret meeting
happening here tonight,

145
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,330
so we came to investigate.

146
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,360
Have you found them yet?

147
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,600
The Zhuo Compound is enormous.

148
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,670
We're completely in the dark
on where to even begin.

149
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,130
I also lost track
of Zhuo Chaoxiong just now.

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,060
Here's our chance.

151
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,880
I'm heading up.

152
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,480
Wait for me.

153
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,300
Okay.

154
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,800
Let's go. Follow them.

155
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,350
I have one condition:

156
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,930
if there's any danger,

157
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,160
you run immediately.

158
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,310
I understand.

159
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,540
Where did he go?

160
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,110
How could he just vanish into thin air?

161
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,540
This hallway doesn't lead anywhere else...

162
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,070
There's something off
about this cabinet.

163
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,130
So this is what it's come to—
the Chamber calls a meeting,

164
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,600
and we can't even get everyone
in the same room.

165
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,750
It seems the Chamber means little

166
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,720
to some of you now.

167
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,840
With your two top lieutenants missing,

168
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,460
how can this meeting proceed?

169
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,950
The Captain is away on business.

170
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,080
As for the Butcher...

171
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,310
he's off meeting a client

172
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,570
about some major deal.

173
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,290
He sent me in his place,

174
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,910
and Butcher said

175
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,690
he's confident the Chamber
will understand.

176
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,600
If you're so capable, then by all means—
handle your own affairs.

177
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,440
The Chamber

178
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,320
certainly won't stop you.

179
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,170
But since the last fire,

180
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,520
we've faced relentless pressure
these years.

181
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,050
We finally tracked down Ghost,

182
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,960
only to end in a stalemate.

183
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,320
Mr. Zhuo,

184
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,120
the incident in the prison—

185
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,150
you owe us

186
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,260
an explanation.

187
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,280
Please assure the leadership—

188
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,410
I will provide a full explanation.

189
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
Some matters,

190
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,240
the Chamber may overlook.

191
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,630
But others—

192
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,120
the Chamber

193
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,360
will never tolerate them.

194
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,210
Who's there?

195
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:09,970
Let's go.

196
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,630
Mr. Zhuo,

197
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,330
Linfeng, why are you so out of breath?

198
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,170
We were just dancing—

199
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,060
got a bit carried away having fun.

200
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,360
Aren't you going to introduce me

201
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,640
to such a lovely dance partner?

202
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,720
This is Lu Yizhen, my girlfriend.

203
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,080
Your girlfriend?

204
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,550
Your father never mentioned her to me.

205
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,280
Miss Lu, are you also an alumna
of the Chongde University?

206
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,910
Yes.

207
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,080
What a delightful coincidence.

208
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,950
Pleasure to meet you.

209
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:39,720
Enjoy.

210
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,440
May I ask

211
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,080
where you work, Miss Lu?

212
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,100
Lu Yizhen.

213
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,550
Lu Yizhen is the first woman
from our university

214
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,000
to join the police station.

215
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,660
Quite impressive, isn't she?

216
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,890
So we have a real heroine in our midst.

217
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,550
The police station

218
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,320
and the intelligence department—

219
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,070
what a perfect match.

220
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,910
Linfeng,

221
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,790
it's been too long.

222
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,090
Why don't we seize the moment?

223
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,660
Come on.

224
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,030
Let's have a proper chat.

225
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,570
Mr. Zhuo.

226
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,880
We've found it.

227
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,400
Linfeng,

228
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,080
it seems something urgent
requires my attention.

229
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,680
We'll catch up another time.

230
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,990
Of course, Mr. Zhuo.
I won't hold you up.

231
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,370
Are you alright?

232
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,350
I need to use the restroom.

233
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,030
Lu Yizhen?

234
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,120
What are you doing here?

235
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,170
And why are you so drunk?

236
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,790
I'm not drunk.

237
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,380
Why are you inside?

238
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,000
Weren't you supposed
to be keeping watch outside?

239
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,060
And why is she here?

240
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,840
She knows.

241
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,330
Don't you understand
how dangerous this is?

242
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,690
Even if she found out,
you shouldn't have brought her along!

243
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,630
D-Don't lecture him.

244
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,780
I came on my own.

245
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,920
And don't think

246
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,520
I don't know what you two

247
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,910
are up to.

248
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,360
If you won't include me,
I'll investigate by myself!

249
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,150
Let go of me!

250
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,080
How are you going
to investigate anything being so drunk?

251
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,480
I'll take her back.
You handle things here.

252
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,410
-Feeling sick?
-Pull over.

253
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,550
If you can't hold your liquor,
you shouldn't have pushed yourself.

254
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,520
You don't need to go this far for a case.

255
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,000
Stop lecturing me.

256
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,410
Why are you always lecturing people?

257
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,090
I'm not lecturing you.

258
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,170
Not lecturing?

259
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,000
Then what was that just now?

260
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,050
I'm asking you—

261
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,090
what do you call that?

262
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:46,980

Here's something for the hangover.

280
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,140
[Jasmine Cafe]

281
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,290
Should I say women are too kind-hearted,

282
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,810
or that they're too forgetful?

283
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,480
You know,

284
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,240
when I was studying in France,

285
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,410
my route from home to school

286
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,610
passed through a street full of bars.

287
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,730
Drunk foreigners
often harassed female students,

288
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,830
so after class,

289
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,220
I always hurried back.

290
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,330
That does sound dangerous.

291
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:18,860
Exactly.

292
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,240
Once, I stayed late at the library,

293
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,350
and on my way back,

294
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,820
I ran into that group
of drunk foreigners again.

295
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,950
Just as they were about to surround me,

296
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,840
my senior showed up—

297
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,650
he stepped in and shielded me.

298
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,690
So, were you close with this senior?

299
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,580
We'd only met a few times,

300
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,420
just casual acquaintances.

301
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,480
Later,

302
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,810
he told me
that we actually lived close by.

303
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,030
After that, he'd wait for me
after class every day

304
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,000
and walk me home.

305
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,100
We'd talk the whole way—

306
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,160
from medicine to philosophy,

307
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,440
life to art—

308
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,270
as if we'd never run out of things to say.

309
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,510
And then?

310
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,240
Well…

311
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,980
eventually, I realized

312
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,580
our places weren't actually
on the way at all.

313
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,440
Every time after dropping me off,

314
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,760
he had to take a long detour to get back.

315
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:11,960
I never would've thought

316
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,620
you had such a romantic story.

317
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,980
Aren't you curious

318
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,850
what happened between us after that?

319
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,510
You ended up together, didn't you?

320
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,060
But you also thought
he was a good guy, didn't you?

321
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,060
He was wonderful,

322
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,370
and he treated me well.

323
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,690
So... when he confessed his feelings,

324
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,770
I turned him down without hesitation.

325
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:29,680
Why?

326
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,200
Because love isn't

327
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,710
just about giving and receiving in return.

328
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,730
There's no formula to measure it.

329
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,540
It is just

330
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,610
a spark—

331
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,070
fleeting, like lightning.

332
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,730
I didn't feel that for him,

333
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,790
so it wouldn't have been right
for either of us.

334
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,440
What a shame, though.

335
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,290
It wasn't a shame at all.

336
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,870
He's since met someone
who truly loves him,

337
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,920
and they're very happy together.

338
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,040
If I had been with him back then

339
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,620
just out of gratitude,

340
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,030
well,

341
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,310
it would've been unfair to us both.

342
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,690
Lu Yizhen,

343
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,410
get in here.

344
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,190
What was that stuff you made me drink?

345
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,420
Did you throw up?

346
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,070
How did you know?

347
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,690
One sip, and I was heaving for ages.

348
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,490
Good. Got it all out, didn't you?

349
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,240
You're a lot clearer-headed now
than yesterday.

350
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,120
You're late.

351
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
I was...

352
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,790
h-hungover.

353
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,250
Inspector.

354
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,240
Inspector!

355
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,150
Why is your face flushed?

356
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,410
No, it's not.

357
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,840
Let's focus. What is it?

358
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,670
We have a new case.

359
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,720
The victim...

360
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,390
is someone you all know.

361
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,890
The victim's name was Wu Xiaoxiao.

362
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,780
Wasn't she the one
who gave you a hard time last time?

363
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,660
Do you want to head back first?

364
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,060
I can handle things here.

365
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,560
She might have died in my place.

366
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,200
That shawl…

367
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,870
I was the one who brought it
to Zhuo Chaoxiong's compound yesterday.

368
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,270
How did it end up on her?

369
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,640
She was there too.

370
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,060
Du Linfeng and I found

371
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,240
where they were holding
their secret meeting,

372
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,970
but someone inside spotted us.

373
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,750
While we were running,

374
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,470
I saw her hiding in a corner.

375
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,790
But the situation was too urgent—

376
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,390
we didn't have time
to wonder why she was there.

377
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,750
This was my fault.

378
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,570
We'll prioritize Wu Xiaoxiao's case.

379
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,600
For the next few days, be careful—

380
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,770
don't go out alone.

381
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,040
This happened
at Zhuo Chaoxiong's compound.

382
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,830
He's involved, without a doubt.

383
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,560
How did things end up like this…

384
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,110
If Wu Xiaoxiao was truly killed
as our scapegoat,

385
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,640
then Zhuo Chaoxiong is
definitely involved.

386
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,440
What were you all just discussing?

387
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,200
Watch out!

388
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,150
What's going on?

389
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,540
-How could you be so clumsy?
-Are you okay?

390
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,340
It's alright.

391
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,470
Could you please take me to clean up?

392
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,070
Of course,

393
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,320
my apologies.

394
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,940
Right this way.
I'll take you to clean that off.

395
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,520
This side, please. Yes, here.

396
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,240
Lu Yizhen,

397
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,640
I don't want to hurt you.

398
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,850
Listen carefully.

399
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,070
Tomorrow at dawn,

400
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,400
meet me at the restaurant
across the street.

401
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,270
I have the information
you're looking for.

402
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,730
But you can't tell anyone—

403
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,590
you must come alone.

404
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,350
Okay.

405
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,160
You can drop me off here,

406
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,550
thanks.

407
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,240
Hello?

408
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,270
There's a street vendor
at the corner selling candied hawthorns.

409
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,600
Buy two sticks,
then come right back here.

410
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:28,920
Alright.

411
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,660
Could you take me
in that direction, please?

412
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,510
Thank you.
