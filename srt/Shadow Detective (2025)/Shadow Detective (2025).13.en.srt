stay clear of this old case

18
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,500
and distant yourselves
from the investigation.

00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,890
Anything wrong, Dr. Ding?

39
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,950
Lu, take a look at this report.

40
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,270
These clothes are from too long ago,

41
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,040
so there aren't many useful clues on them.

42
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,840
Nonetheless,

43
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,190
I found this.

44
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,140
At first,
I thought it was just a piece of insole.

45
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,960
But as I observed closely later,

46
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,120
I found some writing on it.

47
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,920
What does it say?

48
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,720
It's illegible.

49
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,320

50
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,130
Don't touch it.

51
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,750
Though I've removed the stains
on the surface,

52
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,150
there's still mold on it.

In addition,

54
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,510
I think

55
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,720
these paper fragments

56
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,920
were probably glued together on purpose.

57
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,560
When I attempted to separate them,

58
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,680
I almost ruined this piece of evidence.

59
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,409
Are there any other solutions?

60
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,800
Not that I can think of.

61
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,680

62
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,940

69

70

Perhaps that's Jingning's blood
on my clothes.

I haven't told Guan Cen about it yet,

118
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,040
because those clothes are yours,

Let me pour the tea.

135
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,220
You know about

136
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,000
the prison riot, right?

137
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,730
I've heard a bit about it.

138
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,320
Wasn't it quickly contained

00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,960
and didn't cause massive casualties?

140
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,760
That's right.

141

have been friends for years.

He's under a lot of pressure
from the brass.

147
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,750
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

148
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,390
So, I'd like to ask you to look into

149
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,240
this matter.

150
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,670
Now that you've said so,

151
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,600
I'll definitely do my best to help.

152
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,630
But isn't Guan Cen more suited

153
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,920
to investigate cases of this kind?

154
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,930
One of the bodies

155
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,550
belongs to an inmate named Bao Yiming.

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,960
I bet you're rather familiar

157
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,480

159
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,390
The Ghost?

160
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,900
You mean...

161
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,120
the missing suspect of that old case
concerning Lu Yizhen?

162
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,750
Yes.

163
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,410
As you know,
Guan Cen is fixated on this old case.

164
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,930
So, after much consideration,

165
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,670
I decided not to tell him.

166
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,170
Every strike was meant to kill.

167
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,930
The killer had quite a clear purpose.

168
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,050
Director Du,

169
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,810
something seems off.

170
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,500
Take a look

171
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,660
at their ages.

172
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,440
The three of them

173
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,570
were sent to prison for the same theft?

174
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,670
It's written here
that they were 45, 48 and 42 years old,

175
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,670
respectively.

176
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,360
But they seemed to be
in their 30s when they died.

177
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,310
I think they deliberately went to prison
under fake identities.

178
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,670
If that's true,

179
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,660
the situation has become tricky.

180
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,000
What about the doctor hired by the prison?

181
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,840
Wasn't he supposed to give

182
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,910
basic checkups to all the inmates?

183
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,510
How did he miss on
something so obvious and fishy?

184
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,040
Who's the doctor
working with the prison now?

185
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,240
Currently, it's a doctor

186
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,440
named Huang Kaiyuan.

187
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,670
He used to work at Jinghu Hospital.

188
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,940
Later on, he opened his own clinic.

189
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,270
I'm not sure what strings he pulled

190
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,330
to solicit business from the prison.

191
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,390
Look into him.

192
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,130
Okay.

193
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:02,720
Dr. Ding.

194
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,390
Dr. Ding.

195
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,240
Are you investigating a case here,
Director Du?

196
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,360
Yes, an old one.

197
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:08,940
An old case?

198
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,280
Didn't these four bodies
arrive not long ago?

199
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,290
They died of unusual causes,
so I came for a look.

200
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,070
Anything I can help with?

201
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:18,840
Nothing.

202
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,290
Our work's almost done.

203
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,130
Alright.

204
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,240
Don't bother. Leave it to my colleagues.

205
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:26,870
Thank you.

206
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,630
I appreciate your help, Dr. Ding.

207
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,290
No problem.

208
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,330
I'm honored to be of assistance to you,
Director Du.

209
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,550
I see.

210
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,120
We'll take our leave now.

211
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,600
Goodbye.

212
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,910
Are you here to see the doctor?

213
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,170
Did you make an appointment?

214
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,630
We're here
to ask Huang Kaiyuan some questions.

215
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,490
Who are you? How dare you barge in?

216
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,750
Stop, or I'll report you to the police.

217
00:12:58,890 --> 00:12:59,430
No need.

218
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,130
I'm an officer myself.

219
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,570
The Intelligence Department?

220
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,860
Director Du, please.

221
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,840
Come on in.

222
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,030
Director Du,

223
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,160
have some tea.

224
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:27,920
Take a seat.

225
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,510
Dr. Huang,
besides running a private clinic,

226
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,870
you also go to the prison
to treat inmates.

227
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,000
How very busy of you.

228
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,420
Director Du...

229
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,870
You flatter me.

230
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,620
I'm just making a living.

231
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,100
Nothing more than that.

232
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,670
Dr. Huang, what exactly

233
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,000
do you do in the prison?

234
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,320
Oh, this question...

235
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,320
Well, you see,

236
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,440
I'm a doctor.

237
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,290
My job in the prison

238
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,550
is mainly about

239
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,200
giving regular checkups

240
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,120
to inmates.

241
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,320
If any of them are found sick,

242
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,670
I'll prescribe medicine for them.

243
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,790
That's all.

244
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,150
You know about the recent

245
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,280
prison riot, right?

246
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,850
I've heard about it.

247
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Not a lot, though.

248
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,780
During the riot...

249
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,600
To be exact, before and after the riot,

250
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,060
altogether four prisoners were found dead.

251
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,790
Are you aware of it, Dr. Huang?

252
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,440
Director Du, about that...

253
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,600
As you know,

254
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,000
the conditions in the prison are rough.

255
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,480
Isn't it...

256
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,230
normal that a few inmates die
every now and then?

257
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,860
The state that three bodies are in

258
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,080
contradicts the registration details

259
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,540
from when they entered the prison.

260
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,670
I suspect they used false identities.

261
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,360
All of their profiles

262
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,220
were processed by you, Dr. Huang.

263
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,170
Didn't you notice anything wrong?

264
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,440
Look,

265
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,980
Director Du, you hold high office,

266
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,390
so you may not be well informed of...

267
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,440
how certain things work

268
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,000
at lower levels.

269
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:21,860
What do you mean?

270
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,440
Let me put it this way.

271
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,100
Those who have been put in jail

272
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,120
used to be thugs

273
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,040
that did all kinds of evil.

274
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,540
From a social perspective,

275
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,980
putting them in prison

276
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,040
is actually

277
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,050
eliminating public menaces.

278
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,630
Therefore,

279
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,080
after they were put behind bars,

280
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,030
their specific personal details

281
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,210
and their life status

282
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,060
would no longer matter.

283
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,720
Director Du, come on.

284
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,260
Have some tea.

285
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,790
Come on.

286
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,800
Have some tea.

287
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,840
Guan Cen, wash them carefully.

288
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,170
There's still mud here.

289
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,910
Si Min, easy on the salt.

290
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,620
Yizhen hates salty food.

291
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,360
Easy on the salt?

292
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,090
The salt has been used up by you.

293
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,600
Alright. Stop bickering.

294
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,530
I'll go buy some.

295
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,560
It's not safe to go out alone this late.

296
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,760
You go with me then.

297
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,660
Better let me do it.

298
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,400
You wash the vegetables.

299
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,680
I'll go with you.

300
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,920
You wash the vegetables.

301
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,160
They'll be safe going out as a group.

302
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,390
Linfeng is hopeless.

303
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,630
What? Didn't you let him go buy salt?

304
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,890
I presented an opportunity to him,
yet he didn't seize it.

305
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,220
How can I not be worried?

306
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,700
Si Min.

307
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,990
I'm being serious when I tell you this:

308
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,270
I'm not interested in your cousin.

309
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,069
Stop trying to fix me up with him.

310
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,440
Do you want to repeat your mistake

311
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,099
by getting back with Guan Cen?

312
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,240
You want to tell me something?

313
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,640
How did you figure it out?

314
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,920
It's nothing.

315
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,980
Don't say it if you don't feel like it.

316
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,890
You don't want to hear it at all?

317
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,280
What if it's about the Ghost?

318
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,070
Did you find him?

319
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,310
Yes,

320
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,320
but not when he was alive.

321
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,630
He's dead now?

322
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,550
You heard about the recent prison riot,

323
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,400
right?

324
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,530
The prison claimed
there were no casualties.

325
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,530
But in fact,

326
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,000
four inmates died,

327
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,110
one of which was the Ghost.

328
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,990
His name in the prison

329
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,540
was Bao Yiming.

330
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,080
How did you find out about it?

331
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,710
I got it from Director Huo.

332
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,600
He asked me in secret
to investigate this case.

333
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,310
By withholding such information from me,

334
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,570
Director Huo must be
trying to keep me out of this matter.

335
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,030
Why are you telling me now?

336
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,320
I conducted an investigation

337
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,920
and found this case complex.

338
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,510
It might be related to that old case.

339
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,620
I'd like to help Lu Yizhen
uncover the truth.

340
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,310
If you want to act the hero
in front of Lu Yizhen,

341
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,110
you don't need to be telling me all this.

342
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,400
I know
you're also investigating that old case.

343
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,330
You must've found have many leads.

344
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,270
Why don't we join forces

345
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,670
to solve the case sooner?

346
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,720
I'll think about it.

347
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,020
Think about it?

348
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,680
What's there to think about?

349
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,070
Without me telling you about the Ghost,

350
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,340
you will waste a lot of time

351
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,550
on a dead man!

352
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,010
I didn't force you to tell me anything.

353
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,080
Guan Cen...

354
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,550
This is really not cool.

355
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,830
Guan Cen,

356
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,940
I won't share my findings
with you anymore.

357
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,600
You just won't appreciate it.

358
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,700
Wait for me!

359
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,030
Soon, there will be a gathering

360
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,590
for Chongde University alumni.

361
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,750
Zhuo Chaoxiong
has cordially invited alumni

362
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,440
from all walks of life to his mansion.

363
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,840
All the prominent alumni

364
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,240
will attend the gathering.

365
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,680
Maybe many young elites will be there.

366
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,440
I'm talking to you.

367
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,310
How resilient of you, Dr. Si,

368
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,400
for getting over

369
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,660
your true love so soon.

370
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,530
You think I want to go out?

371
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,640
I'm doing all this for you, okay?

372
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,290
Right now, you can choose from two men.

373
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,790
Du Linfeng—you don't like him.

374
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,480
Guan Cen—

375
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,540
You don't like him.

376
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,900
He's bound to break your heart.

377
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,350
To turn the situation around,

378
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,810
you must meet someone new.

379
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,600
I refuse to meet anyone new.

380
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,070
How are you supposed to break out

381
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,480
of the current dangerous situation
if you don't meet someone new?

382
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,750
How am I in a dangerous situation now?

383
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,980
I'm doing perfectly fine.

384
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,550
It was you who met your true love

385
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,950
and got yourself in a dangerous situation.

386
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,930
What if you meet

387
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,920
a handsome and elegant gentleman

388
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,250
at the alumni gathering,

389
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,300
click with him right away,

390
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,880
and instantly fall in love
with each other?

391
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,750
You can't miss out

392
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,920
on any opportunity to find true love.

393
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,390
Anyway, I've already got

394
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,970
an admission ticket for you.

395
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,270
On the evening two days from now,

396
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,800
I look forward to seeing you
turn on the charm.

397
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,990
That was rude.

398
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,350
Whoever killed them must be brutal.

399
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,260
Yes.

400
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,120
They were all killed with sharp weapons

401
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,560
in a similar way,

402
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,590
indicating there was only one killer.

403
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,790
Have their identities been confirmed?

404
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,000
They went to prison under fake identities.

405
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,130
I haven't got any clues
about their real identities yet.

406
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:01,760
How about

407
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,150
I offer you a fresh take?

408
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,260
Dr. Ding.

409
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,440
Look,

410
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,830
there are thick calluses

411
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,590
on the fingers of all the three bodies.

412
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,030
There are strap marks on their shoulders,

413
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,920
and if you look carefully,
you'll find their shoulders uneven.

414
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,120
I think they used to do heavy labor work.

415
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,920
Besides, the skin on their feet is chapped
with rashes

416
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,850
and signs of repeated scratching,

417
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,270
all of which suggests

418
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,080
long-term exposure to seawater.

419
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,680
They probably had worked as loaders

420
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,510
at the docks.

421
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,590
That's a possibility.

422
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,510
Try pursuing that lead.

423
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,440
Perhaps you'll have new findings.

424
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,400
You're actually more perceptive
than I imagined, Dr. Ding,

425
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,200
for noticing such tiny details.

426
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,590
There's a lot you don't know.

427
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,640
But you'll learn.

428
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,050
You've arrived.

429
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,920
Place the items here.

430
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,160
Careful.

431
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,440
Sir,

432
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,960
who were those people passing by?

433
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,350
Mr. Zhuo rules this dock.

434
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,400
Don't you know that?

435
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,790
I...

436
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,020
Of course I know.

437
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,950
You mean Mr. Zhuo, Zhuo Chaoxiong.

438
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,790
We came here specifically for him.

439
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,050
Then why couldn't you recognize his men?

440
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,000
Sir,

441
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,590
the two of us are new here.

442
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,400
You've been here longer.

443
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,930
Please give us some advice.

444
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,930
You're new here?

445
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,100
Just like you, a lot of people here

446
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,440
are hoping to be noticed by Mr. Zhuo.

447
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,270
Yeah.

448
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,240
Sir,

449
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,060
this dork is packed with people.

450
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,030
Any ideas on how long it will take

451
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,150
for me and my fellow to be picked?

452
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,310
Just be patient.

453
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,600
Don't you see I'm still waiting?

454
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,070
Even you haven't been picked yet.

455
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,350
Our wait will be endless then, won't it?

456
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,160
Yes.

457
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
Not necessarily.

458
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,400
A few months ago, three young men

459
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,790
were selected and taken away.

460
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,790
They've never come back.

461
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:48,200
They must be living a comfortable life

462
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,680
of extravagance now.

463
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,710
You're still young.

464
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,430
You still stand a chance.
Keep up the good work!

465
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,660
Thank you, sir.

466
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,520
Thank you, sir.

467
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,310
I heard he was going off to a meeting.

468
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,800
At Mr. Zhuo's, as I heard.

469
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,400
Really?

470
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,540
Du Linfeng.

471
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,160
I envy him.

472
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,400
Let's go.

473
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,480
Won't it be nice if we are selected

474
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,750
one day just like he was?

475
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,350
Liu, Li.

476
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,030
I've noticed
that you often practice martial arts.

477
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,460
You've got your chance today—

478
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,990
follow these gentlemen's lead
and work hard.

479
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,750
Is there a way to sneak into that place?

480
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,510
I can have access to wherever I want
in Shanghai.

481
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,920
[Huang Residence, general practitioner
trained in Western medicine]

482
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,160
You remember the dosage for the patient

483
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,290
in Room No. 3, right?

484
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,410
Mr. Zhuo is here.

485
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,920
Greetings, Mr. Zhuo, Young Master Zhuo.

486
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,050
Is Dr. Huang around?

487
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:40,830
Yes.

488
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,060
I'll notify him of your arrival.

489
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,940
No need.

490
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,440
Father!

491
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,180
I'll wait for you here.

492
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,110
Okay.

493
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,970
Young Master Zhuo,

494
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,600
why not sit here for a while?

495
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,080
Don't worry about me.

496
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,360
Get back to your work.

497
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,600
Okay.

498
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,380
I'll go get my work done.
You take care of him.

499
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,410
Do you have any other discomfort?

500
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,440
Besides the ailments you mentioned,

501
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,900
I also have headaches
and ringing in my ears.

502
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,200
Anyway,

503
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,350
I just lose my temper easily.

504
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,390
Don't worry.

505
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,290
I'll prescribe some medicine for you.

506
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,590
But remember,

507
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,640
try not to get angry.

508
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,800
Anger damages the liver.

509
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,070
You must learn to manage your anger,

510
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,270
or there will be serious consequences.

511
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,710
So you do know the serious consequences
of getting me mad.

512
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,360
What was that incident
in the prison about?

513
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,990
Well,

514
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,200
it was indeed my fault.

515
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,530
I didn't handle it well.

516
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,310
Stop patronizing me.

517
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,590
Don't you think I know

518
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,200
what the Ghost is capable of?

519
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,200
Many of my men died there.

520
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,540
Could he have killed them alone?

521
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,960
By the time I got into the prison,

522
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,310
those people had disappeared.

523
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,350
This is still perplexing me now.

524
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,720
I really don't know what happened.

525
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,220
Since you can't give me an explanation,

526
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,770
you'll take the heat on this one,

527
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,140
when the higher-ups visit

528
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,200
tomorrow.

529
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,910
Go and get the materials

530
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:40,390
we need.

531
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,680
I'll pick you up later.

532
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,030
Okay.

533
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,000
Let's set out early to scout that place.

534
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,200
That way, if anything goes wrong,

535
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,480
we'll have an escape route.

536
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,210
Don't worry.

537
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,720
I've had the area
around the Zhuo Residence

538
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,720
scouted, and a map drawn

539
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,440
about it.

540
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,290
We can navigate with the map.

541
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,860
The challenge is how to gain entry.

542
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,480
The ball will be held
at the Zhuo Residence.

543
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,010
There's no way we can get in.

544
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,690
I'm going to walk right in, of course.

545
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,170
You have an idea?

546
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,370
I am the distinguished Mr. Du,

547
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,750
who's on the guest list.

548
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,110
But you are not.

549
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,160
So you'll have to stake out by the gate.

550
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,290
Let's split up then.

551
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,000
Okay.

552
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,880
Nobody knows

553
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,510
what this matter will lead to.

554
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,990
Don't tell Lu Yizhen about any of this.

555
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,640
Just keep it between you and me.

556
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,440
Sure thing.

557
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,720
Dong.

558
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,550
Have there been

559
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,480
new cases at our station recently?

560
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,290
No.

561
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,970
Then where was he off to?

562
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,680
How am I supposed to know?

563
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,550
Didn't he tell you?

564
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,830
Don't be so nosy.

565
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:00,960
He must have a reason

566
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,350
for keeping it secret.

567
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,550
Besides,

568
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,360
it's better that he's gone,
because we get to relax.

569
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,880
Xu Ruidong.

570
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:36,070
Do you really not know anything?

571
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,880
I...

572
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,030
I really don't know anything.

573
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,160
If I had got any information,

574
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,760
I would've told you already.

575
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,270
Right.

576
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,440
Even if he had told you about a problem,

577
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,040
you wouldn't be able to help.

578
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,400
Some files about the case we worked on

579
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,960
last time are still in the archives.

580
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,110
Could you go get them for me?

581
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,760
I can't carry

582
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,020
that many files alone.

583
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,680
I'm not going.

584
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,000
I just sat down for a rest.

585
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,480
Do it now,

586
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,740
or I'll tell Guan Cen you've slacked off.

587
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,760
I'll go with you.

588
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,800
Lu Yizhen,

589
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,220
you...

590
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,270
Zhuo Chaoxiong?

591
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,570
How come this name sounds so familiar?

592
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,770
The alumni gathering... Isn't it today?

593
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,480
Si Min,

594
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,440
I'll go to the alumni gathering
with you tonight.
