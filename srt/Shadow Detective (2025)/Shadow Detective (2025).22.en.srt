definitely won't mind either.

He's just

12
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,400
wound too tight—

13
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,130

and when there's none,
he goes out looking for them.

That's no kind of life.

To be honest,

79
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,920
I spend more time
at the police station than at home,

80
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,630

00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,480

107
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,470
you'd be available tonight?

Alright,

111
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,620
I wouldn't want to disobey
such a gracious invitation.

112
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,320
How can you imprison the kites?

113
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,480
Because I didn't want them to fly away,

114
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,700
I hid them all away.

115
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,410
By now, they probably can't fly anymore.

116
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,120
You made these?

117
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,120
And they were this well-made even
when you were a child?

118
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,760
I loved flying kites as a kid,

119
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,750
but I could never get them

120
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,080
airborne all by myself.

121
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,290
So I tried persuading Jingning
to join me,

122
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,720
but she didn't like running
around in the wild.

123
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,200
I thought I could tempt her

124
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,210
with pretty kites.

125
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,480
But the store-bought ones

126
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,880
weren't special enough.

127
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,330
Eventually, I decided to make my own.

128
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,360
That's how I met Mr. Wei,

129
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,650
and I went on to make a lot of kites
under his guidance.

130
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,360
This sachet looks just
like the one in your car.

131
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,420
Was it Jingning's?

132
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,880
Not exactly—

133
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,180
this one's flawed.

134
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,930
It was her birthday,

135
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,170
and I thought long and hard
about what to give her.

136
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,480
In the end, I decided

137
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,390
to give her a sachet
that I would make myself.

138
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,650
I knew she loved lotus,

139
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,540
so I embroidered one on it.

140
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,640
But my skills were
still lacking back then—

141
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,720
I ruined quite a few.

142
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,080
Either the stitching was off here,

143
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,810
or the pattern was messy there.

144
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,730
The one Jingning received

145
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,600
was the most perfect of them all.

146
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,080
She must have been
wearing it all the time.

147
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,240
I told her

148
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,000
that as long as she held that sachet,

149
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,330
no matter where she went

150
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,720
or what she became,

151
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,560
I would recognize her

152
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,850
and find her.

153
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,200
So from the moment she received it,

154
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,840
she wore it constantly,

155
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,040
never letting it leave her side.

156
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,720
Was she

157
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,430
wearing it that day?

158
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,950
Can I take a closer look?

159
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,440
I'll let you take a look,

160
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,100
but be careful—don't lose it.

161
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:30,810
Okay.

162
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,400
It's beautiful! Look at the edge here.

163
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,070
What's wrong?

164
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,040
I just remembered something.

165
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,840
Stop thinking about it.

166
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,000
I can't recall more.

167
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,790
I just can't.

168
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,790
You don't need
to keep forcing yourself, Lu Yizhen.

169
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,190
If I push a little harder,

170
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,480
if I remember just a bit more,

171
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,880
there might be more hope.

172
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,600
It's fine—don't worry about me.

173
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,730
Let me try a bit more.

174
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,960
Don't think about it anymore.

175
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,180
It's all over.

176
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,160
That was so long ago.

177
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:46,870
It's okay.

178
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,120

179

If you're still unwell,

180
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,270
we should go to the hospital.

181
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,530
I don't want to go to the hospital.

182
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,600
There's somewhere else
I'd rather go.

183
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,790
Are you sure you're okay?

184
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,630
I'm fine.

185
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,910
I just overdid it
with the thinking earlier,

186
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,440
so I have a bit of a headache.

187
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,120

00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,150
Ready now?

190
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:40,980
Wait,

191
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,200
let me apply a bit more.

192
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,000
Just worried I might accidentally
hurt you later.

193
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,670
Are you looking down on me?

194
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,360
It's not about looking down on you—

195
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,890
it's about knowing myself.

196
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,900
Well, today you'll get
to rediscover yourself.

197
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,530
Let's go.

198
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,910
Inspector Guan,

199
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,750
we're heading back first.
Don't forget to lock up.

200
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,200
Got it.

201
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:09,920
Let's go.

202
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,200
Come on, Lu Yizhen.

203
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,240
Didn't you want to see
what I'm really capable of?

204
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,310
You okay?

205
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,360
Lu Yizhen, you cheated!

206
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,840
All's fair in love and war.

207
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,790
Get away from me.

208
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,270
Don't choke me!

209
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,510
Go away!

210
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,030
I hate you!

211
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,280
Come on, Lu Yizhen.

212
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,260
Using that move again?

213
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,300
Lu Yizhen?

214
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,350
Let's call it a day, no more fighting.

215
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:22,910
No,

216
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,960
let's continue.

217
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,640
We have to keep going.

218
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,240
I recalled something just now,

219
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,790
but not everything yet.

220
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,290
You're the only one
who can help me.

221
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,300
Please, help me.

222
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,690
Take this seriously, Guan Cen.

223
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,360
Come on!

224
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:58,680
Yizhen.

225
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,000
Lu Yizhen,

226
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,240
are you okay?

227
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,270
Lu Yizhen,

228
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,440
are you all right?

229
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,630
Lu Yizhen.

230
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,510
I saw Jingning get hurt...

231
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,900
I'm so scared.

232
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,530
It's okay.

233
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,600
It's okay.

234
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,160
I'm here.

235
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,500
Don't be afraid, Lu Yizhen.

236
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,360
No matter what happens,

237
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,610
I'll always stand by your side.

238
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:31,920
Lu Yizhen.

239
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,900
It's alright.

240
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,000
It's alright.

241
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,840
It's okay. It's okay.

242
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,380
[Yong Kang]

243
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,960
Feeling better now?

244
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,050
I'll take you home in a bit.

245
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,470
Make sure you get
some proper rest tonight.

246
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,640
I don't want to be alone.

247
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,440
Stay with me, please.

248
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,560
When I saw you carrying
that old flint striker last time,

249
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,170
I was really surprised.

250
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,730
Who carries something like that around?

251
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
It's just a habit.

252
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,180
When Jingning was little,

253
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,510
our family often went
on outings together.

254
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,540
But she was afraid of the dark,

255
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,830
so we'd always

256
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,770
light a bonfire nearby.

257
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,210
Later, after Jingning...

258
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,550
My mother was heartbroken

259
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,760
and shut herself indoors.

260
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,240
My father couldn't bear staying
in this place full of memories

261
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,500
and left for Hong Kong.

262
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,800
I moved out and lived alone.

263
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,530
After that, our family
rarely saw each other,

264
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,810
and no one ever brought up outings again.

265
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,400
But I kept the habit.

266
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,200
My family always stayed together,

267
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,750
but we never went on outings.

268
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,010
My parents thought

269
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,960
I'd get hurt whenever I went out,

270
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,330
so they never let me leave the house.

271
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,200
They finally agreed to let me
go out with Si Min once,

272
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,130
and… well, you know what happened.

273
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,790
After that,

274
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,760
they watched me even more closely—

275
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,720
never let me out of their sight

276
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,960
for a second.

277
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,940
I didn't really have friends either.

278
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,830
Looking back now,

279
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,810
those years were incredibly lonely.

280
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,150
Do you still feel lonely now?

281
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,640
Now I have you—

282
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,250
how could I be lonely?

283
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,720
I'm truly

284
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,040
content.

285
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,960
This is the life
I've always wanted:

286
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,790
doing work I love,

287
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,400
having friends around,

288
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,200
and still learning new things.

289
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,820
See, I even get to learn

290
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,970
little forensic tricks from Dr. Ding.

291
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,960
When I first joined the police station,

292
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,110
I actually thought you and Dr. Ding

293
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,750
had some kind of romantic history.

294
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,610
I never expected

295
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,210
she'd try to set me up with...

296
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,480
With who?

297
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:12,960
With you.

298
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,720
Aren't you cold?

299
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:23,820
I'm not cold.

300
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,260
What about you?

301
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,600
Do you feel lonely?

302
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,160
I've never really thought about it.

303
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,030
I used to live

304
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,350
for one purpose.

305
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,920
I thought

306
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,040
there were only two possible endings
for my life:

307
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,900
if Jingning was alive,

308
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,130
I'd spend it searching for her;

309
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,590
if she was dead,

310
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,330
I saw no reason to keep living.

311
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,310
But now, I have a new purpose.

312
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,310
Don't talk about living or dying—

313
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,520
please don't say things like that.

314
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,360
You have to live well.

315
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,680
Run!

316
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,410
Hurry! Hurry!

317
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,590
What's wrong?

318
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,630
Lu Yizhen.

319
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:05,960
Here.

320
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,330
Take it.

321
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,790
Ghost,

322
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,970
you're on delivery duty today.

323
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,810
But it's my day off.

324
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,410
The guy's sick.

325
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,000
Boss said you're
to deliver the kids to Mr. Jin.

326
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,640
Now hurry.

327
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,720
Search them

328
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,690
and make them change clothes
before shipping.

329
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,510
This is the place!

330
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,170
After them!

331
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,110
Stop! Don't move! Stop right there!

332
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,350
Halt!

333
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,510
Freeze!

334
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,350
Wake up.

335
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,590
Wake up.

336
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,590
Come on,

337
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,650
open your eyes.

338
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,830
Wake up.

339
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,920
Nightmare?

340
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,060
I remember now.

341
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,810
I remember everything.

342
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,450
You're the one who saved me.

343
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,020
You remember that?

344
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,510
I also recalled

345
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,320
something about Jingning.

346
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,240
Mr. Jin.

347
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,640
Mr. Jin?

348
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,400
Mr. Jin.

349
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,510
So you're saying

350
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,200
the deceased Bao Yiming in prison

351
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,270
was likely murdered by Tang Jiahao.

352
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,450
But he couldn't

353
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,750
have pulled this off alone—

354
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,010
there must be someone behind the scenes.

355
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,640
Can you remember

356
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,600
anyone else?

357
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,500
Perhaps Gu Sinian?

358
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,640
I don't recall anything

359
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,750
about Gu Sinian.

360
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,200
Jingning and I were almost out

361
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,800
when Tang Jiahao showed up.

362
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
He took Jingning,

363
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,510
and I was

364
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,510
saved by Bao Yiming—Ghost.

365
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,380
Why would he save you?

366
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,610
"Save" might not be the right word.

367
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,550
I think he was after

368
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,010
the note hidden in my shoe.

369
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,080
You mean it belonged to him?

370
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,170
Do you remember what it was?

371
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,000
I never opened it,

372
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,590
but I suspect

373
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,920
it had something to do
with Skylark Company.

374
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,120
Why else would he risk hiding it with me?

375
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,720
Then we'll have to wait for Ding Eryi

376
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,520
to solve that part of the puzzle.

377
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,910
What about Jingning?

378
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,890
Jingning and I were so close to escaping,

379
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,040
but Tang Jiahao showed up too quickly.

380
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,840
There's too much information at once—

381
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,240
I need to sort through it.

382
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,830
If your memories

383
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,680
don't include Gu Sinian,

384
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,130
where do we even start?

385
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,070
There's one name

386
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,830
that might be connected
to Jingning's whereabouts.

387
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,680
What's the name?

388
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,400
Mr. Jin.

389
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,270
Mr. Jin...

390
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,450
That sounds really familiar.

391
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,920
Both you and Guan Cen

392
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,210
must be struggling,

393
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,300
suddenly remembering everything.

394
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,200
To be honest,

395
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,130
I don't know what I'm supposed
to feel when I face him.

396
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,080
Jingning is still missing,

397
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,920
yet I managed to escape.

398
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,920
I'll pull

399
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,780
all missing persons cases

400
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,300
and population records

401
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,720
from the Intelligence Department
as soon as possible.

402
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,480
But

403
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,830
it's a lot of data—

404
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,100
a thorough review will take time.

405
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,100
I understand.

406
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,720
I'm counting on you.

407
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,440
I'll also keep digging

408
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,680
into this "Mr. Jin" lead

409
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,400
and update you the moment I find anything.

410
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:29,930
Alright.

411
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,760
Stay close to him these days.

412
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,350
He may seem tough,

413
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,750
but he's fragile inside.

414
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,960
Right now, he needs you.

415
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,730
I'm different, though—

416
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,760
I've been through the wringer.

417
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,040
I'm hardened now.

418
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,550
And of course,

419
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,450
you gave the crank a few turns.

420
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,510
Alright, you should get going now.

421
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,310
I'm off, then.

422
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,400
All these years,

423
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,550
I've braced

424
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,750
for the worst,

425
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,720
over and over.

426
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,220
Now it feels strange—

427
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,990
I thought I could endure it,

428
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,030
but I couldn't.

429
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,070
There's only

430
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,230
a quiet relief,

431
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,320
as if whatever the outcome,

432
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,250
I can finally make peace with it.

433
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,210
I understand.

434
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,070
I can't stop thinking about

435
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,030
Jingning back then, holding that sachet,

436
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,400
believing I'd come for her...

437
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,260
and I never did.

438
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,490
How helpless she must have felt.

439
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,070
I'm sorry.

440
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,710
You don't need to apologize.

441
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,960
You lived through it—

442
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,240
if anyone should be sorry, it's me.

443
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,480
If I hadn't lost my memory,

444
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,650
you wouldn't have suffered
all these years.

445
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,640
Maybe not remembering
was a kindness.

446
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,310
It was precisely because you forgot

447
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:56,780
that you granted me

448
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,210
an oasis that was never there.

449
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,110
Besides,

450
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,210
you survived the nightmare—

451
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,450
if you remembered everything,

452
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,680
you'd have

453
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,750
relived that pain again and again.

454
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,110
I was wrong before,

455
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,450
trying to trade your suffering

456
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,000
for clues about Jingning.

457
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,960
But I soon realized...

458
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,760
that wasn't what I truly wanted.

459
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,350
You will never have to endure

460
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,750
the pain of losing someone
like that again.

461
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,750
I promise you.

462
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,060
Director Wang.

463
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,010
You're here.

464
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,850
Perfect timing—

465
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,540
I've just made some progress.

466
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,180
Where's Dr. Ding?

467
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,040
I don't see her.

468
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,350
She's not in today—
it's her day off.

469
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,750
Do you need her for something?

470
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,150
No, no, I was just asking.

471
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,900
You're truly remarkable.

472
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,790
To restore it to this state

473
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,050
in such a short time...

474
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,640
It all comes down to experience
accumulated over the years.

475
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,070
I've handled evidence

476
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,060
in even worse condition before.

477
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,070
Thank you for your efforts,
Director Wang.

478
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,800
Don't mention it—it's my duty.

479
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,970
It's just... the writing here
is no longer legible.

480
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:01,960
True.

481
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:02,920
But

482
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,590
that doesn't mean it's impossible

483
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,480
to decipher.

484
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,960
I've started reconstructing the characters
by their stroke traces—

485
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,110
some are obvious

486
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,720
at a glance,

487
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,180
while others require educated guesses.

488
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,440
Give me a little more time.

489
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,840
I'll have it sorted soon.

490
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,220
Thank you for your hard work.

491
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,260
I've found the "Mr. Jin"
you've been looking into.

492
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,510
Back when we were young,

493
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,440
he was already

494
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,110
a prominent figure in Shanghai—

495
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,590
involved in shady dealings,

496
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,720
connected on both sides of the law,

497
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,920
and thriving in the city's underworld.

498
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,680
Then how come

499
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,080
we've never heard of him?

500
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,500
Because he nearly got arrested years ago.

501
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,110
No one knew exactly
what he was involved in,

502
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,780
but shortly after his arrest,

503
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,720
he was released

504
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,450
and vanished without a trace.

505
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,510
If he vanished,

506
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,240
how are we supposed to find him?

507
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,160
You'd never guess—

508
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,270
there's actually someone close to us

509
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,110
who had dealings with him back then.

510
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,640
Who?

511
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,920
Director Huo.

512
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,590
He was the one
who arrested Mr. Jin back then.
