Doctor,

00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,880
something's wrong with the medicine
I got last time.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,680
My stomach hurts after I take it.

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,000
Ghost.

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,160
Long time no see.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,190
I just have an upset stomach.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,820
Ghost,

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,220
today,

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,610
even if you manage to leave this room,

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,900
I guarantee you won't be able to
get out of this prison.

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,170
The higher-ups won't let you off the hook.

12
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,240
And that Crazy Hound, Tang Jiahao,

13
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,840
will come for you too.

[Episode 9]

17
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,680
After all this trouble,

18
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,220
you couldn't even find a suspect!

19
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,610
Are you kidding?

Director Huo,

21
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,110
please give me some more time.

22
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,410
I promise
I'll bring the murderer to justice.

23
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,210
Haven't I given you enough time?

24
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,930
You two inspectors are leading

25
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,220
two police stations' officers
on this one case.

26
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,880
How much more time do you need?

27
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,490
Director Huo.

28
00:02:59,010 --> 00:02:59,940
Hello, Linfeng.

29
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,810
T-To what do I owe this visit?

30
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,740
Director Huo,

31
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,260
I came specifically
to thank Inspector Zhu.

32
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,090
I'm grateful to Inspector Zhu
for assigning

33
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,650
two police stations' officers to help us

34
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,450
catch some suspects yesterday.

35
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,930
I'm glad you got your suspects.

36
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,190
They're obligated... to help you.

37
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,720
By the way, Inspector Zhu,

38
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,790
let me know if you ever need anything.

39
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,840
The Intelligence Department
will be happy to help.

40
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,050
Alright. I'll leave you to it.

41
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,310
I'm going back to interrogate suspects.

42
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,890
How generous of you,

43
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,800

to the brass.

I didn't mean to, Mrs. Li.

forced his way in to meet you.

Inspector Guan,

104
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,190
what brings you to my establishment?

105
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,120
On the nights
of the 3rd and 5th of this month,

106
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,450
where was your husband?

107
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:57,920
Him?

108
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,950
He was at home.

109
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:01,750
Really?

110
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,950
He's been coming home
every day this month,

111
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,600
so I remember it clearly.

112
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,600
Then where was he last night?

113
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,310
Last night?

114
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,840
H-He was also at home last night.

115
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,660
But the staff

116
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,550
at Taihua Restaurant told me

117
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,140
that their boss spent last night
doing the accounts

118
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,200
at the restaurant.

119
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,870
Well, I must've remembered it wrong—

120
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,320
I've been swamped with people lately.

121
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,600
He was at home the night before,

122
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,440
and at the restaurant last night.

123
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,500
Actually, I never spoke to the staff.

124
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,080
And your husband
wasn't at Taihua Restaurant last night.

125
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,630
Instead, he went out with friends
to carouse and screw around.

126
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,409
Seriously, what's the matter with you?

127
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,910
You've been fishing for information.

128
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,840
What is it that you're trying to do?

129
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,030
Stop covering up for him.

130
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,240
If he really is the murderer,

131
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,130
then you're in serious danger now.

132
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,290
Inspector Guan,

133
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,790
you see, I have many customers here.

134
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,080
You also have a lot of cases to work on.

135
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,600
Just go attend to your business, alright?

136
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,360
If you do know something,

137
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,400
you should definitely tell me.

138
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,960
Or there will be another murder
at Taihua Restaurant.

139
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,450
Pour me a drink.
What are you standing there for?

140
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,290
Don't be so nervous. Slow down.

141
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,390
Why the rush?

142
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,770
No one else is around.

143
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,870
Didn't you go to West Taihua Restaurant?

144
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,070
What brings you here?

145
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,760
Get out!

146
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,800
Come back!

147
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,280
Sit!

148
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:55,750
Yes.

149
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,410
Sit!

150
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,390
Where were you last night?

151
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,550
Where else could I have gone?

152
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,440
I was here the entire night.

153
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,070
How dare you lie?

154
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,790
Lie?

155
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,150
I...

156
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,750
What am I lying about?

157
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,630
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

158
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,490
You weren't home
on the first few days of this month.

159
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,120
Where on earth did you go?

160
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,810
Where else could I have possibly gone?

161
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,430
Did you kill those two people?

162
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,200
Are you crazy?

163
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,780
You're the one who's crazy!

164
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,030
If it weren't for this restaurant,

165
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,670
you think I'd care
whether you live or die?

166
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,030
No, I...

167
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,320
Without me,

168
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,270
you would've been arrested long ago!

169
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,360
P-Please don't be mad.

170
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,080
I'm just afraid that my family business

171
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,600
will be ruined by you!

172
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,670
Don't be mad. Please!

173
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,320
You bastard.

174
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,790
Going out for drinks every day!

175
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,030
Calm down. This is all my fault.

176
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,790
How dare you...

177
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,390
I'm sorry.

178
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,790
How dare you go out to drink every day,
huh?

179
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,270
Do you know where he was off to?

180
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:34,680
Yes.

181
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,940
Here's what you do.

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,150
Go to the Police Station
to inform Inspector Guan of this.

183
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,600
Got it.

184
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,440
Okay, I'll arrange it.

185
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,370

Inspector Zhu.

00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,850
Inspector Guan,
you're not playing by the rules.

188
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,940
You're keeping a lead to yourself.

189
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,390
Are you planning to take all the credit
after solving the case?

190
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,870
Inspector Zhu,
you're taking it the wrong way.

191
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,960
The information I got
hasn't been verified yet,

192
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,380
so I haven't reported it to you.

193
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,480
Have you forgotten

194
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,110
who's in charge of this case?

195
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,480
You must report any leads

196
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,600
you have to me first.

197
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,880
Of course I haven't forgotten it.

198
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,550
Inspector Zhu, you are

199
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,110
more than welcome

200
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,170
to lead us officers

201
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,460
to verify

202
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,480
the accuracy of this information.

203
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,750
Okay.

204
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,080
Let's go.

205
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,460
Sen.

206
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,260
Tell Dong to proceed as planned.

207
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,460
Let me know if any problems come up.

208
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,030
Yes.

209
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,670
The inspector only told us to follow her

210
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,670
and nothing else?

211
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,400
Nothing else.

212
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,560
He only asked us
to keep her within our sights.

213
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,720
What's he up to?

214
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,180
This is all so mysterious.

215
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,750
Yeah.

216
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,720
What do you think is going through
the inspector's mind every day?

217
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,240
How strange.

218
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,540
Hey, I'm talking to you.

219
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,270
I'm asking what's on the inspector's mind.

220
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:15,700
Wait.

221
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,200
Do you see her? Where is she?

222
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,600
Wasn't she over there just now?

223
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,140
Where has she gone?

224
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,500
I'll look for her.
You go back to report this.

225
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,390
Be careful!

226
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,080
What are you doing?

227
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,840
Where are you from?

228
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,240
I was just sleeping with a waitress.

229
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,900
Do you have to point guns at me?

230
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,270
Guan, Zhu,

231
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,670
I know you guys!

232
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,750
Messing with me, aren't you?

233
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,910
Listen up,

234
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,150
I have connections with big shots.

235
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,080
I'll have you pay for this!

236
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,020
You...

237
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,670
How skillful.

238
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,010
You're on your knees again...

239
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,200
I'm sorry.

240
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,110
Inspector Guan,

241
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,960
you call this a lead?

242
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,940
Inspector Zhu,

243
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,360
I already told you

244
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,590
what I got was unverified information.

245
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,530
Can't I satisfy you at home?

246
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,910
Clean up

247
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,790
this mess yourself, Inspector Guan.

248
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,550
You can!

249
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,790
Then why did you...

250
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,120
She seduced me!

251
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,030
Mr. Li, I didn't! He took the initiative!

252
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,390
I-I just work here!

253
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,680
Save it!

254
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,120
You said you were seduced every time!

255
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,100
What an insult to my intelligence.

256
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,280
If I had known this, I wouldn't have...

257
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,630
This is so embarrassing!

258
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,200
I'm sorry.

259
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,790
Enough!

260
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,040
Button up your shirt!

261
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,220
She was just a restaurant staffer.

262
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,750
How could she afford
such a fine jade bracelet?

263
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,670
Look at this.

264
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,570
Another jade bracelet.

265
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,240
Do you know how much I love my wife?

266
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,960
She's got a strange illness.

267
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,880
Though she's only 30 years old,

268
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,270
she looks like an 80-year-old.

269
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,130
She has lost all her hair.

270
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,200
She used to

271
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,670
love her hair more than anything.

272
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,430
I just want her to have long hair again,

273
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,680
so she won't be upset anymore.

274
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,510
You think you really love your wife?

275
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,000
You wouldn't do any of this
if you truly loved her.

276
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,410
You just envy those business owners

277
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:26,290
for having the means
to hire companionship.

278
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,830
Why can they always get the women
they like?

279
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,720
Why do I have to be stuck with

280
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,880
a sick woman?

281
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,670
My wife loves long black hair like this.

282
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,590
Stop...

283
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,720
Lu Yizhen!

284
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,120
Freeze!

285
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,110
Take him away!

286
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,640
Let go of me!

287
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,720
Go.

288
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,720
Sit here for a while.

289
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,660
Inspector.

290
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,800
Get that civilian
to the hospital right away.

291
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,720
Yes.

292
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,110
How did you know

293
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,570
that girl could be
the killer's next target?

294
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,170
Actually, I was just taking a chance.

295
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,270
Sir, you're not allowed in.

296
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,530
You're not allowed in!

297
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,310
So, I guessed

298
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,830
he gave that jade bracelet away.

299
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,260
Inspector Zhu.

300
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,640
I had an police officer notify them.

301
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,060
Inspector Zhu.

302
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,370
The criminal has been arrested.

303
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,500
You can take him back

304
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,320
and report to Director Huo.

305
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,920
Just because you caught the murderer

306
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,000
doesn't mean
you get to do as you please.

307
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,730
How did that civilian get shot?

308
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,740
When I arrived,

309
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,430
the situation was tense.

310
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,520
I had no choice but to fire my gun.

311
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,830
Seems like you're taking

312
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,230
responsibility for that, Inspector Guan.

313
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,010
Then I'll have to honestly
report what happened

314
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,290
to Director Huo.

315
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,790
I can bear the consequences myself.

316
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,250
You didn't have to do that.

317
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,680
When I got here,

318
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,750
you didn't respond when I called you.

319
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,950
Do you remember that?

320
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,950
I was injected with a knock-out drug.

321
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,420
Then I fell onto the ground.

322
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,890
When I was looking at Liu Taifu's back
as he attempted to hurt that girl,

323
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,320
I suddenly recalled...

324
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,470
Recalled what?

325
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,380
Nothing at all.

326
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,330
You can't remember anything.

327
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,360
How do you take responsibility
for your actions?

328
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,210
Does it hurt?

329
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,070
It's nothing.

330
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,290
Just a minor injury.

331
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,760
Lu Yizhen.

332
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,750
From now on, no matter what happens,

333
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,510
let me know

334
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,570
if any problems come up.

335
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,640
The accidental shooting on a civilian

336
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,870
was not Guan Cen's fault at all.

337
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,530
It was mine.

338
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,980
This matter has already been handed over
to the British.

339
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,040
I don't get to decide the punishment.

340
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,310
I made that mistake.

341
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,910
I can bear the consequences.

342
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
Suspending Guan Cen is equal to

343
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,550
shutting down the entire police station.

344
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,350
Enough.

345
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,510
Do you know how complicated this is?

346
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,450
Are you aware of the interests at stake?

347
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,480
Listen,

348
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,510
even if Guan Cen wasn't involved
or didn't shoot a civilian,

349
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,720
he'd still be suspended for other reasons.

350
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,400
This is not up to you,

351
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,640
a tiny officer.

352
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,200
Director Huo...

353
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,240
Cut it out!

354
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,030
I think Guan Cen is being too nice to you.

355
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,400
He insisted on transferring you
to the Police Station,

356
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,030
saying...

357
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,160
that you showed

358
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,670
great potential and talent,

359
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,960
and that it would be a waste
to leave you in Laozha.

360
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,840
Is this what you're really like,
reckless and impatient?

361
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,230
I'm telling you,

362
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,920
though Guan Cen appears arrogant,

363
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,550
proud, and distant,

364
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,160
he's actually very perceptive

365
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,620
and observant about everything around him!

366
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,170
Regarding this matter,

367
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,000
he must have his reasons for thinking

368
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,860
this is the right way to handle it.

369
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,410
Besides,

370
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,550
this case is closed now.

371
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,640
Just let him take a few days' break.

372
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,270
I'll also give you a couple of days off.

373
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,400
Go get some rest too.

374
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,070
What are you staring at?

375
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,720
He's just temporarily suspended.

376
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,200
Can't you believe me,

377
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,330
and that I'll properly deal with this?

378
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,160
Get out!

379
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:35,670
How stubborn.

380
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,190
[Shanghai Police Station]

381
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,690
A big case was finally solved.

382
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,110
Inspector Guan deserves some credit
for his hard work.

383
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,400
Isn't suspension too severe
a punishment for him?

384
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,790
Inspector Guan has never made a mistake
during arrests.

385
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,200
Why would his gun accidentally go off
this time?

386
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,960
Worse still, a passerby was shot.

387
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,590
Lu Yizhen,

388
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,590
only you were with the inspector that day.

389
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,920
What exactly happened?

390
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,350
Say something. I...

391
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,200
Who would've thought
the gun would misfire?

392
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,070
Besides,
that civilian wasn't severely injured.

393
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:17,240
He has already written a letter
of forgiveness to Director Huo.

394
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,310
Yizhen was knocked out
by an injection that day.

395
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:22,840
The inspector only meant to help his team,
including us and her.

396
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,620
Inspector.

397
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,100
-Inspector.
-Inspector.

398
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,080
It's okay.

399
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,320
I was thinking of taking a few days off
anyway.

400
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,590
Just go home.

401
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,360
I'll practice a bit longer.

402
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,900
You should leave now.

403
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,750
You need to go to work
at the police station tomorrow.

404
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,350
I'll practice a little more.

405
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,400
I'm fine.

406
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,240
Off you go.

407
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,330
Guan Cen.

408
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,510
I'll be waiting for your return.

409
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,110
Okay.

410
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,590
You're still in the mood for coffee?

411
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,070
Why wouldn't I be?

412
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,680
Do you know Guan Cen has been suspended?

413
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,350
Yes, I do.

414
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,280
Then why are you still here?

415
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,580
Where else am I supposed to be?

416
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:09,750
Well,

417
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,810
as his good friend,

418
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,650
shouldn't you go comfort him?

419
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,550
What am I going to say?

420
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,550
"Don't be upset"?

421
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,880
"You did nothing wrong to deserve
such harsh punishment"?

422
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,880
You think he'd like to hear all that?

423
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,880
You and I both know

424
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,900
he's not that kind of person.

425
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,300
He never acts on impulse.

426
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,720
So, the truth of this matter

427
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,450
may not be what we've been told.

428
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,010
Alright. I'm leaving.

429
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,050
Put whatever you drink on my tab.

430
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,420
What kind of person is that?

431
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,890
How did it go?

432
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,310
Did you recall more memories?

433
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,080
Perhaps the course of arresting Liu Taifu

434
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,600
triggered some of your memories.

435
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,240
But I'm afraid it may be difficult

436
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,600
for you to recover more.

437
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,880
What exactly happened

438
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,920
that makes you so eager

439
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,180
to get back those memories from the past?

440
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,110
Guan Cen has never looked down on me.

441
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,000
On the contrary,

442
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,600
he recognizes my abilities
in front of others.

443
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,270
But I...

444
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,250
I let him take responsibility

445
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,960
for a mistake I made.

446
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,880
You're feeing guilty

447
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,930
but powerless to make amends.

448
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,420
So, you've decided to jog your memories
about the past

449
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,580
as a way to compensate Guan Cen.

450
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,890
That incident from years ago
still preys on his mind.

451
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,070
I don't think

452
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,700
a few fragments of memories can help.

453
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,490
So, I'd like to try my best to recall
as many things as possible.

454
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,310
I hope to connect these fragments

455
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,280
and turn them into useful leads.

456
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,300
I need to point out one more thing.

457
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,560
The memories you've recovered

458
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,510
indicate that what's going to happen

459
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,720
will take a turn for the worse.

460
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,920
You're very worried.

461
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,400
You fear that something bad
may happen to Guan Jingning

462
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,480
because of you.

463
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,890
I understand how you must feel.

464
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,170
But don't rush anything.

465
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,430
Okay, no rush.

466
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,410
Dr. Gu,

467
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,750
today,

468
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:04,370
I felt the power
of teamwork for the first time.

469
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,330
In addition to Guan Cen,

470
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,030
Dong would also

471
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,160
defend me and stand up for me

472
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,910
in front of others.

473
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:15,640
In the past,

474
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,120
I always felt like I was fighting alone.

475
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,090
But now it has changed.

476
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,480
That's good.

477
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,350
You're feeling less adrift.

478
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,110
Perhaps the Police Station can help you

479
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,240
find the long lost sense of belonging.

480
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,240
Very good.
