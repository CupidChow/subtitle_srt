Stop!

00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,560
Stop!

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,910
Split up.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,550
Okay.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,190
Hurry, guys! You stop there!

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,440
Stop! Don't run!

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,870
Stop! Don't run!

Stop!

10
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:22,830
Stop!

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:23,720
This way!

12
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,490
Stop!

[Episode 10]

15
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,020
Inspector,

16
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,560
I...

17
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,870
There you are.

18
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,590
I placed the files on top of that cabinet.

19
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,450
Don't forget to remind Dong of it.

20
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,600
I drew these when I was bored.

21
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,590
I'll help you find her.

22
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,360
Thank you.

23
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,590
Lu Yizhen,

24
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,560
I brought you a salve.

25
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,190
Use it after washing your face,

26
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,320
and then wipe it off.

27
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,050
There's another medicine.

28
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,610
Apply it on your wounds with cotton swabs.

29
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,750
Are you alright?

30
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:54,970
I'm alright.

31
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,280
Listen,

32
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,120
don't neglect those wounds of yours.

33
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,280
They'll leave scars
if not treated properly.

34
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,520
I do pay attention to them.

35
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,150
I do.

36
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,540
There could be scars. I heard you.

37
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,750
Lu Yizhen.

38
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,079
Lu Yizhen, you seem a bit off.

39
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,279
That's not true.

40
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,230
Let me ask you.

41
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,120
How are things between you and Guan Cen?

42
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,020
He and I were investigating
a case together.

43
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,750
Then I made a mistake.

44
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,070
I should've been the one to be punished.

45
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,800
But instead,

46
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,380
he took the fall for me.

47
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,680
That's not much of a big deal, is it?

48
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,630
He should do that,
since he's your superior.

49
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,710
You've been taken advantage of before.

50
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,830
You've already fallen into
a trap of his design once.

51
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,920
Isn't it enough?

52
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:58,990
It's not that.

53
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,680
I think...

54
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,480
this time, he is really not using me.

55
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,750
And there were indeed
misunderstandings between us in the past.

56
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,240
He's tricking you by harming himself.

57
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,040
Aren't you aware of that tactic?

58
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,160
Lu Yizhen,

59
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,390
you have to be extra careful
around this guy.

60
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,800
He is unusually crafty.

61
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,160
Fine. He's conniving.

62
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,780
Can we stop talking about him?

63
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,310
Recently, I've recalled

64
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,450
some things about Guan Jingning.

65
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,110
Do you think I should tell him?

66
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,060
What have you recalled?

67
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,950
Just some fragmented memories.

68
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,570
I remember she was stabbed.

69
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,840
There was a lot of blood.

70
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,110
Well,

71
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,159
no consecutive segments at all?

72
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,650
Just drop it.

73
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,240
Lu Yizhen,

74
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,720
first,

75
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,990
this incident happened many years ago.

76
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,070
The memories you've recovered,

77
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,630
be they about good or bad things,

78
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,390
may not accurately reflect the facts.

79
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,980
Second,

80
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,740
even if what you've recalled
is a good thing,

81
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,480
upon hearing it,

82
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,270
Guan Cen will find some hope at most.

83
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,630
But what if it's a bad thing?

84
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,560
He'll only feel worse
when he learns about it, right?

85
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,180
Aren't you going to invite me in?

86
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,530
Is that even necessary?

87
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,810
What kind of attitude is this?

88
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,270
When you asked me to buy you magazines,

89
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,340
you weren't like this at all.

90
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,860
I'm extremely busy every day.

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,680
In most cases where you're busy,

92
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,310
you're likely being troubled by an ex,

93
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,120
or dealing with an ex who...

94
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,680
Stop it.

95
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,159
Cut it out now.

96
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,980
When we were in school,

97
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,630
you didn't seem to enjoy reading.

98
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,550
How come you never

99
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,480
miss an issue of this magazine now?

100
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,160
What?

101
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,430
Do I need to tell you
everything about my life?

102
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,690
Guan, how heartless of you to say that.

103
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,280
As your good friend,
shouldn't I show you some care?

104
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,520
In childhood,

105
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,920
who took you in

106
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,380
when your dad beat you up?

107
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,870
Who lent you a suit

108
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,950
for your first date?

109
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,800
Also, when you first started working
in the Police Station

110
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,680
and got in trouble, who stood up for you?

111
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,540
How can take this tone with me now?

112
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,040
Where were you when I took the blame

113
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,240
for your wrongdoing?

114
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,360
Didn't you do something
that your dad is still unaware of?

115
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,120
Hey, Guan, stop it.

116
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,000
Well, it's getting late.

117
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,420
I-I should leave now.

118
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,190
It seems...

119
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,600
the suspension hasn't affected you much.

120
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,330
Don't forget to close the door.

[The Detective's Casebook]

122
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,490
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

123
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,800
I am Juggernaut.

124
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,870
In terms of experience,

125
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,800
everyone here could be my teacher.

126
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,920
I'm shy of presenting my ideas in front of

127
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,270
these many seasoned writers.

128
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,240
But I do have a few words to say.

129
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,600
Thanks to your efforts, detective fiction

130
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,920
has been brought to the current height.

131
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,600
Even I, a layman, gradually

132
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,270
took a liking to writing

133
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,120
and courageously made a start.

134
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,000
But indeed,

135
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,830
the development of detective fiction

136
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,370
is showing signs of stagnation.

137
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,490
Readers are no longer
as enthusiastic as before.

138
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,580
They accept all the works,

139
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,980
regardless of quality.

140
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:37,840
We are

141
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,350
thus required to strive for excellence,

142
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,309
hone our skills,

143
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,150
and carve out our own path
among the many genres

144
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,240
of literary works.

145
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,120
I know it is widely assumed

146
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,080
that the world of defective fiction
belongs to males,

147
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,870
and that females are emotional

148
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,870
and weak in logic.

149
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,870
But I think my presence

150
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,480
has proven it to be a fallacy.

151
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,910
Genders don't matter
when it comes to writing.

152
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,060
Competence is demonstrated by fine works.

153
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,060
Bravo, well said.

154
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,240
I've always been curious

155
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,270
about one thing.

156
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,480
What is it?

157
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,790
The cases in your novel
are rich in detail.

158
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,320
Ours are no match for yours.

159
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,410
Have you been engaged in criminal cases
in reality?

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,660
That's private information.

161
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,200
Sir, I don't think we've met. Who are you?

162
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,960
I am...

163
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,030
a reader.

164
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,000
I read about this seminar in a magazine

165
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,200
and thought it was open to the public.

166
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,720
So, I came specifically to hear
your perspectives as writers.

167
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,120
I hope I'm not intruding.

168
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,480
So you are a reader.

169
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,480
It's fine.

170
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,950
We should also hear readers' opinions.

171
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,810
May I have your name?

172
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,480
Gu Shuhe.

173
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,480
Never heard of him.

174
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,320
Is this a coincidence or...

175
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,840
Thank you for accepting our interview.

176
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,550
Thank you.

177
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,080
Goodbye.

178
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,580
I just read about this event

179
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,040
in a magazine,

180
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,870
so I thought I'd come by.

181
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,360
Just a coincidence, huh?

182
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,790
You happened to have bought a magazine

183
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,520
that happened to be this issue,

184
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,570
in which you happened to read about
this seminar?

185
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,750
Exactly.

186
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,840
Have you been stalking me, Inspector Guan?

187
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,240
Me stalking you?

188
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,240
Why else would you care so much
about a subordinate's personal life?

189
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,080
How am I paying attention
to your personal life?

190
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,480
Don't flatter yourself.

191
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,790
I should give Dong and others
a reminder when I get back to work.

192
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,050
A reminder about what?

193
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,270
That they should be careful,

194
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,670
because the great Inspector Guan

195
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,600
may stalk someone at random times.

196
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,210
-Dad, I’m hungry.
-Why the hurry?

197
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,320
Xiaomin, be good. Just wait a moment.

198
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,270
When these roly-poly toys are sold,

199
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,930
I'll buy you tasty food, okay?

200
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,990
Miss, sir, why not buy a roly-poly toy?

201
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,600
Look, I made these myself.

202
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,240
See the colors and designs?

203
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,360
You can't find these anywhere else.

204
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,550
W-Why not show it to your husband, miss?

205
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,390
You two make a cute couple.

206
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,790
We're actually not...

207
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,120
Quickly take your pick.

208
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,970
Dad, I'm hungry.

209
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,550
Be good, Xiaomin.
Just wait a moment, okay?

210
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,030
This lady here just bought a sweet potato.

211
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,840
You may eat it.

212
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,330
Sir,

213
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,870
no need for this.

214
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,240
It's okay.

215
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,820
Your child is so adorable.

216
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,530
Thank the gentleman and lady now.

217
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,260
Thank you, sir, miss.

218
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,170
Come on, eat up.

[Wei's Kite Shop]

220
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,050
That little girl must be very happy today.

221
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,080
You've given her food.

222
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,410
Of course she's happy.

223
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,200
What to do with these?

224
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,750
You told me to pick these many toys.

225
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,980
They're certainly yours to take home.

226
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,490
I...

227
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,040
Just leave one for me.

228
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,600
Actually, this is a good chance

229
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,840
for you to get a few days' rest.

230
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,700
It's a delight.

231
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,390
Of course you'd find it a delight,
without my "exploitation" at work.

232
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,650
That's not what I mean.

233
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,630
I know.

234
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,430
Let me walk you home.

235
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,450
Would you like to...
go to a place with me?

236
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,660
It's neat here.

237
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,690
My dad has this place cleaned every month.

238
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,550
But hasn't your family
settled in Nanyang?

239
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,930
After all,
this is where my family used to live.

240
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,230
There are memories to cherish, I guess.

241
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,840
Besides, during the previous few visits,

242
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,910
they stayed here.

243
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,960
Why did you suddenly
want to come back here?

244
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,240
It was not that sudden.

245
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,630
Two years ago,
after I learned about that old incident,

246
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,430
my dad gave me a key to this house.

247
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,200
But I never came back here.

248
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,320
I didn't have a reason

249
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,130
or the courage to come here.

250
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,960
As it happened, a while ago,

251
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,020
my dad told me he had left a watch here.

252
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,790
He asked me to come get it.

253
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,600
That is why I'm back here.

254
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,050
I feel like I'm intruding into
someone else's world.

255
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,000
You're a whole new Lu Yizhen now.

256
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,720
Of course
you'd find your old self unfamiliar.

257
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,980
But it doesn't matter,

258
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,000
as long as

259
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,270
you don't let the past hold you back.

260
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,470
I'm actually curious about this place.

261
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,030
Come on.

262
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,880
Let's look for the watch.

263
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,750
Yizhen!

264
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,800
Isn't "Her Ladyship" not home?

265
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,910
Du Linfeng!

266
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,520
Where are you going?

267
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,120
I have an emergency to deal with.

268
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,110
I need to leave now.

269
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,570
Take care on your way home.

270
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,120
Du Linfeng.

271
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,900
You lovesick traitor of friendship!

272
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,080
I told you not to come, but you insisted.

273
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,360
Now, the girl you're into is away,

274
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,960
so you're ditching your dear friend?

275
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,820
No, there is indeed an emergency.

276
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,850
How about...

277
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,870
you invite Yizhen for dinner?

278
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,910
It'll be my treat.

279
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,510
Du Linfeng!

280
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,600
I'm telling you,

281
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,790
if you leave now,

282
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,470
I'll quit helping you pursue Yizhen.

283
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,310
I mean it!

284
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,550
Si Min.

285
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,790
Si Min!

286
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,320
In that case, I'll deal with

287
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,820
that emergency tomorrow.

288
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,490
Get your stuff. Let's go.

289
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,560
That's more like it.

290
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,120
What is this?

291
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,910
It seems she has never given up

292
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,390
investigating this case.

293
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,550
Oh, Lu Yizhen...

[A famous detective novelist and Gu Shuhe,
the inspector role she created]

295
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,430
God knows
what she's busy with all day long.

296
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,960
To your knowledge,
has she got any findings?

297
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,840
No.

298
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,230
There's nothing you haven't been told.

299
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,480
All is about...

300
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,440
a fire and a suspect.

301
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,630
A fire?

302
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
The one that accidentally happened

303
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,750
when Lu Yizhen was lured
to an abandoned factory

304
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,270
by someone ill-intentioned,

305
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,440
as you told me?

306
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,320
Yes.

307
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,750
I did some research on it.

308
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,000
That fire

309
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,290
was indeed determined to be an accident.

310
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,160
But if it was really accidental,

311
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,790
why would Lu Yizhen put it

312
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,130
on this board of clues?

313
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,050
Is there something more to it?

314
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,320
How would I know?

315
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,920
She didn't tell me anything.

316
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,120
Besides,

317
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,480
I didn't even know she was investigating

318
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,280
this old case.

319
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,800
If she is to talk to someone,

320
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,510
her first choice

321
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,840
won't be you or me.

322
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,080
Who else can it be? Guan Cen?

323
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,720
I can find whatever Guan Cen can.

324
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,900
I'll do everything within my capacity

325
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,030
to find out whatever she wants to know.

326
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,270
But why can't I be her first choice?

327
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,150
You're getting serious?

328
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,660
I thought you decided to court her
on the spur of the moment.

329
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,950
I wish that were true.

330
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,110
This is the watch.

331
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,050
Will you mail it to your dad?

332
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:45,310
No need. He can have it back
when he comes to Shanghai again.

333
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,930
What is this?

334
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,480
Let me help you.

335
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,020
It's far inside.

336
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,770
These are the clothes you wore
during that incident.

337
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,480
Why have they been preserved till now?

338
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,790
I don't recall these.

339
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,790
Nor do I know why my mom

340
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,960
and dad would keep them till now.

341
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,840
Perhaps they've forgotten
these are still under the bed.

342
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,880
Shall we send the clothes to Dr. Ding
for an examination?

343
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,040
But it's been a long time.

344
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,240
I'm afraid there's a small chance

345
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,640
of finding useful leads.

346
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,770
That said, we both want to give it a try,

347
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:24,660
don't we?

348
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,310
[Forensic Room]

349
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,060
Looks like I came at the perfect time.

350
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,240
Showing up at the right time
with a suitcase—

351
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,310
are you planning to elope with me?

352
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,570
How would I dare to do that?

353
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,160
Your admirers even

354
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,760
outnumber the officers
in our police station.

355
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,640
But what you're holding

356
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,560
doesn't look like a gift for me.

357
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,330
I promise I'll bring you a gift next time.

358
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,880
Today, I'm here
to ask for a personal favor.

359
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,970
These old items were found

360
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,930
at Lu Yizhen's former home.

361
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,560
I'd like you to examine them

362
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,120
for any possible clues.

363
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,720
After all, back then, Jingning...

364
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,350
I get it.

365
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,010
You've never stopped pursuing this case
over these years.

366
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,720
But now, this effort

367
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,310
of your is more for Lu

368
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,570
than Jingning, right?

369
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,310
Rest assured.

I'll do as much as I can to help.

371
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,240
Thank you.

372
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,070
The boss has scheduled for the big action

373
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,130
to happen in 3 days.

374
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,790
Really?

375
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,250
Can I really get out of here?

376
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,320
Don't worry.

377
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,240
They won't kill you right away.

378
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,600
As long as you have that thing on you,

379
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,960
you'll live.

380
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,160
Dr. Huang.

381
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,080
Dr. Huang,

382
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,150
has the medicine for the prisoners
been prepared?

383
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,470
Here's the medicine.

384
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,240
Names are noted on the packets.

385
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,680
Please don't mix them up.

386
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,590
If there are no other issues,

387
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,550
I'll come back to check on them in 3 days.

388
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,150
Off you go.

389
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,790
Let's go!

390
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,400
Ouch!

391
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,800
Are you okay, little boy?

392
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,790
Are you alright?

393
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,350
Are you okay?

394
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,880
Miss,

395
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,610
how did you bump into

396
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,920
my brother on such a broad road?

397
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,680
I didn't mean to...

398
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,680
Right! You just wanted to bully a beggar,
didn't you?

399
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,070
I didn't. It was he who ran into me.

400
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:55,720
Are you okay?

401
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,880
I'll take you to the hospital, okay?

402
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,270
You're planning to dump us
at the hospital, right?

403
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,270
It's not going to happen!

404
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,720
We demand money as compensation.

405
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,200
I-I can pay you,

406
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,200
but what if this causes him further harm?

407
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,720
Let me take you to the hospital. Come on.

408
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,050
Don't worry about that.

409
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,110
All we need is money as compensation.

410
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,170
A couple of silver dollars, at least.

411
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,590
That's mine. Give it back to me.

412
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,270
No way!

413
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,240
How could you take
someone else's belongings?

414
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,160
Help! We need help! Help!

415
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,790
Pay up! Pay up! Pay up!

416
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,440
Pay up!

417
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,390
What's all this noise about?

418
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,510
-Mr. Du.
-Mr. Du.

419
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,750
-Mr. Du.
-Mr. Du.

420
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:34,920
Mr. Du.

421
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,940
Help us!

422
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,790
This woman wasn't watching
where she was going.

423
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,240
She bumped into my brother.

424
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,790
And now she's being unreasonable.

425
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,320
She's being unreasonable!

426
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,590
What are you doing?

427
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,200
-Mr. Du.
-Mr. Du.

428
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
Mr. Du, I'm sorry.

429
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,840
Your legs are perfectly fine, aren't they?

430
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,350
Apologize to this lady!

431
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,270
Sorry, miss.

432
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,070
Sorry, miss.

433
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:57,880
Sorry, miss.

434
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,510
My apologies, miss.

435
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,770
You broke that, didn't you?

436
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,210
Let it slide.

437
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:07,680
Fine.

438
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,590
Now that this lady has said so,
I won't pursue further.

439
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,350
However...

440
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,890
if you ever dare to do this again...

441
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,350
We won't, Mr. Du.

442
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,270
We won't, Mr. Du.

443
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:16,960
We won't.

444
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:17,900
Now go away.

445
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,160
Run, guys!

446
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:19,910
Hold on.

447
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,800
Buy yourselves some food.

448
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,370
Thank you, Mr. Du.

449
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:28,980
Thank you, Mr. Du!

450
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,720
Thank you, Mr. Du!

451
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
Thank you, Mr. Du.

452
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,880
We wish you two a lifetime of happiness!

453
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,250
Dismissed!

454
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,160
Let's go!

455
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:36,830
Run!

456
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,390
Lu Yizhen.

457
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,680
Lu Yizhen, Lu Yizhen!

458
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,660
What kind of people are you friends with?

459
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,720
They're like younger brothers to me!

460
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,010
Those kids are still young.

461
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,640
Many of them are orphans.

462
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,450
They're wandering in the streets

463
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,940
at such young ages
for nothing but survival.

464
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,650
The problem is,

465
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,330
they have a poor sense of judgment,

466
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,060
given which,

467
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,930
they could easily go astray.

468
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,640
So, I've sent some of them

469
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,920
to orphanages.

470
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,200
As for those

471
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,350
who can't be admitted to orphanages,

472
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,280
I've found places for them to stay.

473
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,240
Although

474
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,960
the conditions aren't great,

475
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,690
at least they have shelter now.

476
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,840
Who would've thought?

477
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,800
Mr. Du the dandy
is actually a philanthropist.

478
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,680
How is that unexpected?

479
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,320
In your heart,

480
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,750
what exactly am I like?

481
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,560
A playboy?

482
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,330
A spoiled rich kid exuding arrogance?

483
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,480
Lu Yizhen, you don't really think of me

484
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,140
as that kind of person, do you?

485
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,830
No, I don't.

486
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,120
Why motivates you to help these children?

487
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,910
The story of them and me

488
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,070
is a long one to tell.

489
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,010
I provide for you!

490
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,950
Can't you steal money for me?

491
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,880
It's like I'm raising a piece of trash!

492
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,160
I-I'm sorry.

493
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,440
I promise I'll bring money back next time.

494
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,400
Next time?

495
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:00,960
Hey!

496
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,690
Isn't it time to pay
this month's protection money?

497
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,800
You've fared well lately, huh?

498
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,160
No, not at all.

499
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,550
Du,

500
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,310
is it your wallet?

501
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:11,760
Yes.

502
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,000
So you're that informant.

503
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,640
Kiddo.

504
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,070
Here.

505
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,630
Take it.

506
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,930
Be a good person from now on.

507
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,200
Do not steal again.

508
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,640
Thank you, sir.

509
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,640
Thank you.

510
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,500
Thank you, sir.

511
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,110
Since then,

512
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,510
I began to realize

513
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,110
many children are homeless, reduced to

514
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,030
being beggars,

515
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,160
and used by bad people

516
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,040
for evil purposes.

517
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,400
Maybe for us, the night is a time

518
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,400
to chill while eating a bowl of wontons
in the streets.

519
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,050
But for those children,

520
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,440
the night is a time

521
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,290
to sleep out in the open,

522
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,280
to bear the cold,

523
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,510
to starve,

524
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,680
and to face the constant threat

525
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,720
of violence.

526
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,080
I couldn't bring myself

527
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,960
to sit back and do nothing
upon knowing their situation.

528
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,210
I never realized this side of you.

529
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,380
There are many other sides of me.

530
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,730
Care to explore deeper?

531
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,940
Are you done eating? I should go home now.

532
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,170
It's late. Let me walk you home.

533
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,870
I'll have this fixed for you.

534
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,350
No need to treat me this way.

535
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,020
It's my responsibility
to protect those around me.

536
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,750
You know that's not what I mean.

537
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,110
Director Du,
I think you've probably misinterpreted...

538
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,170
We need to talk about a serious issue.

539
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,270
Are you investigating that old case?

540
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,550
How did you know that?

541
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,130
It must be Si Min...

542
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:11,930
Let's go.

543
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,200
We'll talk as we walk.

544
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,210
Morning.

545
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:40,920
Morning.

546
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:04,830
Do you like it?

547
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,550
It's a new makeup product,

548
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,900
supposedly resistant to sunlight and wind.

549
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,880
It's perfect for you, as you're out
for investigations every day.

550
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,510
Thank you.

551
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,860
I appreciate the thought.
But I don't need it, so take it back.

552
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,790
Keep it.

553
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,530
It'll come in handy one day.

554
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,760
Director Du!

555
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,210
Director Du.

556
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:22,770
Come on.

557
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,590
Here are the files you asked for.

558
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,180
They contain the information

559
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,350
about the cases proceeded
by the Police Station over these years,

560
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,310
plus the informants' profiles.

561
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,440
Everything's here.

562
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,050
Thanks.

563
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,080
Why do you need this information?

564
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,920
For smooth transition.

565
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,680
Transition?

566
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,920
He is an inspector.

567
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,000
Don't you have cases to work on

568
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,160
in the Intelligence Department?

569
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,510
Why are you sticking around here?

570
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,520
I do have other work.

571
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,720
But most tasks are minor errands

572
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,030
involving information sorting.

573
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,890
My subordinates can handle them.

574
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,510
I'm needed here in the Police Station,
aren't I?
