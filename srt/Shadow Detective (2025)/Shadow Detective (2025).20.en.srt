do you want to keep up this act?

00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,190
My patience is very limited.

In our line of work,
we don't always have a choice.

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,390
Mr. Qiang was impressive enough,

To ship this kind of cargo
through my dock,

49
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,480
you need to tell me who sent you.

I understand your caution.

51
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,270
However,

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,040

We really can't reveal their identity.

54
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,120
But I can tell you two things.

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,310
First,

with Mr. Qiang.

there's a heavy crackdown
on human trafficking now.

Several police stations have increased
their surveillance of this.

At such a sensitive time,

we should remain cautious.

as if he's shrouded in mystery.

107
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,040
So how could he make
such a public appearance at Shihua Hotel,

108
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,700
allowing everyone to see him?

109

It's all thanks to the dog he kept.

why would a butler

I really mean it!

131
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,990
I figured out that Sasaki was an impostor
because of the dog.

132
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,120
But she noticed it from other details.

133
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,680
In our drinking culture,

134
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,600
there's a hierarchy of respect.

135
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,330
It's the same for the Japanese.

When toasting,

137
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,080
I noticed the fake Sasaki's cup rim

138
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,960
was slightly lower than the butler's.

139
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,360
This is a crucial detail.

140
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,390
So that's why you took the initiative
to toast.

141
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,570
Once might be a coincidence,

142
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,940
but three times can't possibly be
mere chance.

143
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,100
I didn't expose him right away

144
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,030
to set things up for what came next.

145
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,810
Set things up for what?

146
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,020
For shooting at me.

147
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,310
Shooting at you?

148
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,810
Sasaki asked her to shoot me.

149
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,000
First of all, there were no bullets
in that gun.

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,200
Secondly, I didn't shoot at you anyway.

151
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,120
When you picked up that gun,

152
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,850
do you know how terrified I was?

153
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,020
What were you afraid of?

154
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,120
Were you afraid
I'd sacrifice you or myself?

155
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,630
Seeing your attitude

156
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,960
when you were about to
investigate Shop No. 7,

157
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,120
I really couldn't tell what you might do.

158
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,790
I'd actually hoped you'd listen to Sasaki

159
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,870
and point the gun at me.

160
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,470
How could I possibly hurt you?

161
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,050
But you shouldn't choose to
hurt yourself either.

162
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,180
Anyway, you both came back unscathed.

163
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,580
What about Sasaki now?

164
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,160
I think he's taken the bait.

165
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,400
We can just wait here patiently.

166
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,680
He'll come to us.

this is my friend, Mr. Sasaki.

It's an honor to meet you.

172
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,870
Mr. Hong,

173
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,150
although this is our first meeting,

174
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,910
our connections run deep.

175
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,890
Yes, indeed.

176
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,060
I'll leave you to chat.

177
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,970
Please, have a seat.

178
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,840
Miss Lu, you're quite the chameleon.

179
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,710
I almost didn't recognize you
when I came in.

180
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,450
Different occasions call for
different attire.

181
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,910
Miss Lu, thank you for your favor.

182
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,510

Miss Lu, you're straightforward.

184
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,200
So

185
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,620
I agree to cooperate with you.

186
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,470
I'll need to think this over carefully.

187
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,580
Miss Lu,

188
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,450
have you found another collaborator?

189
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,720
My client has heard

190
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,320
there were issues
with your antique shipment.

191
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,240
The matter with the antiques
has been resolved.

192
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,720
Please assure him of that.

193
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,080
But that matter

194
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,680
has already drawn the attention
of the police.

195
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,510
My client had this experience before,

196
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,770
so he doesn't want to go through it again.

197
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,250
How about this?

198
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,170
Invite him to Shop No. 7,

199
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,030
and I'll explain it to him in person.

200
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,960
Will that work?

201
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,570
That's a bit difficult.

202
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,810
But since you're sincere,

203
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,340
I'm willing to give it a try.

204
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,530
Thank you, Miss Lu.

205
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,370
Stop this nonsense!

206
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,530
Do you call this

207
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,050
discussing it with me?

208
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,910
You're just informing me!

209
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,710
Director Huo.

210
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,790
This is a critical moment.

211
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,270
Your participation

212
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,040
is the key to our operation's success.

213
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,440
Right.

214
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,640
Since when did you learn to be
so smooth-tongued?

215
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,790
No, Mr. Huo,

216
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,580
my father told me

217
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,540
you used to be excellent at
performing modern plays.

218
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,840
Why does your father tell you everything?

219
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,000
That was many years ago.

220
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,560
Those best actor awards I won back then—

221
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,330
better not mention them.

222
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,910
But you went undercover
in the Qinglong Gang

223
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,310
and solved Shanghai's biggest theft case.

224
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,270
You surely know everything.

225
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,150
I haven't been in the field for years.

226
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,790
I'm rusty!

227
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,000
Director Huo,

228
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,390
Sasaki Jiro is now

229
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,320
eager to meet the upper echelon
of our organization.

230
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,000
We've looked for many people,

231
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,870
but none fit the role.

232
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,910
Only you,

233
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,430
Director Huo,

234
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,390
are fit to play this role.

235
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,710
We must seize this opportunity

236
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,960
and make him believe
you're a high-ranking member.

237
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,360
This way, we can not only obtain
the criminal evidence

238
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,870
but also catch "Butcher."

239
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,530
Mr. Huo,

240
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,730
please help us this time.

241
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,150
It's not that I don't want to help you.

242
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,700
Have you considered this—

243
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,100
what kind of man

244
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,180
is Sasaki Jiro?

245
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,670
Do you know whether he knows

246
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,600
I'm the police director?

247
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,960
What if my cover is blown?

248
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,150
Besides, I'm so fat.

249
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,670
What if I get hurt?

250
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,470
Director Huo.

251
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
You're not fat.

252
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,200
This is the generous build
of a successful man.

253
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,080
You're right about what you just said.

254
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,360
This operation is indeed risky,

255
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,200
but whether to take risks depends on
whether it's worth it.

256
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,440
If it weren't for the fact
that we recently discovered

257
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,940
such a mysterious organization around us—

258
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,910
one that may have already infiltrated
every corner,

259
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,910
affecting all of us

260
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,480
without us even noticing...

261
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,120
And you...

262
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,180
will lead us...

263
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,240
to uproot it completely.

264
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,090
You really need me?

265
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,920
Desperately.

266
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,510
Am I...

267
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,960
wise and mighty?

268
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,240
You certainly are.

269
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,000
Am I handsome?

270
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,650
I'll think about it.

271
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,780
I couldn't bring myself to answer that.

272
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,200
Mr. Sasaki,

273
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,630
this is Mr. Hu.

274
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,630
Mr. Hu,

275
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,960
this is Mr. Sasaki Jiro.

276
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Mr. Hu, I've heard so much about you.

277
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,910
Likewise.

278
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,430
Please.

279
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,870
Mr. Hu.

280
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,200
Miss Lu has mentioned your reputation.

281
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,440
Now that I've met you,

282
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
your reputation is well-deserved.

283
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:58,960
I'm old.

284
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,480
In the future,

285
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,500
you'll have to drink this too.

286
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,840
Is this the English style?

287
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,820
Goji berries! Our ancestors' style!

288
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,870
Mr. Hu,

289
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,560
do you always go out with this many men?

290
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,310
We learned that from you.

291
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,120
There's an old Chinese saying:

292
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,790
"Caution keeps you safe
on a long journey."

293
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,510
I

294
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,120
always keep that in mind.

295
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,030
Mr. Sasaki, it seems

296
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,390
you've studied
Chinese proverbs extensively.

297
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,200
But our ancestors' sayings

298
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,520
definitely contain wisdom!

299
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,530
Of course.

300
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,910
That's why I'm particularly fond of
Chinese culture.

301
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,790
I can tell.

302
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,550
Mr. Sasaki,

303
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,930
just like these walnuts in my hand,

304
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,120
you like to keep a tight grip

305
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,150
on everything.

306
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,920
You flatter me, Mr. Hu.

307
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,750
May I ask,

308
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,630
which turf

309
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,670
did you run before?

310
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,600
Mr. Hu has just returned to the country.

311
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,320
So...

312
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,750
I'm a wanderer.

313
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,400
I'm at home wherever I go!

314
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,200
Then the whole world

315
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,670
is your oyster.

316
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,480
I'm old now.

317
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,630
Mr. Hu,

318
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,320
I didn't agree immediately

319
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,150
to your previous request.

320
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,200
Please forgive me.

321
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,240
As you know,

322
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,390
things are very tense right now.

323
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,080
So we're very interested in knowing

324
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,760
why you failed, Mr. Sasaki.

325
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,970
You must mean the antiques.

326
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,580
That was indeed a mistake made by my men.

327
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,200
But rest assured,

328
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,920
the matter has been handled.

329
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,750
It absolutely won't happen again.

330
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,500
You don't have to
explain to me, Mr. Sasaki.

331
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,930
I'm just a businessman.

332
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,510
But whether I should

333
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,270
let you handle this deal...

334
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,810
I need to think about it.

335
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:25,760
Mr. Hu.

336
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,770
If you let me take this job,

337
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,670
I guarantee we

338
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,690
will make a fortune together.

339
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,010
Please.

340
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,110
Then please, Mr. Sasaki,

341
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,070
show us around your place

342
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,230
so we can get to know you better.

343
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:56,720
Sure.

344
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,960
Please.

345
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,000
Mr. Hu.

346
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,750
Miss Lu.

347
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,160
Usually, at our dock,

348
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,860
we ship only ordinary goods.

349
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,060
No one inspects them.

350
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,240
If a client

351
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,240
needs to transport certain goods,

352
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,900
we hide them in secret compartments
on the ship.

353
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,770
Only the captain knows about them,

354
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,970
and ordinary people can't detect them.

355
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,110
Much better than I imagined.

356
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,950
In all of Shanghai's smuggling business,

357
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,490
there's no one more skilled than me.

358
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,530
I'm not worried about
your professionalism,

359
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,140
but...

360
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,730
Mr. Hu,

361
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,860
if you have any concerns,

362
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,360
you can ask me directly.

363
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,110
Mr. Sasaki,

364
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,790
in business, honesty is key.

365
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,790
Mr. Hu doesn't like

366
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,270
working with people
who go back on their word.

367
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:54,960
Miss Lu,

368
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,960
I, Sasaki, do business honestly
with everyone,

369
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,270
young and old alike.

370
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,140
You even know Chinese idioms.

371
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,710
You're quite the China expert, Mr. Sasaki.

372
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,110
If you don't want to become Chinese,

373
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,590
then you must want to

374
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,480
devour all of China.

375
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,880
Mr. Hu,

376
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,590
I wouldn't dare.

377
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,830
If

378
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,400
you don't trust me,

379
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,790
I can show you all the ledgers

380
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,170
from our dock.

381
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
Would that work?

382
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,240
My business is extensive.

383
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,310
Contraband, human cargo—

384
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,110
I deal in all of it.

385
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,840
We only handle contraband.

386
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,550
As for human cargo...

387
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,070
If you don't know how,
find someone who does.

388
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,590
What?

389
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,850
You can't do it?

390
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,830
I can.

391
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,920
Good.

392
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,480
I like working with people
who have courage.

393
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,280
I always tell her

394
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,550
that we old folks

395
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,920
should step aside

396
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,720
and let the young ones
take over to gain experience.

397
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,450
Let's have a good partnership.

398
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,080
Let's go.

399
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,310
Sasaki, code-named Captain,

400
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,760
is in charge of contraband smuggling.

401
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,410
The Butcher

402
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,990
handles human cargo.

403
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,550
If we can confirm...

404
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,050
they've worked together,

405
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,550
then Sasaki must have

406
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,130
two sets of ledgers.

407
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,290
We've already set the transaction time.

408
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,280
Once the timing is right,
we'll make the arrest

409
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,520
at the dock.

410
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,750
We just don't know if this fish

411
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,810
will take the bait.

412
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,920
Catching just one would be good enough.

413
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,160
We can't be too greedy.

414
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,750
Although I have some confidence,

415
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,550
it doesn't mean there's no risk.

416
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,590
So

417
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,960
once we catch the Captain,

418
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,370
we'll definitely catch the Butcher.

419
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,470
Sasaki is a cautious man.

420
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,410
If we want to lower the risk,

421
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,540
we need to put pressure on him.

422
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,300
For dealing with this type of person,

423
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,120
I actually have an idea.

424
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:25,750
Boss!

425
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,240
Boss!

426
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,480
There's an article about Mr. Hu

427
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,940
in today's Shanghai News.

428
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,090
Mr. Hu is actually a British nobleman.

429
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,110
He's planning to move
all his overseas business

430
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,000
back to China.

431
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,790
Someone went to Shop No. 7, as expected.

432
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,770
Sasaki also sent me a secret message.

433
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,290
What do you need me to do?

434
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,480
Has your injury healed?

435
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,680
It won't be a problem.

436
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,930
He took the bait.

437
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,920
Tonight, we fish.

438
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,640
Are you all ready?

439
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,360
Finally, we can move.

440
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,880
The big fish has finally taken the bait.

441
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
With me on the job,

442
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,480
it's as good as done!

443
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,560
Stay hidden.

444
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,400
Don't let Sasaki escape from here.

445
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,060
Understood?

446
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,460
Yes.

447
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,800
Mr. Sasaki, what does this mean?

448
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:02,400
This is the painting
you gave me last time, Miss Lu.

449
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,240
Now

450
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,880
I'm returning it to its rightful owner.

451
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,070
It seems that before I came,

452
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,130
you two had already exchanged gifts.

453
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,830
But by returning the gift,

454
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,080
are you expressing displeasure with me

455
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,550
or with her?

456
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:19,960
Mr. Hu,

457
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,240
please don't misunderstand.

458
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,510
Last time, Miss Lu gifted me
this painting,

459
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,640
but now that we're working together,

460
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,850
I can't appear ungrateful.

461
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,170
So I'm returning it to you, Miss Lu.

462
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,880
Since we're cooperating,

463
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,830
there's no need to
return the gift, is there?

464
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,490
Mr. Sasaki, it seems
you have other intentions.

465
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,740
They weren't kidding about
how sharp you are.

466
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,440
Nothing

467
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,550
can escape your discerning eye.

468
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,070
Mr. Hu,

469
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,520
I'm always cautious in business.

470
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:57,760
I investigated the previous owner
of this painting.

471
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,470
Guess what I found?

472
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,870
It seems the situation has changed.

473
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,260
Mr. Sasaki, stop beating around the bush.

474
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:22,860
Returning the gift

475
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,510
is an insult in itself.

476
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,520
Since we're suspicious of each other,

477
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,180
let's not cooperate anymore.

478
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:33,110
I was hoping to try
the food at your Shop No. 7.

479
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,310
Let's go!

480
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,350
Hold on!

481
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,160
Since your first visit,

482
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,120
you've been peppering me with questions.

483
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,440
I really want to know:

484
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,400
if I answer everything correctly,

485
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,510
what will I get?

486
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,510
What more do you want?

487
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,960
Working with us

488
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,970
and handling our contraband business—

489
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,170
isn't that already the biggest benefit
you could ask for?

490
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,920
Mr. Sasaki.

491
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,240
It's okay for people

492
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,870
to be greedy.

493
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,270
You want to be the boss,

494
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,730
right?

495
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,150
I trust you.

496
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,790
But I don't trust others!

497
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,270
Mr. Sasaki, if you can pull this off,

498
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,920
Mr. Hu will naturally trust
your abilities.

499
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,030
Then what you want

500
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,030
will naturally be yours.

501
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,680
Any news from Dong?

502
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,480
No.

503
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,960
Take a few men and come with me.

504
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,070
Have the rest stay here.

505
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,590
Yes.

506
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:54,930
You guys,

507
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:55,820
come with me.

508
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,260
Third Brother,

509
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,840
how did you know
they would ambush us here?

510
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,310
Send a message to Mr. Sasaki—

511
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,230
we're under attack.

512
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:06,640
Yes.

513
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,790
I'm so sorry, you two.

514
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,800
I invited you as guests,

515
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,480
yet you ended up hearing gunfire here.

516
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,960
I'm really sorry.

517
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,580
I'll send someone

518
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,670
to check right now.

519
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,160
I'm leaving it to you.

520
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,960
-Stay still!
-Stay still!

521
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,830
There was gunfire outside just now.

522
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,090
Did something happen?

523
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,130
Are you okay?

524
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,280
Thank you, Director Du...

525
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,400
for saving us.

526
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,650
Don't thank me.

527
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,610
Thank your boss instead.

528
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,650
Inspector Guan?

529
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,660
Who else would it be?

530
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,550
I wonder if you

531
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,950
have taken
what Mr. Hu and I said seriously.

532
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I have.

533
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,400
I have.

534
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,120
Mr. Hu and Miss Lu,

535
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,080
look at

536
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,630
what I've prepared for you.

537
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,790
Mr. Hu,

538
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,570
this is the account book from our shop

539
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,310
I mentioned last time.

540
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,350
What about the other person?

541
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,410
Why didn't he come?

542
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,310
Butcher...

543
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,670
would never come to our Shop No. 7.

544
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,600
Mr. Hu,

545
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,330
if you want to meet him,

546
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,160
I...

547
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,280
will take you to him personally.

548
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,340
He sure acts like a big shot.

549
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,770
I've been fed up with his behavior
for a long time.

550
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,880
But our previous boss

551
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,720
couldn't do anything about him either.

552
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,400
So...

553
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,600
if you want to meet him...

554
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,930
it would be better for me
to take you to him myself.

555
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:49,950
Sure!

556
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,780
We'll go with you.

557
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:53,570
Please.

558
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,640
Mr. Hu.

559
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,240
I'm a man who follows the rules.

560
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,510
When I say it,

561
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,590
I follow through.

562
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,750
Mr. Sasaki,

563
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,310
why don't you just tell us

564
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,310
where we need to go

565
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,310
to meet him?

566
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,830
Wait.

567
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,490
These accounts don't add up.

568
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,350
You're right.

569
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,080
I never intended to give you the real one.

570
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,120
Are you sure?

571
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,650
Finish them!

572
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,200
Search more carefully!

573
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,400
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

574
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,310
Mr. Huo.

575
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,720
How is it?

576
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,310
How many of our men are injured?

577
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,270
Are they badly wounded?

578
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,160
It's fine. Just a few men
with minor injuries.

579
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,890
Don't worry.

580
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,640
Who the hell

581
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,480
is behind all of this?
